"Believing you will win when all around see a match that's slipping away. Coming back for more when all game you have been turned over and picked off. Finding precision in the critical moment, having been imprecise in so much of what has gone before. England, despite the late larceny in Cardiff that has extended theirvictory roll to 16 games and counting,are far from perfect. There are flaws and weaknesses there, but the abiding memory from this white-hot battle on a frozen winter's night will be of strength: of character, in depth, of conviction. Wales thought they had done enough. For 76 minutes they had, playing with a pace and ferocity that stirred memories of the massacre of Stuart Lancaster's innocentshere four years ago.The massed ranks of their support were singing them home. And then it turned, ostensibly on one tired clearing kick from Jonathan Davies, but really on so much more. Good teams go close and see the logic in their defeat. They vow to go away and learn the lessons. They accept that sometimes it is just not their day. This England team don't appear to countenance defeat at all. They refuse to let the pressure of being close cloud their thinking. They keep winning that ugly way. Report: Wales 16-21 England Relive Saturday's Six Nations action Howley delighted until last five minutes 5 live In Short: England's backs 'more talented than Wilkinson era' George Ford, fielding Davies' kick 40 metres out with England 16-14 down, might have gambled on a speculative drop-goal. Owen Farrell, taking his pass at pace and with only one man outside him, might have twitched at the memory of the interception a few minutes earlier, or gone safely into contact to set up field position. Elliot Daly, running on instead to another fast, sweetly timed pass, might have cut inside or allowed himself to be swallowed up by the onrushing arms of Alex Cuthbert. Four minutes to go, everything hanging on that one moment, and they made it happen. If it was cruel on Wales, better than they have been in many a marooned year, it characterised the essence of what this England team has become. This video can not be played English grit won us the game - Jones Eddie Jones always thinks his side will win, no matter what mess they find themselves in. Rob Howley always looks worried that his Wales team will lose. That belief has permeated through the ranks. Maro Itoje doesn't dwell on the possibility of defeat, not least because in his brief career it has been such an unfamiliar experience to him. James Haskell's ego makes him relish coming off the bench to help turn games around. Farrell, hit so late and hard by Ross Moriarty early in the second half that he was left dry-retching, sucked it in, grinned and came back to produce the contest's pivotal pass and kick. Howley is a nice man and a dedicated coach who, as a player, could do things few other scrum-halves could. His record as Wales' caretaker boss while Warren Gatland is away is statistically solid - seven wins in his past 10 matches - and has touched occasional heights: a record-breaking win over South Africa last autumn, that unprecedented 30-3 hammering of England in 2013. But whereas Jones comes across as a general with both tactical mastery and troops who are genuinely frightened of him, Howley is more the well-meaning supply teacher whose optimistic lesson plans fail to survive the streetwise and disruptive elements inherent in every classroom. It is the difference too between the England of Jones and that of his predecessor Lancaster, another honourable, hard-working man who saw crunch matches slip from his grasp in each of his four Six Nations campaigns. This video can not be played Six Nations 2017: 'Composure let Wales down' - Howley It happened at Twickenham in 2012, whenScott Williams' brilliant solo burglaryand escape sent Wales away towards a third Grand Slam in eight years and left England stalled in second. It happened in Paris in 2014, whenGael Fickou's late accelerationinside Alex Goode snatched a victory at the death to spell another second place. And it happened, most famously of all, at Twickenham in that tumultuous World Cup group showdown 18 months ago, when an England team 10 points ahead, with half an hour to go, let a Welsh side with a scrum-half on the wing, a wing at centre and a patched-up fly-half at full-back fight back to steal away a three-point win that will be sung about until the Severn runs dry. Jones, reptilian grin and all, does not care who likes him or what others think of his team, as Howley often appears to do and Lancaster once did. And he is becoming defined by these wins when all is nip and tuck and maybe not: here in Cardiff, when his inexperienced back row shipped eight turnovers to their opponents, when the usually unflustered Jonathan Joseph was throwing passes into touch, when only Daly's muscular speed had denied the excellent Dan Biggar a breakaway try; against France a week ago, when three opposition players all made more than 125m with ball in hand; when a red card for Daly meant 75 minutes against Argentina last autumn with 14 men. Captain Dylan Hartley was replaced after only 46 minutes as England turned to their bench to see them to victory Jones spoke afterwards of his team having used up all their get-out-of-jail cards. It was an admission that he expects better and will drill his charges until it comes. It was also a reflection of a bench that he calls his finishers but may be better described as his emergency services. Normally the sight of a skipper being hauled off uninjured after 46 minutes would be a cause for crisis. Not when Jones can send on Jamie George for Dylan Hartley. Haskell, bullish in mind and body, deserves better than the bench but repeatedly makes such an impact from it that he may suffer the unusual misfortune of playing himself out of the starting XV. Ben Te'o, Danny Care, Kyle Sinckler; the names and minutes played may change from game to game, but the influence seldom does. In the second row, Joe Launchbury: not a first choice, not with Itoje and George Kruis in town, but 20 tackles on Saturday night in a defence that kept Wales within range. And so England rumble on, to play an Italian team who have never beaten them, to another home fixture after that against a Scotland side who are winless at Twickenham in 34 years. No-one in the camp is talking yet about Grand Slams, but precedent suggests the trip to Ireland in five weeks time might be precisely for that. Wales will take heart from their performance, if little comfort from helping produce a match that gripped from the start and carried all watching along to the end. They might wonder how this one got away, look back with regret at those first-half penalties not aimed at the posts or the period of second-half dominance that featured wonderful possession and territory but nothing on the board to show for it. England? There will be no regrets, not when they keep marching forward, not when they keep finding a way. There will be plenty of regrets for Wales having come so close to downing the reigning Six Nations champions Wales 16-21 England Late Daly try seals narrow England win.

"Thibaut Courtois conceded a direct free-kick for the first time in his Premier League career Chelsea missed the chance to move 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League as they were held to a draw by a resilient Burnley at Turf Moor. The hosts had won all four of their previous homes games without conceding but fell behind early on when Pedro finished off a sweeping attack. The visitors dominated possession and it seemed only a matter of time before they added to their advantage. However, Burnley's record signing Robbie Brady - making his full debut following a January move from Norwich - equalised with a stunning free-kick. The Clarets almost went ahead before the break but Thibaut Courtois superbly denied Matt Lowton from close range. Chelsea did not have a single shot on target in the second half as Burnley took the game to the Premier League leaders, Andre Gray testing Courtois with a low drive when he was through one-on-one. In the end, manager Antonio Conte will perhaps consider this a point gained as the Blues moved 10 points ahead of Tottenham. Manchester City can close the gap to eight points if they beat Bournemouth on Monday. Burnley, meanwhile, are 12th. Analysis: How Burnley exposed Chelsea's weak spot - Gullit Conte doesn't like Mourinho's 'joking' Relive Burnley's draw with Chelsea Diego Costa did not manage a single shot on target, with both his efforts blocked by a brilliant Burnley defence Chelsea's away form in the Premier League is unrivalled but this was always going to be a difficult test for the Blues. Just two sides have a better home record than Burnley - Chelsea and Tottenham - with 28 of the Clarets' 29 points collected prior to the visit of Conte's men coming at Turf Moor. Initially, it looked like the visitors had the measure of their opponents, swiftly turning defence into attack to catch the Clarets out of position and open the scoring. To Burnley's credit, they did not abandon a system that had brought them so much success on home soil. They allowed Chelsea to dominate possession but closed them down quickly as soon as they approached the box. A disciplined four-man defence had the bustling Diego Costa and the mercurial Eden Hazard under control, limiting the Blues to just two shots on target in the whole game, both of which came in the first half. It was only the second time all season they have dropped points against a side outside the top six. With just Manchester City and Manchester United left to face out of the leading group, it will take an almighty collapse to deny the Blues a fifth Premier League title. Chelsea only managed two shots on target, both of which were from inside the box. As they struggled to break through the Burnley defence they resorted to efforts from distance. Every one of their long-range strikes went wide Cesc Fabregas had one shot and played one key pass after coming on in the 67th minute A key factor in Chelsea's impressive season has been consistency, with Conte rarely making changes to his side unless forced to. Against Burnley, he chose the same XI that started in the 3-1 home win against Arsenal last time out. That meant Cesc Fabregas - who scored against the Gunners - had to make do with a place on the bench. Despite Conte recently calling Fabregas ""a genius"" and likening him to Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo, the Spanish midfielder has started just five games this season. N'Golo Kante and Nemanja Matic were preferred in midfield against Burnley but both are defensive-minded and it quickly became evident that Chelsea were lacking the creativity of someone like Fabregas. Once again Fabregas climbed off the bench but with 20 minutes remaining against a determined Burnley side, it left him little time to make an impression. It could be time for Conte to give Chelsea's 'Pirlo' his chance to shine for the run-in. This video can not be played Conte congratulates 'very tough' Burnley Burnley's home form has all but guaranteed their Premier League status for next season, with Sean Dyche's side comfortably in mid-table and 10 points clear of the relegation zone. But while their home form is as good as anyone's in the top flight, their away form has been on par with a side battling to stay up. They've collected just one point on their travels, a daunting record going into four consecutive away games. The addition of Brady appears an astute signing and, along with Joey Barton, means they possess two players who are deadly from set-pieces. No side have scored more goals from direct free-kicks than Burnley this season and that could represent their best chance of picking up some much-needed points on the road. This video can not be played Burnley making definite progress - Dyche Michael Keane (left) was instrumental in preventing Chelsea from managing a shot on target in the second half Burnley boss Sean Dyche:""Chelsea are a fine side. They are the market leaders for a reason and we limited them to two shots on target and that is tough enough. ""We made four or five really good chances. I am very pleased overall. The mentality here, I am pleased about the growth in the side. ""We are maturing as a side as individuals and as a team. You need assuredness in the Premier League. I was super impressed with our reaction to their goal. We were not disappointed or stepping on the back foot."" Chelsea manager Antonio Conte:""It is one point and for sure we must be disappointed. We tried to win. We started very well and scored a goal and created chances to score the second goal. ""We tried to win but we know Burnley at home are not easy. They have taken 29 points at home. Now it is important to continue to work. ""I think we tried to build and do our football for sure. Burnley tried to disrupt our play. They played long balls and the second ball is not easy. It is not easy to play against this team. It is very particular. At home they are very tough."" Burnley have gone six top-flight games unbeaten at home for the first time since September 1975. Chelsea (19) have scored the first goal of the game more times than any other Premier League team this season and have yet to lose (W16 D3). Burnley have never won a Premier League encounter against Chelsea (D2 L4). Pedro has now scored nine times in all competitions for Chelsea this season, surpassing his total of eight in 2015-16. Robbie Brady is the first Premier League player to score a direct free-kick v Chelsea (in the PL) since Rickie Lambert in March 2013. Brady is the third Burnley player to score on his first Premier League start for the club alongside Scott Arfield v Chelsea in August 2014 and Daniel Fox v West Ham in February 2010. Diego Costa has failed to score in three consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since April-May 2016. After hosting non-league Lincoln City in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday [12:30 GMT], Burnley begin a run of four away games in a row when they travel to Hull City on 25 February. Chelsea are also in FA Cup action at the weekend. They travel to Championship side Wolves [17:30] on Saturday before hosting Swansea in the Premier League the following weekend.

"Petkovic was among the German team members outraged by the mistake The United States Tennis Association has apologised after a version of the German national anthem associated with the Nazi era was accidentally sung at a tournament in Hawaii. The obsolete first verse, including the words ""Germany, Germany above all else"" was sung by a soloist at the Fed Cup. The error left members of the German team and fans upset and angry. The USTA extended ""a sincere apology to the German Fed Cup team and fans for the outdated National Anthem"". ""This mistake will not occur again,"" it said. Germany's Andrea Petkovic and Alison Riske of the US were about to play their first-round tie when the anthem was heard. ""It was an absolute outrage and affront, the lowest,"" Petkovic said. ""It was by some way the worst thing that's happened to me, especially in the Fed Cup."" The song, the Deutschlandlied, became the official German anthem under the democratic Weimar Republic in the 1920s. But after World War Two, the first, contentious verse was dropped and the Federal Republic adopted only the third verse beginning ""Unity and justice and freedom"". The Fed Cup is the largest international team competition in women's tennis, and included 99 teams in 2015. Petkovic lost to Riske, 7-6, 6-2.

"The town of Loveland, Colorado, in the lap of the white-tipped Rocky Mountains, is smitten with Valentine's Day, writes Andy Jones. Ask nicely and they'll even send you a card. In the Loveland postal room, the thump-thump sound of ink stamp on pad serves as a drum beat to the crooning swoon of a barbershop quartet. The singing foursome, suited in crisp pink and white, are cooing the melody of Let Me Be Your Sweetheart as a chorus of pensioners sift through piles of pink mail. For two weeks every year, Loveland volunteers stamp and redecorate hundreds of thousands of letters from all corners of the globe, so that lovers can present the objects of their desires with letters postmarked in the land of love. The missives come from as far away as China and the UK, and are forwarded to all kinds of famous addresses. President Obama received one at the White House, Hugh Hefner has them posted to his girls at the Playboy Mansion. Even TV star Oprah Winfrey is a fan. Local businesses feed breakfast to the volunteers. An Elvis lookalike comes in to sing to them, and the stampers - like silver-haired Valentine's elves - busy away in the workshop, karaoke-ing along to toe-tapping bluegrass classics. Among all the free pie and coffee, the head of the re-mailing programme, Mindy McCloughan, gushes: ""It's just like being at your grandma's house."" The Loveland re-mailing programme was born some 70 years ago, when a postmaster called Mr Ivers, a devoted philatelist, began re-addressing all mail ""From The Sweetheart City."" Cupid's bow now sends some 300,000 pieces of mail in Loveland's direction, each one them to be stamped with a unique poem, always a step up from the tired old ""Roses are Red, violets are blue."" This year's verse says: From the Sweetheart City in a land of love, Warm Thoughts of you are sent above. On Wings they fly from land to sea, Searching and finding the one to be. Any broken hearts had better leave town for the week - Loveland's Valentines motto is: ""Go heart or go home."" On its neat, square boulevards, corner stores play slushy music, cake shops bake everything pink and even hardware stores try to add a little romance to the drills and saws. On Fourth Street, every lamp-post displays a heart-shaped sign bearing a lover's message. There's a race to buy the best spot - some are sold off three months in advance - with the best pitches being those visible to all locals and drivers along the expressway to Estes Park. You can almost picture a bitter sweetheart furious that her sign is three streets too far to the left. Locals Nicole and Dominic Yost, who have been together for 13 years, always buy each other a heart. It's a treasure hunt finding them. Nicole's says: ""Dominic, you will always have my heart."" In return, her husband's manfully boasts: ""Nicole, I love you more than bacon."" It's OK, she says - just like everyone in this part of America, where ranchers still herd cattle, meat is a big deal for Dominic.

"About 20 miles west of Glasgow lies a modern ruin. St Peter's Seminary was built only 50 years ago, yet by the 1990s it was derelict. However, plans to breathe new life into the building are now close to being realised. The concrete ghost is hidden in woods on the north side of the River Clyde - the shell of an ambitious 1960s modernist building which the Catholic Church had planned to use to train 100 novice priests. But the seminary - at the back of a golf course on the edge of the village of Cardross - was built in changing times. The Church would soon shift away from training priests in seclusion, instead placing them in the community. The inauguration ceremony was held on St Andrew's Day 1966. At the ceremony, the Archbishop of Glasgow James Scanlan commented on the ""unique edificeâ¦ of such architectural distinction as to merit the highest praise from the most qualified judges"". But by the 2000s, the same space would be in ruins. The post-war years saw the break-up of many of the traditionally Catholic areas in Glasgow - as sections of the old inner city were demolished and people moved into new high-rise homes or out to new towns like East Kilbride or Cumbernauld. In this photo taken in the mid-60s, newly-built 20-storey flats in the Gorbals area of Glasgow overlook St Francis Church and Friary. The Catholic Church embarked on an ambitious building project to serve these new communities - using architects  Gillespie, Kidd and Coia (GKC). GKC was also asked to build a new St Peter's Seminary near Cardross - to replace the old St Peter's College in Bearsden, which was destroyed by fire in the 1940s. The architectural drawing above, of the new St Peter's south elevation, includes Kilmahew House - the 19th Century mansion which had been used as a temporary seminary since the late 1940s. The trainee priests were to have ""cells"" in the main block - directly above the chapel - as shown in this section drawing from 1961. The first sod on the site was cut in 1960. Architects John Cowell (left) and Isi Metzstein (right) - with project manager Stan Blair in the centre - celebrate here with pints of Guinness at the ""topping out"" ceremony in 1965. Tucked away on a wooded hilltop, St Peter's was removed from the outside world. The entrance to the main block was across a bridge spanning a shallow pool. The architecture was celebrated at this early stage, and the project won a Royal Institute of British Architects Bronze Regional Award in 1967. The granite altar in the sanctuary was the heart of the seminary complex. Despite the sharp contrast between Kilmahew House and the St Peter's extension, the old mansion was an integral part of the college. With the break up of traditional Catholic communities in the West of Scotland, and the increasing secularisation of society, St Peter's was never used to full capacity. It was designed to hold 100 residents, but the highest number of students living there at any one time was 56. This under population only exacerbated a series of maintenance problems on the site. Inefficient heating, poor sound insulation and water leaks made life difficult for the trainee priests - but it did not stop them from enjoying a game of football. In November 1979, only 13 years after it opened, the Archdiocese of Glasgow decided to close St Peter's because of the dwindling number of trainee priests, the maintenance issues and financial constraints. The building was used as a drug rehabilitation centre for four years in the 1980s, but then fell into a state of disrepair. Architectural interest remained though, and in 1992 Historic Scotland granted St Peter's Category A listed status. Two years later, the adjoining Kilmahew House was gutted by fire and had to be demolished. Only the footprint of the mansion was left behind. With no secure plans for the future, the site continued to deteriorate. Protected by a high steel fence, nature started to reclaim St Peter's. What the priests left behind, the graffiti artists claimed as their own. Since the seminary's closure, numerous ideas have been submitted for repurposing St Peter's. One ambitious plan - scuppered by the recession which followed the financial crash in 2008 - would have seen the modernist structure turned into a swimming pool and health spa. Now arts charity NVA is working towards turning the site into a dramatic space for public art, performance and debate. The idea is to consolidate the ruin into a new design - with only partial restoration. A master plan was submitted in 2011. With significant help from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Creative Scotland, NVA has reached its Â£7m funding target - and later this year work is expected to start on returning the site to a usable space. A big clean-up last year removed lots of the detritus. The sanctuary and altar area could be turned into a performance space like this. But the public has already been given a chance to see the ruin of St Peter's in a new light. In Spring 2016, NVA created a journey in light and sound through the concrete. CalledHinterland, the event was sold out. St Peter's made a dramatic architectural statement when it was built, but its first incarnation as a seminary was short-lived. It is hoped this 21st Century rebirth by NVA, bringing the structure back into productive use, will prove more enduring. All images subject to copyright.

There are 84 categories at the Grammys - including ""best surround sound album"" and ""best notes"" (C# is our favourite) - so if you're a musician and you don't get a prize, it's probably best to cut your losses and take up ostrich farming. You can see the main nominees at the bottom of this page, or read the full, exhaustive list on theofficial website of the Grammy Awards,external. The big fight is between Adele and Beyonce, who go head to head in the three main categories: Album of the year, record of the year and song of the year. We predict Beyonce's politically-charged Lemonade will take the honours for album of the year; while Adele's Hello will take the others, which focus more on songcraft. If we're right, it will be the first time Beyonce's won the main prize. Two years ago, she lost album of the year to Beck's Morning Phase, prompting Kanye West to throw all his toys out of the pram. ""Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyonce,"" he observed. Beck declined. Song of the year goes to the people who wrote the music and lyrics. Record of the year recognises everyone who contributed - musicians, producers, artists, catering team, dog groomer, receptionist, Simon Cowell, etc. Very much so. Photographs of the seating plans released on Friday show that Beyonce and Jay Z get the best seats in the house, cementing their position as pop royalty. Beyonce's sister Solange - nominated for best R&B performance - has to sit a row behind, resisting the urge to flick B's ear. Adele sits next to Bruno Mars, while Lady Gaga has an aisle seat.  And, in the most unlikely pairing of the night, J-Lo will have to make small talk with Barry Gibb. The name was chosen in a contest - as the ceremony was previously known as the Gramophone Awards. Jay Danna, the contest winner, received 25 LPs as a prize from the Recording Academy. Sturgill Simpson is the dark horse in the best album category. His nomination raised more than a few eyebrows from people who expected David Bowie's Blackstar to be honoured by the Recording Academy. The bad boy of country music, Sturgill covers Nirvana songs and has publicly berated Nashville for being out of touch. Could he do a Beck? Adele gave an uncharacteristically pitchy performance at last year's Grammys - after a rogue microphone fell on her piano strings and knocked everything out of tune. The Recording Academy have ""spent a year trying to make it up to her,"" Grammy producer Ken Ehrlich told E! and they'll be tightening all the screws on all of the mic stands with an industrial-level power tool. Undoubtedly, she'll be back to her usual, flawless self. David Bowie, George Michael, Prince, Leonard Cohen, Sir George Martin, Sharon Jones, Glenn Frey, Prince Buster, Phife Dawg... 2016 was brutal - but that puts the Grammys in a pickle. They have a long history of musical tributes, but no-one wants this year's show to feel like a funeral. ""You've got a lot of people incredibly excited about being nominated,""producer Kenneth Ehrlich told Rolling Stone,external. ""I don't want to deny them by devoting a third of the show to people who've passed away."" However, organisers have announced there will be special segments devoted to Prince - possibly led by Bruno Mars - and George Michael. Frank Ocean's Blonde was one of the most critically-acclaimed albums of 2016 - but it's nowhere to be seen in the Grammy nominations. Don't call it a snub, though. The star simply didn't submit the record for consideration, citing his dissatisfaction with the way the Grammys treated black artists. ""That institution certainly has nostalgic importance,""he told the New York Times,external. ""It just doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down."" Kanye West, who's up for best rap album, vowed to boycott the Grammys if Frank Ocean wasn't nominated. We'll have to wait and see if he keeps his word. Among the other major stars, Justin Bieber is allegedly skipping the show because he ""doesn't think the Grammys are relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers"" (according to TMZ, anyway). And Drake isn't going to make it to LA, because he's playing a show in Manchester... But that might not be such a bad decision. The show's ratings dropped to a seven-year low in 2016, meaning the star will make more money from a single concert than he would from three minutes' TV exposure. It certainly seems likely. Adele, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and John Legend have all been outspoken critics of the new president. The show has a history of protest. Pharrell, Beyonce and Common all spoke out against police killings of African-Americans two years ago; while Kendrick Lamar performed in chains last year, making a comment on discrimination in America's prison system. Chance The Rapper could make history if his Coloring Book album snags any of the seven awards it's nominated for. The ebullient, gospel-inspired record is the first streaming-only release to be eligible for the Grammys. Although he's locked out of the best album category, David Bowie has five other nominations - and is favourite to win best rock album. But don't place a bet just yet, as he only ever won one competitive Grammy in his life. Rihanna is second to Beyonce as the night's most-nominated woman - she's up for eight awards - but she's likely to be overshadowed in the main categories. Her bold, experimental album ANTI should easily win best urban contemporary album, however. And, while Kanye may complain, don't expect anyone to refuse their awards. Sinead O'Connor is the only artist to have rejected her Grammy outright; while Milli Vanilli are the only act to have their award revoked.

"It's amazing to think that just 10 years ago, flat-rate digital music streaming services were a mere gleam in the eye of industry executives. It wasas recently as September 2007,externalthat Rick Rubin, then co-head of Columbia Records, put forward the idea as a way of combating online music piracy and file-sharing. ""You'd pay, say, $19.95 a month, and the music will come from anywhere you'd like,"" he told the New York Times. ""In this new world, there will be a virtual library that will be accessible from your car, from your cell phone, from your computer, from your television."" As it turned out, he was essentially describing Spotify, which launched just over a year later. He even got the price right. In those heady days, when the pound was a lot stronger, $19.95 was equivalent to Â£10, which, give or take a penny, is the monthly cost of Spotify Premium in the UK today. But Spotify is yet to make a profit, while plans to float the firm on the stock market have reportedly been delayed, raising a big question mark over its business model. Of course, Spotify isn't the only streaming platform out there. Others have joined it over the past decade, including Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music and Deezer, as well as high-resolution music services Tidal and Qobuz. But Spotify is seen as the leader, with more than 100 million users, 40 million of them paid-up subscribers to its Premium tier. Spotify's Daniel Ek is now the music industry's most powerful player, says Billboard The Swedish firm is now a major player in 60 countries, including the world's biggest music market, the US, where streaming accounted for 51% of music consumption last year. Reflecting the huge impact that Spotify has had, its chief executive, Daniel Ek, has just topped US music industry magazine Billboard's latestPower 100 list,externalof the biggest movers and shakers in the business. ""For the first time since [former file-sharing service] Napster decimated music sales, the recorded music industry is showing signs of growth, and that reversal of fortune is largely due to one man,"" Billboard said in its citation. The magazine also hailed Spotify as ""the place fans discover music as well as consume it"", pointing to its promoted playlists, including its Discover Weekly service. However, the clock is ticking for Spotify as it hatches its plans to go public. The firm originally planned to float this year, butaccording to the TechCrunch website,external, this could now be delayed until 2018. There are various issues behind this move, not least of which is that Spotify needs to conclude new long-term licensing deals with the big three record companies - Universal, Sony and Warner - to avoid the risk of suddenly losing major chunks of its content. It's thought that Spotify currently pays 55% of its revenue to record labels in royalties, with additional money going to music publishers. In the interest of finally becoming a profitable company, it would like to lower that percentage, but this is unlikely to go down well with artists, who argue that the royalties they receive from streaming are unfairly low as it is. But if it waits too long before floating, it could face a serious cash crisis. In March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once the initial public offering (IPO) of shares takes place. Is Spotify now too big to fail? However, under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the IPO happens. So as time goes on, Spotify must pay ever larger sums to its creditors just to settle the interest on its loan, while the amount of money it can raise from its IPO is trimmed by an ever greater amount. Unless Mr Ek can get the better of this brutal arithmetic, the future looks tough for Spotify. But at the same time, as Billboard says, ""the entire music business now has an interest in its success"". ""If it's not already too big to fail, it's headed in that direction quickly,"" concludes the magazine.

"Could Jeremy Corbyn be replaced as Labour leader? And if so when? Those whispered questions have been echoing between Labour MPs and party apparatchiks at Westminster for weeks, for months. But today the guessing game has risen to a new pitch. In BBC interviews, we have been given answers of a sort by two of the most prominent members of the shadow cabinet. Yes, the Labour leader could be replaced. And the change could take place at the next election, ""if and when"" Mr Corbyn decides he has had enough. This time, the helpful guidance was not contained in any unattributed, anonymous briefing from a ""senior MP"" or ""party source"", who may or may not be keen to hasten Mr Corbyn on his way. They were the words of the party's newly appointed election co-ordinator in the shadow cabinet, Ian Lavery. In an interview with me for BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, I asked Mr Lavery if a report in the Sunday Times newspaper was true - that the party had conducted focus group research to gauge the potential appeal of two shadow cabinet colleagues, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Raynor, as potential future leadership candidates. His denial was as emphatic as it was unsurprising. It was, he said, ""political poppycock."" Ian Lavery said Labour had ""plenty"" of future leaders to choose from ""I think they are fantastic candidates. We have got lots of quality in the Labour Party and it's not just the two who have been mentioned,"" he added. More interesting was what he said next. ""There's plenty of leaders to pick from, if and when Jeremy decides, of his own volition, that it's not for him at the election."" He concluded, again helpfully: ""That isn't the case at this point in time."" So, in the space of one brief moment, the man now appointed to guide Labour through what could become a torrid series of electoral tests has volunteered that, in his judgement, Mr Corbyn may conceivably decide to pass on the leadership ""at the election"". And that there had been no such decision on Mr Corbyn's part ""at this point in time"". All of which can only crank up the volume of whispered speculation. Against this background, the verdict of Tom Watson, Labour's deputy Labour leader, in his interview with Andrew Marr, perhaps becomes a little more intriguing. He told Marr the party ""has got the leadership settled for this Parliament"". As for the mood in the party, much depends on the coming Parliamentary by-elections in the once supposedly ""safe"" constituencies of Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland in Cumbria. The new election co-ordinator, who replaced Jon Trickett amid a certain unease at the state of Labour's readiness for the fights ahead, was upbeat. Upbeat, at least up to a point. ""If you look at them separately, they are both relatively positive at this moment in time, despite what he polls might say, despite what individuals might say,"" he said. It was not the most ringingly confident assessment I can remember from an election strategist. If Labour loses one or both of these seats, expect the present simmering unease in the party to approach boiling point once again.

"Petkovic was among the German team members outraged by the mistake The United States Tennis Association has apologised after a version of the German national anthem associated with the Nazi era was accidentally sung at a tournament in Hawaii. The obsolete first verse, including the words ""Germany, Germany above all else"" was sung by a soloist at the Fed Cup. The error left members of the German team and fans upset and angry. The USTA extended ""a sincere apology to the German Fed Cup team and fans for the outdated National Anthem"". ""This mistake will not occur again,"" it said. Germany's Andrea Petkovic and Alison Riske of the US were about to play their first-round tie when the anthem was heard. ""It was an absolute outrage and affront, the lowest,"" Petkovic said. ""It was by some way the worst thing that's happened to me, especially in the Fed Cup."" The song, the Deutschlandlied, became the official German anthem under the democratic Weimar Republic in the 1920s. But after World War Two, the first, contentious verse was dropped and the Federal Republic adopted only the third verse beginning ""Unity and justice and freedom"". The Fed Cup is the largest international team competition in women's tennis, and included 99 teams in 2015. Petkovic lost to Riske, 7-6, 6-2.

"Believing you will win when all around see a match that's slipping away. Coming back for more when all game you have been turned over and picked off. Finding precision in the critical moment, having been imprecise in so much of what has gone before. England, despite the late larceny in Cardiff that has extended theirvictory roll to 16 games and counting,are far from perfect. There are flaws and weaknesses there, but the abiding memory from this white-hot battle on a frozen winter's night will be of strength: of character, in depth, of conviction. Wales thought they had done enough. For 76 minutes they had, playing with a pace and ferocity that stirred memories of the massacre of Stuart Lancaster's innocentshere four years ago.The massed ranks of their support were singing them home. And then it turned, ostensibly on one tired clearing kick from Jonathan Davies, but really on so much more. Good teams go close and see the logic in their defeat. They vow to go away and learn the lessons. They accept that sometimes it is just not their day. This England team don't appear to countenance defeat at all. They refuse to let the pressure of being close cloud their thinking. They keep winning that ugly way. Report: Wales 16-21 England Relive Saturday's Six Nations action Howley delighted until last five minutes 5 live In Short: England's backs 'more talented than Wilkinson era' George Ford, fielding Davies' kick 40 metres out with England 16-14 down, might have gambled on a speculative drop-goal. Owen Farrell, taking his pass at pace and with only one man outside him, might have twitched at the memory of the interception a few minutes earlier, or gone safely into contact to set up field position. Elliot Daly, running on instead to another fast, sweetly timed pass, might have cut inside or allowed himself to be swallowed up by the onrushing arms of Alex Cuthbert. Four minutes to go, everything hanging on that one moment, and they made it happen. If it was cruel on Wales, better than they have been in many a marooned year, it characterised the essence of what this England team has become. This video can not be played English grit won us the game - Jones Eddie Jones always thinks his side will win, no matter what mess they find themselves in. Rob Howley always looks worried that his Wales team will lose. That belief has permeated through the ranks. Maro Itoje doesn't dwell on the possibility of defeat, not least because in his brief career it has been such an unfamiliar experience to him. James Haskell's ego makes him relish coming off the bench to help turn games around. Farrell, hit so late and hard by Ross Moriarty early in the second half that he was left dry-retching, sucked it in, grinned and came back to produce the contest's pivotal pass and kick. Howley is a nice man and a dedicated coach who, as a player, could do things few other scrum-halves could. His record as Wales' caretaker boss while Warren Gatland is away is statistically solid - seven wins in his past 10 matches - and has touched occasional heights: a record-breaking win over South Africa last autumn, that unprecedented 30-3 hammering of England in 2013. But whereas Jones comes across as a general with both tactical mastery and troops who are genuinely frightened of him, Howley is more the well-meaning supply teacher whose optimistic lesson plans fail to survive the streetwise and disruptive elements inherent in every classroom. It is the difference too between the England of Jones and that of his predecessor Lancaster, another honourable, hard-working man who saw crunch matches slip from his grasp in each of his four Six Nations campaigns. This video can not be played Six Nations 2017: 'Composure let Wales down' - Howley It happened at Twickenham in 2012, whenScott Williams' brilliant solo burglaryand escape sent Wales away towards a third Grand Slam in eight years and left England stalled in second. It happened in Paris in 2014, whenGael Fickou's late accelerationinside Alex Goode snatched a victory at the death to spell another second place. And it happened, most famously of all, at Twickenham in that tumultuous World Cup group showdown 18 months ago, when an England team 10 points ahead, with half an hour to go, let a Welsh side with a scrum-half on the wing, a wing at centre and a patched-up fly-half at full-back fight back to steal away a three-point win that will be sung about until the Severn runs dry. Jones, reptilian grin and all, does not care who likes him or what others think of his team, as Howley often appears to do and Lancaster once did. And he is becoming defined by these wins when all is nip and tuck and maybe not: here in Cardiff, when his inexperienced back row shipped eight turnovers to their opponents, when the usually unflustered Jonathan Joseph was throwing passes into touch, when only Daly's muscular speed had denied the excellent Dan Biggar a breakaway try; against France a week ago, when three opposition players all made more than 125m with ball in hand; when a red card for Daly meant 75 minutes against Argentina last autumn with 14 men. Captain Dylan Hartley was replaced after only 46 minutes as England turned to their bench to see them to victory Jones spoke afterwards of his team having used up all their get-out-of-jail cards. It was an admission that he expects better and will drill his charges until it comes. It was also a reflection of a bench that he calls his finishers but may be better described as his emergency services. Normally the sight of a skipper being hauled off uninjured after 46 minutes would be a cause for crisis. Not when Jones can send on Jamie George for Dylan Hartley. Haskell, bullish in mind and body, deserves better than the bench but repeatedly makes such an impact from it that he may suffer the unusual misfortune of playing himself out of the starting XV. Ben Te'o, Danny Care, Kyle Sinckler; the names and minutes played may change from game to game, but the influence seldom does. In the second row, Joe Launchbury: not a first choice, not with Itoje and George Kruis in town, but 20 tackles on Saturday night in a defence that kept Wales within range. And so England rumble on, to play an Italian team who have never beaten them, to another home fixture after that against a Scotland side who are winless at Twickenham in 34 years. No-one in the camp is talking yet about Grand Slams, but precedent suggests the trip to Ireland in five weeks time might be precisely for that. Wales will take heart from their performance, if little comfort from helping produce a match that gripped from the start and carried all watching along to the end. They might wonder how this one got away, look back with regret at those first-half penalties not aimed at the posts or the period of second-half dominance that featured wonderful possession and territory but nothing on the board to show for it. England? There will be no regrets, not when they keep marching forward, not when they keep finding a way. There will be plenty of regrets for Wales having come so close to downing the reigning Six Nations champions Wales 16-21 England Late Daly try seals narrow England win.

"Thibaut Courtois conceded a direct free-kick for the first time in his Premier League career Chelsea missed the chance to move 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League as they were held to a draw by a resilient Burnley at Turf Moor. The hosts had won all four of their previous homes games without conceding but fell behind early on when Pedro finished off a sweeping attack. The visitors dominated possession and it seemed only a matter of time before they added to their advantage. However, Burnley's record signing Robbie Brady - making his full debut following a January move from Norwich - equalised with a stunning free-kick. The Clarets almost went ahead before the break but Thibaut Courtois superbly denied Matt Lowton from close range. Chelsea did not have a single shot on target in the second half as Burnley took the game to the Premier League leaders, Andre Gray testing Courtois with a low drive when he was through one-on-one. In the end, manager Antonio Conte will perhaps consider this a point gained as the Blues moved 10 points ahead of Tottenham. Manchester City can close the gap to eight points if they beat Bournemouth on Monday. Burnley, meanwhile, are 12th. Analysis: How Burnley exposed Chelsea's weak spot - Gullit Conte doesn't like Mourinho's 'joking' Relive Burnley's draw with Chelsea Diego Costa did not manage a single shot on target, with both his efforts blocked by a brilliant Burnley defence Chelsea's away form in the Premier League is unrivalled but this was always going to be a difficult test for the Blues. Just two sides have a better home record than Burnley - Chelsea and Tottenham - with 28 of the Clarets' 29 points collected prior to the visit of Conte's men coming at Turf Moor. Initially, it looked like the visitors had the measure of their opponents, swiftly turning defence into attack to catch the Clarets out of position and open the scoring. To Burnley's credit, they did not abandon a system that had brought them so much success on home soil. They allowed Chelsea to dominate possession but closed them down quickly as soon as they approached the box. A disciplined four-man defence had the bustling Diego Costa and the mercurial Eden Hazard under control, limiting the Blues to just two shots on target in the whole game, both of which came in the first half. It was only the second time all season they have dropped points against a side outside the top six. With just Manchester City and Manchester United left to face out of the leading group, it will take an almighty collapse to deny the Blues a fifth Premier League title. Chelsea only managed two shots on target, both of which were from inside the box. As they struggled to break through the Burnley defence they resorted to efforts from distance. Every one of their long-range strikes went wide Cesc Fabregas had one shot and played one key pass after coming on in the 67th minute A key factor in Chelsea's impressive season has been consistency, with Conte rarely making changes to his side unless forced to. Against Burnley, he chose the same XI that started in the 3-1 home win against Arsenal last time out. That meant Cesc Fabregas - who scored against the Gunners - had to make do with a place on the bench. Despite Conte recently calling Fabregas ""a genius"" and likening him to Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo, the Spanish midfielder has started just five games this season. N'Golo Kante and Nemanja Matic were preferred in midfield against Burnley but both are defensive-minded and it quickly became evident that Chelsea were lacking the creativity of someone like Fabregas. Once again Fabregas climbed off the bench but with 20 minutes remaining against a determined Burnley side, it left him little time to make an impression. It could be time for Conte to give Chelsea's 'Pirlo' his chance to shine for the run-in. This video can not be played Conte congratulates 'very tough' Burnley Burnley's home form has all but guaranteed their Premier League status for next season, with Sean Dyche's side comfortably in mid-table and 10 points clear of the relegation zone. But while their home form is as good as anyone's in the top flight, their away form has been on par with a side battling to stay up. They've collected just one point on their travels, a daunting record going into four consecutive away games. The addition of Brady appears an astute signing and, along with Joey Barton, means they possess two players who are deadly from set-pieces. No side have scored more goals from direct free-kicks than Burnley this season and that could represent their best chance of picking up some much-needed points on the road. This video can not be played Burnley making definite progress - Dyche Michael Keane (left) was instrumental in preventing Chelsea from managing a shot on target in the second half Burnley boss Sean Dyche:""Chelsea are a fine side. They are the market leaders for a reason and we limited them to two shots on target and that is tough enough. ""We made four or five really good chances. I am very pleased overall. The mentality here, I am pleased about the growth in the side. ""We are maturing as a side as individuals and as a team. You need assuredness in the Premier League. I was super impressed with our reaction to their goal. We were not disappointed or stepping on the back foot."" Chelsea manager Antonio Conte:""It is one point and for sure we must be disappointed. We tried to win. We started very well and scored a goal and created chances to score the second goal. ""We tried to win but we know Burnley at home are not easy. They have taken 29 points at home. Now it is important to continue to work. ""I think we tried to build and do our football for sure. Burnley tried to disrupt our play. They played long balls and the second ball is not easy. It is not easy to play against this team. It is very particular. At home they are very tough."" Burnley have gone six top-flight games unbeaten at home for the first time since September 1975. Chelsea (19) have scored the first goal of the game more times than any other Premier League team this season and have yet to lose (W16 D3). Burnley have never won a Premier League encounter against Chelsea (D2 L4). Pedro has now scored nine times in all competitions for Chelsea this season, surpassing his total of eight in 2015-16. Robbie Brady is the first Premier League player to score a direct free-kick v Chelsea (in the PL) since Rickie Lambert in March 2013. Brady is the third Burnley player to score on his first Premier League start for the club alongside Scott Arfield v Chelsea in August 2014 and Daniel Fox v West Ham in February 2010. Diego Costa has failed to score in three consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since April-May 2016. After hosting non-league Lincoln City in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday [12:30 GMT], Burnley begin a run of four away games in a row when they travel to Hull City on 25 February. Chelsea are also in FA Cup action at the weekend. They travel to Championship side Wolves [17:30] on Saturday before hosting Swansea in the Premier League the following weekend.

"Kate and her Nanny Chat's wedding photos more than 60 years apart Social media was captivated by a150-year-old wedding dress that had been lostafter a dry cleaners went bust. Tess Newall, who had worn her great-great grandmother's dress at her wedding in June, posted a plea on Facebook to help find it,which was shared more than 300,000 times,external. Luckily her dress was found but what is the appeal for brides of choosing a dress once worn by a relative? Three women explained why they had ditched trawling the bridal shops for the perfect dress in favour of a borrowed gown. Kate Ridgway, from Stockport, made the decision to wear her grandmother's wedding dress in 2014. ""I remember it from when I was a child,"" said the 27-year-old. ""I always knew nan had kept it and I tried it on for dressing up, but back then I thought it was a horrid lacy thing."" However, when she got engaged to her now-husband Stu, Joan Chatfield, known as ""Nanny Chat"", asked if she would like to wear it on her big day. ""I was heavily pregnant at the time, so I couldn't try it on,"" said Kate. ""But she had always wanted me to wear it."" Then, three days after Kate's eldest son was born, her nan passed away. When she travelled down to Sussex for the funeral, her mother handed her the box with the vintage wedding dress from 1951, and everything fell into place. ""When I tried it on, it fitted perfectly,"" she said. ""I had it cleaned but I didn't have to do anything else to it. ""I had tried on brand new wedding dresses and I had fallen in love with one, but this felt different and so special. ""It meant so much to us as a family for me to wear it and, as you can imagine, it made for a very emotional day."" Emily Clark's dress was first worn by her mother Marilyn London-based digital designer Emily Clark also hopes to start a tradition of her own by using her mother's frock for her wedding this October. The 33-year-old said her mother's dress, which was first worn in 1980, had played a big part in her childhood. ""I used to dress in my mum's wedding dress from the age of five or six to - if I'm truthful - until I was 15. ""It's one of a kind, it's a dress you wouldn't be able to find now and you wouldn't be able to replicate."" The dress was bought by her grandfather, who died last year. She said the dress would act as a way of commemorating him at her wedding to fiance Andrew Stewart. Emily and Andrew are due to get married in October The dress is currently being altered, and when she heard that Mrs Newall's had gone missing at the dry cleaners she says she ""did panic"". She added: ""I just think it's wonderful that they've had it returned."" For Rachel Cohen, from Edinburgh, the discovery of her grandmother's dress in the loft spurred on the idea to go retro. ""I knew there were dresses up there amongst a lot of random stuff,"" she said. ""I even found one dress which much have been from a previous generation, but it just couldn't have been worn."" However, the one Granny Marie Waterston wore in the 1930s was in superb condition and perfect for Rachel's special day. Marie Waterston in the 1930s (L) and Rachel Cohen in 2009 (R) ""I had never been the type of person to dream of a big white dress, so when I found it, packed away all neat and tidy in a box, I had the idea to wear it,"" she said. ""I had to cut the sleeves off as she had such tiny hands, but otherwise it was the same."" Having her grandmother's dress meant a lot to Rachel when she married in 2009. ""My mother died when I was young and I looked after my grandmother when she was old, so we had a close relationship,"" said Rachel. ""It was special to have her dress there, even when she couldn't be."" While those three brides opted for the personal touch with their dresses, they join growing numbers of people choosing vintage items more generally. Louise Croft, ethical fashion blogger at PaupertoPrincess.com - who will be wearing a 1940s gown for her wedding later this year - said going vintage had many benefits, from following fashion cycles to stopping garments ending up in landfills. She said the growth of online sharing had also led to brides wanting to stand out even more, and going down the classic route often means the dress is one of a kind. ""It feels like giving a precious piece of history a moment in the limelight rather than it being in a museum or attic,"" added Louise. ""Of course, you always wonder what tales and secrets it holds and if it's from a family member then you are lucky enough to also have all these answers."" Some brides choose to customise a handed down dress Kat Williams, editor of Rock 'n Roll Bride, said although dresses have been passed down for many years, a lot more people were putting their own touches to them. ""We had one woman in the magazine who wore her grandmother's dress and customised it all to make it more modern,"" she said. ""She shortened it, added a big petticoat and made it more fitted. ""It looked great but offered that little bit of family history too. ""Even if you buy a dress from a vintage shop, it means you won't see lots of other brides wearing the same thing and a bride wants to feel unique."" 150-year-old dress lost at dry cleaners 150-year-old wedding dress found Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Inside neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"When police officers parked a man's car outside their own station to keep it safe, no-one expected their colleagues to then mistakenly blow it up. But sometimes, despite the best of intentions, our defenders of law and order get it wrong. BBC News takes a look at some other unfortunate blunders. The car was parked by officers outside Workington police station after the owner had been taken ill Last week, kind-hearted police officers helped a man who had fallen ill and took him to hospital in Cumbria. Unfortunately, having parked his car outside Workington police station for safe keeping, they failed to make what they had done sufficiently clear to their colleagues. The next shift, concerned about the ""suspicious"" vehicle,called the bomb squad who blew it up. Cumbria Police apologised for the ""internal communications error"" and said it would ""review this incident and will take on board any learning"". Theircolleagues in Barrow,externalare likely to make sure of that. Picking the right fuel can be tricky for officers and civilians alike Cars have proved tricky for police forces in other ways. Specifically, when it comes to remembering which fuel they take. Misfuelling repairs costScottish police Â£60,000 over five years. In one year alone North Wales Policeput 26 cars out of action,external. Avon and Somerset forcebroke 50,externalbut, in their defence, pointed out they filled up about 57,000 times each year. Essex Police took the problem so seriously theyinstalled talking fuel caps,external. Repton Road, left, and Repton Grove - an easy mistake to make Still on the road but going the wrong way, some police forces have found mistaken identity to be something of a theme. One man from Birmingham waserroneously visited by police more than 40 times in 18 months, often in the middle of the night. West Midlands Police kept confusing a house on Repton Road (where Matthew Jillard lived) with one on Repton Grove (where he did not). Mr Jillard, who was not wanted in connection with any crimes, said the force told his girlfriend they ""knew all about it because they had seminars about not getting it wrong"". A police spokeswoman said officers had ""been in regular contact with the occupier to apologise for the mistakes"". Mr Jillard might be forgiven for thinking ""regular contact"" was the problem. Mr Jokubauskas had to show Lithuanian police his ID Last year Cambridgeshire Police were looking for a 57-year-old suspect called Vytautas Jokubauskas, from Peterborough. To aid their search they released an image. The problem wasit was of an entirely different 50-year-old Lithuanian, with the same name, who said he had never been to the UK. This is not the only time Cambridgeshire Police has suffered from a case of mistaken identity. In May it had to apologise afterwrongly indentifying two ""completely innocent"" teenage girlsas prime suspects in a shop theft. The letter from Sussex Police was addressed to Mr Rachel Dios For Sussex Police it was the correct name but wrong title which got it into trouble, when a nurse reported a transphobic hate crime. Rachel Dios told police some men had shouted ""It's a man, it's a man"" at her in the street. She was disconcerted toreceive a reply from the force addressed to ""Mr Dios"". The force apologised and undertook ""to make sure the same mistake doesn't happen again"". Warwickshire Police tweeted a picture of its new van - but the photograph revealed spelling mistakes on the side Warwickshire Police risked alienating the good people of Shipston-on-Stour and Wellesbourne whenthe names of the two towns were spelled incorrectlyon a new force van. When a local neighbourhood team pointed it out, the force did what all modern, social media-minded organisations have learnt works best - held their hands up andmade a joke about it on Twitter,external. Sculptor Alfie Bradley welded knives to the angel's wings Clearly making mistakes is easily done. It is just that the police are more likely than most people to be handling explosives when they do err. Last year, knives collected in a nationwide amnesty were sent by forces to a tourist attraction in Oswestry, Shropshire, for a ""knife angel"" sculpture. However, one of the forcesaccidentally included two bags of explosivesin its donation. It was never clear which force was responsible. Fake explosives can be just as tricky. In 2014, West Midlands Policeinadvertently left behind a fake bomb,externalafter a training exercise at Wolverhampton Wanderers' football stadium. Fans spotted the device and the match was almost called off before police realised what had happened. The force apologised for ""any distress"". While police mistakes often make the news, this is only because their actions have ""more serious consequences for society and public safety"", says Professor David Wall, of Leeds University's Centre for Criminal Justice Studies. ""I think we look to police as a source of authority and to help us when we are in trouble and I guess that we expect them to be a little more perfect than the rest of us are,"" he said. Cumbria Police calling in the bomb squad suggested ""their left hand didn't seem to know what the right hand was doing"", he said. But they are not alone, he stresses. He recalls an unnamed university which cut down trees to make space for a new conservation area sign and which also stuck ""save electricity"" posters on windows, making it too dark to see without lights.

"Rebekah Ellis breastfeeds her baby son and three-year-old daughter Women who breastfeed their toddlers say they are either branded ""hippy earth mothers"" or seen as ""weird and disgusting"". Many have applauded model Tamara Ecclestone forbraving the backlashto post a photograph of herself breastfeeding her daughter, who is nearly three. TheNHS says,externalmost women in the UK wish they could breastfeed for longer than they do, yet onlyone in 200 mothersdo so past their baby's first birthday. Here, five mothers who carried on breastfeeding share their stories. Rebekah Ellis, 32, from Cambridge, breastfeeds both her six-month-old son and her daughter, who is three and a half. She says: ""The reaction from the NHS has been supportive, albeit surprised. The midwives who attended my son's birth at home said 'Good for you,' when my husband explained. ""Most people don't know that I am still feeding my daughter. I know that I would get a negative reaction from the vast majority. Even nursing past a year old is often seen as weird, disgusting - despite the WHO [World Health Organisation] recommendation [that children should be breastfed until the age of two or older]. ""When I nurse my son out in public (my daughter hasn't wanted milk during the day since the age of 18 months), I use a cover. This is more for me than for the benefit of others. ""People still look uncomfortable though, even when they can't see anything."" Kelly Lane, 38, from Redditch in Worcestershire, breastfed her daughter, now nine, and her son, now seven, until the age of two and a half. She says her confidence took a knock after a friend's husband criticised her, telling her it was ""pointless"" - but she carried on because she could see the health benefits for her children. She says: ""You do have to be dedicated to do it but I was happy to give that up for what was only a very short period of my life. ""The one quite hard thing is having a meal. I personally felt too uncomfortable to breastfeed in public and would use breast-feeding rooms or the toilet. ""But breastfeeding in toilets is horrendous - they're not hygienic, there's not enough space and you're conscious you are taking up space for someone who might be queuing. ""Both my children did not like having blankets thrown over them when feeding, as they like to look at Mummy and be talked to and, to be honest, rightly so. A child shouldn't be covered up when it's being nursed. ""I feel so sad that society is so negative and disgusted that a mother would be feeding her child the way nature intended in public, than actually congratulating her for doing a great thing. ""It's ok though for women to be up on billboards everywhere flashing every body part possible! The hypocrisy is astonishing!"" Tamara Ecclestone sparked a debate online with this photo Rebecca Alexander, 34, from Liverpool, still breastfeeds her son who will be three in April.  She says she loves Tamara Ecclestone's ""continued support and promotion of breastfeeding"". She told the BBC: ""I struggled feeding my elder daughter for more than three weeks first time around because of the lack of knowledge and support. Breastfeeding should be visible in our society. It's how we learn; by seeing others do it. ""I set out on this journey [with my son] thinking I would breastfeed till two years and then pump until four. ""When he has had big changes such as starting nursery, with a new childminder and me returning to work, breastfeeding has been his source of comfort and a way to reconnect after being apart all day. ""How anyone can see it as sexual completely shocks me, and I think it says more about our society, and the view of women than anything else."" Sarah Johnson, who breastfeeds her two-year-old son twice a day, says: ""I think it is a benefit for his health and also a nice bonding moment for us both, especially as I work away part of the week. ""I have decided to continue until he is ready to stop, but I am coming under pressure from family members to stop - grandparents - who say he is 'no longer a baby'. ""I tell them about the WHO guidelines for breastfeeding until two and beyond, but I guess in our Western culture you are seen as a hippy earth mother or odd if you still breastfeed a toddler - shame as in other parts of the world it is totally normal. ""When did something natural become unnatural? I don't judge mothers who choose to bottle feed, so would not liked to be judged either. ""Although the pictures [of Tamara Ecclestone] are rather posed, I commend her for posting them."" Sue Burgess, 57, from Oxford, breastfed her daughter until she was two and a half, and while she says she cannot understand why anyone would describe it as disgusting, she admits she only did it in public ""a handful of times"" as she found it ""embarrassing"". Although her daughter is now 16, Sue still cringes when she thinks about the ""worst time"" feeding her in a village square in Italy and feeling ""exposed"" as a solemn church procession took place close by. ""My daughter started to say 'A boo! A boo! A BOO!!!' at ever-increasing volumes, which was her way of asking for a breastfeed. I complied unwillingly."" Sue adds: ""Nonetheless, if other people feel the strength to take such experiences in their stride, I can only admire them.""

"It's amazing to think that just 10 years ago, flat-rate digital music streaming services were a mere gleam in the eye of industry executives. It wasas recently as September 2007,externalthat Rick Rubin, then co-head of Columbia Records, put forward the idea as a way of combating online music piracy and file-sharing. ""You'd pay, say, $19.95 a month, and the music will come from anywhere you'd like,"" he told the New York Times. ""In this new world, there will be a virtual library that will be accessible from your car, from your cell phone, from your computer, from your television."" As it turned out, he was essentially describing Spotify, which launched just over a year later. He even got the price right. In those heady days, when the pound was a lot stronger, $19.95 was equivalent to Â£10, which, give or take a penny, is the monthly cost of Spotify Premium in the UK today. But Spotify is yet to make a profit, while plans to float the firm on the stock market have reportedly been delayed, raising a big question mark over its business model. Of course, Spotify isn't the only streaming platform out there. Others have joined it over the past decade, including Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music and Deezer, as well as high-resolution music services Tidal and Qobuz. But Spotify is seen as the leader, with more than 100 million users, 40 million of them paid-up subscribers to its Premium tier. Spotify's Daniel Ek is now the music industry's most powerful player, says Billboard The Swedish firm is now a major player in 60 countries, including the world's biggest music market, the US, where streaming accounted for 51% of music consumption last year. Reflecting the huge impact that Spotify has had, its chief executive, Daniel Ek, has just topped US music industry magazine Billboard's latestPower 100 list,externalof the biggest movers and shakers in the business. ""For the first time since [former file-sharing service] Napster decimated music sales, the recorded music industry is showing signs of growth, and that reversal of fortune is largely due to one man,"" Billboard said in its citation. The magazine also hailed Spotify as ""the place fans discover music as well as consume it"", pointing to its promoted playlists, including its Discover Weekly service. However, the clock is ticking for Spotify as it hatches its plans to go public. The firm originally planned to float this year, butaccording to the TechCrunch website,external, this could now be delayed until 2018. There are various issues behind this move, not least of which is that Spotify needs to conclude new long-term licensing deals with the big three record companies - Universal, Sony and Warner - to avoid the risk of suddenly losing major chunks of its content. It's thought that Spotify currently pays 55% of its revenue to record labels in royalties, with additional money going to music publishers. In the interest of finally becoming a profitable company, it would like to lower that percentage, but this is unlikely to go down well with artists, who argue that the royalties they receive from streaming are unfairly low as it is. But if it waits too long before floating, it could face a serious cash crisis. In March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once the initial public offering (IPO) of shares takes place. Is Spotify now too big to fail? However, under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the IPO happens. So as time goes on, Spotify must pay ever larger sums to its creditors just to settle the interest on its loan, while the amount of money it can raise from its IPO is trimmed by an ever greater amount. Unless Mr Ek can get the better of this brutal arithmetic, the future looks tough for Spotify. But at the same time, as Billboard says, ""the entire music business now has an interest in its success"". ""If it's not already too big to fail, it's headed in that direction quickly,"" concludes the magazine.

"When police officers parked a man's car outside their own station to keep it safe, no-one expected their colleagues to then mistakenly blow it up. But sometimes, despite the best of intentions, our defenders of law and order get it wrong. BBC News takes a look at some other unfortunate blunders. The car was parked by officers outside Workington police station after the owner had been taken ill Last week, kind-hearted police officers helped a man who had fallen ill and took him to hospital in Cumbria. Unfortunately, having parked his car outside Workington police station for safe keeping, they failed to make what they had done sufficiently clear to their colleagues. The next shift, concerned about the ""suspicious"" vehicle,called the bomb squad who blew it up. Cumbria Police apologised for the ""internal communications error"" and said it would ""review this incident and will take on board any learning"". Theircolleagues in Barrow,externalare likely to make sure of that. Picking the right fuel can be tricky for officers and civilians alike Cars have proved tricky for police forces in other ways. Specifically, when it comes to remembering which fuel they take. Misfuelling repairs costScottish police Â£60,000 over five years. In one year alone North Wales Policeput 26 cars out of action,external. Avon and Somerset forcebroke 50,externalbut, in their defence, pointed out they filled up about 57,000 times each year. Essex Police took the problem so seriously theyinstalled talking fuel caps,external. Repton Road, left, and Repton Grove - an easy mistake to make Still on the road but going the wrong way, some police forces have found mistaken identity to be something of a theme. One man from Birmingham waserroneously visited by police more than 40 times in 18 months, often in the middle of the night. West Midlands Police kept confusing a house on Repton Road (where Matthew Jillard lived) with one on Repton Grove (where he did not). Mr Jillard, who was not wanted in connection with any crimes, said the force told his girlfriend they ""knew all about it because they had seminars about not getting it wrong"". A police spokeswoman said officers had ""been in regular contact with the occupier to apologise for the mistakes"". Mr Jillard might be forgiven for thinking ""regular contact"" was the problem. Mr Jokubauskas had to show Lithuanian police his ID Last year Cambridgeshire Police were looking for a 57-year-old suspect called Vytautas Jokubauskas, from Peterborough. To aid their search they released an image. The problem wasit was of an entirely different 50-year-old Lithuanian, with the same name, who said he had never been to the UK. This is not the only time Cambridgeshire Police has suffered from a case of mistaken identity. In May it had to apologise afterwrongly indentifying two ""completely innocent"" teenage girlsas prime suspects in a shop theft. The letter from Sussex Police was addressed to Mr Rachel Dios For Sussex Police it was the correct name but wrong title which got it into trouble, when a nurse reported a transphobic hate crime. Rachel Dios told police some men had shouted ""It's a man, it's a man"" at her in the street. She was disconcerted toreceive a reply from the force addressed to ""Mr Dios"". The force apologised and undertook ""to make sure the same mistake doesn't happen again"". Warwickshire Police tweeted a picture of its new van - but the photograph revealed spelling mistakes on the side Warwickshire Police risked alienating the good people of Shipston-on-Stour and Wellesbourne whenthe names of the two towns were spelled incorrectlyon a new force van. When a local neighbourhood team pointed it out, the force did what all modern, social media-minded organisations have learnt works best - held their hands up andmade a joke about it on Twitter,external. Sculptor Alfie Bradley welded knives to the angel's wings Clearly making mistakes is easily done. It is just that the police are more likely than most people to be handling explosives when they do err. Last year, knives collected in a nationwide amnesty were sent by forces to a tourist attraction in Oswestry, Shropshire, for a ""knife angel"" sculpture. However, one of the forcesaccidentally included two bags of explosivesin its donation. It was never clear which force was responsible. Fake explosives can be just as tricky. In 2014, West Midlands Policeinadvertently left behind a fake bomb,externalafter a training exercise at Wolverhampton Wanderers' football stadium. Fans spotted the device and the match was almost called off before police realised what had happened. The force apologised for ""any distress"". While police mistakes often make the news, this is only because their actions have ""more serious consequences for society and public safety"", says Professor David Wall, of Leeds University's Centre for Criminal Justice Studies. ""I think we look to police as a source of authority and to help us when we are in trouble and I guess that we expect them to be a little more perfect than the rest of us are,"" he said. Cumbria Police calling in the bomb squad suggested ""their left hand didn't seem to know what the right hand was doing"", he said. But they are not alone, he stresses. He recalls an unnamed university which cut down trees to make space for a new conservation area sign and which also stuck ""save electricity"" posters on windows, making it too dark to see without lights.

"Donald Trump will visit the UK later this year Many column inches have been devoted to Commons Speaker John Bercow since he voiced his strong opposition to Donald Trump addressing both Houses of Parliament. But according to the Sunday Express,external, Mr Trump plans to snub Parliament when he pays a state visit to the UK later this year. The paper says the US president will ""speak to the people"" at a spectacular rally - and donate the proceeds of what he hopes will be a sell-out event to the Poppy Appeal. The Express says venues in Birmingham, and even Wembley, are under consideration. An accusation that Theresa May is putting Northern Ireland's peace process in jeopardyis carried in the Observer,external. The claim is made by Bertie Ahern, the Irish leader who helped secure the Good Friday Agreement. In an interview with the paper, Mr Ahern, who served three terms as taoiseach between 1997 and 2008, says the British government appeared to have resigned itself to the establishment of a border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic once the UK leaves the EU with, the paper says, potentially devastating results. The Mail on Sunday says it has seen what it describes,externalas ""sexist"" text messages sent by Brexit Secretary David Davis regarding an encounter with Diane Abbott in a Commons bar last week. The shadow home secretary is said to have rebuffed Mr Davis with strong language when he approached her after she had voted in favour of triggering Article 50. According to the paper, Mr Davis texted a Tory friend denying he had tried to hug Ms Abbott, adding ""I'm not blind!"" A spokesman for Mr Davis said the texts were ""self-evidently jocular and private"". Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott has weighed into the debate over the future of the NHS and social care. Writing in the Sunday Mirror,external, Lord Prescott says, at 78, he is among a generation of people who are living longer, have more complex conditions and need more care. He calls for all parties to sit down and work out a long-term way of funding a social care system based on need, not ability to pay. Lord Prescott says tax rises will be necessary but the government could implement two measures immediately to ease the strain on the NHS - cancel corporation tax cuts and sack Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. The Sunday Times says Labour is conducting,externalsecret ""succession planning"" for Jeremy Corbyn's departure. The paper reports that it has seen leaked documents that warn the party is facing meltdown under Mr Corbyn's leadership. Participants in a focus group reportedly delivered a damning verdict on Mr Corbyn, describing him as ""boring"" and ""like a scruffy school kid"". While winning the Lottery may be a dream for many, Britain's youngest Euromillions winner tells theSunday People,externalit has ruined her life. So much so, says the paper, that Jane Park is considering legal action against Lottery operators for negligence. Ms Park was only 17 when she won Â£1m with her first-ever ticket in 2013. She now complains of being sick of shopping for designer goods and staying in upmarket holiday resorts, struggling to find a boyfriend who is not after her money and being burdened with the stress of being a millionaire. The paper is not entirely sympathetic. It describes her complaints as a ""breathtaking whinge"".
