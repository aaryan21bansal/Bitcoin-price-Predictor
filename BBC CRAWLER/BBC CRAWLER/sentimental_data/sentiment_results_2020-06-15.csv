"The memorial for PC Keith Palmer was unveiled outside Parliament in 2018 A man has been jailed for urinating at the Westminster memorial dedicated to PC Keith Palmer. Andrew Banks, 28, of Stansted, Essex, was photographed during Saturday's right-wing protests in London. He was sentenced to 14 days in custody, after pleading guilty to outraging public decency at Westminster Magistrates' Court. PC Palmer, 48, was stabbed while on duty during the Westminster attack on 22 March 2017. He was one of five people murdered by Khalid Masood. Andrew Banks had not slept the night before the incident, the court heard The image of Banks was widely shared on social media on Saturday asviolent clashes between far-right protesters and policetook place in central London. Banks, a Tottenham Hotspur fan, said he had travelled to central London with other football supporters to ""protect statues"", but admitted he did not know which statues. He was said to have drunk 16 pints during Friday night into Saturday morning, and had not been to sleep. Banks contacted police after being confronted by his father, the court heard. Jailing Banks, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said: ""I accept you were drunk and did not know where you were urinating. ""Your explanation is you had 16 pints to drink, you hadn't been to bed, and a group of football supporters were coming up to protect the monuments. ""The irony is rather than protecting the monuments, you almost urinated on one. That was more by luck than judgment."" PC Keith Palmer was unarmed as he was attacked by Khalid Masood His counsel Stuart Harris said his client was ""ashamed by his action"", and had mental health issues. The act was widely condemned at the time by politicians including MP Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to PC Palmer as he lay dying in the grounds of Parliament. Met Police Cdr Bas Javid said: ""Keith Palmer was a brave police officer and the memorial stands testament to his courage. ""Banks' actions, in stark contrast, were unpleasant and extremely upsetting to PC Palmer's family and colleagues. ""While I note that Banks did not act with intent, I welcome the sentence handed down by the court for his thoughtless and distasteful behaviour.""

"This video can not be played The PM says the EU and UK are ânot actually that far apartâ UK and EU leaders have said new momentum is needed in negotiations on their future relationship, after high-level talks on Monday. The PM, who met EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen virtually, said there was a ""very good"" chance of getting a trade deal by December. He said he saw no reason why it cannot be ""done in July"", after the sides agreed to intensify talks next month. Mrs von der Leyen said they ""agreed to deliver the best deal"" for citizens. The EU also noted the UK's decision not to extend the transition period, which ends in December. Kuenssberg: Metaphors abound as talks get more urgent What are the sticking points in the trade talks? Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? In a joint statement issued after Monday's meeting via video conference, the UK and EU ""welcomed the constructive discussions on the future relationship that had taken place"". ""The parties agreed nevertheless that new momentum was required,"" it said. The high-level meeting was via video link They have agreed to intensify talks in July, and to find an ""early understanding on the principles"" underlying any deal. The UK government has said the talks in July will involve a mix of formal negotiating rounds and smaller group meetings in London and Brussels, if coronavirus guidelines allow. Mr Johnson said the EU and the UK were ""not that far apart"" with regards to the future relationship, but he added that ""a bit of oomph"" was needed in the talks. Calling on the EU to ""put a tiger in the tank"", the prime minister said the chances of getting a trade deal by the end of the year were ""very good"", provided both sides focus now and ""get on and do it"". Asked what the cut-off date would be by which the UK government will give business certainty of what they can expect, Mr Johnson said he saw no reason why it cannot be ""done in July"". ""I certainly don't want to see it going on until the Autumn/Winter as I think perhaps in Brussels they would like. I don't see any point in that so let's get it done."" European Council President Charles Michel, who joined Mrs von der Leyen on the call along with European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli, said a ""broad and ambitious agreement"" was ""in our mutual interest"".

Downing Street earlier said Mr Johnson would reiterate that the UK's ambition is for a high quality free trade agreement consistent with others the EU have agreed. Mr Johnson was also due to make clear that the UK is ready to start trading on World Trade Organisation rules from 1 January if a deal cannot be reached. This was Boris Johnson's first meeting with EU leaders since trade negotiations started back in March. So, did we have an ""aha moment""? A glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel of deadlocked talks? Well, not exactly. But this was always going to be a stocktaking moment, rather than high level negotiation. The EU was buoyed to hear the prime minister express commitment to finding a deal. And while Brussels privately regards as unrealistic, the UK aim of having the outline of that deal in place by the end of the summer, EU insiders say negotiators will try everything to find agreement as soon as possible. You wouldn't expect them to say anything less. But notably absent from today's declarations was to what extent each side is willing to compromise. And that, of course, will be key. Without some concessions, from both sides, today's high-level declaration of intent to reach an EU-UK deal, is rather empty. But a French former Europe minister has said the EU is preparing itself for a no-deal Brexit. MEP Nathalie Loiseau told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are ready either for an agreement or for a no-deal and we are getting prepared more actively to a no-deal considering the circumstances. ""We believe it is possible to have an agreement - it has to be ready in October so that parliaments on both sides can ratify it. ""We believe it is possible because we have the political declaration which we negotiated together, signed together and should respect together - so, yes, the framework is here."" UK backtracks on full EU border checks post-Brexit Which countries does the UK do the most trade with? Monday's virtual meeting comes after EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said there had been ""no significant areas of progress"" at the last negotiating round earlier this month. Likewise his UK counterpart David Frost had said progress ""remains limited,"" and negotiators were ""reaching the limits"" of what could be achieved in formal talks. Differences between the two sides remain on fisheries, competition rules, police co-operation, and how a deal would be enforced. Meanwhile, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson and Emmanuel Macron will meet in London on Thursday. The French president will travel to London to attend official commemorations of 80th anniversary of General Charles de Gaulle's appeal to the French population to resist the German occupation of France during the Second World War.

"This video can not be played Man Utd's Rashford speaks about mother's sacrifices in his bid to end food poverty England striker Marcus Rashford said he would fight on after the government confirmed it would not provide free school meal vouchers during the summer. The Manchester United player wrote an emotional open letter to MPs in which he said ""the system isn't built for families like mine to succeed"". But the Department for Education said it would not reverse its decision. Rashford, 22, responded by tweeting ""we aren't beaten yet"" and ""MPs, please #maketheUturn"". Rashford has raised aboutÂ£20m to supply three million mealsto vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. Campaigners have threatened to bringlegal action against the governmentfor not extending the food voucher scheme into the summer holidays. In his letter, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was ""all too familiar for families in England"". Sonja from Basingstoke, who has three teenage children, told BBC Radio 5 live Drive she found herself out of work because of the pandemic and does not start her new job until September. She said she was in ""real trouble"" without the vouchers in the meantime. ""I'm relying on the Â£60 I get every fortnight from free school meal vouchers to do my food shopping,"" she said. ""There are lots of us out there that have found ourselves on benefits through no fault of our own. We really are struggling to make ends meet and I'm not sure too many people understand how difficult it is - Marcus obviously does."" Gary Lineker told BBC Newsnight he was ""very impressed"" with Rashford's efforts. He said he understands that ""kids wouldn't ordinarily be fed during the summer holidays"", but these are ""very, very difficult times"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Rashford said: ""It's written from the heart and it's about how my life was at the moment - the letter is to open up and let people understand the impact on families and to know I've done the right thing. ""What families are going through now, I've once had to go through that - and it's very difficult to find a way out. It's very important for me to help people who are struggling -  whether the outcome changes or doesn't change, that's why I wrote it."" The Department for Education said: ""As schools open more widely, and their kitchens reopen, we expect schools to make food parcels available for collection or delivery for any children that are eligible for free school meals who are not yet able to return to school. ""Where this is not possible, schools can continue to offer vouchers to eligible pupils."" A spokesperson also pointed to the new Â£63m local authority welfare assistance scheme to support the most vulnerable families, and its Holiday Activities and Food programme, which offers activities and free meals in the summer holidays. Families claiming free school meals have been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card - worth Â£15 per child, per week - to spend at supermarkets, while schools have been closed. In England, about 1.3 million children from low-income backgrounds are eligible for free school meals. To qualify, their household must earn a maximum income of Â£7,400 a year after tax, not including any benefits. The full criteria is listedhere.,external A child who qualifies remains eligible until 31 March 2022, whether in primary or secondary education. Children from families who meet certain criteria can also be eligible for free school meals before they start school. During the pandemic,the government says,externalit expects schools to continue to support eligible children in term time. This includes: Food parcels A national voucher scheme Vouchers for a local shop or supermarket This provision included the Easter and May half-term holidays, but the voucher schemes will not run during the summer holidays. In Wales, the government will provide free school meal vouchers until schools reopen, or at least until the end of August. A survey by the Food Foundation in May,externalsaid that more than 200,000 children in the UK have had to skip meals because their family could not access enough food during lockdown. In the letter, Rashford wrote: ""My mum worked full-time, earning the minimum wage, to make sure we always had a good evening meal on the table, but it was not enough. ""The system was not built for families like mine to succeed, regardless of how hard my mum worked."" Rashford added his plea for the government to ""make the U-turn and make protecting the lives of some of our most vulnerable a top priority"" was ""not about politics"" but about ""humanity"". He added it was about ""looking at ourselves in the mirror and feeling like we did everything we could to protect those who can't, for whatever reason or circumstance, protect themselves"". This video can not be played Marcus Rashford speaks to BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent about his childhood Rashford wrote: ""Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to be hungry?"" The United youth-team graduate, who is one of five children, added: ""As a black man from a low-income family in Wythenshawe, Manchester, I could have been just another statistic. ""Instead, due to the selfless actions of my mum, my family, my neighbours, and my coaches, the only stats I'm associated with are goals, appearances and caps. ""I would be doing myself, my family and my community an injustice if I didn't stand here today with my voice and my platform and ask you for help."" ""Ten years ago, I would have been one of those children, and you would never have heard my voice and seen my determination to become part of the solution,"" added Rashford. ""Food poverty in England is a pandemic that could span generations if we don't course correct now."" Rashford stated the government's Universal Credit benefit system ""is simply not a short-term solution"" to the issue of food poverty, because ""I am fully aware that the majority of families applying are experiencing five-week delays"". He is concerned child poverty is ""only going to get worse"" when the government's furlough scheme ends. Rashford added that with many children still not able to return to school and have more of their nutritional needs met ""we're encouraging this cycle of hardship to continue"". A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said Boris Johnson ""will respond to Marcus Rashford's letter as soon as he can"", adding the footballer ""has been using his profile in a positive way to highlight some important issues"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""This is such an important and moving letter. Thank you, Marcus, for all the work you are doing to support children during the coronavirus crisis."" Marcus Rashford with his mum Mel. He wrote: ""Without the kindness and generosity of the community I had around me, there wouldn't be the Marcus Rashford you see today: a 22-year old black man lucky enough to make a career playing a game I love.""

"Prince William spoke with Leanne whose five-year-old son Kaydyn has cystic fibrosis The Duke of Cambridge has made a surprise video call to a woman and her young son who have been shielding for the past three months. William spoke with Leanne and five-year-old Kaydyn, who has cystic fibrosis, at their home in Corby, Northamptonshire. Footage of the call will feature on BBC One's The One Show on Tuesday. Leanne was shown covering her mouth with her hands in shock as the Duke called from his home in Norfolk. Live updates: Coronavirus news and more from across the East of England It forms part of a film focusing on extremely vulnerable people being advised to remain at home as much as possible, and the challenges they are facing. The Duke of Cambridge during a previous video call, when he revealed he was a volunteer for a mental health charity's crisis helpline From the start of June, more than 2.2 million extremely vulnerable people shielding from coronavirus were allowed to leave their homes. William reveals he is helpline volunteer William fears NHS staff's struggle with 'hero' tag Royal Family thanks world's nurses in video calls Since the advice changed, Leanne and Kaydyn have been outside twice, for country walks. The BBC said: ""Initially Kaydyn was frustrated about being forced to stay inside - now he is very nervous about leaving the house."" The film will also look at Shelby Lynch, a 21-year-old from Leeds, who has spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and is on a ventilator 24 hours a day. It follows the moment she finally leaves her home for a socially distanced meeting with her boyfriend for the first time in weeks. ""He had been feeling a little down so it was nice to see his face light up,"" she said. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and volunteers at Conscious Youth during a video call Last week, the Duke of Cambridge revealed he had been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown, after being trained by a mental health charity. William said he had been answering messages at Shout 85258, which offers support via text message to people in personal crisis. Last month he told fellow volunteers in a video call: ""I'm going to share a little secret with you guys, but I'm actually on the platform volunteering.""

"Shopper Adam Marlow said Bicester Village was ""way too overcrowded"" More than three thousand people have signed a petition calling for Bicester Village to temporarily close after hundreds of people were pictured at the shopping complex. Pictures on social media appear to show people struggling to maintain social distancing at the designer retail outlet in Bicester, Oxfordshire. The petition is calling for it to be closed until changes are made. Value Retail, which runs the complex, has been contacted for comment. All shops in England are now allowed to open, but with strict safety measures. Laura Wicks, who launched the petition, wrote she was ""disgusted to see hundreds of people squashed into the street like Coronavirus never happened"" and called for the complex to keep their staff safe. Bicester Village reopened to the public on Monday The complex, which has 160 shops, said on its website visitors are temperature-scanned on arrival and they should keep a two-metre distance apart. Shopper Adam Galbraith said keeping two metres was fine in the shops, but it was not being enforced ""well enough"" outside the shops at the luxury retail outlet. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""It was definitely way too overcrowded to adhere to social distancing. ""For a complex of that size they should know how many people can be in this place safely and keep two metres distance, and that for me wasn't monitored at all. ""What would have been better if they had the queues to get into the village outside, and gave customers a two-hour slot to do their shopping."" He added queues outside the shops, which allocated a time to shoppers using an digital queuing app, were less busy. Some shops at the shopping complex had digital queues Shopper Dr Tesh Amarasinghe said she had her temperature checked with a thermal scanner and social distancing within the stores was ""excellent"", but she said there were difficulties maintaining the two-metre distancing in the outdoor walkways. The GP, from Northampton, said: ""It kind of took away the point of distancing in the shop, if you're standing in a queue up to an hour really close [to others].""

"The top court in the US has ruled that employers who fire workers for being gay or transgender are breaking the country's civil rights laws. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court said federal law, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, should be understood to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The ruling is a major win for LGBT workers and their allies. And it comes even though the court has become more conservative. Lawyers for the employers had argued that the authors of the 1964 Civil Rights Act had not intended it to apply to cases involving sexual orientation and gender identity. The Trump administration sided with that argument. But Judge Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated to the court by President Donald Trump, said acting against an employee on those grounds necessarily takes sex into account. ""An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,"" he wrote. Members of the LGBT community across the US were celebrating on hearing the news. Sean K Heslin, Palm Springs, California Today's Supreme Court ruling brought me to tears. As a gay man lucky enough to live in California and originally come from New York I've never had to personally worry about losing a job or not being hired simply because of my sexual orientation. But as a financial adviser working with clients all around the country for over 30 years, I've heard countless stories of people who have lost their jobs simply for being gay. It's angered and saddened me for so long. For years now, I have been speaking at seminars or with friends and family about how in this day and age it's still perfectly legal to fire someone just because they're gay. Many people didn't believe me. Until today. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as gender, race, colour, national origin and religion. Under the Obama administration, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the anti-discrimination law, said it included gender identity and sexual orientation. But the Trump administration has moved to roll back some protections in healthcare and other areas. While some states in the US had already explicitly extended such protections to LGBT workers, many have not. It's difficult to overstate the significance of the decision. While the court is establishing a long history of decisions expanding gay rights, this is the first time it spoke directly about the legal protections for transgender individuals. That the ruling comes out just days after the Trump administration announced it was removing transgender health-insurance protections only puts the issue in stark relief. Transgender rights is becoming a political battlefield, and a majority of the Supreme Court just announced which side it's on. Read more here LGBT advocates hailed the decision as the end of people hiding their sexuality at work. ""Especially at a time when the Trump administration is rolling back the rights of transgender people and anti-transgender violence continues to plague our nation, this decision is a step towards affirming the dignity of transgender people and all LGBTQ people,"" said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD. Protests outside court last year The American Civil Liberties Union shared a prepared statement from transgender plaintiff Aimee Stephens, who died last month. Her case was the first major transgender civil rights case heard by America's top court. ""I am glad the court recognised that what happened to me is wrong and illegal,"" Ms Stephens said. ""I am thankful that the court said my transgender siblings and I have a place in our laws - it made me feel safer and more included in our society."" But the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian non-profit that asked the court to hear Ms Stephens' case, said it was disappointed in the ruling. It warned it would ""create chaos and enormous unfairness for women and girls in athletics, women's shelters and many other contexts"". In his opinion, Mr Gorsuch said such matters were not before the court. ""The only question before us is whether an employer who fires someone for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual 'because of such individual's sex',"" he wrote. The teenagers behind Virtual Pride 'I'm stuck in isolation with my homophobic parents' The answer, he said, was ""clear"" - even if such a scenario had not been anticipated when the law was written. ""It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex,"" he wrote. Three conservative justices opposed the ruling: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh. The ruling resolves three cases brought by people who said they had been fired after their employers learned they were gay or transgender. Ms Stephens had previously presented as a man at work for six years before writing a letter to colleagues saying she would return to work ""as my true self, Aimee Australia Stephens, in appropriate business attire"". Two weeks later, Ms Stephens was fired for insisting in working in women's clothes. In a court filing last year, the funeral home owner argued it wanted Ms Stephens to comply with a dress code ""applicable to Stephens' biological sex"". A lower court sided with Ms Stephens. This video can not be played A taxi service trying to keep trans people safe Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor from New York who died in a skydiving accident in 2014, had filed one of the other cases. He was dismissed after joking with a female client with whom he was tandem-diving not to worry about the close physical contact because he was ""100% gay"". The company maintained he was fired because he shared personal information with a client, not because he was gay, but a court in New York ruled in Mr Zarda's favour.

"Shopper Adam Marlow said Bicester Village was ""way too overcrowded"" More than three thousand people have signed a petition calling for Bicester Village to temporarily close after hundreds of people were pictured at the shopping complex. Pictures on social media appear to show people struggling to maintain social distancing at the designer retail outlet in Bicester, Oxfordshire. The petition is calling for it to be closed until changes are made. Value Retail, which runs the complex, has been contacted for comment. All shops in England are now allowed to open, but with strict safety measures. Laura Wicks, who launched the petition, wrote she was ""disgusted to see hundreds of people squashed into the street like Coronavirus never happened"" and called for the complex to keep their staff safe. Bicester Village reopened to the public on Monday The complex, which has 160 shops, said on its website visitors are temperature-scanned on arrival and they should keep a two-metre distance apart. Shopper Adam Galbraith said keeping two metres was fine in the shops, but it was not being enforced ""well enough"" outside the shops at the luxury retail outlet. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""It was definitely way too overcrowded to adhere to social distancing. ""For a complex of that size they should know how many people can be in this place safely and keep two metres distance, and that for me wasn't monitored at all. ""What would have been better if they had the queues to get into the village outside, and gave customers a two-hour slot to do their shopping."" He added queues outside the shops, which allocated a time to shoppers using an digital queuing app, were less busy. Some shops at the shopping complex had digital queues Shopper Dr Tesh Amarasinghe said she had her temperature checked with a thermal scanner and social distancing within the stores was ""excellent"", but she said there were difficulties maintaining the two-metre distancing in the outdoor walkways. The GP, from Northampton, said: ""It kind of took away the point of distancing in the shop, if you're standing in a queue up to an hour really close [to others].""

"Health workers have been testing Beijing residents to try to contain the outbreak The Chinese capital Beijing has put more neighbourhoods under lockdown and boosted testing as it tries to contain an outbreak of coronavirus. There were 27 new cases reported on Tuesday, bringing the total to 106 people over five days. A Chinese official has described the new outbreak in the capital as ""extremely severe"". For more than seven weeks Beijing had only registered cases from people travelling in from abroad. New clusters of coronavirus are ""always a concern"", said Mike Ryan, emergencies programme head at the World Health Organization. ""But what we do like to see is an immediate response to that and comprehensive set of measures,"" he added. The fresh outbreak has been linked to the city's largest wholesale market, Xinfadi. Local media reports say the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at the market, prompting major supermarkets in Beijing to pull the fish from their shelves. The general manager of the market has been dismissed, along with other local officials. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters STRESS:How to look after your mental health In his comments though, the WHO's Mike Ryan was cautious about the source of the outbreak, saying the suggestion it was carried on salmon or its packaging was only a ""hypothesis"". Other health experts have pointed to cross-contamination as being a more likely cause. Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the virus strain found in Beijing did not resemble the type circulating across the rest of the country, and the WHO has urged China to share the genetic sequencing. The market was shut early on Saturday and restrictions imposed on nearby neighbourhoods. Residents living near the market have been told they can't leave the city. All taxis are also now banned from driving beyond the city limits. By Monday Beijing had set up nearly 200 testing sites and contacted about 200,000 people who had visited the market since the end of May, state news outlet Xinhua reported. Volunteers at security checkpoints tested residents' temperatures. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic The lockdown has also been extended to 21 residential compounds close to the market. Indoor sporting and entertainment venues across Beijing have been ordered to close, as have many schools. The concerns over a second outbreak come as Beijing attempts to return to normal life. China reported the first coronavirus cases last year, but new cases and infections have dropped drastically as hotspots have developed elsewhere in the world. Did China test a whole city in 10 days?

"This video can not be played Shoppers in England rush back to the High Street Demand across England's High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres surged on Monday as some shops reopened after a three-month lockdown. Research firm Springboard said that by 17:00, footfall was 38.8% higher than last week, as pent-up demand led to reports of long queues. However, shopper numbers were generally far below the same time last year. But at Bicester Village, near Oxford,crowding was so great that 3,000 people signed a petition to close it. All shops in England are now allowed to open, but with strict safety measures. ""Footfall has risen by more than we anticipated, but it was certainly helped by the weather, which made queuing a more pleasurable experience,"" said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard. Safety measures include plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers two metres apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Jaydee Darrock, from Warwickshire, was one of the first insidePrimark's Birmingham storeafter queuing from about 07:00. She described it as ""surprisingly calm"". ""We thought it would be chaotic, it's not, it's quite nice,"" she said. In pictures: Shops in England reopen Five ways shopping will be different from now on How to shop safely in a coronavirus pandemic There were also big queues outside the Nike store in Central London, although some complained there had been a lack of social distancing. In Manchester people waited for almost an hour outside Primark, TK Maxx and Foot Locker, although elsewhere demand was more subdued. Most shops - like this Primark in Birmingham - have been locked since 23 March Although food shops, pharmacies, banks and other essential retailers have stayed open, vast swathes of the High Street, from bookshops to clothes outlets, have been closed since 23 March. Springboard said footfall was likely to rise further in the coming weeks, but warned many shoppers still had concerns about other people not following the safety measures in stores and there being long queues to get in. Shantel Brown, 35, was shopping in Milton Keynes with her daughter Tee, who is 16. Shantel said: ""I bought nightwear and baby clothes because Primark was open. I'm pregnant and I've been waiting to get some baby stuff. ""Everyone keeps their distance. They've got sanitiser at the entrance. As long as we've got our masks on we're fine."" Tee added: ""I bought tops, shorts and summer clothes. I came because Mum forced me."" Greg Dulson, 68, was shopping for a new watch strap. ""The strap on my favourite watch broke and I brought it in to the watchmaker's the day before lockdown,"" he said. ""They said come back tomorrow, but it was closed!"" Katie Kirby, who is 18, was shopping with her 21-year-old boyfriend Zac Hopkins. ""I bought a jumpsuit because Primark was open and the weather's getting better again,"" said Katie. ""I did go just to get some essentials like pants and socks, but I when I saw the jumpsuit I had to treat myself because the shops haven't been open for so long."" ""We do keep our distance in the store. We thought it would be a different shopping experience but once we were in there it was just the same."" Zac Hopkins added: ""I bought a skipping rope, so I can do some exercise at home."" The first thing I bought when the shops reopened Business reporter Vivienne Nunis in Milton Keynes There were socially distant queues outside Zara, Primark and TK Maxx this morning and a steady crowd of shoppers are now browsing in the centre. Lots of young people are here, mothers with strollers and some older shoppers too. Some people are wearing masks, but not many. However, lots of stores remain closed and all the lights are off in the locked cafes and fast-food restaurants. The shoppers are mostly sticking to the new rules and staying socially distant - when they remember. Floor markings indicate a one-way system, every second toilet cubicle is closed, touch-screen maps have been powered down and seating areas are roped off. But apart from those changes - and a growing queue outside Primark - everything feels rather normal. HMV owner Doug Putman told the BBC's Today programme that he expected a rush in the first week of trading after his shops open their doors. But he said retailers could be faced with a problem if shoppers do not return in the same numbers as before the lockdown. ""If you've got the same cost structure to run the business but sales are down even 20% it makes a lot of companies unviable. ""We're being very hesitant, we believe that it is going to be a tough year."" This video can not be played Mary Portas: 'This is a window of opportunity for local High Streets' Other safety measures brought in by retailers include pleas not to touch items unless customers are thinking about buying them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use.

Furniture giant Ikeaopened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Many stores are encouraging customers to make purchases by contactless card payments, with limits increased to Â£45. London's West End, which includes Oxford Street, is expecting about 80% fewer visitors when it reopens on Monday. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body representing the sector, warned that the unlocking was unlikely to provide an immediate boost for the sector. It wants the government to help stimulate demand with a short-term cut in VAT or a temporary income tax cut for lower-income workers.

Relaxing the 2m social distancing rule will be key to reviving the economy, the hospitality industry says. Pubs and restaurants have warned that they cannot make money if customers are required to keep two-metres apart, and have urged that the distance limit be reduced to one metre.

"Asstores across England selling non-essential goods opened their doorsfor the first time since the lockdown began, shoppers arrived early to centre:mk in Milton Keynes.  Some were picking up goods they had been waiting months to buy, such as baby clothes and home furnishings. Others were here for the sales. These shoppers told us what they bought - and why. ""We bought lots of handbags for my wife, because she loves to buy bags from TK Maxx,"" says Paul Sabato, 56. ""We came today because it was the first day. After three months being closed - we knew there would be good sales and there are."" And Mr Sabato and his wife Jennifer Sabato, 44, have plans to return. ""We also bought some shoes and sunglasses. We spent Â£570 but this would be worth more than Â£1,000 normally. We're going to drop these bags at home then come back and see what sales there are at Zara."" ""We came to buy my daughter some new clothes for work because she starts a new job on Wednesday in the H&M warehouse,"" says Arlene Dela Pena, 53, out shopping with Jessica, 20. ""I'm not worried about the virus because I work in a hospital and as long as I have my mask and sanitise my hands and keep distant, then I think it will be safe."" ""We're here to buy clothes. There are some great bargains,"" says Sophie Quantick, 27. ""I got this dress for Â£20. We were here at 9.30. By the time we got to Zara there was a queue. It's like a theme park, you have to have a strategy."" ""We wanted to put on makeup and be normal and have a normal shopping experience, even though we have been buying online during the lockdown,"" says Bryony Martin, 29.  ""We have a rollercoaster mindset - what's the best shop? Go there first."" ""We wanted to buy home stuff like these cushions,"" says Ahmed Khan, 33, accompanied by wife Zainab, 28, and baby Mirha. ""We moved into our new home in January, then we went to Pakistan for my brother's wedding and when we came back in April all the shops were shut. ""We came today because it's the first day the shops are open. We were expecting sales and there have been. We could have bought online but it's not the same experience."" ""We came to buy summer clothes for the children. We went to Primark first but the queue was never ending so we went to H&M,"" says Erika Stara, 41, standing alongside her children Rebecca and Marco. ""I wanted to come today and get out and see people, and have some retail therapy."" ""The queue and the social distancing mean it feels different here,"" adds Rebecca, 12.

""I bought a jumpsuit because Primark was open and the weather's getting better again,"" says Katie Kirby, 18. ""I did go just to get some essentials like pants and socks, but I when I saw the jumpsuit I had to treat myself because the shops haven't been open for so long."" ""We do keep our distance in the store. We thought it would be a different shopping experience but once we were in there it was just the same."" Zac Hopkins, 21, adds: ""I bought a skipping rope so I can do some exercise at home. You can't go to the gym and they're sold out in lots of shops."" ""I came to Hugo Boss because I wanted to buy some tracksuits for my two brothers and the shops have been closed for three months,"" says Tom Hunjan, 34. ""I bought myself one too. They're similar to what I'm wearing, but in white. The shop didn't have them in though so they're ordering them for me and I'll come back in a few days. Why do I like Hugo Boss so much?

"About 6,000 people attended the two raves at Daisy Nook Country Park and Carrington at the weekend Two illegal ""quarantine raves"" at the weekend were ""almost impossible"" to stop after venues were changed at the last minute, a chief constable said. About6,000 peoplewent to raves at Daisy Nook Country Park, Failsworth, and Carrington, Greater Manchester. A 20-year-old man died of a suspected drug overdose at the Daisy Nook rave while a woman was raped and three people stabbed in Carrington. Greater Manchester Police's Ian Hopkins said some behaviour was ""appalling"". Both events late on Saturday were illegal under coronavirus restrictions but Greater Manchester Police restricted its involvement to what they called ""careful monitoring"". Both events were illegal under coronavirus restrictions An 18-year-old woman was raped and there were three separate stabbings at the Carrington site - one of which left an 18-year-old man with life-threatening injuries. The chief constable said: ""The location was changed and that made it very difficult [to stop]. ""Once these things start it is almost impossible to stop them given the number of people that were there and the number of officers available. ""It would have been very serious situation and many people, including my officers, would have been badly injured I believe."" He said that was why officers on the ground made the decision not to try to stop the gatherings. ""Some of the behaviour was appalling; some of this was not partying - this was people going out of their way to commit crime,"" he added. A raver at the Daisy Nook park event told BBC 5 Live he went after ""listening to guidelines for three months"". Matt, who did not give his surname, said: ""I've not been around a group of people in a long time so I thought I might as well this week. ""I just went for a good time."" When asked about the Covid-19 pandemic, the 22-year-old said: ""I'm not really scared of the virus but I don't know anyone who has had it so I didn't think of that."" Volunteers picked up between 350 to 400 bags of rubbish at site near Daisy Nook Country Park, says Mr Carroll Under current government guidelines for England,groups of up to six peoplefrom different households can gather outside in parks or private gardens. Paul Carroll, who lives near the Failsworth site, said: ""Police were passively driving up and down and occasionally moving people on but when you have 4,000 people and 20 to 30 police it was never going to be enforcement. ""I was still awake at three o'clock in the morning with people sniffing nitrous oxide gas on the garden wall, urinating and taxis coming and going."" This video can not be played Volunteers have been clearing up a ""sea of canisters"" and other litter after two illegal raves. DJ Judge Jules called for nightclubs to be reopened so people can go out in a safe environment. ""The fact is people are going to go out - let's just get the clubs and the nightlife industry open as soon as its possible because the industry is suffering immensely and the pent up demand is clearly there."" Kate Green MP for Stretford and Urmston condemned those who attended the two ""unsafe and irresponsible"" illegal raves saying it brought ""huge disruption"" to the local community, some serious injuries and was ""in complete contravention of social distancing rules"".

Savile Row tailors were among the shops opening - with a new sartorial addition As our live page draws to a close, this is a chance to catch up with the coronavirus news from the UK today. Here are the highlights from ourevening update:  Ahead of our pause in live coverage about the coronavirus pandemic, here's an update of developments from around the world: Next year's Oscars ceremony has been pushed back by two months, the latest major event to have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. The Academy Awards were due to take place on 28 February next yearbut have now been put back until 25 April. The pandemic has already halted work on a number of films that were due to be released by the end of the year. Organisers have also agreed to extend the cut-off date for Oscar-eligible films beyond 31 December 2020 to the end of February. Meanwhile, organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have announced the dates of next year's competitionfollowing the cancellation of this year's event. The semi-finals will take place on 18 and 20 May, followed by the grand final on 22 May. They will all be held in Rotterdam, where this year's event had been due to take place last month. With the end of the economic impact of coronavirus nowhere near in sight, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is making plans to extend economic aid. Ezekiel Elliott at a game in January Several NFL players for the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans  have tested positive for Covid-19,NFL Network,externalreports. Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliot is among the players with the virus, but is doing well, according to his agent. He recently made headlines, along with a number of other top football players, for a video criticising the league over its response to black rights issues that was released the day of African American George Floyd's funeral. Texans players were also given time off if they wished to attend the funeral service. None of the players were in team facilities, according to NFL Network, and the Cowboys and Texans have been following health protocols. The teams have not offered further details. NFL coaches and staff have started returning to facilities, but no players have yet done so. The league is still aiming to start its 2020 season in September, and is hopeful that training camps will happen before then. This month, Roger Goodell, NFL commissioner, sent teams guidelines on reopening, with rules addressing distancing, equipment cleaning, food service, and personal protective equipment requirements. The sunbeds are out in Benidorm There is some hopeful news for those in the UK who feel the need to head south for warmer weather. A spokesperson for the Spanish government has told the BBC that British travellers are âwelcome to travel to Spainâ from Sunday without facing quarantine measures or restrictions on arrival. It confirms a tweet posted earlier by the British embassy in Madrid, which said the UK had been included on the list of countries that will not face restrictions when Spain's borders reopen. Travellers returning to the UK will still have to self isolate for two weeks afterwards, however, and the UK government's official advice is still against any non-essential international travel.

Meanwhile, Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa said talks between the two countries on an ""air bridge"" were going well. The arrangement would allow UK visitors to avoid mandatory quarantine when they return home. ""We are working towards an agreement and will wait for it to happen,"" Costa told reporters. But he could not say when the air bridge might be in place. Government scientific and medical advisers were absent from the UK briefing today, but one, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has been speaking to football legend Ian Wright about the return of Premier League games this week. Prof Van-Tam says he is ""desperate to get back to the stadium"" of his beloved Boston United in Lincolnshire. But he cautions that it has to be done in a way that prevents transmission of the virus starting again - and that's why football's restart is limited to behind closed doors. ""Stay at home, watch the games at home, follow the rules,"" he says. Watch the full videobelow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Manager Brad Parscale said the ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, would be taking precautions for Covid-19 and the summer heat, including handing out masks and bottled water. And,as we reported earlier, those purchasing tickets for Trump's rally will have to sign a waiver confirming they ""voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19"" and will not hold the president's campaign responsible for ""any illness or injury"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters the campaign was making ""good"" decisions and that there was a ""recognition that there are guidelines in place that should be followed"". Health officials in the state have expressed concerns over the event, with Tulsa's health department chief sayinghe wished the rally would be postponed,external. Oklahoma has one of the country's lowest infection rates, and businesses are reopening, but the governor has urged residents to continue social distancing and minimise time in crowds.

Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor Food is more than twice as expensive as it was last year in Syria No-one knows exactly how much damage Syriaâs civil war
has done to the economy. One estimate is something like half a
trillion pounds ($630bn) worth of destruction. The pieces that remain are being battered by a new and
severe crisis. The result, says UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, is
that ""Syrians are hungry now en masse in a way which wasn't true one or
two years ago"". It is happening, he adds, as the economic
consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic start kicking in, not just in Syria but
across the world. ""What we're projecting globally is a doubling of the
people all across the planet who will be at starvation levels of hunger."" Read more:Assad under pressure as economic crisis batters Syria The government has released its latest figures and data on how the virus is affecting the UK. Here are graphs showing how the numbers are changing. You can find other key statistics - including how many cases there are in your area -here. Norway's health authorities have halted the roll-out of a coronavirus mobile phone app after it was criticised by the data protection authority. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) said it would delete all information collected so far, but warned that the move would weaken the fight against coronavirus. Norway's data protection authority (DPA) said on Friday that the potentially intrusive nature of the app Smittestopp (Infection stop) was not warranted, given the low rate of infection. About 1.5 million people downloaded it in the first week of its launch in April - more than a quarter of the population. The app is designed to show researchers where people are moving and to alert those who have been in contact with a Covid-19 carrier. ""We don't agree with the DPA's evaluation but feel it is necessary to delete all data and put work on hold as a result of
this,"" NIPH said in a statement. Read more: Contact-tracing apps face further hitches Social distancing rules mean only a quarter of students can be in school at once Secondary school students in England have begun to return to classes today - but how much time will they actually spend in school? A survey of 8,000 teachers suggests that 90% of their pupils will be in class for less than two days a week. Social distancing means schools can only accommodate a quarter of pupils in Years 10 and 12 at any one time, so different groups of students have to take turns to attend. Less than a third of schools are teaching all subject options, with most focusing on English, maths and science. Read the full story Testing has been increased in the area of the new outbreak in Beijing The World Health Organization says it expects China to share the full genetic sequence from the new coronavirus outbreak in Beijing with the rest of the world. Speaking in Geneva, head of health emergencies Dr Mike Ryan said it was expected as ""they have done in the past"". Beijing has seen a cluster of about 100 new cases of the virus, and is investigating the origins. Experts said the strain did not resemble the type found elsewhere in the country and genetic traces have suggested it could have originated in Europe. ""The finding that this may represent a strain more common in transmission in Europe is important and it may reflect
human-to-human transmission more than any other hypotheses,"" Dr Ryan said. Local media said the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at a market, leading to speculation that it was brought in on the fish or its packaging.
 
Dr Ryan said the safety of food and its packaging should be looked at but added that he was ""reticent"" to say all food packaging needed testing. The Duke of Cambridge has made a surprise video call to a woman and her young son who have been shielding for the past three months. Prince William spoke to Leanne and five-year-old Kaydyn, who has cystic fibrosis, at their home in Corby, Northamptonshire. Footage of the call will feature on BBC One's The One Show at 19:00 on Tuesday.
Leanne was shown covering her mouth with her hands in shock as the duke called from his home in Norfolk. Last week, the Duke of Cambridge revealed he had been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. You can read more about his callhere. Iran's daily death count is more than 100 once again, raising alarm from the authorities Iran has warned it may have to reimpose strict measures against the coronavirus, as it reported more than 100 deaths for a second day running. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said there had been 113 new fatalities, taking the official death toll to 8,950 since Iran's outbreak began in February. She said a further 2,449 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. Iran started to relax its lockdown in mid-April after infections declined but has since seen a surge. There have also been concerns the official figures do not reflect the full extent of deaths and infections. On Monday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei criticised the lack of social distancing by people at holy sites and on public transport. ""In the [Tehran] subway, although 90% of passengers use masks, social distancing is not being observed,"" he said. ""If we find that the spread of the virus is out of control... then we will definitely apply strict decisions again."" A bargain dress or a new watchstrap - what do you really need after three months? As the coronavirus lockdown was eased further in England, queues formed outside many shops before they opened for the first time since March. Industry data shows the number of visitors to high streets, shopping centres and retail parks was up by almost half this morning, compared with last week -  but the levels were still far below the same period last year. Retailers have had to introduce strict safety measures such as plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Many shoppers seem confident in the measures being taken and were keen for a bargain - we spoke to some about their experiences and their first purchases and you can read about thathere. In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland.  The state is moving forward with its reopening process New York's death toll and total number of people sent to hospital due to Covid-19 have both fallen to the lowest points since the crisis began. On Monday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said this weekend had the fewest deaths on a three-day average since March. The number of positive tests has also continued to decline. Twenty-five people died of the virus on Sunday and there were just over 1,600 residents requiring hospital treatment for Covid-19 over the weekend. ""The facts are that new York is on the right track,"" he said, though noted it was unlikely the numbers would hit zero. ""It's coming down to what the doctor certifies as the cause of death, many people who pass away because of Covid have other underlying conditions."" The report comes as parts of the state enter the third phase of reopening; gatherings of up to 25 people will be allowed, up from 10, and many businesses are back open. But the governor also called out businesses and residents ignoring social distancing measures, saying the state had received 25,000 complaints of violations. The latest UK unemployment figures are due to be published by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow but several companies have announced plans to cut jobs today. Wickes owner Travis Perkins, the UK's biggest builders' merchant,plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. The group says it expects a UK recession to hit demand for building materials this year and in 2021. Jaguar Land Rover is set to cut up to 1,100 temporary jobs from its factory floors after it reported a Â£501m loss in the final quarter of its financial year. And75 jobs are under threat at the Titanic Belfast visitor centre, the BBC understands. The company has started a consultation over the potential redundancies. Frank KeoghBBC Sport Royal Ascot starts on Tuesday - but the famous British horse racing meeting will have a very different feel this year. The action will take place behind closed doors amid strict safety protocols because of the coronavirus pandemic - jockeys must undergo temperature checks and wear face masks. And while the fixture retains its regal title and branding, the Queen will not be in attendance for the first time in her 68-year reign. She is expected to watch television coverage from Windsor Castle. Racehorse owners are not allowed at the Berkshire track but will have access to a 360-degree live camera feed of runners in the parade ring, while people are being encouraged to wear a hat and dress up at home.

"The top court in the US has ruled that employers who fire workers for being gay or transgender are breaking the country's civil rights laws. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court said federal law, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, should be understood to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The ruling is a major win for LGBT workers and their allies. And it comes even though the court has become more conservative. Lawyers for the employers had argued that the authors of the 1964 Civil Rights Act had not intended it to apply to cases involving sexual orientation and gender identity. The Trump administration sided with that argument. But Judge Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated to the court by President Donald Trump, said acting against an employee on those grounds necessarily takes sex into account. ""An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,"" he wrote. Members of the LGBT community across the US were celebrating on hearing the news. Sean K Heslin, Palm Springs, California Today's Supreme Court ruling brought me to tears. As a gay man lucky enough to live in California and originally come from New York I've never had to personally worry about losing a job or not being hired simply because of my sexual orientation. But as a financial adviser working with clients all around the country for over 30 years, I've heard countless stories of people who have lost their jobs simply for being gay. It's angered and saddened me for so long. For years now, I have been speaking at seminars or with friends and family about how in this day and age it's still perfectly legal to fire someone just because they're gay. Many people didn't believe me. Until today. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as gender, race, colour, national origin and religion. Under the Obama administration, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the anti-discrimination law, said it included gender identity and sexual orientation. But the Trump administration has moved to roll back some protections in healthcare and other areas. While some states in the US had already explicitly extended such protections to LGBT workers, many have not. It's difficult to overstate the significance of the decision. While the court is establishing a long history of decisions expanding gay rights, this is the first time it spoke directly about the legal protections for transgender individuals. That the ruling comes out just days after the Trump administration announced it was removing transgender health-insurance protections only puts the issue in stark relief. Transgender rights is becoming a political battlefield, and a majority of the Supreme Court just announced which side it's on. Read more here LGBT advocates hailed the decision as the end of people hiding their sexuality at work. ""Especially at a time when the Trump administration is rolling back the rights of transgender people and anti-transgender violence continues to plague our nation, this decision is a step towards affirming the dignity of transgender people and all LGBTQ people,"" said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD. Protests outside court last year The American Civil Liberties Union shared a prepared statement from transgender plaintiff Aimee Stephens, who died last month. Her case was the first major transgender civil rights case heard by America's top court. ""I am glad the court recognised that what happened to me is wrong and illegal,"" Ms Stephens said. ""I am thankful that the court said my transgender siblings and I have a place in our laws - it made me feel safer and more included in our society."" But the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian non-profit that asked the court to hear Ms Stephens' case, said it was disappointed in the ruling. It warned it would ""create chaos and enormous unfairness for women and girls in athletics, women's shelters and many other contexts"". In his opinion, Mr Gorsuch said such matters were not before the court. ""The only question before us is whether an employer who fires someone for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual 'because of such individual's sex',"" he wrote. The teenagers behind Virtual Pride 'I'm stuck in isolation with my homophobic parents' The answer, he said, was ""clear"" - even if such a scenario had not been anticipated when the law was written. ""It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex,"" he wrote. Three conservative justices opposed the ruling: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh. The ruling resolves three cases brought by people who said they had been fired after their employers learned they were gay or transgender. Ms Stephens had previously presented as a man at work for six years before writing a letter to colleagues saying she would return to work ""as my true self, Aimee Australia Stephens, in appropriate business attire"". Two weeks later, Ms Stephens was fired for insisting in working in women's clothes. In a court filing last year, the funeral home owner argued it wanted Ms Stephens to comply with a dress code ""applicable to Stephens' biological sex"". A lower court sided with Ms Stephens. This video can not be played A taxi service trying to keep trans people safe Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor from New York who died in a skydiving accident in 2014, had filed one of the other cases. He was dismissed after joking with a female client with whom he was tandem-diving not to worry about the close physical contact because he was ""100% gay"". The company maintained he was fired because he shared personal information with a client, not because he was gay, but a court in New York ruled in Mr Zarda's favour. Gerald Bostock, a former child welfare services co-ordinator from Georgia, lost his job after joining a gay recreational softball league, thereby publicly revealing his sexual orientation. His employer, Clayton County, said his dismissal was the result of ""conduct unbecoming of a county employee"". Mr Bostock lost his discrimination case in a federal court in Atlanta.

"This video can not be played The PM says the EU and UK are ânot actually that far apartâ UK and EU leaders have said new momentum is needed in negotiations on their future relationship, after high-level talks on Monday. The PM, who met EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen virtually, said there was a ""very good"" chance of getting a trade deal by December. He said he saw no reason why it cannot be ""done in July"", after the sides agreed to intensify talks next month. Mrs von der Leyen said they ""agreed to deliver the best deal"" for citizens. The EU also noted the UK's decision not to extend the transition period, which ends in December. Kuenssberg: Metaphors abound as talks get more urgent What are the sticking points in the trade talks? Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? In a joint statement issued after Monday's meeting via video conference, the UK and EU ""welcomed the constructive discussions on the future relationship that had taken place"". ""The parties agreed nevertheless that new momentum was required,"" it said. The high-level meeting was via video link They have agreed to intensify talks in July, and to find an ""early understanding on the principles"" underlying any deal. The UK government has said the talks in July will involve a mix of formal negotiating rounds and smaller group meetings in London and Brussels, if coronavirus guidelines allow. Mr Johnson said the EU and the UK were ""not that far apart"" with regards to the future relationship, but he added that ""a bit of oomph"" was needed in the talks. Calling on the EU to ""put a tiger in the tank"", the prime minister said the chances of getting a trade deal by the end of the year were ""very good"", provided both sides focus now and ""get on and do it"". Asked what the cut-off date would be by which the UK government will give business certainty of what they can expect, Mr Johnson said he saw no reason why it cannot be ""done in July"". ""I certainly don't want to see it going on until the Autumn/Winter as I think perhaps in Brussels they would like. I don't see any point in that so let's get it done."" European Council President Charles Michel, who joined Mrs von der Leyen on the call along with European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli, said a ""broad and ambitious agreement"" was ""in our mutual interest"".

Downing Street earlier said Mr Johnson would reiterate that the UK's ambition is for a high quality free trade agreement consistent with others the EU have agreed. Mr Johnson was also due to make clear that the UK is ready to start trading on World Trade Organisation rules from 1 January if a deal cannot be reached. This was Boris Johnson's first meeting with EU leaders since trade negotiations started back in March. So, did we have an ""aha moment""? A glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel of deadlocked talks? Well, not exactly. But this was always going to be a stocktaking moment, rather than high level negotiation. The EU was buoyed to hear the prime minister express commitment to finding a deal. And while Brussels privately regards as unrealistic, the UK aim of having the outline of that deal in place by the end of the summer, EU insiders say negotiators will try everything to find agreement as soon as possible. You wouldn't expect them to say anything less. But notably absent from today's declarations was to what extent each side is willing to compromise. And that, of course, will be key. Without some concessions, from both sides, today's high-level declaration of intent to reach an EU-UK deal, is rather empty. But a French former Europe minister has said the EU is preparing itself for a no-deal Brexit. MEP Nathalie Loiseau told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are ready either for an agreement or for a no-deal and we are getting prepared more actively to a no-deal considering the circumstances. ""We believe it is possible to have an agreement - it has to be ready in October so that parliaments on both sides can ratify it. ""We believe it is possible because we have the political declaration which we negotiated together, signed together and should respect together - so, yes, the framework is here."" UK backtracks on full EU border checks post-Brexit Which countries does the UK do the most trade with? Monday's virtual meeting comes after EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said there had been ""no significant areas of progress"" at the last negotiating round earlier this month. Likewise his UK counterpart David Frost had said progress ""remains limited,"" and negotiators were ""reaching the limits"" of what could be achieved in formal talks. Differences between the two sides remain on fisheries, competition rules, police co-operation, and how a deal would be enforced. Meanwhile, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson and Emmanuel Macron will meet in London on Thursday. The French president will travel to London to attend official commemorations of 80th anniversary of General Charles de Gaulle's appeal to the French population to resist the German occupation of France during the Second World War.

"The plan will see pubs, along with hotels and cafes, open sooner than originally anticipated Northern Ireland's hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from 3 July, the Stormont Executive has confirmed. Hotels in NIhad been given an indicative date of 20 Julyfor reopening - but the tourism sector had pressed for an earlier date. Self-catering accommodation such as caravans can also open from 26 June. First Minister Arlene Foster said the moves will only go ahead if the spread of the virus remains low. Many in the tourism and hospitality industries had been calling for the date of 20 July to be brought forward, after the Irish government said the sectors in the Republic of Ireland could reopen on 29 June. It means Northern Ireland becomes the first part of the UK to announce such changes to its coronavirus regulations. Stormont's Economy Minister Diane Dodds, who had lobbied for an earlier date, described the move as a ""good day for the Northern Ireland economy"". ""It's a good day for tourism and hospitality, and in particular a sector that has been incredibly hard hit by the lockdown."" She stressed that the plans were dependent on the transmission of the virus. The decision came as it was announced that no new coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in Northern Ireland on Sunday. The Department of Health's death toll, which relates mostly to deaths in hospitals, remains at 541. Bars in Belfast have been shut since the start of the pandemic in March Caravan parks, camping sites and self-catering tourist accommodation can reopen on 26 June - next Friday. From 3 July, hotels will be permitted to open, but spas and leisure facilities within them will not be able to open. From this date, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops can also resume trading. Pubs and bars will also be allowed to trade, but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Those pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors. Visitor attractions such as museums, and cultural heritage sites can reopen from 3 July as well. The first and deputy first ministers stressed that social distancing rules must be adhered to by all those businesses seeking to reopen. The Executive also agreed to continue reviewing the 2m (6ft) social distancing requirement. It is estimated the hospitality industry employs 65,000 jobs in Northern Ireland and is worth Â£2bn annually. Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said Monday's decision marked a ""significant milestone in what will be a long and challenging path to rebuild our hospitality sector"". ""Operating under the restrictions will not be easy and we recognise that many businesses will still be unable to reopen,"" he said. ""But we welcome the minister's comments to bring forward proposals on reopening these parts of the industry in due course."" Janice Gault, the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, said the earlier date would give the tourism sector an opportunity to trade over the summer season. ""Today's new date also puts Northern Ireland on a similar trajectory to the Republic of Ireland, and will allow us to compete on an all-island basis and hopefully, as transport links improve, in the Great Britain market as well,"" she added. Speaking at the executive's daily press briefing on Monday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill rejected suggestions that ministers had not made childcare a priority in their recovery plan. Further work must be done to facilitate childcare for parents who will now be expected to return to work, she added. Q&A: What are the guidelines on childcare now? Currently childcare is only available for vulnerable children, or those of key workers. Mrs Foster said the executive had agreed to extend the definition of a key worker to include people working in manufacturing and construction. This video can not be played What does the ease in restrictions mean for people in Northern Ireland? ""It very much is at the top our agenda now because there is a recognition we need to support the sector in tangible ways,"" she said. Mrs Foster also said the executive had agreed to adopt a ""graduated approach"" to extending the so-called bubble model. Ministers hope to announce a date within the next fortnight to allow two households to form a support unit, she added. At present,only single adults in Northern Irelandcan form a bubble with one other household. Ms O'Neill said the executive was due to officially review the regulations on Thursday. ""We'd be hopeful that following that executive meeting, we'll be in a position to come forward with some more good news of other sectors as per our plan, so for example, our hairdressers and our barbers and looking to give indicative dates there also."" The first and deputy first ministers initially published a recovery blueprint without indicative dates, but have said they want to move away from that, where it is possible to do so. The Department of Health has confirmed the R number of the virus in Northern Ireland remains at between 0.5 and 0.9. R is the number of people each infected person, on average, passes the virus on to and it has been at the heart of Stormont's decision making. The goal is to keep R under one. On Sunday,the department also released the scientific data,externalbehind how they calculate the number and other estimates on how prevalent the infection currently is in Northern Ireland. Less than 5% of the population have recovered from Covid-19 and have detectable antibodies, the department suggests. That means ""any subsequent waves of the epidemic have the potential to be significantly worse"" than the current outbreak, according to the department's update. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented?

"Shops across England selling non-essential goods are welcoming back customers from today as the unlocking of the High Street begins. Thousands of of people queue outside of Primark stores across England Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to ""shop with confidence"". Retailers are required to introduce plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers two metres (6ft 5ins) apart. Updates on Monday, 15 June Jennifer Meierhans, Jay Vydelingum, Rob England and Chris Heard Rob EnglandBBC News We've seen joy and frustration from shoppers, and queues, lots of queues, as retailers across England reopened for the first time since lockdown began in March. But, as all things must, our live coverage has come to an end for the day. Join us again tomorrow morning at 07:30 for all the latest coronavirus news and updates. Stay safe. Here's the view from across England as non-essential shops opened today for the first time since lockdown began in March. London: Birmingham: Southampton: It is the first day in nearly three months that shops selling non-essential goods, such as clothing and electronics, have been allowed to open. Here's a quick roundup of what the first day of shopping looked like: This video can not be played Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit With millions of workers on furlough and workplaces closed
due to lockdown, bosses across many industries stopped hiring. According to analysis by the Office for National Statistics,
the volume of job adverts posted in the last month is less than half the average
for 2019. Catering and hospitality and manufacturing have seen
the biggest slumps â down to 18% and 21% of their average for last year. Retail and
wholesale job adverts have also fallen to below a quarter of last year's average. The ONS compiled the figures by analysing the jobs website
Adzuna. Rob EnglandBBC News As people joinedqueues outside many shops across England, what were they looking to buy after three months of lockdown? Retailer John Lewis reported the first products sold at the two stores it reopened today was a china tea set, in Kingston, and an iPhone 11, at its Poole store in Dorset. Today's top sellers included buttons, face masks, towels, sofas, egg cups and baby sleepsuits. The company said,externalthe popularity of buttons appeared to be down to the items being used in conjunction with face masks to stop the elastic straps rubbing behind the ears. They are also thought to have been wanted by people who have taken up sewing and knitting during lockdown, requiring buttons for their handmade goods. Other popular items sold on Monday were pillowcases and bed sheets, televisions and printer cartridges, it added. Rob EnglandBBC News Despite a good start for shops on Monday, social distancing rules must be relaxed or thousands of jobs could be at risk, a retail boss has said. It comes as non-essential stores complying with government coronavirus guidelineswelcomed customers for the first time since lockdown began. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive at New West End Company - a partnership of 600 retail, restaurant, hotel and property owners - said: ""The businesses that have opened have a nice customer trade coming in, people are queueing, which is very good."" Mr Tyrrell added that the two-metre (6ft) rule could cause up to 50,000 jobs to be at risk if it stayed in place due to loss of sales. ""There's no doubt this year will be one of the most challenging ever we have experienced in retail in the West End,"" he said. ""If we don't address social distancing and the international quarantine, we could easily see over 50,000 job losses here... alone. We could lose about Â£5 billion in sales, so of course it is going to be a long recovery."" Marc Ashdown From tiny traders to billion
pound behemoths, the lockdown saw businesses across London plunged into a
sudden deep freeze. Now the task of reviving
them from hibernation begins. Itâs not as simple as
flinging the doors open and welcoming a shop full of eager customers once
again. There are serious questions for shops of all shapes and sizes around how
to keep staff and customers safe, but also how viable they genuinely can be in
this radically different trading climate. For Londonâs beleaguered
smaller high streets, those who survive the thaw may actually see a boost in
trade. Bargain offers could whet the appetite, as long as social distancing
measures convince shoppers to venture out. But with the message to
avoid public transport still ringing loud and clear, a walk down the local
parade or town centre may seem a much more attractive proposition now than
kitting the family in masks and dragging them to the West End for a day out. The trick will be balance
and flexibility. The balance between the
shopper experience and safety will be delicate and needs to be attractive
enough to entice people in. So queuing systems, protective equipment and
distancing has to be managed in a sensible way to maintain confidence and
enjoyment. But if it all starts to go
wrong, those who show the flexibility to adapt and change things up quickly
will have a better chance of surviving and even thriving. Shantel Brown, 35, was shopping in Milton Keynes with her daughter Tee, who is 16. Shantel said: ""I bought nightwear and baby clothes because Primark was open. I'm pregnant and I've been waiting to get some baby stuff. ""Everyone keeps their distance. They've got sanitiser at the entrance. As long as we've got our masks on we're fine."" Tee added: ""I bought tops, shorts and summer clothes. I came because mum forced me."" Greg Dulson, 68, was shopping for a new watch strap. ""The strap on my favourite watch broke and I brought it in to the watchmaker's the day before lockdown,"" he said. ""They said come back tomorrow, but it was closed!"" Katie Kirby, who is 18, was shopping with her 21-year-old boyfriend Zac Hopkins.

James DawsonBBC Yorkshire As thousands of people head back to high streets across the country for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic started, I've been speaking to shoppers in Leeds. Bertran Hardy and Lauryn
Wiley (pictured above), both 18, have been out shopping in Leeds today while trying to maintain social
distance from each other. ""How theyâve done it is really
[good], how everything is socially distanced,â Bertran said of the re-opened stores. âI like that all the shops have got
hand sanitiser. It think itâs good to get the economy going again.â Lauryn added that the pair have
âavoided the queuesâ by shopping at quieter retailers. Bertran also says he now feels less
worried about coronavirus than he did at the beginning of lockdown. âAs the measures have become less
strict, everyoneâs forgotten about it and itâs now less of a worry,"" he

"The top court in the US has ruled that employers who fire workers for being gay or transgender are breaking the country's civil rights laws. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court said federal law, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, should be understood to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The ruling is a major win for LGBT workers and their allies. And it comes even though the court has become more conservative. Lawyers for the employers had argued that the authors of the 1964 Civil Rights Act had not intended it to apply to cases involving sexual orientation and gender identity. The Trump administration sided with that argument. But Judge Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated to the court by President Donald Trump, said acting against an employee on those grounds necessarily takes sex into account. ""An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,"" he wrote. Members of the LGBT community across the US were celebrating on hearing the news. Sean K Heslin, Palm Springs, California Today's Supreme Court ruling brought me to tears. As a gay man lucky enough to live in California and originally come from New York I've never had to personally worry about losing a job or not being hired simply because of my sexual orientation. But as a financial adviser working with clients all around the country for over 30 years, I've heard countless stories of people who have lost their jobs simply for being gay. It's angered and saddened me for so long. For years now, I have been speaking at seminars or with friends and family about how in this day and age it's still perfectly legal to fire someone just because they're gay. Many people didn't believe me. Until today. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as gender, race, colour, national origin and religion. Under the Obama administration, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the anti-discrimination law, said it included gender identity and sexual orientation. But the Trump administration has moved to roll back some protections in healthcare and other areas. While some states in the US had already explicitly extended such protections to LGBT workers, many have not. It's difficult to overstate the significance of the decision. While the court is establishing a long history of decisions expanding gay rights, this is the first time it spoke directly about the legal protections for transgender individuals. That the ruling comes out just days after the Trump administration announced it was removing transgender health-insurance protections only puts the issue in stark relief. Transgender rights is becoming a political battlefield, and a majority of the Supreme Court just announced which side it's on. Read more here LGBT advocates hailed the decision as the end of people hiding their sexuality at work. ""Especially at a time when the Trump administration is rolling back the rights of transgender people and anti-transgender violence continues to plague our nation, this decision is a step towards affirming the dignity of transgender people and all LGBTQ people,"" said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD. Protests outside court last year The American Civil Liberties Union shared a prepared statement from transgender plaintiff Aimee Stephens, who died last month. Her case was the first major transgender civil rights case heard by America's top court. ""I am glad the court recognised that what happened to me is wrong and illegal,"" Ms Stephens said. ""I am thankful that the court said my transgender siblings and I have a place in our laws - it made me feel safer and more included in our society."" But the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian non-profit that asked the court to hear Ms Stephens' case, said it was disappointed in the ruling. It warned it would ""create chaos and enormous unfairness for women and girls in athletics, women's shelters and many other contexts"". In his opinion, Mr Gorsuch said such matters were not before the court. ""The only question before us is whether an employer who fires someone for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual 'because of such individual's sex',"" he wrote. The teenagers behind Virtual Pride 'I'm stuck in isolation with my homophobic parents' The answer, he said, was ""clear"" - even if such a scenario had not been anticipated when the law was written. ""It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex,"" he wrote. Three conservative justices opposed the ruling: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh. The ruling resolves three cases brought by people who said they had been fired after their employers learned they were gay or transgender. Ms Stephens had previously presented as a man at work for six years before writing a letter to colleagues saying she would return to work ""as my true self, Aimee Australia Stephens, in appropriate business attire"". Two weeks later, Ms Stephens was fired for insisting in working in women's clothes. In a court filing last year, the funeral home owner argued it wanted Ms Stephens to comply with a dress code ""applicable to Stephens' biological sex"". A lower court sided with Ms Stephens. This video can not be played A taxi service trying to keep trans people safe Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor from New York who died in a skydiving accident in 2014, had filed one of the other cases. He was dismissed after joking with a female client with whom he was tandem-diving not to worry about the close physical contact because he was ""100% gay"". The company maintained he was fired because he shared personal information with a client, not because he was gay, but a court in New York ruled in Mr Zarda's favour. Gerald Bostock, a former child welfare services co-ordinator from Georgia, lost his job after joining a gay recreational softball league, thereby publicly revealing his sexual orientation. His employer, Clayton County, said his dismissal was the result of ""conduct unbecoming of a county employee"". Mr Bostock lost his discrimination case in a federal court in Atlanta.

"The memorial for PC Keith Palmer was unveiled outside Parliament in 2018 A man has been jailed for urinating at the Westminster memorial dedicated to PC Keith Palmer. Andrew Banks, 28, of Stansted, Essex, was photographed during Saturday's right-wing protests in London. He was sentenced to 14 days in custody, after pleading guilty to outraging public decency at Westminster Magistrates' Court. PC Palmer, 48, was stabbed while on duty during the Westminster attack on 22 March 2017. He was one of five people murdered by Khalid Masood. Andrew Banks had not slept the night before the incident, the court heard The image of Banks was widely shared on social media on Saturday asviolent clashes between far-right protesters and policetook place in central London. Banks, a Tottenham Hotspur fan, said he had travelled to central London with other football supporters to ""protect statues"", but admitted he did not know which statues. He was said to have drunk 16 pints during Friday night into Saturday morning, and had not been to sleep. Banks contacted police after being confronted by his father, the court heard. Jailing Banks, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said: ""I accept you were drunk and did not know where you were urinating. ""Your explanation is you had 16 pints to drink, you hadn't been to bed, and a group of football supporters were coming up to protect the monuments. ""The irony is rather than protecting the monuments, you almost urinated on one. That was more by luck than judgment."" PC Keith Palmer was unarmed as he was attacked by Khalid Masood His counsel Stuart Harris said his client was ""ashamed by his action"", and had mental health issues. The act was widely condemned at the time by politicians including MP Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to PC Palmer as he lay dying in the grounds of Parliament. Met Police Cdr Bas Javid said: ""Keith Palmer was a brave police officer and the memorial stands testament to his courage. ""Banks' actions, in stark contrast, were unpleasant and extremely upsetting to PC Palmer's family and colleagues. ""While I note that Banks did not act with intent, I welcome the sentence handed down by the court for his thoughtless and distasteful behaviour.""

"Ikea has said it is planning to repay salaries paid by governments around the world under furlough schemes. It is set to repay nine governments, including the US and Ireland. However, it does not include the UK as although the furniture chain furloughed 10,000 UK workers it did not claim back their salaries from the government. Other firms are also refunding furlough pay, with Games Workshop and the Spectator magazine both saying they will repay the UK government. Governments across the globe have set up schemes to pay workers who could not do their jobs because of the lockdowns that were designed to control the spread of coronavirus. In the UK, furloughed workers are being paid 80% of their pay under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? UK furlough scheme extended by four months Ikea said it started the lockdown by paying 90% of wages for workers it furloughed. In the UK  it said: ""We furloughed around 10,000 co-workers in the UK. At such an uncertain time, we had initially anticipated putting a number of co-workers on furlough under the job retention scheme. However, we did not claim for or accept any money under the job retention scheme, and we will not be doing so."" Now that stores are re-opening, it says it does not plan to take any more government money from the countries where it had availed itself of government support: ""Although no one knows how things will continue to develop, or what the impact on our business or the economy will be, we are feeling more hopeful and clearer about the decisions we need to take for the future,"" Ikea said in a statement. The countries in which it received support are Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain and the US,the Financial Times reported.,external On Friday, Games Workshop  - the company that makes Warhammer toy soldiers - said it would aim to repay furlough money after sales recovered by more than it had expected.

"This video can not be played Man Utd's Rashford speaks about mother's sacrifices in his bid to end food poverty Marcus Rashford has called on the government to reverse a decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, saying that ""the system isn't built for families like mine to succeed"". The Manchester United and England forward has raised aboutÂ£20m to supply three million mealsto vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. Campaigners have threatened to bringlegal action against the governmentfor not extending the food voucher scheme into the summer holidays. In an emotional open letter to MPs drawing on his own experiences of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up, Rashford said his story is ""all too familiar for families in England"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast about the letter, Rashford, 22, said: ""It's written from the heart and it's about how my life was at the moment - the letter is to open up and let people understand the impact on families and to know I've done the right thing. ""What families are going through now, I've once had to go through that - and it's very difficult to find a way out. It's very important for me to help people who are struggling. Whether the outcome changes or doesn't change - that's why I wrote it."" In England, about 1.3 million children from low income backgrounds are eligible for free school meals. To qualify, their household must earn a maximum income of Â£7,400 a year after tax, not including any benefits. The full criteria is listedhere.,external A child who qualifies remains eligible until 31 March 2022, whether in primary or secondary education. Children from families who meet certain criteria can also be eligible for free school meals before they start school. During the pandemic,the government says,externalit expects schools to continue to support eligible children in term time. This includes: Food parcels A national voucher scheme Vouchers for a local shop or supermarket This provision included the Easter and May half-term holidays, but the voucher schemes will not run during the summer holidays. In Wales, the government will provide free school meal vouchers until schools reopen, or at least until the end of August In the letter, Rashford wrote: ""My mum worked full-time, earning the minimum wage, to make sure we always had a good evening meal on the table, but it was not enough. ""The system was not built for families like mine to succeed, regardless of how hard my mum worked."" Rashford added his plea for the government to ""make the U-turn and make protecting the lives of some of our most vulnerable a top priority"" was ""not about politics"" but about ""humanity"". He added that it was about ""looking at ourselves in the mirror and feeling like we did everything we could to protect those who can't, for whatever reason or circumstance, protect themselves"". The Department for Education confirmed the scheme would not run during summer holidays: ""As schools open more widely, and their kitchens reopen, we expect schools to make food parcels available for collection or delivery for any children that are eligible for free school meals who are not yet able to return to school. Where this is not possible, schools can continue to offer vouchers to eligible pupils. The spokesperson also pointed to the new Â£63m local authority welfare assistance scheme to support the most vulnerable families, and its Holiday Activities and Food programme, which offers activities and free meals in the summer holidays. Families claiming free school meals have been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card - worth Â£15 per child, per week - to spend at supermarkets, while schools have been closed. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford speaks to BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent about his childhood Rashford wrote: ""Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to be hungry?"" The United youth-team graduate, who is one of five children, added: ""As a black man from a low-income family in Wythenshawe, Manchester, I could have been just another statistic. ""Instead, due to the selfless actions of my mum, my family, my neighbours, and my coaches, the only stats I'm associated with are goals, appearances and caps.

""Ten years ago, I would have been one of those children, and you would never have heard my voice and seen my determination to become part of the solution,"" said Rashford. ""Food poverty in England is a pandemic that could span generations if we don't course correct now."" Rashford stated that the government's Universal Credit benefit system ""is simply not a short-term solution"" to the issue of food poverty, because ""I am fully aware that the majority of families applying are experiencing five-week delays"". He is concerned that child poverty is ""only going to get worse"" when the government's furlough scheme ends. Rashford added that with many children still not able to return to school and have more of their nutritional needs met ""we're encouraging this cycle of hardship to continue"". A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said Boris Johnson ""will respond to Marcus Rashford's letter as soon as he can"", adding the footballer ""has been using his profile in a positive way to highlight some important issues"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""This is such an important and moving letter. Thank you, Marcus, for all the work you are doing to support children during the coronavirus crisis.""

"Breonna Taylor was a decorated emergency medical technician and had no criminal record Pop star BeyoncÃ© has demanded justice for a black woman killed by police in a letter to the attorney general in the US state of Kentucky. The singer urged Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron to bring charges against the three officers involved in Breonna Taylor's killing. Ms Taylor, 26, was shot eight times when officers entered her home in Louisville on 13 March. They were executing a no-knock search warrant as part of a drugs raid. A no-knock warrant is a search warrant approved by a judge that permits police to enter a home without permission. Inside, the officers exchanged fire with Ms Taylor's partner, who believed the raid was a home invasion, but no drugs were found. Lawsuit after US health worker shot dead by police Protesters call on people to 'say her name' Police have said they knocked before using a battering ram to enter the home but this account has been disputed by Ms Taylor's family and a neighbour. The three officers involved - Jon Mattingly, Myles Cosgrove, and Brett Hankison - have been placed on administrative leave but none have been arrested or charged over Ms Taylor's death. Investigations are ongoing. ""Three months have passed - and Breonna Taylor's family still waits for justice,"" BeyoncÃ© wrote in the letter,shared on her official website on Sunday,external. Ms Taylor's killing has been propelled into the spotlight again since the death of unarmed African-American man George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last month. Ms Taylor's name has been used as a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter protests sweeping the US and the globe. Last Thursday,Louisville's city council voted unanimously in favour of banning no-knock warrants. Similar legislation that would ban the warrants nationwide was tabled in Congress, the US federal legislature, on the same day. BeyoncÃ© said the legislation represented ""small steps in the right direction"" but were a ""painful"" reminder that there was still ""no justice for Breonna Taylor"". BeyoncÃ© was critical of the Louisville Metro Police Department's investigations into the killing of Ms Taylor, which have ""created more questions than answers"". She questioned the accuracy of an incident report about the killing released last week by the police department. BeyoncÃ© has expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement In it, Ms Taylor's injuries were listed as ""none"" yet ""we know she was shot at least eight times"", BeyoncÃ© wrote. The police department previously said it was ""taking immediate steps to correct the report and to ensure the accuracy of incident reports going forward"". At the end of her letter, BeyoncÃ© made three specific demands. She urged the Kentucky attorney general to ""demonstrate the value of a black woman's life"" by: Bringing criminal charges against the three officers involved in Ms Taylor's killing Committing itself to transparency in the investigation and prosecution of the officers Investigating the response of Louisville police to the shooting ""Don't let this case fall into the pattern of no action after a terrible tragedy,"" BeyoncÃ© wrote. On Sunday, the Kentucky attorney general's office said it was aware of BeyoncÃ©'s letter but would not comment further.

The UK's biggest builders' merchant,Travis Perkins, plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. The group said it expected a UK recession to hit demand for building materials this year and in 2021. It said it had started a consultation process with staff at about 165 branches, about 8% of its network. The group includes Wickes, Toolstation and Tile Giant. It said closures would mainly be of smaller branches of its Travis Perkins General Merchant brand. The Welsh Government has published its Covid-19 guidance for higher education.

Chief Executive Hugh Morris said: âWe were looking forward to our annual fixtures in Swansea and Colwyn Bay, and taking one-day cricket to Newport for our 2020 season. ""It is with regret that we today announce that the logistical challenges of hosting outground cricket simply cannot be met in this current, uncertain climate."" Morris said the domestic fixture schedule for 2020 was yet to be determined, but added: ""If cricket is able to safely return, our focus for the season will be on hosting all matches at our main venue, Sophia Gardens. ""We remain committed to taking Glamorgan games across Wales for wider communities to enjoy, when we are able to do so safely and securely.â Allow Twitter content?

Lifting Covid-19 restrictions will not see a return to the âpre-pandemic normalâ, Wales' first minister has warned. Mark Drakeford said there could be a second wave of coronavirus cases even though the disease had receded. The leader of the Welsh Government told a press conference the virus remained present in Wales. âThat is why we will continue to need to take precautions and measures to prevent the spread.â he said.

The county council said its libraries would not be open for browsing and that safety remained its priority. ""Collections
will be quarantined for 72 hours before they are collected,"" a spokesman said. ""Readers are also
advised to quarantine books again for a further 72 hours once received, and to
wash hands before and after reading."" Similar services are also running at other Welsh councils, including Cardiff and Torfaen. Drivers have been moving cones from a street where they had been placed to allow socially-distanced shopping. One Twitter user wrote on the site that motorists on Wellfield Road, Cardiff, had been ""causing conflict"" with pedestrians when told they were not allowed to park. Cardiff Council said the cones will be replaced by ""bolt down units"" but that in the meantime there would be increased parking patrols. Wellfield Road will be trialled asa pilot for post-lockdown shopping. While all shops in England and Northern Ireland can now open, in Wales no opening dates have been given. Allow Twitter content?

Wales' first minister has stressed the need for community support for when restrictions are relaxed to allow tourism to resume. Mark Drakeford said a test â although not particularly âhard edgedâ â for reopening attractions is that tourists need to be âwelcomed when they get thereâ. âIf we reopen tourism in parts of Wales, when visitors arrive, they will need to know that their presence there is welcome in those local communities,â he said. First Minister Mark Drakeford has claimed there is a lack of talks between the UK government and Welsh ministers over the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Drakeford said he had last spoken to Prime Minister Boris Johnson two weeks ago. At the Welsh Government's daily press briefing, he said he had had ""no discussion"" with any UK minister, with the exception of Welsh Secretary Simon Hart since then. But he said there was still discussion between officials âIn terms of what I have wanted to see - that regular reliable rhythm of meetings with UK ministers - and the 'stop-start' arrangements we've had, I'm afraid we've been in a 'stop' part of that cycle for more than two weeks.â Allow Twitter content?

The first minister has said Wales' lower R rate is a ""sign of success"" rather than an ""inducement"" to lift lockdown restrictions. The R rate in Wales is now down from 0.8 to 0.7. On relaxing restrictions, Mark Drakeford said he wanted to take ""maximum advantage of the headroom we have while it remains in the bounds of safe public practice"". But he said he would ""only put forward measures on Friday of this week that the chief medical officer has endorsed"", Mr Drakeford also defended the relative caution of the Welsh Government in lifting restrictions compared to the UK government, when the R rate was lower in Wales than in England. ""It's the way we have done things in Wales that has resulted in the R figure that you refer to,"" he said. ""This is a sign of a success of the way we have done things, rather than an inducement to do an awful lot very quickly."" Any easing of lockdown on Friday will not mean a return to the pre-pandemic normal, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said ministers were looking at three areas, including the reopening of non-essential shops, reopening of schools on 29 June, and relaxing more restrictions on outdoor activities. He said shops would be ""well prepared"" before reopening, if ministers were advised to give the green light on Friday. The first minister said the sector had put in place ""new arrangements"" such as safe ways for shoppers to enter and leave stores, social distancing in shops, and protection for retail employees. Mr Drakeford said he was keen for the economy to reopen in Wales but stressed that public health must come first ""as that was best for our economy"". Plans to reopen shops ""carefully"" are being considered as part of moves to ease lockdown in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakford has said. Today, non-essential shops in England have reopened. But in Wales all retailers, apart from those deemed essential, such as supermarkets and pharmacies, have been closed since the start of lockdown in March. The Welsh Government is due to review lockdown restrictions on Friday. Mr Drakeford said reopening non-essential shops and further relaxing restrictions on outdoors activity are being considered by the Welsh Government. He said ministers were âlooking and learning from the experiences of other countries around the worldâ, and did not want things to reopen too soon and then have to close again. Mr Drakeford said that they were making sure businesses were going to be ready to safely open, should the Welsh Government be in ""a position"" to make such an announcement on Friday. âIn many countries where cafes have reopened they are opening outside only because the virus doesnât survive for as long outdoors as it does indoors,â he said. But other countries have reintroduced restrictions âbecause lockdown has led to cases of increasingâ. Mr Drakeford added that it would not mean a return to the pre-pandemic normal. âWhile the virus has receded and fewer people are becoming ill, coronavirus has not gone away â it continues to be present in Wales and there is still a risk we will face a second wave of illness later in the year,â he said. First Minister Mark Drakeford says Wales now has the capacity to carry out 12,300 coronavirus tests every day, as well as separate home tests. He told today's press briefing that more than 3,000 tests are being conducted every day in Wales and in the last 24 hours just over 30 were positive. âThis is a very different situation to the final weeks of March, when we went into lockdown,â he said. âAt that time, cases of coronavirus were increasing rapidly â we were seeing around 400 confirmed cases every day and there would have been even more people with the virus in the community.â âThe risk of meeting someone with the disease was rising too, while now it continues to fall.â The number of deaths continues to fall in Wales, the first minister has said. On Saturday, Public Health Wales reported three further deaths of people with coronavirus. Mark Drakeford said this was the lowest in a single day ""for some time"", but he said this did not mean the ""virus has gone away"". He told the daily Welsh Government press conference an analysis of deaths across the UK from the Office for National Statistics showed that when age is taken into account, England has the highest rate per population of coronavirus deaths, followed by Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Within Wales at health board level the lowest death rates were seen in the Hywel Dda area; rates in Powys and Betsi Cadwaladr were below the Wales average. The highest rates were seen in Cardiff and Vale and the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board areas. âThe number of deaths from coronavirus continues to fall in each of recent weeks,â he said. But Mr Drakeford said he recognised âevery single death as a tragedy for every family involvedâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Cox family are weighing up whether Jacob and Bethany go back to school and nursery Many parents will share Katie Cox's dilemma of whether she sends her young children back to school and nursery when they reopen in Wales. Pre-school childcare and schoolscan reopen on 29 June,externalbut the mum-of-four is ""concerned"" about how safe her three-year-old will be back in nursery. But the ""futures of pre-school settings may be in doubt"" when Welsh Government stops a funding ""lifeline"" this week. The government said free pre-school care was available for key workers. The approximate 500 pre-school providers across Wales have continued to receive government funding for those children who are applicable forfree childcare,externaldespite nurseries being shut since March due to the coronavirus lockdown. That funding ends on 19 June unless the applicable child actually attends their chosen nursery from 22 June - a move described as a ""hammer blow"" by opposition parties - making them ""unsustainable"" according to the group representing nurseries. Wales school reopening advice published Q&A: How will schools in Wales reopen? Chief medical officer wanted August school opening The Welsh Government has alsosuspended its free childcare provision for childrenwho have turned three since the new year until at least September -  this will be reviewed in August. An organisation that represents nurseries said pre-school settings were worried if the childcare funding is not reintroduced for new applicants in September, or parents continue to keep their children at home next term, their ""future looks uncertain"". Playgroups such as Little Acorns ""rely"" on what it called the government's funding ""lifeline"" It is thewidely-acknowledged inability for pre-school children to socially distance,externalthat worries Katie when she considers sending three-year-old Bethany back to nursery when it reopens. The 35-year-old thinks she may ""err on the side of caution"" and keep her youngest at home due to the ""possible fear"" of ""inadvertently introducing coronavirus"" into her family. ""For three months I've been telling Bethany we can't go to the park or see her friends or sleep at nanny's house because of a nasty virus that might hurt us,"" said Katie. ""So if I now tell her she can go back to nursery and Bethany asks 'has the virus gone mummy?' - what do I say? 'Well, no Bethany actually it hasn't gone so you need to be careful, keep washing your hands and keep away from your friends and the nursery workers. ""Firstly that could potentially frighten her a little bit and put her off nursery completely and more importantly how do you expect a three-year-old to effectively socially distance. ""And a young child's natural instinct has no boundaries - they want to play with any toy they see and get close to their friends all while constantly putting their hands on their face."" Katie Cox is worried that Jacob and Bethany won't be able to safely socially distance Katie and husband Thomas have been ""agonising"" over whether to send Bethany back to nursery and five-year-son Jacob back to school in Chepstow since the announcement was made they could reopen on 29 June. ""We can only make an informed decision when I know the plans of nursery and what theCovid-19 R numberis like locally,"" added the legal assistant and trainee lawyer. ""But our instinct is to err on the side of caution and keep the young children home. We can do that because we're mainly working from home so we're lucky in that respect as I know many don't have that option."" This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Thirteen of Little Acorns' 22 children benefit from Wales' free childcare offer and that funding has been a ""lifeline"" for the playgroup in Chepstow. Coordinator Kelly Hornbuckle has vowed the morning playgroup will reopen ""even if just one child wants to return"", but she has conceded the long-term future is uncertain if they don't receive any government help. ""We fully understand parents' concerns about sending their children back to playgroup and we're trying to give as many answers as we can,"" said the mother-of-two. ""But this is an unprecedented situation and we're awaiting further guidance ourselves on how to safely reopen our nursery. ""I'd completely understand if parents didn't feel comfortable about sending their child to playgroup, they've got to do what is right for them. ""For us as childcare providers, our funding may be cut if some of those children who are in receipt of the free childcare provision don't attend. ""Over the summer we'll lose all 13 of our children who get the government's childcare funding when they move up to school - so what happens to the pre-school sector if there's a second coronavirus wave which affects us reopening in September for the winter term?"" Latest figures show about 17,500 people work in the childcare sector in Wales and the four staff at Little Acorns, which runs every morning at a community centre in Chepstow's Bulwark area, have offered to take pay cuts while their landlords have deferred rent. ""We'll be here for our children as long as we can but we just don't know how viable our business will be long-term with this uncertain future,"" added Kelly, who took over the playgroup 18 months ago. Pre-school providers face ""months of reduced demand and increased operating costs"" The group representing the almost 21,000 nurseries across the UK is concerned the ""complexities of funding"" could leave some childcare businesses ""operating at a loss while delivering this important service"". ""Nurseries and other providers are gearing up towards wider reopening from 29 June, but this announcement means some may lose funding over a week before that date,"" said Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of National Day Nurseries Association Cymru. ""Providers are between a rock and a hard place where they might not be able to reopen, but also lose out on support to remain sustainable. ""Childcare businesses will be looking at months of reduced demand for places and increased operating costs as they bring in measures to keep children and staff safe."" The association called for a ""transformation and recovery fund"" for the sector to help pre-school providers ""weather this storm"". UK Government's key evidence on schools Has closing schools had an impact? Coronavirus risks for children This video can not be played How will the reopening of Welsh schools work? The Welsh Conservatives have called for the Labour-led administration to ""save"" the early years industry. ""The Welsh Government needs to realise that if nurseries start going to the wall, there will not be sufficient childcare capacity when children are back in school and parents return to work,"" said the party's children spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders. ""Childcare professionals have told me that they now face huge instability and are making skilled staff redundant."" Plaid Cymru said it was ""very concerned"" as there ""simply isn't enough support for this sector"". ""The crisis has exposed how fragmented the sector is,"" said education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian. ""The current support given by Welsh Government simply isn't enough and we could easily find ourselves in a situation whereby many childcare settings simply won't be able to reopen after the crisis has passed."" ""This will be hugely detrimental in economic terms as many families will be left without this essential provision and many parents - especially women - will simply be unable to return to work."" There are about 500 pre-school providers in Wales, latest figures show The Welsh Government will make its final decision on Thursday about schools reopening on 29 June. It said the funding has been reprioritised for paying for children of critical workers and vulnerable pupils under the newCoronavirus Childcare Assistance Scheme,external. ""We are currently providing free childcare for pre-school aged children of key workers, as well as for vulnerable children, and will continue to do that until the end of the summer break,"" said a spokesman. ""There are a number of schemes in place which can provide support to the childcare sector, including grants for small businesses. ""We have also published new guidance to support childcare settings to increase their operations alongside schools.""

"This video can not be played Shoppers in England rush back to the High Street Demand across England's High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres surged on Monday as some shops reopened after a three-month lockdown. Research firm Springboard said that by 17:00, footfall was 38.8% higher than last week, as pent-up demand led to reports of long queues. However, shopper numbers were generally far below the same time last year. But at Bicester Village, near Oxford,crowding was so great that 3,000 people signed a petition to close it. All shops in England are now allowed to open, but with strict safety measures. ""Footfall has risen by more than we anticipated, but it was certainly helped by the weather, which made queuing a more pleasurable experience,"" said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard. Safety measures include plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers two metres apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Jaydee Darrock, from Warwickshire, was one of the first insidePrimark's Birmingham storeafter queuing from about 07:00. She described it as ""surprisingly calm"". ""We thought it would be chaotic, it's not, it's quite nice,"" she said. In pictures: Shops in England reopen Five ways shopping will be different from now on How to shop safely in a coronavirus pandemic There were also big queues outside the Nike store in Central London, although some complained there had been a lack of social distancing. In Manchester people waited for almost an hour outside Primark, TK Maxx and Foot Locker, although elsewhere demand was more subdued. Most shops - like this Primark in Birmingham - have been locked since 23 March Although food shops, pharmacies, banks and other essential retailers have stayed open, vast swathes of the High Street, from bookshops to clothes outlets, have been closed since 23 March. Springboard said footfall was likely to rise further in the coming weeks, but warned many shoppers still had concerns about other people not following the safety measures in stores and there being long queues to get in. Shantel Brown, 35, was shopping in Milton Keynes with her daughter Tee, who is 16. Shantel said: ""I bought nightwear and baby clothes because Primark was open. I'm pregnant and I've been waiting to get some baby stuff. ""Everyone keeps their distance. They've got sanitiser at the entrance. As long as we've got our masks on we're fine."" Tee added: ""I bought tops, shorts and summer clothes. I came because Mum forced me."" Greg Dulson, 68, was shopping for a new watch strap. ""The strap on my favourite watch broke and I brought it in to the watchmaker's the day before lockdown,"" he said. ""They said come back tomorrow, but it was closed!"" Katie Kirby, who is 18, was shopping with her 21-year-old boyfriend Zac Hopkins. ""I bought a jumpsuit because Primark was open and the weather's getting better again,"" said Katie. ""I did go just to get some essentials like pants and socks, but I when I saw the jumpsuit I had to treat myself because the shops haven't been open for so long."" ""We do keep our distance in the store. We thought it would be a different shopping experience but once we were in there it was just the same."" Zac Hopkins added: ""I bought a skipping rope, so I can do some exercise at home."" The first thing I bought when the shops reopened Business reporter Vivienne Nunis in Milton Keynes There were socially distant queues outside Zara, Primark and TK Maxx this morning and a steady crowd of shoppers are now browsing in the centre. Lots of young people are here, mothers with strollers and some older shoppers too. Some people are wearing masks, but not many. However, lots of stores remain closed and all the lights are off in the locked cafes and fast-food restaurants. The shoppers are mostly sticking to the new rules and staying socially distant - when they remember. Floor markings indicate a one-way system, every second toilet cubicle is closed, touch-screen maps have been powered down and seating areas are roped off. But apart from those changes - and a growing queue outside Primark - everything feels rather normal. HMV owner Doug Putman told the BBC's Today programme that he expected a rush in the first week of trading after his shops open their doors. But he said retailers could be faced with a problem if shoppers do not return in the same numbers as before the lockdown. ""If you've got the same cost structure to run the business but sales are down even 20% it makes a lot of companies unviable. ""We're being very hesitant, we believe that it is going to be a tough year."" This video can not be played Mary Portas: 'This is a window of opportunity for local High Streets' Other safety measures brought in by retailers include pleas not to touch items unless customers are thinking about buying them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use. Shops are also promising there will be plenty of sanitiser on hand for customers. Toilets will remain closed in Primark's shops but facilities in other stores, including John Lewis and Selfridges, will be open. Which shops are reopening on Monday? Can my boss force me to go back to work? Consumers 'should shop with confidence', says PM In most clothes shops, fitting rooms will be closed. Bookshops including Waterstones intend to put items in quarantine if browsed but not bought, while some jewellers are introducing ultraviolet boxes that can decontaminate items in minutes. Government guidance suggests shops put some items aside if they have been extensively handled by customers. This video can not be played What's it now like shopping for clothes? Not all stores will throw open their doors immediately. John Lewis will reopen just two outlets on Monday - in Kingston upon Thames and Poole - as part of a phased approach, with 11 others to follow on Thursday. John Lewis willstart by opening 13 branchesin stages Next will reopen just 25 of its 500 stores at first Debenhams willreopen 50 stores in Englandand three in Northern Ireland Marks and Spencer will open all its shops in England and Northern Ireland JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its stores in England Primark is reopening all 153 of its stores in England Argos, which has kept outlets in Sainsbury's stores open, will reopen 145 standalone stores for click and collect Topshop is reopening all its stores in England and selected ones in Northern Ireland Music retailer HMV is reopening 93 of its 113 stores Currys PC World is reopening 131 of its outlets. Some other retailers selling products classed as essential - such as DIY, furniture and bicycles - have already started reopening. Furniture giant Ikeaopened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Many stores are encouraging customers to make purchases by contactless card payments, with limits increased to Â£45. London's West End, which includes Oxford Street, is expecting about 80% fewer visitors when it reopens on Monday. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body representing the sector, warned that the unlocking was unlikely to provide an immediate boost for the sector. It wants the government to help stimulate demand with a short-term cut in VAT or a temporary income tax cut for lower-income workers. 'It's very exciting to be returning to work' How coronavirus will change the way we all shop Government to review 2m social distancing rule Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas were also allowed to open from Monday. In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland. In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will not be allowed to open their doors until 4 July at the earliest - and even then, only if they can meetsocial distancing measures. Relaxing the 2m social distancing rule will be key to reviving the economy, the hospitality industry says. Pubs and restaurants have warned that they cannot make money if customers are required to keep two-metres apart, and have urged that the distance limit be reduced to one metre. Prime ministerBoris Johnson has commissioned a reviewinto two-metre distancing, saying there was ""margin for manoeuvre"" as the number of coronavirus cases falls. The government is under intense pressure to get the economy moving amid fears that there could be another wave of job losses as wage support schemes are wound down.

"Shops across England selling non-essential goods are welcoming back customers from today as the unlocking of the High Street begins. Thousands of of people queue outside of Primark stores across England Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to ""shop with confidence"". Retailers are required to introduce plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers two metres (6ft 5ins) apart. Updates on Monday, 15 June Jennifer Meierhans, Jay Vydelingum, Rob England and Chris Heard Rob EnglandBBC News We've seen joy and frustration from shoppers, and queues, lots of queues, as retailers across England reopened for the first time since lockdown began in March. But, as all things must, our live coverage has come to an end for the day. Join us again tomorrow morning at 07:30 for all the latest coronavirus news and updates. Stay safe. Here's the view from across England as non-essential shops opened today for the first time since lockdown began in March. London: Birmingham: Southampton: It is the first day in nearly three months that shops selling non-essential goods, such as clothing and electronics, have been allowed to open. Here's a quick roundup of what the first day of shopping looked like: This video can not be played Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit With millions of workers on furlough and workplaces closed
due to lockdown, bosses across many industries stopped hiring. According to analysis by the Office for National Statistics,
the volume of job adverts posted in the last month is less than half the average
for 2019. Catering and hospitality and manufacturing have seen
the biggest slumps â down to 18% and 21% of their average for last year. Retail and
wholesale job adverts have also fallen to below a quarter of last year's average. The ONS compiled the figures by analysing the jobs website
Adzuna. Rob EnglandBBC News As people joinedqueues outside many shops across England, what were they looking to buy after three months of lockdown? Retailer John Lewis reported the first products sold at the two stores it reopened today was a china tea set, in Kingston, and an iPhone 11, at its Poole store in Dorset. Today's top sellers included buttons, face masks, towels, sofas, egg cups and baby sleepsuits. The company said,externalthe popularity of buttons appeared to be down to the items being used in conjunction with face masks to stop the elastic straps rubbing behind the ears. They are also thought to have been wanted by people who have taken up sewing and knitting during lockdown, requiring buttons for their handmade goods. Other popular items sold on Monday were pillowcases and bed sheets, televisions and printer cartridges, it added. Rob EnglandBBC News Despite a good start for shops on Monday, social distancing rules must be relaxed or thousands of jobs could be at risk, a retail boss has said. It comes as non-essential stores complying with government coronavirus guidelineswelcomed customers for the first time since lockdown began. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive at New West End Company - a partnership of 600 retail, restaurant, hotel and property owners - said: ""The businesses that have opened have a nice customer trade coming in, people are queueing, which is very good."" Mr Tyrrell added that the two-metre (6ft) rule could cause up to 50,000 jobs to be at risk if it stayed in place due to loss of sales. ""There's no doubt this year will be one of the most challenging ever we have experienced in retail in the West End,"" he said. ""If we don't address social distancing and the international quarantine, we could easily see over 50,000 job losses here... alone. We could lose about Â£5 billion in sales, so of course it is going to be a long recovery."" Marc Ashdown From tiny traders to billion
pound behemoths, the lockdown saw businesses across London plunged into a
sudden deep freeze. Now the task of reviving
them from hibernation begins. Itâs not as simple as
flinging the doors open and welcoming a shop full of eager customers once
again. There are serious questions for shops of all shapes and sizes around how
to keep staff and customers safe, but also how viable they genuinely can be in
this radically different trading climate. For Londonâs beleaguered
smaller high streets, those who survive the thaw may actually see a boost in
trade. Bargain offers could whet the appetite, as long as social distancing
measures convince shoppers to venture out. But with the message to
avoid public transport still ringing loud and clear, a walk down the local
parade or town centre may seem a much more attractive proposition now than
kitting the family in masks and dragging them to the West End for a day out. The trick will be balance
and flexibility. The balance between the
shopper experience and safety will be delicate and needs to be attractive
enough to entice people in. So queuing systems, protective equipment and
distancing has to be managed in a sensible way to maintain confidence and
enjoyment. But if it all starts to go
wrong, those who show the flexibility to adapt and change things up quickly
will have a better chance of surviving and even thriving. Shantel Brown, 35, was shopping in Milton Keynes with her daughter Tee, who is 16. Shantel said: ""I bought nightwear and baby clothes because Primark was open. I'm pregnant and I've been waiting to get some baby stuff. ""Everyone keeps their distance. They've got sanitiser at the entrance. As long as we've got our masks on we're fine."" Tee added: ""I bought tops, shorts and summer clothes. I came because mum forced me."" Greg Dulson, 68, was shopping for a new watch strap. ""The strap on my favourite watch broke and I brought it in to the watchmaker's the day before lockdown,"" he said. ""They said come back tomorrow, but it was closed!"" Katie Kirby, who is 18, was shopping with her 21-year-old boyfriend Zac Hopkins. ""I bought a jumpsuit because Primark was open and the weather's getting better again,"" said Katie. ""I did go just to get some essentials like pants and socks, but I when I saw the jumpsuit I had to treat myself because the shops haven't been open for so long."" ""We do keep our distance in the store. We thought it would be a different shopping experience but once we were in there it was just the same."" Zac Hopkins added: ""I bought a skipping rope, so I can do some exercise at home."" James DawsonBBC Yorkshire As thousands of people head back to high streets across the country for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic started, I've been speaking to shoppers in Leeds. Bertran Hardy and Lauryn
Wiley (pictured above), both 18, have been out shopping in Leeds today while trying to maintain social
distance from each other. ""How theyâve done it is really
[good], how everything is socially distanced,â Bertran said of the re-opened stores. âI like that all the shops have got
hand sanitiser. It think itâs good to get the economy going again.â Lauryn added that the pair have
âavoided the queuesâ by shopping at quieter retailers. Bertran also says he now feels less
worried about coronavirus than he did at the beginning of lockdown. âAs the measures have become less
strict, everyoneâs forgotten about it and itâs now less of a worry,"" he

A shoe shop run by eight generations of the same family for more than 200 years has reopened today. WJ French & Son has been trading in Southampton since 1803, but estimates it has lost more than Â£100,000 during the lockdown. Social distancing measures include plastic screens so shoes can be safely fitted by staff.

Improvement work around the city centre is continuing, said the council, with a few issues ""still to be ironed out,"" as the spaces open back up again. Tony Wade, who runs jewellery shop A Simmonds in Canterbury, said he was pleased to be back at work,as many non-essential stores in England reopenedfor the first time in three months today. Much to his delight, he was welcomed back by a queue of 10 customers when his shop opened this morning. Mr Wade said: âItâs great to see people come back. The phone
hasnât stopped. âWe suspected it would be busy because we have loyal
customers. âWe have lost three months of trading and there is no way of
telling the impact until three monthsâ time. Iâm optimistic.â Sandish ShokerBBC News Another city that's seen huge queues outside retailers is Nottingham. Hundreds of people waited to get into Primark, with the queue winding back into nearby Market Square. Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester have also seen similar-sized queues for the retailer, which unlike other clothes stores, does not have an online arm. Â© 2025 BBC.

"There is ""much more that we need to do"" to tackle racism, Boris Johnson has said as he announced a new commission to look at all ""aspects of inequality"". Writing in the Telegraph,external, the PM said ""no-one who cares about this country"" could ignore the anti-racist protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd. But Labour's David Lammy said it was time for action, not another review. The PM also said the UK should not attempt to ""re-write the past"" by removing historical symbols. The UK's heritage should be left ""broadly in peace"", he added. The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Protesters clash with police in central London 'We stopped somebody from being killed' Mr Johnson condemned the ""far-right thugs"" involved in violent protests on Saturday, which saw more than 100 people arrested in London after thousands gathered saying they were protecting statues. He said their mission was ""utterly absurd"" but he added that it was ""deplorable"" that Sir Winston Churchill's statue had been in danger of attack. It comes after the statue in Parliament Square was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" last weekend. In Bristol, anti-racism protesters pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces inquiry into racial inequality Thousands of people have marched in the UK as part of Black Lives Matter demonstrationsfollowing the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. The prime minister said he was setting up a commission to look at inequality as it was ""no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism"". He wrote: ""There is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality - in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life."" Questions over inequality in health outcomes have been repeatedly raised during the coronavirus pandemic after figures showedmore people from ethnic minority backgrounds were ""disproportionately"" dying with the virus. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said a number of inquiries into racial inequality had already been carried out, such ashis own reporton the treatment of black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system and Theresa May'sRace Disparity Audit,external. ""You can understand why it feels like, yet again in the UK, we want figures, data, but we don't want action,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Black people aren't playing victim as Boris indicates, they're protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now."" Mr Lammy said the announcement lacked detail because it was ""written on the back of a fag packet yesterday to assuage the Black Lives Matter protest"". He called for legislation and the recommendations of past reviews to be implemented. The Race Disparity Audit, published by then Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017, showed inequalities between ethnicities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and the courts The 2017Lammy Reviewfound evidence of bias and discrimination against people from ethnic minority backgrounds in the justice system in England and Wales Also in 2017,the McGregor-Smith Reviewof race in the workplace found people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were still disadvantaged at work and faced lower employment rates than their white counterparts Anindependent review of the Windrush scandal, published in March, found the Home Office showed ""institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race"" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the new commission would be run out of the Cabinet Office and report to the prime minister, and it would be asked to finish its work by Christmas. A chair has not yet been identified but the commission will be overseen by Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, with independent members also on the panel. There are expected to be public evidence sessions and legislation may follow. Lord Simon Woolley, founder of Operation Black Vote and the advisory chair of the government's Race Disparity Unit, said he was ""encouraged"" by the announcement of the commission. However, he said it must lead to action and structural change, to tackle the inequalities in employment, health and education laid bare by the pandemic. This video can not be played Racism in the UK: 'I feel like an alien' Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova said: ""We are in the midst of a global health pandemic that has sharply exposed deep structural inequalities which have long since needed urgently addressing."" She criticised some of Mr Johnson's words, after he told broadcasters he wanted to ""change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination"". Ms de Cordova described this as ""condescending"" and ""designed to let himself and his government off the hook"". Lord Woolley also said the phrase was ""frankly unhelpfulâ¦ unnecessary and to some hurtful"". Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine said the commission was a ""welcome first step"" and showed the Black Lives Matter protests were working. But she added: ""Its findings must not become simply another report on a shelf in Whitehall - the government must implement them without delay."" Meanwhile, a survey of people's attitudes to race in Britain carried out during recent protests suggests people are increasingly optimistic that the UK will become more tolerant and diverse. When asked if they were optimistic Britain would be more tolerant and diverse in 10 years' time, two thirds of people polled by Ipsos Mori said they were, up from half in 2009. And 84% of people strongly disagreed when asked if someone has to be white to be truly British - up from 55% a decade earlier. Anti-racism protesters in Bristol pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Mr Johnson said the ""serious points"" being raised by the anti-racism demonstrators should be taken seriously. However, he said that did not mean ""wasting time"" disputing the life and opinions of ""every historical personality currently immortalised in bronze or stone"". ""Let's fight racism, but leave our heritage broadly in peace. If we really want to change it, there are democratic means available in this country - thanks, by the way, to Winston Churchill,"" he said. It comes as English Heritage is reviewing London's 950 blue plaques to check if any have ""problematic"" connections and will warrant extra context published about them online,as first reported in the Times.,external As for statues, English Heritage also said it believes the best course of action is to give extra context to ensure the stories of individuals are told ""without embellishment or excuses"".

Much to his delight, he was welcomed back by a queue of 10 customers when his shop opened this morning. Mr Wade said: âItâs great to see people come back. The phone
hasnât stopped. âWe suspected it would be busy because we have loyal
customers. âWe have lost three months of trading and there is no way of
telling the impact until three monthsâ time. Iâm optimistic.â Sandish ShokerBBC News Another city that's seen huge queues outside retailers is Nottingham. Hundreds of people waited to get into Primark, with the queue winding back into nearby Market Square. Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester have also seen similar-sized queues for the retailer, which unlike other clothes stores, does not have an online arm. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here are the highlights from ourevening update:  Ahead of our pause in live coverage about the coronavirus pandemic, here's an update of developments from around the world: Next year's Oscars ceremony has been pushed back by two months, the latest major event to have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. The Academy Awards were due to take place on 28 February next yearbut have now been put back until 25 April. The pandemic has already halted work on a number of films that were due to be released by the end of the year. Organisers have also agreed to extend the cut-off date for Oscar-eligible films beyond 31 December 2020 to the end of February. Meanwhile, organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have announced the dates of next year's competitionfollowing the cancellation of this year's event. The semi-finals will take place on 18 and 20 May, followed by the grand final on 22 May. They will all be held in Rotterdam, where this year's event had been due to take place last month. With the end of the economic impact of coronavirus nowhere near in sight, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is making plans to extend economic aid. Ezekiel Elliott at a game in January Several NFL players for the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans  have tested positive for Covid-19,NFL Network,externalreports. Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliot is among the players with the virus, but is doing well, according to his agent. He recently made headlines, along with a number of other top football players, for a video criticising the league over its response to black rights issues that was released the day of African American George Floyd's funeral. Texans players were also given time off if they wished to attend the funeral service. None of the players were in team facilities, according to NFL Network, and the Cowboys and Texans have been following health protocols. The teams have not offered further details. NFL coaches and staff have started returning to facilities, but no players have yet done so. The league is still aiming to start its 2020 season in September, and is hopeful that training camps will happen before then. This month, Roger Goodell, NFL commissioner, sent teams guidelines on reopening, with rules addressing distancing, equipment cleaning, food service, and personal protective equipment requirements. The sunbeds are out in Benidorm There is some hopeful news for those in the UK who feel the need to head south for warmer weather. A spokesperson for the Spanish government has told the BBC that British travellers are âwelcome to travel to Spainâ from Sunday without facing quarantine measures or restrictions on arrival. It confirms a tweet posted earlier by the British embassy in Madrid, which said the UK had been included on the list of countries that will not face restrictions when Spain's borders reopen. Travellers returning to the UK will still have to self isolate for two weeks afterwards, however, and the UK government's official advice is still against any non-essential international travel.

But he could not say when the air bridge might be in place. Government scientific and medical advisers were absent from the UK briefing today, but one, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has been speaking to football legend Ian Wright about the return of Premier League games this week. Prof Van-Tam says he is ""desperate to get back to the stadium"" of his beloved Boston United in Lincolnshire. But he cautions that it has to be done in a way that prevents transmission of the virus starting again - and that's why football's restart is limited to behind closed doors.

Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor Food is more than twice as expensive as it was last year in Syria No-one knows exactly how much damage Syriaâs civil war
has done to the economy. One estimate is something like half a
trillion pounds ($630bn) worth of destruction. The pieces that remain are being battered by a new and
severe crisis. The result, says UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, is
that ""Syrians are hungry now en masse in a way which wasn't true one or
two years ago"". It is happening, he adds, as the economic
consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic start kicking in, not just in Syria but
across the world. ""What we're projecting globally is a doubling of the
people all across the planet who will be at starvation levels of hunger."" Read more:Assad under pressure as economic crisis batters Syria The government has released its latest figures and data on how the virus is affecting the UK. Here are graphs showing how the numbers are changing. You can find other key statistics - including how many cases there are in your area -here. Norway's health authorities have halted the roll-out of a coronavirus mobile phone app after it was criticised by the data protection authority. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) said it would delete all information collected so far, but warned that the move would weaken the fight against coronavirus. Norway's data protection authority (DPA) said on Friday that the potentially intrusive nature of the app Smittestopp (Infection stop) was not warranted, given the low rate of infection. About 1.5 million people downloaded it in the first week of its launch in April - more than a quarter of the population. The app is designed to show researchers where people are moving and to alert those who have been in contact with a Covid-19 carrier. ""We don't agree with the DPA's evaluation but feel it is necessary to delete all data and put work on hold as a result of
this,"" NIPH said in a statement. Read more: Contact-tracing apps face further hitches Social distancing rules mean only a quarter of students can be in school at once Secondary school students in England have begun to return to classes today - but how much time will they actually spend in school? A survey of 8,000 teachers suggests that 90% of their pupils will be in class for less than two days a week. Social distancing means schools can only accommodate a quarter of pupils in Years 10 and 12 at any one time, so different groups of students have to take turns to attend. Less than a third of schools are teaching all subject options, with most focusing on English, maths and science. Read the full story Testing has been increased in the area of the new outbreak in Beijing The World Health Organization says it expects China to share the full genetic sequence from the new coronavirus outbreak in Beijing with the rest of the world. Speaking in Geneva, head of health emergencies Dr Mike Ryan said it was expected as ""they have done in the past"". Beijing has seen a cluster of about 100 new cases of the virus, and is investigating the origins. Experts said the strain did not resemble the type found elsewhere in the country and genetic traces have suggested it could have originated in Europe. ""The finding that this may represent a strain more common in transmission in Europe is important and it may reflect
human-to-human transmission more than any other hypotheses,"" Dr Ryan said. Local media said the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at a market, leading to speculation that it was brought in on the fish or its packaging.
 
Dr Ryan said the safety of food and its packaging should be looked at but added that he was ""reticent"" to say all food packaging needed testing. The Duke of Cambridge has made a surprise video call to a woman and her young son who have been shielding for the past three months. Prince William spoke to Leanne and five-year-old Kaydyn, who has cystic fibrosis, at their home in Corby, Northamptonshire. Footage of the call will feature on BBC One's The One Show at 19:00 on Tuesday.
Leanne was shown covering her mouth with her hands in shock as the duke called from his home in Norfolk. Last week, the Duke of Cambridge revealed he had been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. You can read more about his callhere. Iran's daily death count is more than 100 once again, raising alarm from the authorities Iran has warned it may have to reimpose strict measures against the coronavirus, as it reported more than 100 deaths for a second day running. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said there had been 113 new fatalities, taking the official death toll to 8,950 since Iran's outbreak began in February. She said a further 2,449 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. Iran started to relax its lockdown in mid-April after infections declined but has since seen a surge. There have also been concerns the official figures do not reflect the full extent of deaths and infections. On Monday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei criticised the lack of social distancing by people at holy sites and on public transport. ""In the [Tehran] subway, although 90% of passengers use masks, social distancing is not being observed,"" he said. ""If we find that the spread of the virus is out of control... then we will definitely apply strict decisions again."" A bargain dress or a new watchstrap - what do you really need after three months? As the coronavirus lockdown was eased further in England, queues formed outside many shops before they opened for the first time since March. Industry data shows the number of visitors to high streets, shopping centres and retail parks was up by almost half this morning, compared with last week -  but the levels were still far below the same period last year. Retailers have had to introduce strict safety measures such as plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Many shoppers seem confident in the measures being taken and were keen for a bargain - we spoke to some about their experiences and their first purchases and you can read about thathere. In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland.  The state is moving forward with its reopening process New York's death toll and total number of people sent to hospital due to Covid-19 have both fallen to the lowest points since the crisis began. On Monday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said this weekend had the fewest deaths on a three-day average since March. The number of positive tests has also continued to decline. Twenty-five people died of the virus on Sunday and there were just over 1,600 residents requiring hospital treatment for Covid-19 over the weekend. ""The facts are that new York is on the right track,"" he said, though noted it was unlikely the numbers would hit zero. ""It's coming down to what the doctor certifies as the cause of death, many people who pass away because of Covid have other underlying conditions."" The report comes as parts of the state enter the third phase of reopening; gatherings of up to 25 people will be allowed, up from 10, and many businesses are back open. But the governor also called out businesses and residents ignoring social distancing measures, saying the state had received 25,000 complaints of violations. The latest UK unemployment figures are due to be published by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow but several companies have announced plans to cut jobs today. Wickes owner Travis Perkins, the UK's biggest builders' merchant,plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. The group says it expects a UK recession to hit demand for building materials this year and in 2021. Jaguar Land Rover is set to cut up to 1,100 temporary jobs from its factory floors after it reported a Â£501m loss in the final quarter of its financial year. And75 jobs are under threat at the Titanic Belfast visitor centre, the BBC understands. The company has started a consultation over the potential redundancies. Frank KeoghBBC Sport Royal Ascot starts on Tuesday - but the famous British horse racing meeting will have a very different feel this year. The action will take place behind closed doors amid strict safety protocols because of the coronavirus pandemic - jockeys must undergo temperature checks and wear face masks. And while the fixture retains its regal title and branding, the Queen will not be in attendance for the first time in her 68-year reign. She is expected to watch television coverage from Windsor Castle. Racehorse owners are not allowed at the Berkshire track but will have access to a 360-degree live camera feed of runners in the parade ring, while people are being encouraged to wear a hat and dress up at home.

"The memorial for PC Keith Palmer was unveiled outside Parliament in 2018 A man has been jailed for urinating at the Westminster memorial dedicated to PC Keith Palmer. Andrew Banks, 28, of Stansted, Essex, was photographed during Saturday's right-wing protests in London. He was sentenced to 14 days in custody, after pleading guilty to outraging public decency at Westminster Magistrates' Court. PC Palmer, 48, was stabbed while on duty during the Westminster attack on 22 March 2017. He was one of five people murdered by Khalid Masood. Andrew Banks had not slept the night before the incident, the court heard The image of Banks was widely shared on social media on Saturday asviolent clashes between far-right protesters and policetook place in central London. Banks, a Tottenham Hotspur fan, said he had travelled to central London with other football supporters to ""protect statues"", but admitted he did not know which statues. He was said to have drunk 16 pints during Friday night into Saturday morning, and had not been to sleep. Banks contacted police after being confronted by his father, the court heard. Jailing Banks, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said: ""I accept you were drunk and did not know where you were urinating. ""Your explanation is you had 16 pints to drink, you hadn't been to bed, and a group of football supporters were coming up to protect the monuments. ""The irony is rather than protecting the monuments, you almost urinated on one. That was more by luck than judgment."" PC Keith Palmer was unarmed as he was attacked by Khalid Masood His counsel Stuart Harris said his client was ""ashamed by his action"", and had mental health issues. The act was widely condemned at the time by politicians including MP Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to PC Palmer as he lay dying in the grounds of Parliament. Met Police Cdr Bas Javid said: ""Keith Palmer was a brave police officer and the memorial stands testament to his courage.

The UK's biggest builders' merchant,Travis Perkins, plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. The group said it expected a UK recession to hit demand for building materials this year and in 2021. It said it had started a consultation process with staff at about 165 branches, about 8% of its network. The group includes Wickes, Toolstation and Tile Giant. It said closures would mainly be of smaller branches of its Travis Perkins General Merchant brand. The Welsh Government has published its Covid-19 guidance for higher education. It outlines some of the measures providers may need to follow in order to protect the health of students, staff and the communities they serve. For the time being, it says most teaching and learning will continue
to be delivered online. It also says that students who have left student accommodation and

Chief Executive Hugh Morris said: âWe were looking forward to our annual fixtures in Swansea and Colwyn Bay, and taking one-day cricket to Newport for our 2020 season. ""It is with regret that we today announce that the logistical challenges of hosting outground cricket simply cannot be met in this current, uncertain climate."" Morris said the domestic fixture schedule for 2020 was yet to be determined, but added: ""If cricket is able to safely return, our focus for the season will be on hosting all matches at our main venue, Sophia Gardens. ""We remain committed to taking Glamorgan games across Wales for wider communities to enjoy, when we are able to do so safely and securely.â Allow Twitter content?

Lifting Covid-19 restrictions will not see a return to the âpre-pandemic normalâ, Wales' first minister has warned. Mark Drakeford said there could be a second wave of coronavirus cases even though the disease had receded. The leader of the Welsh Government told a press conference the virus remained present in Wales. âThat is why we will continue to need to take precautions and measures to prevent the spread.â he said.

The county council said its libraries would not be open for browsing and that safety remained its priority. ""Collections
will be quarantined for 72 hours before they are collected,"" a spokesman said. ""Readers are also
advised to quarantine books again for a further 72 hours once received, and to
wash hands before and after reading."" Similar services are also running at other Welsh councils, including Cardiff and Torfaen. Drivers have been moving cones from a street where they had been placed to allow socially-distanced shopping. One Twitter user wrote on the site that motorists on Wellfield Road, Cardiff, had been ""causing conflict"" with pedestrians when told they were not allowed to park. Cardiff Council said the cones will be replaced by ""bolt down units"" but that in the meantime there would be increased parking patrols. Wellfield Road will be trialled asa pilot for post-lockdown shopping. While all shops in England and Northern Ireland can now open, in Wales no opening dates have been given. Allow Twitter content?

The Swansea Bay 10k, which was set to celebrate its 40th anniversary this year, has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It has been rescheduled for 19 September 2021. A statement from organisers said: ""It has become clear that although restrictions are gradually being relaxed, there is no indication that mass gatherings of this nature will be able to return in time to be able to safely stage the event this September."" Public Health Wales (PHW) publishes daily statistics of deaths, mostly occurring in hospitals, but only when the virus has been confirmed by laboratories. This graph shows the number of deaths each day since March on the day they occurred, not when they were announced. Four more people have died with Covid-19 in Wales, Public Health Wales has announced. This map shows how many people have died with the virus in each health board area. Four more people with coronavirus are
reported to have died in Wales, taking the total to 1,448. Public
Health Wales (PHW) figures also showed there were 62 new cases reported,
meaning 14,804 people have tested positive for Covid-19. PHW publishes daily statistics of deaths, mostly occurring in hospitals, but only when the virus has been confirmed by laboratories.

Wales' first minister has stressed the need for community support for when restrictions are relaxed to allow tourism to resume. Mark Drakeford said a test â although not particularly âhard edgedâ â for reopening attractions is that tourists need to be âwelcomed when they get thereâ. âIf we reopen tourism in parts of Wales, when visitors arrive, they will need to know that their presence there is welcome in those local communities,â he said. First Minister Mark Drakeford has claimed there is a lack of talks between the UK government and Welsh ministers over the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Drakeford said he had last spoken to Prime Minister Boris Johnson two weeks ago. At the Welsh Government's daily press briefing, he said he had had ""no discussion"" with any UK minister, with the exception of Welsh Secretary Simon Hart since then. But he said there was still discussion between officials âIn terms of what I have wanted to see - that regular reliable rhythm of meetings with UK ministers - and the 'stop-start' arrangements we've had, I'm afraid we've been in a 'stop' part of that cycle for more than two weeks.â Allow Twitter content?

The first minister has said Wales' lower R rate is a ""sign of success"" rather than an ""inducement"" to lift lockdown restrictions. The R rate in Wales is now down from 0.8 to 0.7. On relaxing restrictions, Mark Drakeford said he wanted to take ""maximum advantage of the headroom we have while it remains in the bounds of safe public practice"". But he said he would ""only put forward measures on Friday of this week that the chief medical officer has endorsed"", Mr Drakeford also defended the relative caution of the Welsh Government in lifting restrictions compared to the UK government, when the R rate was lower in Wales than in England. ""It's the way we have done things in Wales that has resulted in the R figure that you refer to,"" he said. ""This is a sign of a success of the way we have done things, rather than an inducement to do an awful lot very quickly."" Any easing of lockdown on Friday will not mean a return to the pre-pandemic normal, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said ministers were looking at three areas, including the reopening of non-essential shops, reopening of schools on 29 June, and relaxing more restrictions on outdoor activities. He said shops would be ""well prepared"" before reopening, if ministers were advised to give the green light on Friday. The first minister said the sector had put in place ""new arrangements"" such as safe ways for shoppers to enter and leave stores, social distancing in shops, and protection for retail employees. Mr Drakeford said he was keen for the economy to reopen in Wales but stressed that public health must come first ""as that was best for our economy"". Plans to reopen shops ""carefully"" are being considered as part of moves to ease lockdown in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakford has said. Today, non-essential shops in England have reopened. But in Wales all retailers, apart from those deemed essential, such as supermarkets and pharmacies, have been closed since the start of lockdown in March. The Welsh Government is due to review lockdown restrictions on Friday. Mr Drakeford said reopening non-essential shops and further relaxing restrictions on outdoors activity are being considered by the Welsh Government. He said ministers were âlooking and learning from the experiences of other countries around the worldâ, and did not want things to reopen too soon and then have to close again. Mr Drakeford said that they were making sure businesses were going to be ready to safely open, should the Welsh Government be in ""a position"" to make such an announcement on Friday. âIn many countries where cafes have reopened they are opening outside only because the virus doesnât survive for as long outdoors as it does indoors,â he said. But other countries have reintroduced restrictions âbecause lockdown has led to cases of increasingâ. Mr Drakeford added that it would not mean a return to the pre-pandemic normal. âWhile the virus has receded and fewer people are becoming ill, coronavirus has not gone away â it continues to be present in Wales and there is still a risk we will face a second wave of illness later in the year,â he said. First Minister Mark Drakeford says Wales now has the capacity to carry out 12,300 coronavirus tests every day, as well as separate home tests. He told today's press briefing that more than 3,000 tests are being conducted every day in Wales and in the last 24 hours just over 30 were positive. âThis is a very different situation to the final weeks of March, when we went into lockdown,â he said. âAt that time, cases of coronavirus were increasing rapidly â we were seeing around 400 confirmed cases every day and there would have been even more people with the virus in the community.â âThe risk of meeting someone with the disease was rising too, while now it continues to fall.â The number of deaths continues to fall in Wales, the first minister has said. On Saturday, Public Health Wales reported three further deaths of people with coronavirus. Mark Drakeford said this was the lowest in a single day ""for some time"", but he said this did not mean the ""virus has gone away"". He told the daily Welsh Government press conference an analysis of deaths across the UK from the Office for National Statistics showed that when age is taken into account, England has the highest rate per population of coronavirus deaths, followed by Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Within Wales at health board level the lowest death rates were seen in the Hywel Dda area; rates in Powys and Betsi Cadwaladr were below the Wales average. The highest rates were seen in Cardiff and Vale and the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board areas. âThe number of deaths from coronavirus continues to fall in each of recent weeks,â he said. But Mr Drakeford said he recognised âevery single death as a tragedy for every family involvedâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here are the highlights from ourevening update:  Ahead of our pause in live coverage about the coronavirus pandemic, here's an update of developments from around the world: Next year's Oscars ceremony has been pushed back by two months, the latest major event to have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. The Academy Awards were due to take place on 28 February next yearbut have now been put back until 25 April. The pandemic has already halted work on a number of films that were due to be released by the end of the year. Organisers have also agreed to extend the cut-off date for Oscar-eligible films beyond 31 December 2020 to the end of February. Meanwhile, organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have announced the dates of next year's competitionfollowing the cancellation of this year's event. The semi-finals will take place on 18 and 20 May, followed by the grand final on 22 May. They will all be held in Rotterdam, where this year's event had been due to take place last month. With the end of the economic impact of coronavirus nowhere near in sight, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is making plans to extend economic aid. Ezekiel Elliott at a game in January Several NFL players for the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans  have tested positive for Covid-19,NFL Network,externalreports. Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliot is among the players with the virus, but is doing well, according to his agent. He recently made headlines, along with a number of other top football players, for a video criticising the league over its response to black rights issues that was released the day of African American George Floyd's funeral. Texans players were also given time off if they wished to attend the funeral service. None of the players were in team facilities, according to NFL Network, and the Cowboys and Texans have been following health protocols. The teams have not offered further details. NFL coaches and staff have started returning to facilities, but no players have yet done so. The league is still aiming to start its 2020 season in September, and is hopeful that training camps will happen before then. This month, Roger Goodell, NFL commissioner, sent teams guidelines on reopening, with rules addressing distancing, equipment cleaning, food service, and personal protective equipment requirements. The sunbeds are out in Benidorm There is some hopeful news for those in the UK who feel the need to head south for warmer weather. A spokesperson for the Spanish government has told the BBC that British travellers are âwelcome to travel to Spainâ from Sunday without facing quarantine measures or restrictions on arrival. It confirms a tweet posted earlier by the British embassy in Madrid, which said the UK had been included on the list of countries that will not face restrictions when Spain's borders reopen. Travellers returning to the UK will still have to self isolate for two weeks afterwards, however, and the UK government's official advice is still against any non-essential international travel.

But he could not say when the air bridge might be in place. Government scientific and medical advisers were absent from the UK briefing today, but one, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has been speaking to football legend Ian Wright about the return of Premier League games this week. Prof Van-Tam says he is ""desperate to get back to the stadium"" of his beloved Boston United in Lincolnshire. But he cautions that it has to be done in a way that prevents transmission of the virus starting again - and that's why football's restart is limited to behind closed doors.

Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor Food is more than twice as expensive as it was last year in Syria No-one knows exactly how much damage Syriaâs civil war
has done to the economy. One estimate is something like half a
trillion pounds ($630bn) worth of destruction. The pieces that remain are being battered by a new and
severe crisis. The result, says UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, is
that ""Syrians are hungry now en masse in a way which wasn't true one or
two years ago"". It is happening, he adds, as the economic
consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic start kicking in, not just in Syria but
across the world. ""What we're projecting globally is a doubling of the
people all across the planet who will be at starvation levels of hunger."" Read more:Assad under pressure as economic crisis batters Syria The government has released its latest figures and data on how the virus is affecting the UK. Here are graphs showing how the numbers are changing. You can find other key statistics - including how many cases there are in your area -here. Norway's health authorities have halted the roll-out of a coronavirus mobile phone app after it was criticised by the data protection authority. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) said it would delete all information collected so far, but warned that the move would weaken the fight against coronavirus. Norway's data protection authority (DPA) said on Friday that the potentially intrusive nature of the app Smittestopp (Infection stop) was not warranted, given the low rate of infection. About 1.5 million people downloaded it in the first week of its launch in April - more than a quarter of the population. The app is designed to show researchers where people are moving and to alert those who have been in contact with a Covid-19 carrier. ""We don't agree with the DPA's evaluation but feel it is necessary to delete all data and put work on hold as a result of
this,"" NIPH said in a statement. Read more: Contact-tracing apps face further hitches Social distancing rules mean only a quarter of students can be in school at once Secondary school students in England have begun to return to classes today - but how much time will they actually spend in school? A survey of 8,000 teachers suggests that 90% of their pupils will be in class for less than two days a week. Social distancing means schools can only accommodate a quarter of pupils in Years 10 and 12 at any one time, so different groups of students have to take turns to attend. Less than a third of schools are teaching all subject options, with most focusing on English, maths and science. Read the full story Testing has been increased in the area of the new outbreak in Beijing The World Health Organization says it expects China to share the full genetic sequence from the new coronavirus outbreak in Beijing with the rest of the world. Speaking in Geneva, head of health emergencies Dr Mike Ryan said it was expected as ""they have done in the past"". Beijing has seen a cluster of about 100 new cases of the virus, and is investigating the origins. Experts said the strain did not resemble the type found elsewhere in the country and genetic traces have suggested it could have originated in Europe. ""The finding that this may represent a strain more common in transmission in Europe is important and it may reflect
human-to-human transmission more than any other hypotheses,"" Dr Ryan said. Local media said the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at a market, leading to speculation that it was brought in on the fish or its packaging.
 
Dr Ryan said the safety of food and its packaging should be looked at but added that he was ""reticent"" to say all food packaging needed testing. The Duke of Cambridge has made a surprise video call to a woman and her young son who have been shielding for the past three months. Prince William spoke to Leanne and five-year-old Kaydyn, who has cystic fibrosis, at their home in Corby, Northamptonshire. Footage of the call will feature on BBC One's The One Show at 19:00 on Tuesday.
Leanne was shown covering her mouth with her hands in shock as the duke called from his home in Norfolk. Last week, the Duke of Cambridge revealed he had been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. You can read more about his callhere. Iran's daily death count is more than 100 once again, raising alarm from the authorities Iran has warned it may have to reimpose strict measures against the coronavirus, as it reported more than 100 deaths for a second day running. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said there had been 113 new fatalities, taking the official death toll to 8,950 since Iran's outbreak began in February. She said a further 2,449 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. Iran started to relax its lockdown in mid-April after infections declined but has since seen a surge. There have also been concerns the official figures do not reflect the full extent of deaths and infections. On Monday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei criticised the lack of social distancing by people at holy sites and on public transport. ""In the [Tehran] subway, although 90% of passengers use masks, social distancing is not being observed,"" he said. ""If we find that the spread of the virus is out of control... then we will definitely apply strict decisions again."" A bargain dress or a new watchstrap - what do you really need after three months? As the coronavirus lockdown was eased further in England, queues formed outside many shops before they opened for the first time since March. Industry data shows the number of visitors to high streets, shopping centres and retail parks was up by almost half this morning, compared with last week -  but the levels were still far below the same period last year. Retailers have had to introduce strict safety measures such as plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Many shoppers seem confident in the measures being taken and were keen for a bargain - we spoke to some about their experiences and their first purchases and you can read about thathere. In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland.  The state is moving forward with its reopening process New York's death toll and total number of people sent to hospital due to Covid-19 have both fallen to the lowest points since the crisis began. On Monday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said this weekend had the fewest deaths on a three-day average since March. The number of positive tests has also continued to decline. Twenty-five people died of the virus on Sunday and there were just over 1,600 residents requiring hospital treatment for Covid-19 over the weekend. ""The facts are that new York is on the right track,"" he said, though noted it was unlikely the numbers would hit zero. ""It's coming down to what the doctor certifies as the cause of death, many people who pass away because of Covid have other underlying conditions."" The report comes as parts of the state enter the third phase of reopening; gatherings of up to 25 people will be allowed, up from 10, and many businesses are back open. But the governor also called out businesses and residents ignoring social distancing measures, saying the state had received 25,000 complaints of violations. The latest UK unemployment figures are due to be published by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow but several companies have announced plans to cut jobs today. Wickes owner Travis Perkins, the UK's biggest builders' merchant,plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. The group says it expects a UK recession to hit demand for building materials this year and in 2021. Jaguar Land Rover is set to cut up to 1,100 temporary jobs from its factory floors after it reported a Â£501m loss in the final quarter of its financial year. And75 jobs are under threat at the Titanic Belfast visitor centre, the BBC understands. The company has started a consultation over the potential redundancies. Frank KeoghBBC Sport Royal Ascot starts on Tuesday - but the famous British horse racing meeting will have a very different feel this year. The action will take place behind closed doors amid strict safety protocols because of the coronavirus pandemic - jockeys must undergo temperature checks and wear face masks. And while the fixture retains its regal title and branding, the Queen will not be in attendance for the first time in her 68-year reign. She is expected to watch television coverage from Windsor Castle. Racehorse owners are not allowed at the Berkshire track but will have access to a 360-degree live camera feed of runners in the parade ring, while people are being encouraged to wear a hat and dress up at home.

A spokesperson for the Spanish government has told the BBC that British travellers are âwelcome to travel to Spainâ from Sunday without facing quarantine measures or restrictions on arrival. It confirms a tweet posted earlier by the British embassy in Madrid, which said the UK had been included on the list of countries that will not face restrictions when Spain's borders reopen. Travellers returning to the UK will still have to self isolate for two weeks afterwards, however, and the UK government's official advice is still against any non-essential international travel.

Meanwhile, Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa said talks between the two countries on an ""air bridge"" were going well. The arrangement would allow UK visitors to avoid mandatory quarantine when they return home. ""We are working towards an agreement and will wait for it to happen,"" Costa told reporters. But he could not say when the air bridge might be in place. Government scientific and medical advisers were absent from the UK briefing today, but one, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has been speaking to football legend Ian Wright about the return of Premier League games this week. Prof Van-Tam says he is ""desperate to get back to the stadium"" of his beloved Boston United in Lincolnshire. But he cautions that it has to be done in a way that prevents transmission of the virus starting again - and that's why football's restart is limited to behind closed doors. ""Stay at home, watch the games at home, follow the rules,"" he says. Watch the full videobelow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Manager Brad Parscale said the ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, would be taking precautions for Covid-19 and the summer heat, including handing out masks and bottled water. And,as we reported earlier, those purchasing tickets for Trump's rally will have to sign a waiver confirming they ""voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19"" and will not hold the president's campaign responsible for ""any illness or injury"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters the campaign was making ""good"" decisions and that there was a ""recognition that there are guidelines in place that should be followed"". Health officials in the state have expressed concerns over the event, with Tulsa's health department chief sayinghe wished the rally would be postponed,external. Oklahoma has one of the country's lowest infection rates, and businesses are reopening, but the governor has urged residents to continue social distancing and minimise time in crowds.

Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor Food is more than twice as expensive as it was last year in Syria No-one knows exactly how much damage Syriaâs civil war
has done to the economy. One estimate is something like half a
trillion pounds ($630bn) worth of destruction. The pieces that remain are being battered by a new and
severe crisis. The result, says UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, is
that ""Syrians are hungry now en masse in a way which wasn't true one or
two years ago"". It is happening, he adds, as the economic
consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic start kicking in, not just in Syria but
across the world. ""What we're projecting globally is a doubling of the
people all across the planet who will be at starvation levels of hunger."" Read more:Assad under pressure as economic crisis batters Syria The government has released its latest figures and data on how the virus is affecting the UK. Here are graphs showing how the numbers are changing. You can find other key statistics - including how many cases there are in your area -here. Norway's health authorities have halted the roll-out of a coronavirus mobile phone app after it was criticised by the data protection authority. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) said it would delete all information collected so far, but warned that the move would weaken the fight against coronavirus. Norway's data protection authority (DPA) said on Friday that the potentially intrusive nature of the app Smittestopp (Infection stop) was not warranted, given the low rate of infection. About 1.5 million people downloaded it in the first week of its launch in April - more than a quarter of the population. The app is designed to show researchers where people are moving and to alert those who have been in contact with a Covid-19 carrier. ""We don't agree with the DPA's evaluation but feel it is necessary to delete all data and put work on hold as a result of
this,"" NIPH said in a statement. Read more: Contact-tracing apps face further hitches Social distancing rules mean only a quarter of students can be in school at once Secondary school students in England have begun to return to classes today - but how much time will they actually spend in school? A survey of 8,000 teachers suggests that 90% of their pupils will be in class for less than two days a week. Social distancing means schools can only accommodate a quarter of pupils in Years 10 and 12 at any one time, so different groups of students have to take turns to attend. Less than a third of schools are teaching all subject options, with most focusing on English, maths and science. Read the full story Testing has been increased in the area of the new outbreak in Beijing The World Health Organization says it expects China to share the full genetic sequence from the new coronavirus outbreak in Beijing with the rest of the world. Speaking in Geneva, head of health emergencies Dr Mike Ryan said it was expected as ""they have done in the past"". Beijing has seen a cluster of about 100 new cases of the virus, and is investigating the origins. Experts said the strain did not resemble the type found elsewhere in the country and genetic traces have suggested it could have originated in Europe. ""The finding that this may represent a strain more common in transmission in Europe is important and it may reflect
human-to-human transmission more than any other hypotheses,"" Dr Ryan said. Local media said the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at a market, leading to speculation that it was brought in on the fish or its packaging.
 
Dr Ryan said the safety of food and its packaging should be looked at but added that he was ""reticent"" to say all food packaging needed testing. The Duke of Cambridge has made a surprise video call to a woman and her young son who have been shielding for the past three months. Prince William spoke to Leanne and five-year-old Kaydyn, who has cystic fibrosis, at their home in Corby, Northamptonshire. Footage of the call will feature on BBC One's The One Show at 19:00 on Tuesday.
Leanne was shown covering her mouth with her hands in shock as the duke called from his home in Norfolk. Last week, the Duke of Cambridge revealed he had been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. You can read more about his callhere. Iran's daily death count is more than 100 once again, raising alarm from the authorities Iran has warned it may have to reimpose strict measures against the coronavirus, as it reported more than 100 deaths for a second day running. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said there had been 113 new fatalities, taking the official death toll to 8,950 since Iran's outbreak began in February. She said a further 2,449 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. Iran started to relax its lockdown in mid-April after infections declined but has since seen a surge. There have also been concerns the official figures do not reflect the full extent of deaths and infections. On Monday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei criticised the lack of social distancing by people at holy sites and on public transport. ""In the [Tehran] subway, although 90% of passengers use masks, social distancing is not being observed,"" he said. ""If we find that the spread of the virus is out of control... then we will definitely apply strict decisions again."" A bargain dress or a new watchstrap - what do you really need after three months? As the coronavirus lockdown was eased further in England, queues formed outside many shops before they opened for the first time since March. Industry data shows the number of visitors to high streets, shopping centres and retail parks was up by almost half this morning, compared with last week -  but the levels were still far below the same period last year. Retailers have had to introduce strict safety measures such as plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Many shoppers seem confident in the measures being taken and were keen for a bargain - we spoke to some about their experiences and their first purchases and you can read about thathere. In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland.  The state is moving forward with its reopening process New York's death toll and total number of people sent to hospital due to Covid-19 have both fallen to the lowest points since the crisis began. On Monday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said this weekend had the fewest deaths on a three-day average since March. The number of positive tests has also continued to decline. Twenty-five people died of the virus on Sunday and there were just over 1,600 residents requiring hospital treatment for Covid-19 over the weekend. ""The facts are that new York is on the right track,"" he said, though noted it was unlikely the numbers would hit zero. ""It's coming down to what the doctor certifies as the cause of death, many people who pass away because of Covid have other underlying conditions."" The report comes as parts of the state enter the third phase of reopening; gatherings of up to 25 people will be allowed, up from 10, and many businesses are back open. But the governor also called out businesses and residents ignoring social distancing measures, saying the state had received 25,000 complaints of violations. The latest UK unemployment figures are due to be published by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow but several companies have announced plans to cut jobs today. Wickes owner Travis Perkins, the UK's biggest builders' merchant,plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. The group says it expects a UK recession to hit demand for building materials this year and in 2021. Jaguar Land Rover is set to cut up to 1,100 temporary jobs from its factory floors after it reported a Â£501m loss in the final quarter of its financial year. And75 jobs are under threat at the Titanic Belfast visitor centre, the BBC understands. The company has started a consultation over the potential redundancies. Frank KeoghBBC Sport Royal Ascot starts on Tuesday - but the famous British horse racing meeting will have a very different feel this year. The action will take place behind closed doors amid strict safety protocols because of the coronavirus pandemic - jockeys must undergo temperature checks and wear face masks. And while the fixture retains its regal title and branding, the Queen will not be in attendance for the first time in her 68-year reign. She is expected to watch television coverage from Windsor Castle. Racehorse owners are not allowed at the Berkshire track but will have access to a 360-degree live camera feed of runners in the parade ring, while people are being encouraged to wear a hat and dress up at home. An expanded programme sees six additional races for a total of 36 contests over five days. Â© 2025 BBC.

"There is ""much more that we need to do"" to tackle racism, Boris Johnson has said as he announced a new commission to look at all ""aspects of inequality"". Writing in the Telegraph,external, the PM said ""no-one who cares about this country"" could ignore the anti-racist protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd. But Labour's David Lammy said it was time for action, not another review. The PM also said the UK should not attempt to ""re-write the past"" by removing historical symbols. The UK's heritage should be left ""broadly in peace"", he added. The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Protesters clash with police in central London 'We stopped somebody from being killed' Mr Johnson condemned the ""far-right thugs"" involved in violent protests on Saturday, which saw more than 100 people arrested in London after thousands gathered saying they were protecting statues. He said their mission was ""utterly absurd"" but he added that it was ""deplorable"" that Sir Winston Churchill's statue had been in danger of attack. It comes after the statue in Parliament Square was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" last weekend. In Bristol, anti-racism protesters pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces inquiry into racial inequality Thousands of people have marched in the UK as part of Black Lives Matter demonstrationsfollowing the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. The prime minister said he was setting up a commission to look at inequality as it was ""no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism"". He wrote: ""There is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality - in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life."" Questions over inequality in health outcomes have been repeatedly raised during the coronavirus pandemic after figures showedmore people from ethnic minority backgrounds were ""disproportionately"" dying with the virus. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said a number of inquiries into racial inequality had already been carried out, such ashis own reporton the treatment of black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system and Theresa May'sRace Disparity Audit,external. ""You can understand why it feels like, yet again in the UK, we want figures, data, but we don't want action,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Black people aren't playing victim as Boris indicates, they're protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now."" Mr Lammy said the announcement lacked detail because it was ""written on the back of a fag packet yesterday to assuage the Black Lives Matter protest"". He called for legislation and the recommendations of past reviews to be implemented. The Race Disparity Audit, published by then Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017, showed inequalities between ethnicities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and the courts The 2017Lammy Reviewfound evidence of bias and discrimination against people from ethnic minority backgrounds in the justice system in England and Wales Also in 2017,the McGregor-Smith Reviewof race in the workplace found people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were still disadvantaged at work and faced lower employment rates than their white counterparts Anindependent review of the Windrush scandal, published in March, found the Home Office showed ""institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race"" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the new commission would be run out of the Cabinet Office and report to the prime minister, and it would be asked to finish its work by Christmas.

"There is ""much more that we need to do"" to tackle racism, Boris Johnson has said as he announced a new commission to look at all ""aspects of inequality"". Writing in the Telegraph,external, the PM said ""no-one who cares about this country"" could ignore the anti-racist protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd. But Labour's David Lammy said it was time for action, not another review. The PM also said the UK should not attempt to ""re-write the past"" by removing historical symbols. The UK's heritage should be left ""broadly in peace"", he added. The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Protesters clash with police in central London 'We stopped somebody from being killed' Mr Johnson condemned the ""far-right thugs"" involved in violent protests on Saturday, which saw more than 100 people arrested in London after thousands gathered saying they were protecting statues. He said their mission was ""utterly absurd"" but he added that it was ""deplorable"" that Sir Winston Churchill's statue had been in danger of attack. It comes after the statue in Parliament Square was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" last weekend. In Bristol, anti-racism protesters pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces inquiry into racial inequality Thousands of people have marched in the UK as part of Black Lives Matter demonstrationsfollowing the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. The prime minister said he was setting up a commission to look at inequality as it was ""no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism"". He wrote: ""There is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality - in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life."" Questions over inequality in health outcomes have been repeatedly raised during the coronavirus pandemic after figures showedmore people from ethnic minority backgrounds were ""disproportionately"" dying with the virus. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said a number of inquiries into racial inequality had already been carried out, such ashis own reporton the treatment of black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system and Theresa May'sRace Disparity Audit,external. ""You can understand why it feels like, yet again in the UK, we want figures, data, but we don't want action,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Black people aren't playing victim as Boris indicates, they're protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now."" Mr Lammy said the announcement lacked detail because it was ""written on the back of a fag packet yesterday to assuage the Black Lives Matter protest"". He called for legislation and the recommendations of past reviews to be implemented. The Race Disparity Audit, published by then Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017, showed inequalities between ethnicities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and the courts The 2017Lammy Reviewfound evidence of bias and discrimination against people from ethnic minority backgrounds in the justice system in England and Wales Also in 2017,the McGregor-Smith Reviewof race in the workplace found people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were still disadvantaged at work and faced lower employment rates than their white counterparts Anindependent review of the Windrush scandal, published in March, found the Home Office showed ""institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race"" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the new commission would be run out of the Cabinet Office and report to the prime minister, and it would be asked to finish its work by Christmas. A chair has not yet been identified but the commission will be overseen by Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, with independent members also on the panel.

"Shops across England selling non-essential goods are welcoming back customers from today as the unlocking of the High Street begins. Thousands of of people queue outside of Primark stores across England Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to ""shop with confidence"". Retailers are required to introduce plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers two metres (6ft 5ins) apart. Updates on Monday, 15 June Jennifer Meierhans, Jay Vydelingum, Rob England and Chris Heard Rob EnglandBBC News We've seen joy and frustration from shoppers, and queues, lots of queues, as retailers across England reopened for the first time since lockdown began in March. But, as all things must, our live coverage has come to an end for the day. Join us again tomorrow morning at 07:30 for all the latest coronavirus news and updates. Stay safe. Here's the view from across England as non-essential shops opened today for the first time since lockdown began in March. London: Birmingham: Southampton: It is the first day in nearly three months that shops selling non-essential goods, such as clothing and electronics, have been allowed to open. Here's a quick roundup of what the first day of shopping looked like: This video can not be played Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit With millions of workers on furlough and workplaces closed
due to lockdown, bosses across many industries stopped hiring. According to analysis by the Office for National Statistics,
the volume of job adverts posted in the last month is less than half the average
for 2019. Catering and hospitality and manufacturing have seen
the biggest slumps â down to 18% and 21% of their average for last year. Retail and
wholesale job adverts have also fallen to below a quarter of last year's average. The ONS compiled the figures by analysing the jobs website
Adzuna. Rob EnglandBBC News As people joinedqueues outside many shops across England, what were they looking to buy after three months of lockdown? Retailer John Lewis reported the first products sold at the two stores it reopened today was a china tea set, in Kingston, and an iPhone 11, at its Poole store in Dorset. Today's top sellers included buttons, face masks, towels, sofas, egg cups and baby sleepsuits. The company said,externalthe popularity of buttons appeared to be down to the items being used in conjunction with face masks to stop the elastic straps rubbing behind the ears. They are also thought to have been wanted by people who have taken up sewing and knitting during lockdown, requiring buttons for their handmade goods. Other popular items sold on Monday were pillowcases and bed sheets, televisions and printer cartridges, it added. Rob EnglandBBC News Despite a good start for shops on Monday, social distancing rules must be relaxed or thousands of jobs could be at risk, a retail boss has said. It comes as non-essential stores complying with government coronavirus guidelineswelcomed customers for the first time since lockdown began. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive at New West End Company - a partnership of 600 retail, restaurant, hotel and property owners - said: ""The businesses that have opened have a nice customer trade coming in, people are queueing, which is very good."" Mr Tyrrell added that the two-metre (6ft) rule could cause up to 50,000 jobs to be at risk if it stayed in place due to loss of sales. ""There's no doubt this year will be one of the most challenging ever we have experienced in retail in the West End,"" he said. ""If we don't address social distancing and the international quarantine, we could easily see over 50,000 job losses here... alone. We could lose about Â£5 billion in sales, so of course it is going to be a long recovery."" Marc Ashdown From tiny traders to billion
pound behemoths, the lockdown saw businesses across London plunged into a
sudden deep freeze. Now the task of reviving
them from hibernation begins. Itâs not as simple as
flinging the doors open and welcoming a shop full of eager customers once
again. There are serious questions for shops of all shapes and sizes around how
to keep staff and customers safe, but also how viable they genuinely can be in
this radically different trading climate. For Londonâs beleaguered
smaller high streets, those who survive the thaw may actually see a boost in
trade. Bargain offers could whet the appetite, as long as social distancing
measures convince shoppers to venture out. But with the message to
avoid public transport still ringing loud and clear, a walk down the local
parade or town centre may seem a much more attractive proposition now than
kitting the family in masks and dragging them to the West End for a day out. The trick will be balance
and flexibility. The balance between the
shopper experience and safety will be delicate and needs to be attractive
enough to entice people in. So queuing systems, protective equipment and
distancing has to be managed in a sensible way to maintain confidence and
enjoyment. But if it all starts to go
wrong, those who show the flexibility to adapt and change things up quickly
will have a better chance of surviving and even thriving. Shantel Brown, 35, was shopping in Milton Keynes with her daughter Tee, who is 16. Shantel said: ""I bought nightwear and baby clothes because Primark was open. I'm pregnant and I've been waiting to get some baby stuff. ""Everyone keeps their distance. They've got sanitiser at the entrance. As long as we've got our masks on we're fine."" Tee added: ""I bought tops, shorts and summer clothes. I came because mum forced me."" Greg Dulson, 68, was shopping for a new watch strap. ""The strap on my favourite watch broke and I brought it in to the watchmaker's the day before lockdown,"" he said. ""They said come back tomorrow, but it was closed!"" Katie Kirby, who is 18, was shopping with her 21-year-old boyfriend Zac Hopkins. ""I bought a jumpsuit because Primark was open and the weather's getting better again,"" said Katie. ""I did go just to get some essentials like pants and socks, but I when I saw the jumpsuit I had to treat myself because the shops haven't been open for so long."" ""We do keep our distance in the store. We thought it would be a different shopping experience but once we were in there it was just the same."" Zac Hopkins added: ""I bought a skipping rope, so I can do some exercise at home."" James DawsonBBC Yorkshire As thousands of people head back to high streets across the country for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic started, I've been speaking to shoppers in Leeds. Bertran Hardy and Lauryn
Wiley (pictured above), both 18, have been out shopping in Leeds today while trying to maintain social
distance from each other. ""How theyâve done it is really
[good], how everything is socially distanced,â Bertran said of the re-opened stores. âI like that all the shops have got
hand sanitiser. It think itâs good to get the economy going again.â Lauryn added that the pair have
âavoided the queuesâ by shopping at quieter retailers. Bertran also says he now feels less
worried about coronavirus than he did at the beginning of lockdown. âAs the measures have become less
strict, everyoneâs forgotten about it and itâs now less of a worry,"" he

Sports Direct and JD Sports in the city centre have opened for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown, along with Primark. Improvement work around the city centre is continuing, said the council, with a few issues ""still to be ironed out,"" as the spaces open back up again.

Much to his delight, he was welcomed back by a queue of 10 customers when his shop opened this morning. Mr Wade said: âItâs great to see people come back. The phone
hasnât stopped. âWe suspected it would be busy because we have loyal
customers. âWe have lost three months of trading and there is no way of
telling the impact until three monthsâ time. Iâm optimistic.â Sandish ShokerBBC News Another city that's seen huge queues outside retailers is Nottingham. Hundreds of people waited to get into Primark, with the queue winding back into nearby Market Square.

"Anyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering from Monday under a new rule. More than 3,000 extra staff including police officers are being deployed at stations to make sure people comply. Passengers without a covering will be asked to wear one, or will face being refused onboard or fined Â£100. People with certain health conditions, disabled people and children under the age of 11 will be exempt from the rule. In the coming days, hundreds of thousands of free coverings will be handed out at railway stations. The government says masks can be homemade, such as a scarf or bandana. As well as on transport, all hospital visitors and outpatients also have to wear masks. The face covering rules in more detail How to make your own face mask Why we should all be wearing face masks The UK governmentchanged its advice,externalon face masks to stop the spread of coronavirus earlier this month, as more people used public transport to go back to work. It is now in line withthe World Health Organization's advice. The new rules apply to England and require anyone travelling by bus, coach, train, tram, Tube, ferry or plane to cover their face while on board. They exclude school transport, taxis and private hire vehicles - althoughUber has made face coverings compulsoryfor passengers and drivers. The rules apply only while travelling - not while waiting - but the rail industry has asked people to cover their face as they enter a station. This video can not be played The masks should be made of cotton, and even an old pair of socks can be used to cover your face The compulsory rules do not apply inScotland,,externalWalesorNorthern Ireland- but their governments recommend that people cover their faces in places where social distancing is difficult, including on public transport. Passenger numbers are expected to reach about 20% of capacity on the railways by early next month. At those levels, social distancing of 2m might still be possible, says BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge - but social distancing will not be possible if passenger numbers increase to around 50% of capacity after the summer as predicted. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said remembering to travel with a face covering should become part of people's daily routine. He also urged people against using medical masks, saying they must be kept for clinical settings. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? More than 3,000 extra staff from British Transport Police, Network Rail, train operators and Transport for London are being deployed at major stations and transport hubs. Rail unions have welcomed the face masks rule - but have called for social distancing to still be followed and transport workers to be treated with respect. Transport operators will be able to refuse travel or issue fines to passengers who break the rules The head of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), Manuel Cortes, said: ""This must not be seen as a green light among the wider population to use public transport. ""It must remain the case that only the key workers who are keeping us safe during the pandemic continue to use public transport."" The governmenturges people,externalto consider all other forms of transport before public transport. All NHS hospital staff (not just medics), visitors and outpatientswill also have to wear face coverings,externalin England. The government said people should arrive at hospital with a face covering, but if not a face mask will be provided in emergencies. However, the doctors' union the British Medical Association has criticised the government for not properly planning for the rules in hospitals, saying some NHS services have been left ""confused and unprepared"". The BMA said it was inappropriate for hospitals to have to supply masks to patients and visitors who arrive without a covering, especiallyfollowing shortagesof some types of personal protective equipment. The new face covering rules will ""inevitably lead to an increased demand"", the BMA said. Common household items like cotton fabric from old T-shirts or bedding can be used to make a mask The government said,externalit has adequate stocks of face masks to meet demand and continues to pursue contracts for additional stock. It said more guidance for hospitals will be published on Monday to allow hospitals to get stocks and plans in place. Also on Monday, all non-essential shops can reopen in England for the first time since the lockdown began. Which shops are reopening on Monday? Five ways shopping will be different from now on It comes as a further 36 people died with the coronavirus in the UK, taking the total to 41,698,the UK government announced on Sunday.,external The latest daily figure is the lowest since before lockdown began on 23 March, but there tends to be fewer deaths reported at the weekend, because of a reporting lag. Meanwhile,France is lifting a number of coronavirus restrictionson Monday. Cafes and restaurants can open, travel to other European countries is allowed. Several other countries in Europe including Belgium, Croatia, Switzerland and Germany are also reopening their borders between EU countries on Monday.

Adzuna. Rob EnglandBBC News As people joinedqueues outside many shops across England, what were they looking to buy after three months of lockdown? Retailer John Lewis reported the first products sold at the two stores it reopened today was a china tea set, in Kingston, and an iPhone 11, at its Poole store in Dorset. Today's top sellers included buttons, face masks, towels, sofas, egg cups and baby sleepsuits. The company said,externalthe popularity of buttons appeared to be down to the items being used in conjunction with face masks to stop the elastic straps rubbing behind the ears. They are also thought to have been wanted by people who have taken up sewing and knitting during lockdown, requiring buttons for their handmade goods. Other popular items sold on Monday were pillowcases and bed sheets, televisions and printer cartridges, it added. Rob EnglandBBC News Despite a good start for shops on Monday, social distancing rules must be relaxed or thousands of jobs could be at risk, a retail boss has said. It comes as non-essential stores complying with government coronavirus guidelineswelcomed customers for the first time since lockdown began. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive at New West End Company - a partnership of 600 retail, restaurant, hotel and property owners - said: ""The businesses that have opened have a nice customer trade coming in, people are queueing, which is very good."" Mr Tyrrell added that the two-metre (6ft) rule could cause up to 50,000 jobs to be at risk if it stayed in place due to loss of sales. ""There's no doubt this year will be one of the most challenging ever we have experienced in retail in the West End,"" he said. ""If we don't address social distancing and the international quarantine, we could easily see over 50,000 job losses here... alone. We could lose about Â£5 billion in sales, so of course it is going to be a long recovery."" Marc Ashdown From tiny traders to billion
pound behemoths, the lockdown saw businesses across London plunged into a
sudden deep freeze. Now the task of reviving
them from hibernation begins. Itâs not as simple as
flinging the doors open and welcoming a shop full of eager customers once
again. There are serious questions for shops of all shapes and sizes around how
to keep staff and customers safe, but also how viable they genuinely can be in
this radically different trading climate. For Londonâs beleaguered
smaller high streets, those who survive the thaw may actually see a boost in
trade. Bargain offers could whet the appetite, as long as social distancing
measures convince shoppers to venture out. But with the message to
avoid public transport still ringing loud and clear, a walk down the local
parade or town centre may seem a much more attractive proposition now than
kitting the family in masks and dragging them to the West End for a day out. The trick will be balance
and flexibility. The balance between the
shopper experience and safety will be delicate and needs to be attractive
enough to entice people in. So queuing systems, protective equipment and
distancing has to be managed in a sensible way to maintain confidence and
enjoyment. But if it all starts to go
wrong, those who show the flexibility to adapt and change things up quickly
will have a better chance of surviving and even thriving. Shantel Brown, 35, was shopping in Milton Keynes with her daughter Tee, who is 16. Shantel said: ""I bought nightwear and baby clothes because Primark was open. I'm pregnant and I've been waiting to get some baby stuff. ""Everyone keeps their distance. They've got sanitiser at the entrance. As long as we've got our masks on we're fine."" Tee added: ""I bought tops, shorts and summer clothes. I came because mum forced me."" Greg Dulson, 68, was shopping for a new watch strap. ""The strap on my favourite watch broke and I brought it in to the watchmaker's the day before lockdown,"" he said. ""They said come back tomorrow, but it was closed!"" Katie Kirby, who is 18, was shopping with her 21-year-old boyfriend Zac Hopkins. ""I bought a jumpsuit because Primark was open and the weather's getting better again,"" said Katie. ""I did go just to get some essentials like pants and socks, but I when I saw the jumpsuit I had to treat myself because the shops haven't been open for so long."" ""We do keep our distance in the store. We thought it would be a different shopping experience but once we were in there it was just the same."" Zac Hopkins added: ""I bought a skipping rope, so I can do some exercise at home."" James DawsonBBC Yorkshire As thousands of people head back to high streets across the country for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic started, I've been speaking to shoppers in Leeds. Bertran Hardy and Lauryn
Wiley (pictured above), both 18, have been out shopping in Leeds today while trying to maintain social
distance from each other. ""How theyâve done it is really
[good], how everything is socially distanced,â Bertran said of the re-opened stores. âI like that all the shops have got
hand sanitiser. It think itâs good to get the economy going again.â Lauryn added that the pair have
âavoided the queuesâ by shopping at quieter retailers. Bertran also says he now feels less
worried about coronavirus than he did at the beginning of lockdown. âAs the measures have become less
strict, everyoneâs forgotten about it and itâs now less of a worry,"" he

"This video can not be played Man Utd's Rashford speaks about mother's sacrifices in his bid to end food poverty Marcus Rashford has called on the government to reverse a decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, saying that ""the system isn't built for families like mine to succeed"". The Manchester United and England forward has raised aboutÂ£20m to supply three million mealsto vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. Campaigners have threatened to bringlegal action against the governmentfor not extending the food voucher scheme into the summer holidays. In an emotional open letter to MPs drawing on his own experiences of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up, Rashford said his story is ""all too familiar for families in England"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast about the letter, Rashford, 22, said: ""It's written from the heart and it's about how my life was at the moment - the letter is to open up and let people understand the impact on families and to know I've done the right thing. ""What families are going through now, I've once had to go through that - and it's very difficult to find a way out. It's very important for me to help people who are struggling. Whether the outcome changes or doesn't change - that's why I wrote it."" In England, about 1.3 million children from low income backgrounds are eligible for free school meals. To qualify, their household must earn a maximum income of Â£7,400 a year after tax, not including any benefits. The full criteria is listedhere.,external A child who qualifies remains eligible until 31 March 2022, whether in primary or secondary education. Children from families who meet certain criteria can also be eligible for free school meals before they start school. During the pandemic,the government says,externalit expects schools to continue to support eligible children in term time. This includes: Food parcels A national voucher scheme Vouchers for a local shop or supermarket This provision included the Easter and May half-term holidays, but the voucher schemes will not run during the summer holidays. In Wales, the government will provide free school meal vouchers until schools reopen, or at least until the end of August In the letter, Rashford wrote: ""My mum worked full-time, earning the minimum wage, to make sure we always had a good evening meal on the table, but it was not enough. ""The system was not built for families like mine to succeed, regardless of how hard my mum worked."" Rashford added his plea for the government to ""make the U-turn and make protecting the lives of some of our most vulnerable a top priority"" was ""not about politics"" but about ""humanity"". He added that it was about ""looking at ourselves in the mirror and feeling like we did everything we could to protect those who can't, for whatever reason or circumstance, protect themselves"". The Department for Education confirmed the scheme would not run during summer holidays: ""As schools open more widely, and their kitchens reopen, we expect schools to make food parcels available for collection or delivery for any children that are eligible for free school meals who are not yet able to return to school. Where this is not possible, schools can continue to offer vouchers to eligible pupils. The spokesperson also pointed to the new Â£63m local authority welfare assistance scheme to support the most vulnerable families, and its Holiday Activities and Food programme, which offers activities and free meals in the summer holidays. Families claiming free school meals have been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card - worth Â£15 per child, per week - to spend at supermarkets, while schools have been closed. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford speaks to BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent about his childhood Rashford wrote: ""Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to be hungry?"" The United youth-team graduate, who is one of five children, added: ""As a black man from a low-income family in Wythenshawe, Manchester, I could have been just another statistic. ""Instead, due to the selfless actions of my mum, my family, my neighbours, and my coaches, the only stats I'm associated with are goals, appearances and caps. ""I would be doing myself, my family and my community an injustice if I didn't stand here today with my voice and my platform and ask you for help."" Around1.3m children in England,externalare eligible for free school meals anda survey by the Food Foundation in May,externalsaid that more than 200,000 children have had to skip meals because their family could not access enough food during lockdown. ""Ten years ago, I would have been one of those children, and you would never have heard my voice and seen my determination to become part of the solution,"" said Rashford. ""Food poverty in England is a pandemic that could span generations if we don't course correct now."" Rashford stated that the government's Universal Credit benefit system ""is simply not a short-term solution"" to the issue of food poverty, because ""I am fully aware that the majority of families applying are experiencing five-week delays"". He is concerned that child poverty is ""only going to get worse"" when the government's furlough scheme ends. Rashford added that with many children still not able to return to school and have more of their nutritional needs met ""we're encouraging this cycle of hardship to continue"". A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said Boris Johnson ""will respond to Marcus Rashford's letter as soon as he can"", adding the footballer ""has been using his profile in a positive way to highlight some important issues"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""This is such an important and moving letter. Thank you, Marcus, for all the work you are doing to support children during the coronavirus crisis."" Marcus Rashford with his mum Mel. He wrote: ""Without the kindness and generosity of the community I had around me, there wouldn't be the Marcus Rashford you see today: a 22-year old black man lucky enough to make a career playing a game I love.""

"This video can not be played What's it now like shopping for clothes? After three months of hibernation, non-essential shops in England will finally be able to re-open on Monday. But it is clear Covid-19 will have a lasting impact on retail well beyond the end of lockdown. There's socially distanced shopping, for starters. The new retail rules during this pandemic may take a bit of getting used to. It's one thing queueing for groceries, but we're going to have to be prepared to queue to get into all the other shops, too. We're being encouraged to shop alone and to avoid touching things, where possible. You may have to forget trying clothes on as the guidance says fitting rooms should be closed wherever possible. Coronavirus is going to suck some of the fun out of one of our most popular social activities and not all of us will fancy waiting in line when we can buy what we want online. Shoppers outside a reopened Ikea store: queueing when we shop will now be more common Duncan Brewer, head of the UK retail and consumer team at consultants Oliver Wyman, says people may also be more careful with their money. ""Consumers have changed their spending habits, and will be increasingly used to going without much of their discretionary shopping. ""With the inevitable recession coming, it's likely that many will continue to be careful with spending, even if they are comfortable shopping in the first place."" There's clearly a bit of pent-up demand, given the spectacular queues outside Ikea stores when they recently re-opened. But even if queueing becomes part of everyday life for now, it doesn't mean bumper profits for retailers. Social distancing makes it hard for many firms to trade profitably. Fewer shoppers means fewer transactions which may not cover all the costs of running stores, especially when government support measures start to ebb away. ""When we do start opening up, it certainly won't be profitable, but we've got to start somewhere,"" the retail entrepreneur and businessmen Theo Paphitis told me recently as he prepared to reopen his Robert Dyas, Boux Lingerie and Ryman stores. This video can not be played Theo Paphitis: âMrs P has been ordering online every day!â He believes coronavirus has speeded up our changing shopping habits. Online sales have been rising steadily over the last decade but they've rocketed during the pandemic. According to a survey by Visa,external, a third of Britons bought items online for the first time during lockdown.  And that is likely to be a permanent shift - just look at food shopping. According to the most recent monthly figures from Kantar, nearly one in five households ordered groceries online - 1.6 million more than this time last year. Non-food retailers have also seen a huge spike in online sales. KPMG estimates online retailing could reach 50% of the total goods we buy by 2025, five years earlier than previously anticipated. ""The necessity for many retailers to change business models, review their cost base including the amount of physical space they require, has been turbo-charged,"" says Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG. Numbers in stores will be limited to comply with social distancing With more done online, retailers need fewer shops. This was so long before coronavirus came along, yet the economics of store-based retailing look even more tricky now. Not all shops will open immediately. It will be a gradual re-opening for some big chains. And some shops will never re-open, although as yet it's difficult to say how many. Debenhams - in administration for the second time - has already said 17 of its stores will remain permanently closed. Others have already failed to make it through lockdown - Cath Kidston, Oasis and Warehouse - and there will be more to come. High Street fashion chain Oasis has been one of the retail casualties of the lockdown ""There will continue to be business failures - but there is also opportunity for the better capitalised and more agile retailers,"" says Lisa Hooker, PWC's head of retail and consumer markets. Retailers have been able to furlough workers and save huge sums with a year-long business rates holiday, but many costs have continued leaving them with an almighty cash squeeze. Some won't be able to pay their rent for months to come. Also, given the problems and debt burdens that many big businesses have, access to the government's bailout loan schemes is proving challenging given the strict credit worthiness tests from lenders.  More debt is the last thing some retailers need as any loans will later have to be paid off alongside deferred costs such as VAT. Debenhams has already said 17 of its department stores will remain permanently closed For weaker businesses, coronavirus has brought all their problems to a head. Watch out for Darwinism in retail over the next 18 months, says Paul Martin. ""Those with an appealing customer proposition and valid business models, that are really fit for purpose with strong balance sheets will survive. Those that have neither will fall by the wayside"" If more shops shut, who and what will fill the gaps? ""There are so many implications for town centres,"" says Ojay McDonald, CEO of the Association of Town and Centre Management. ""Many businesses in some city locations may be unviable as organisations who use large office spaces may be more supportive of home working, which will mean a big decrease in footfall and spend in these areas."" Over the next 12-18 months there will plenty of turmoil on Britain's High Streets But equally, there could be a boost to towns and villages, if more people are working from home. ""Covid-19 has shone a light on the need for many big chains to accelerate store closures but the lockdown has also led us to want to shop locally - so some High Streets will flourish,"" believes Lisa Hooker. Duncan Brewer also thinks there will be opportunities for new businesses: ""Up to 25% of retail sites could be vacant. This large amount of retail space available will allow new entrants to launch new businesses without all the historic barriers to entry,"" Coronavirus could help reinvent our High Streets and town centres. But over the next 12-18 months there will plenty of turmoil, too.

"Many non-essential shops have already reopened, and now restaurants, pubs, hairdressers, outdoor gyms, and other venues will be able to join them from 4 July So, what can customers expect? Shops in England, including those offering clothes, toys, books and electronics, are already throwing open their doors to customers again. Shops in Northern Ireland have reopened too. Many have been announcing their plans: John Lewis isstarting by opening 13 branchesin stages Next is reopening just 25 of its 500 stores at first Debenhams isreopening 50 stores in Englandand three in Northern Ireland Marks and Spencer is reopening all its shops in England and Northern Ireland JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its stores in England Primark is reopening all 153 of its stores in England Argos, which has kept outlets in Sainsbury's stores open, is reopening 145 standalone stores for click and collect TopShop is reopening all its stores in England and selected ones in Northern Ireland Music retailer HMV is reopening 93 of its 113 stores Currys PC World is reopening 131 of its outlets Mobile phone operators are reopening too. Three UK is starting with 250 stores, Vodafone is opening 65 and EE is opening all its shops in England, while O2 has opened ""some"" shops River Island is opening 150 stores, with more to follow on Thursday Gap is reopening all its 81 shops in England H&M is opening ""the majority"" of its English stores DIY, furniture and bicycle stores have also been reopening, following garden centres, open-air markets and car showrooms. Furniture giant Ikeaopened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations stayed open during lockdown. Can my boss force me to go back to work? Shops which reopenmust meet the government's Covid-19 secure guidelines.,external These include showing customers they are aware of safety measures, putting protective coverings on large items like beds or sofas, and frequent cleaning of regularly-touched surfaces. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2 metres (6ft) apart had become a regular fixture. But this 2m-metre rule has now been reduced to a minimum of 1m. But some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - have been announced by some other shops. For example, John Lewis will clean baskets after each use, and will not let customers use fitting rooms. Services such as personal styling, the bureau de change and food and drink outlets will be closed. Marks & Spencer will also not be offering all of its services, such as its bra-fitting service, for example. What will a post-lockdown high street look like? Jobs go as Debenhams shuts more stores All the staff at Next will wear plastic visors, with the option to also wear masks if they want to. Waterstones says it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. River Island says it will do the same with items of clothing, Currys PC World says only 42 of its shops will be fully open from Monday, with full browsing access for customers. In another 89 outlets, shoppers will be able to request products at the entrance and have them collected by staff. Some shops, including Three UK and River Island, will have reduced opening hours to begin with. H&M says it will make customers use different entrances and exits, while only a limited number of people will be allowed in at any one time. Stores have been askedto encourage people to shop alone,external. Big retailers have been urged to talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible,to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited, while shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. A reduction of the 2m distancing rule to what the prime minister called a ""1m-plus rule"" means many businesses in England have been given the green light to reopen from 4 July. Pubs and restaurants can start serving customers indoors, although it will be limited to table service only. Hairdressers can reopen, but staff must wear visors. Museums, hotels, cinemas, camping parks and outdoor gyms are among other areas that can also reopen provided safety measures are in place, such as distancing. But nightclubs, swimming pools, indoor gyms and casinos are among sectors that will remain closed. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping In Northern Ireland,all shops are now allowed to open. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said thatall shops can open on Monday 22 Juneas long as they havesocial distancing measuresin place. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that smaller shops and outdoor marketswill be allowed to reopen from 29 June in phase twoof the country's lockdown-easing plan. Shops of all sizes will be able to open from that date as long as they have outdoor entrances and exits. Indoor shopping centres will remain closed, except for essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacists. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in his latest easing measures that he expects Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to continue ""responding at their own pace"". The British Retail Consortium (BRC) predicted that it may take time for customers to return to their old shopping habits. It estimated that the lockdown has cost non-essential retailers Â£1.8bn a week in lost sales. However,there were queues outside some Primark shops in London and Birminghambefore their 08:00 BST opening times. And the Birmingham branch opened its doors 35 minutes early to satisfy the demand. Primark says no 'special discounts' at reopening Most shops - like this Primark in Birmingham - have been locked since 23 March Queues also formed outside shops such as TK Maxx and Foot Lockerin the centre of Manchester. With many people fearful for their jobs, now may not be the time to splurge on the High Street - but there may be bargains.

"More than one million people have fallen through cracks in government schemes designed to support them during the coronavirus crisis, MPs says. The Treasury Select Committee called on ministers to plug gaps in the schemes to fulfil the government's promise of ""doing whatever it takes"". Freelancers and recent employees are among those who cannot access support, the MPs say. The Treasury said the schemes protected millions of jobs and livelihoods. But the committee's interim report, which was unanimously agreed by members, said it was still not enough. ""The Treasury's interventions have been welcomed by many but rolling out financial support at pace and scale has inevitably resulted in some hard edges in policy design and some critical gaps in provision,"" the committee said. ""The government must assist these people if it is to completely fulfil its promise to do whatever it takes to protect people from the economic impact of coronavirus."" 'Forgotten' TV freelancers call for 'urgent help' Bank of England 'ready to act' as economy reels The MPs said hundreds of thousands of people are suffering financial hardship through no fault of their own, often due to unfortunate timing in starting a new job or their employer's choice of timing in submitting payroll paperwork to the HMRC tax authority. When lockdown first started, the Treasury said it would cover up to 80% of the salaries of workers who were unable to do their job from home. But those who started a new job after the government's 28 February cut-off date are not covered by the scheme. Although this was later extended by three weeks, many have still been left behind, the committee said. Retailers get ready to reopen after three months Which areas have the most furloughed workers? Do you feel you have missed out on the support offered by the government during the coronavirus crisis? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The committee also said the government is failing to help those who have become self-employed within the last year and those whose companies have annual trading profits of more than Â£50,000. Another group that has fallen through the net is freelancers or those on short-term contracts. The MPs said that in industries such as television and theatre, where short-term contracts are the norm, many workers are not entitled to support under the schemes. The report said: ""This cannot be right. The government should give this group access to financial support that equates to 80% of their average monthly income, up to a total of Â£2,500 per month."" The report comes amid growing unease about the health of the economy, which contracted by a record 20.4% in April. There are warnings of huge job losses once the furlough schemes are wound down. On Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged on the Andrew Marr show ""there is going to be hardship ahead"". Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride said: ""The chancellor has said that he will do whatever it takes to support people and businesses from the economic impact of the pandemic. Overall, he has acted at impressive scale and pace. ""However, the committee has identified well over a million people who, through no fault of their own, have lost livelihoods while being locked down and locked out of the main support programmes."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The swift and targeted action we've taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee. ""Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world - with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than Â£6.5 billion injected into the welfare safety net. ""All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.""

"Security guards at a residential area under restrictions near Yuquan East Market in Beijing Beijing has recorded 36 new locally-transmitted coronavirus cases, amid fears of a second wave in the Chinese capital. Another 36 cases were also recorded on Saturday. The city had previously seen no new cases in more than 50 days. The country's Vice Premier Sun Chunlan called on officials to take ""decisive measures"", warning that the risk of further spread remained high. The outbreak has been linked to the city's largest wholesale market. The general manager of the market has been dismissed, along with other local officials. Three other provinces - Liaoning, Hebei and Sichuan - have also reported confirmed or suspected cases connected to Beijing. Local media reports say the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at the market, prompting major supermarkets in Beijing to pull the fish from their shelves. Did China test a whole city in 10 days? What did China do about early outbreak? According to China's National Health Commission, Beijing recorded one new virus case on Thursday and six on Friday - the first cases in almost two months. On Saturday, 36 new local cases were recorded in Beijing, all related to Xinfadi market - which has been described by state media outlet CGTN as the biggest wholesale market in all of Asia. The market was quickly placed under lockdown and restrictions were imposed in 11 nearby neighbourhoods. On Monday, ten more neighbourhoods around the market were restricted, said CGTN. No visitors or deliveries are allowed, but residents can come and go. Schools and nurseries near the market were told to shut and the re-opening of primary schools, originally scheduled for today, has now been postponed, reported the Global Times. The outbreak has been linked to a market like this one Analysis by Stephen McDonell, China correspondent, Beijing The number of infections may not sound huge at the moment. But, after more than 50 days with no cases at all, the authorities here are worried this could easily turn into a full-blown coronavirus second wave in the city. This is especially the case given these infections are being traced back to a massive wholesale market which has tens of thousands of visitors every day, supplying 80% of Beijing's meat and vegetables. In the response, we are again seeing the best and worst of China's Communist Party under Xi Jinping. The speed and scale of isolation measures and mass testing has been impressive. However, the dismissals - not so much. The deputy head of Fengtai district government has been removed, as has the local party secretary for Huaxiang area. The general manager of Xinfadi market has been dismissed and other officials from the market summoned by the party's discipline inspection commission. Here's a question: if you really wanted to encourage a culture with cover-up as your default setting, where fear trumped openness, how might you achieve that? One way would be to sack any leader with a cluster of coronavirus cases suddenly appeared - because the arrival of this invisible killer must be their fault. The chief epidemiologist of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the virus strain found in Beijing did not resemble the type circulating across the rest of the country, suggesting it might have been brought in from elsewhere. Some 10,000 market staff will be tested for the virus. This potential new wave of cases came as normal life had begun resuming across Beijing and most parts of China. People had cautiously returned to workplaces and students back to schools - though virus restrictions still remained in place.

The first jury citations have been issued since the start of lockdown ahead of the return of high court trials next month. Notices will drop through letterboxes from Monday for potential jurors with court trials due to restart in Glasgow and Edinburgh from July. A raft of anti-virus measures have been introduced to protect accused, jurors, witnesses, lawyers, staff and judiciary. Lord justice clerk Lady Dorrian said: ""The courts have been working extremely hard to deliver justice in the current coronavirus circumstances. ""I am satisfied that this work will enable jury trials to take place in a way that ensures the safety and confidence of jurors and all parties, and builds trust in our ability to operate within the strict guidelines set out by Public Health Scotland."" Trials will continue to be conducted with 15 jurors under the same legal standards and procedures as before. No new criminal jury trials have gone ahead since mid-March. The Robert Peel statue in Glasgow has become a potential flashpoint between demonstrators Recent protests are ""self-indulgent"" and ""unnecessary,"" the chairman of the Scottish Police Federation says. David Hamilton told Drivetime officers were putting themselves at risk in the middle of a pandemic in order to respond to these assemblies. Police in Glasgow averted a clash between protesters over a statueat the weekend. Hundreds of people descended on George Square to call for the statue of Met Police founder Robert Peel to stay - after other activists called for its removal. Mr Hamilton said abuse directed towards officers trying to do their job was ""absolutely unacceptable"". People should not be out protesting physically likely this. It is frankly self-indulgent for people who have got other means of protesting and making their point to physically come together, putting other people at risk, themselves at risk, and police officers and everybody else at risk because they want to make a point that could be made in another way. David Hamilton, Chair of the Scottish Police Federation Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The Scottish government has been challenged to come up with more money if it wants pupils to be offered more in-school teaching than is being offered by councils planning for a return to class in August. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggested earlier that she was not happy with the mix of blended learning being proposed by some local authorities. But Allison Evison, president of local authority parent body Cosla, told Lucy Whyte on Drivetime: ""If you look at the funding needed by local councils in a period from March to June, we are already needing Â£45m additional money on top of what has already been given by the Scottish government. ""Local councils have all made the best possible plans in terms of the resources they have at the moment - in terms of buildings they have, teaching staff and support staff. ""If the Scottish government is not happy, we need a realistic conversation about where that money is coming from. Councils have been under-resourced for a long time and there's no spare cash sitting around anywhere."" Ms Evison adds that, if schools are to accommodate more children while maintaining safety and social distancing rules, it would require the use of other buildings and employing more teachers and more support staff - all of which costs more money. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland A group of parents have started a campaign to encourage the Scottish government to introduce a national standard for blended learning amid fears of major differences at schools around the country. Mother of two and public affairs professional Sarah Chisnall told BBC Radio Scotland that the 50-50 group emerged over the weekend following ""a lot of anger from parents and carers"" on Twitter. Ms Chisnall learned on Friday that her teenage son faced having just one day per week of in-school teaching provided by City of Edinburgh Council in August. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that such rates were not acceptable. Ms Chisnall has told the BBC's Lucy Whyte her group wants the Scottish government ""to look at a standard guaranteed national minimum of 50% school time for children and a national standardised best practice for online learning for the other 50%"". Ms Chisnall said there were big difference in what councils were offering. While her son has ""had very little interactive learning"" across the council border in Midlothian ""there is much more availability"", she said. Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. A Glasgow bar has created separated dining pods in a bid to comply with social distancing measures once allowed to open. Pubs, hotels and restaurants have been told to prepare to reopen on 15 July. Perspex screens divide 21 private dining and drinking spaces at the Ardnamurchan in Hope Street. A third of the bar's seating has been removed. Licensee Neil Douglas hopes the measures will meet health and safety consultant approval. Mr Douglas said: ""Our aim is to keep all the character and ambience of the venues and maintain a great experience for customers while providing the safety measures that many will want."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The chief executive of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the health board is sorry for distress and anxiety caused to patients families and staff at the QEUH. A report has said there were a ""series of problems"" with the design and build of the Glasgow hospital campus - but no clear evidence to link those failures to any ""avoidable deaths"". The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital opened in 2015, but fears were raised after deaths were linked to infections. An independent review concluded thatsome patients had been ""exposed to risk that could have been lower"",external. NHS GGC chief executiveJane Grant insisted the board was working hard to address the issues raised in the 227-page independent report. She said there was an issue within a section of the infection control team but work was ongoing with the team and Scottish government to create a ""supportive and inclusive culture"" going forward. Today's Scottish government coronavirus daily briefing was dominated by the return of schools. Nicola Sturgeon expects councils to have plans
in place by 11 August to âmaximiseâ face-to-face learning. The Scottish government will intervene to ask councils to revise their plans where maximising time in
schools is not happening. Here are the other key points from today's briefing: Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Milly Main died after contracting an infection at the Royal Hospital for Children Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has apologised to patients and families who say they were affected by microbiological contaminants at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital complex in Glasgow. She spoke following the publication of a report which said there werea ""series of problems"" with the designof the hospital. 10-year-old Milly Main died at the Royal Hospital for Children in 2017 while recovering from leukaemia. Her family believe her death was caused by an infection picked up at the hospital. Her mum, Kimberly Darroch, said she was ""disappointed"" the report had not answered questions she had about Milly's death. She said: ""We're jumping through hoops to get answers from the health board. At every turn they're denying to cover up all the failings that they've made as a health board."" She is hopeful a fatal accident inquiry will be established because she has no trust in the health board. ""They've completely let Milly down,"" she added. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab leads tonight's UK coronavirus briefing The foreign secretary says that experience of the coronavirus in other countries shows there is a risk of a second spike in infections - proving the need for a cautious approach. He describes the reopening of shops in England as ""very much a managed process"". Non-essential shops remain closed in Scotland, although we expect an announcement on the further easing of lockdown restrictions from the first minister on Thursday. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Customers are having their temperature checked on entering the Apple store in London ""It was pretty strange,"" a London-based Scottish journalist tells BBC Radio Scotland after experiencing the first day of England's non-essential shopsbeing able to openfollowing lockdown. Ahead of opening this morning, there were long queues outside a number of shops and Lewis McKenzie tells Lucy Whyte: ""The number of people being allowed into shops at any one time has been limited. ""There is also a queuing system, much like we have been queuing to get into supermarkets the past few months, where it is socially distanced and you have to wait your turn to go in. ""In pretty much every shop I went into today, there was hand sanitiser available when you were entering and leaving that you could use."" Mr McKenzie reveals that book shop Waterston's has recognised the need for browsing and supplies trolleys where customers can place books they have touched but not bought so they can be quarantined before a return to the shelves.

UK minister of state for health, Edward Argar, has told the Commons that it would be ""premature"" to speculate onthe conclusion of a review into the 2m social distancing rule. He said the review was being led by scientific evidence and would consider the effect on businesses, particularly the hospitality sector. Backbench Conservative MP Greg Clark, who secured this parliamentary urgent question, asked why the UK had chosen a larger distance than many other countries, while other countries have mandated face coverings. Argar said the scientific evidence suggested an increased risk of transmission of the virus at shorter distances, and pointed out that other countries, including Spain, also have a 2m rule. A series of SNP MPs said the 2m rule should be kept for as long as necessary to protect health First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the two-metre rule is also under review in Scotland but indicated today she was not yet minded to reduce the social distancing rule. Argar said the review would issue a report in the coming weeks, but declined to set a date. Read more here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some shoppers in England took protective precautions to stop the spread of Covid-19 A poll has suggested that less than half of Britons feel comfortable returning to clothes retailers. Results of YouGov polling carried out earlier this month suggested just 40% of people were comfortable to go back into such stores and only 48% think they would be able to stay the required two metres away from other shoppers. Non-essential retail shops have been able to open in England today, subject to social distancing measures. Forty-one per cent of people said they believe it is the right time for the shops to reopen but 39% said it was too soon. The UK government's daily press conference is due in about 40 minutes. It's being held by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. As far as we know, he will not be joined by any of the government's scientific advisers. You can follow live updates here. The Scottish government is ""delusional"" about plans for
pupils to return to schools and sit exams as normal next year, according to the Scottish Greens. At her daily briefing, the first minister said it was the Scottish government's ""firm intention"" that next year's exams would go ahead - and that there were no plans for blended learning to last a year. Scotland's schools are due to re-open from 11 August, but will initially have a ""blended"" approach involving face-to-face teaching and at-home learning. Forcing pupils to sit exams as normal at the end of a completely abnormal disrupted year is a recipe for disaster. To say exams can go ahead as normal under these circumstances is delusional.""

"This video can not be played Shoppers in England rush back to the High Street Demand across England's High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres surged on Monday as some shops reopened after a three-month lockdown. Research firm Springboard said that by 17:00, footfall was 38.8% higher than last week, as pent-up demand led to reports of long queues. However, shopper numbers were generally far below the same time last year. But at Bicester Village, near Oxford,crowding was so great that 3,000 people signed a petition to close it. All shops in England are now allowed to open, but with strict safety measures. ""Footfall has risen by more than we anticipated, but it was certainly helped by the weather, which made queuing a more pleasurable experience,"" said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard. Safety measures include plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers two metres apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Jaydee Darrock, from Warwickshire, was one of the first insidePrimark's Birmingham storeafter queuing from about 07:00. She described it as ""surprisingly calm"". ""We thought it would be chaotic, it's not, it's quite nice,"" she said. In pictures: Shops in England reopen Five ways shopping will be different from now on How to shop safely in a coronavirus pandemic There were also big queues outside the Nike store in Central London, although some complained there had been a lack of social distancing. In Manchester people waited for almost an hour outside Primark, TK Maxx and Foot Locker, although elsewhere demand was more subdued. Most shops - like this Primark in Birmingham - have been locked since 23 March Although food shops, pharmacies, banks and other essential retailers have stayed open, vast swathes of the High Street, from bookshops to clothes outlets, have been closed since 23 March. Springboard said footfall was likely to rise further in the coming weeks, but warned many shoppers still had concerns about other people not following the safety measures in stores and there being long queues to get in. Shantel Brown, 35, was shopping in Milton Keynes with her daughter Tee, who is 16. Shantel said: ""I bought nightwear and baby clothes because Primark was open. I'm pregnant and I've been waiting to get some baby stuff. ""Everyone keeps their distance. They've got sanitiser at the entrance. As long as we've got our masks on we're fine."" Tee added: ""I bought tops, shorts and summer clothes. I came because Mum forced me."" Greg Dulson, 68, was shopping for a new watch strap. ""The strap on my favourite watch broke and I brought it in to the watchmaker's the day before lockdown,"" he said. ""They said come back tomorrow, but it was closed!"" Katie Kirby, who is 18, was shopping with her 21-year-old boyfriend Zac Hopkins. ""I bought a jumpsuit because Primark was open and the weather's getting better again,"" said Katie. ""I did go just to get some essentials like pants and socks, but I when I saw the jumpsuit I had to treat myself because the shops haven't been open for so long."" ""We do keep our distance in the store. We thought it would be a different shopping experience but once we were in there it was just the same."" Zac Hopkins added: ""I bought a skipping rope, so I can do some exercise at home."" The first thing I bought when the shops reopened Business reporter Vivienne Nunis in Milton Keynes There were socially distant queues outside Zara, Primark and TK Maxx this morning and a steady crowd of shoppers are now browsing in the centre. Lots of young people are here, mothers with strollers and some older shoppers too. Some people are wearing masks, but not many. However, lots of stores remain closed and all the lights are off in the locked cafes and fast-food restaurants. The shoppers are mostly sticking to the new rules and staying socially distant - when they remember. Floor markings indicate a one-way system, every second toilet cubicle is closed, touch-screen maps have been powered down and seating areas are roped off. But apart from those changes - and a growing queue outside Primark - everything feels rather normal. HMV owner Doug Putman told the BBC's Today programme that he expected a rush in the first week of trading after his shops open their doors. But he said retailers could be faced with a problem if shoppers do not return in the same numbers as before the lockdown. ""If you've got the same cost structure to run the business but sales are down even 20% it makes a lot of companies unviable. ""We're being very hesitant, we believe that it is going to be a tough year."" This video can not be played Mary Portas: 'This is a window of opportunity for local High Streets' Other safety measures brought in by retailers include pleas not to touch items unless customers are thinking about buying them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use. Shops are also promising there will be plenty of sanitiser on hand for customers. Toilets will remain closed in Primark's shops but facilities in other stores, including John Lewis and Selfridges, will be open. Which shops are reopening on Monday? Can my boss force me to go back to work? Consumers 'should shop with confidence', says PM In most clothes shops, fitting rooms will be closed. Bookshops including Waterstones intend to put items in quarantine if browsed but not bought, while some jewellers are introducing ultraviolet boxes that can decontaminate items in minutes. Government guidance suggests shops put some items aside if they have been extensively handled by customers. This video can not be played What's it now like shopping for clothes? Not all stores will throw open their doors immediately. John Lewis will reopen just two outlets on Monday - in Kingston upon Thames and Poole - as part of a phased approach, with 11 others to follow on Thursday. John Lewis willstart by opening 13 branchesin stages Next will reopen just 25 of its 500 stores at first Debenhams willreopen 50 stores in Englandand three in Northern Ireland Marks and Spencer will open all its shops in England and Northern Ireland JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its stores in England Primark is reopening all 153 of its stores in England Argos, which has kept outlets in Sainsbury's stores open, will reopen 145 standalone stores for click and collect Topshop is reopening all its stores in England and selected ones in Northern Ireland Music retailer HMV is reopening 93 of its 113 stores Currys PC World is reopening 131 of its outlets. Some other retailers selling products classed as essential - such as DIY, furniture and bicycles - have already started reopening. Furniture giant Ikeaopened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Many stores are encouraging customers to make purchases by contactless card payments, with limits increased to Â£45. London's West End, which includes Oxford Street, is expecting about 80% fewer visitors when it reopens on Monday. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body representing the sector, warned that the unlocking was unlikely to provide an immediate boost for the sector. It wants the government to help stimulate demand with a short-term cut in VAT or a temporary income tax cut for lower-income workers. 'It's very exciting to be returning to work' How coronavirus will change the way we all shop Government to review 2m social distancing rule Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas were also allowed to open from Monday. In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland. In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will not be allowed to open their doors until 4 July at the earliest - and even then, only if they can meetsocial distancing measures. Relaxing the 2m social distancing rule will be key to reviving the economy, the hospitality industry says. Pubs and restaurants have warned that they cannot make money if customers are required to keep two-metres apart, and have urged that the distance limit be reduced to one metre. Prime ministerBoris Johnson has commissioned a reviewinto two-metre distancing, saying there was ""margin for manoeuvre"" as the number of coronavirus cases falls. The government is under intense pressure to get the economy moving amid fears that there could be another wave of job losses as wage support schemes are wound down.

"This video can not be played Shoppers in England rush back to the High Street Demand across England's High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres surged on Monday as some shops reopened after a three-month lockdown. Research firm Springboard said that by 17:00, footfall was 38.8% higher than last week, as pent-up demand led to reports of long queues. However, shopper numbers were generally far below the same time last year. But at Bicester Village, near Oxford,crowding was so great that 3,000 people signed a petition to close it. All shops in England are now allowed to open, but with strict safety measures. ""Footfall has risen by more than we anticipated, but it was certainly helped by the weather, which made queuing a more pleasurable experience,"" said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard. Safety measures include plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers two metres apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Jaydee Darrock, from Warwickshire, was one of the first insidePrimark's Birmingham storeafter queuing from about 07:00. She described it as ""surprisingly calm"". ""We thought it would be chaotic, it's not, it's quite nice,"" she said. In pictures: Shops in England reopen Five ways shopping will be different from now on How to shop safely in a coronavirus pandemic There were also big queues outside the Nike store in Central London, although some complained there had been a lack of social distancing. In Manchester people waited for almost an hour outside Primark, TK Maxx and Foot Locker, although elsewhere demand was more subdued. Most shops - like this Primark in Birmingham - have been locked since 23 March Although food shops, pharmacies, banks and other essential retailers have stayed open, vast swathes of the High Street, from bookshops to clothes outlets, have been closed since 23 March. Springboard said footfall was likely to rise further in the coming weeks, but warned many shoppers still had concerns about other people not following the safety measures in stores and there being long queues to get in. Shantel Brown, 35, was shopping in Milton Keynes with her daughter Tee, who is 16. Shantel said: ""I bought nightwear and baby clothes because Primark was open. I'm pregnant and I've been waiting to get some baby stuff. ""Everyone keeps their distance. They've got sanitiser at the entrance. As long as we've got our masks on we're fine."" Tee added: ""I bought tops, shorts and summer clothes. I came because Mum forced me."" Greg Dulson, 68, was shopping for a new watch strap. ""The strap on my favourite watch broke and I brought it in to the watchmaker's the day before lockdown,"" he said. ""They said come back tomorrow, but it was closed!"" Katie Kirby, who is 18, was shopping with her 21-year-old boyfriend Zac Hopkins. ""I bought a jumpsuit because Primark was open and the weather's getting better again,"" said Katie. ""I did go just to get some essentials like pants and socks, but I when I saw the jumpsuit I had to treat myself because the shops haven't been open for so long."" ""We do keep our distance in the store. We thought it would be a different shopping experience but once we were in there it was just the same."" Zac Hopkins added: ""I bought a skipping rope, so I can do some exercise at home."" The first thing I bought when the shops reopened Business reporter Vivienne Nunis in Milton Keynes There were socially distant queues outside Zara, Primark and TK Maxx this morning and a steady crowd of shoppers are now browsing in the centre. Lots of young people are here, mothers with strollers and some older shoppers too. Some people are wearing masks, but not many. However, lots of stores remain closed and all the lights are off in the locked cafes and fast-food restaurants. The shoppers are mostly sticking to the new rules and staying socially distant - when they remember. Floor markings indicate a one-way system, every second toilet cubicle is closed, touch-screen maps have been powered down and seating areas are roped off. But apart from those changes - and a growing queue outside Primark - everything feels rather normal. HMV owner Doug Putman told the BBC's Today programme that he expected a rush in the first week of trading after his shops open their doors. But he said retailers could be faced with a problem if shoppers do not return in the same numbers as before the lockdown. ""If you've got the same cost structure to run the business but sales are down even 20% it makes a lot of companies unviable. ""We're being very hesitant, we believe that it is going to be a tough year."" This video can not be played Mary Portas: 'This is a window of opportunity for local High Streets' Other safety measures brought in by retailers include pleas not to touch items unless customers are thinking about buying them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use. Shops are also promising there will be plenty of sanitiser on hand for customers. Toilets will remain closed in Primark's shops but facilities in other stores, including John Lewis and Selfridges, will be open. Which shops are reopening on Monday? Can my boss force me to go back to work? Consumers 'should shop with confidence', says PM In most clothes shops, fitting rooms will be closed. Bookshops including Waterstones intend to put items in quarantine if browsed but not bought, while some jewellers are introducing ultraviolet boxes that can decontaminate items in minutes. Government guidance suggests shops put some items aside if they have been extensively handled by customers. This video can not be played What's it now like shopping for clothes? Not all stores will throw open their doors immediately. John Lewis will reopen just two outlets on Monday - in Kingston upon Thames and Poole - as part of a phased approach, with 11 others to follow on Thursday. John Lewis willstart by opening 13 branchesin stages Next will reopen just 25 of its 500 stores at first Debenhams willreopen 50 stores in Englandand three in Northern Ireland Marks and Spencer will open all its shops in England and Northern Ireland JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its stores in England Primark is reopening all 153 of its stores in England Argos, which has kept outlets in Sainsbury's stores open, will reopen 145 standalone stores for click and collect Topshop is reopening all its stores in England and selected ones in Northern Ireland Music retailer HMV is reopening 93 of its 113 stores Currys PC World is reopening 131 of its outlets. Some other retailers selling products classed as essential - such as DIY, furniture and bicycles - have already started reopening. Furniture giant Ikeaopened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Many stores are encouraging customers to make purchases by contactless card payments, with limits increased to Â£45. London's West End, which includes Oxford Street, is expecting about 80% fewer visitors when it reopens on Monday. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body representing the sector, warned that the unlocking was unlikely to provide an immediate boost for the sector. It wants the government to help stimulate demand with a short-term cut in VAT or a temporary income tax cut for lower-income workers. 'It's very exciting to be returning to work' How coronavirus will change the way we all shop Government to review 2m social distancing rule Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas were also allowed to open from Monday. In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland. In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will not be allowed to open their doors until 4 July at the earliest - and even then, only if they can meetsocial distancing measures. Relaxing the 2m social distancing rule will be key to reviving the economy, the hospitality industry says. Pubs and restaurants have warned that they cannot make money if customers are required to keep two-metres apart, and have urged that the distance limit be reduced to one metre. Prime ministerBoris Johnson has commissioned a reviewinto two-metre distancing, saying there was ""margin for manoeuvre"" as the number of coronavirus cases falls. The government is under intense pressure to get the economy moving amid fears that there could be another wave of job losses as wage support schemes are wound down.

Savile Row tailors were among the shops opening - with a new sartorial addition As our live page draws to a close, this is a chance to catch up with the coronavirus news from the UK today. Here are the highlights from ourevening update:  Ahead of our pause in live coverage about the coronavirus pandemic, here's an update of developments from around the world: Next year's Oscars ceremony has been pushed back by two months, the latest major event to have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. The Academy Awards were due to take place on 28 February next yearbut have now been put back until 25 April. The pandemic has already halted work on a number of films that were due to be released by the end of the year. Organisers have also agreed to extend the cut-off date for Oscar-eligible films beyond 31 December 2020 to the end of February. Meanwhile, organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have announced the dates of next year's competitionfollowing the cancellation of this year's event. The semi-finals will take place on 18 and 20 May, followed by the grand final on 22 May. They will all be held in Rotterdam, where this year's event had been due to take place last month. With the end of the economic impact of coronavirus nowhere near in sight, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is making plans to extend economic aid. Ezekiel Elliott at a game in January Several NFL players for the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans  have tested positive for Covid-19,NFL Network,externalreports. Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliot is among the players with the virus, but is doing well, according to his agent. He recently made headlines, along with a number of other top football players, for a video criticising the league over its response to black rights issues that was released the day of African American George Floyd's funeral. Texans players were also given time off if they wished to attend the funeral service. None of the players were in team facilities, according to NFL Network, and the Cowboys and Texans have been following health protocols. The teams have not offered further details. NFL coaches and staff have started returning to facilities, but no players have yet done so. The league is still aiming to start its 2020 season in September, and is hopeful that training camps will happen before then. This month, Roger Goodell, NFL commissioner, sent teams guidelines on reopening, with rules addressing distancing, equipment cleaning, food service, and personal protective equipment requirements. The sunbeds are out in Benidorm There is some hopeful news for those in the UK who feel the need to head south for warmer weather. A spokesperson for the Spanish government has told the BBC that British travellers are âwelcome to travel to Spainâ from Sunday without facing quarantine measures or restrictions on arrival. It confirms a tweet posted earlier by the British embassy in Madrid, which said the UK had been included on the list of countries that will not face restrictions when Spain's borders reopen. Travellers returning to the UK will still have to self isolate for two weeks afterwards, however, and the UK government's official advice is still against any non-essential international travel.

Meanwhile, Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa said talks between the two countries on an ""air bridge"" were going well. The arrangement would allow UK visitors to avoid mandatory quarantine when they return home. ""We are working towards an agreement and will wait for it to happen,"" Costa told reporters. But he could not say when the air bridge might be in place. Government scientific and medical advisers were absent from the UK briefing today, but one, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has been speaking to football legend Ian Wright about the return of Premier League games this week. Prof Van-Tam says he is ""desperate to get back to the stadium"" of his beloved Boston United in Lincolnshire. But he cautions that it has to be done in a way that prevents transmission of the virus starting again - and that's why football's restart is limited to behind closed doors. ""Stay at home, watch the games at home, follow the rules,"" he says. Watch the full videobelow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Health officials in the state have expressed concerns over the event, with Tulsa's health department chief sayinghe wished the rally would be postponed,external.

Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor Food is more than twice as expensive as it was last year in Syria No-one knows exactly how much damage Syriaâs civil war
has done to the economy. One estimate is something like half a
trillion pounds ($630bn) worth of destruction. The pieces that remain are being battered by a new and
severe crisis. The result, says UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, is
that ""Syrians are hungry now en masse in a way which wasn't true one or
two years ago"". It is happening, he adds, as the economic
consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic start kicking in, not just in Syria but
across the world. ""What we're projecting globally is a doubling of the
people all across the planet who will be at starvation levels of hunger."" Read more:Assad under pressure as economic crisis batters Syria The government has released its latest figures and data on how the virus is affecting the UK. Here are graphs showing how the numbers are changing. You can find other key statistics - including how many cases there are in your area -here. Norway's health authorities have halted the roll-out of a coronavirus mobile phone app after it was criticised by the data protection authority. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) said it would delete all information collected so far, but warned that the move would weaken the fight against coronavirus. Norway's data protection authority (DPA) said on Friday that the potentially intrusive nature of the app Smittestopp (Infection stop) was not warranted, given the low rate of infection. About 1.5 million people downloaded it in the first week of its launch in April - more than a quarter of the population. The app is designed to show researchers where people are moving and to alert those who have been in contact with a Covid-19 carrier. ""We don't agree with the DPA's evaluation but feel it is necessary to delete all data and put work on hold as a result of
this,"" NIPH said in a statement. Read more: Contact-tracing apps face further hitches Social distancing rules mean only a quarter of students can be in school at once Secondary school students in England have begun to return to classes today - but how much time will they actually spend in school? A survey of 8,000 teachers suggests that 90% of their pupils will be in class for less than two days a week. Social distancing means schools can only accommodate a quarter of pupils in Years 10 and 12 at any one time, so different groups of students have to take turns to attend. Less than a third of schools are teaching all subject options, with most focusing on English, maths and science. Read the full story Testing has been increased in the area of the new outbreak in Beijing The World Health Organization says it expects China to share the full genetic sequence from the new coronavirus outbreak in Beijing with the rest of the world. Speaking in Geneva, head of health emergencies Dr Mike Ryan said it was expected as ""they have done in the past"". Beijing has seen a cluster of about 100 new cases of the virus, and is investigating the origins. Experts said the strain did not resemble the type found elsewhere in the country and genetic traces have suggested it could have originated in Europe. ""The finding that this may represent a strain more common in transmission in Europe is important and it may reflect
human-to-human transmission more than any other hypotheses,"" Dr Ryan said. Local media said the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at a market, leading to speculation that it was brought in on the fish or its packaging.
 
Dr Ryan said the safety of food and its packaging should be looked at but added that he was ""reticent"" to say all food packaging needed testing. The Duke of Cambridge has made a surprise video call to a woman and her young son who have been shielding for the past three months. Prince William spoke to Leanne and five-year-old Kaydyn, who has cystic fibrosis, at their home in Corby, Northamptonshire. Footage of the call will feature on BBC One's The One Show at 19:00 on Tuesday.
Leanne was shown covering her mouth with her hands in shock as the duke called from his home in Norfolk. Last week, the Duke of Cambridge revealed he had been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. You can read more about his callhere. Iran's daily death count is more than 100 once again, raising alarm from the authorities Iran has warned it may have to reimpose strict measures against the coronavirus, as it reported more than 100 deaths for a second day running. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said there had been 113 new fatalities, taking the official death toll to 8,950 since Iran's outbreak began in February. She said a further 2,449 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. Iran started to relax its lockdown in mid-April after infections declined but has since seen a surge. There have also been concerns the official figures do not reflect the full extent of deaths and infections. On Monday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei criticised the lack of social distancing by people at holy sites and on public transport. ""In the [Tehran] subway, although 90% of passengers use masks, social distancing is not being observed,"" he said. ""If we find that the spread of the virus is out of control... then we will definitely apply strict decisions again."" A bargain dress or a new watchstrap - what do you really need after three months? As the coronavirus lockdown was eased further in England, queues formed outside many shops before they opened for the first time since March. Industry data shows the number of visitors to high streets, shopping centres and retail parks was up by almost half this morning, compared with last week -  but the levels were still far below the same period last year. Retailers have had to introduce strict safety measures such as plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Many shoppers seem confident in the measures being taken and were keen for a bargain - we spoke to some about their experiences and their first purchases and you can read about thathere. In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland.  The state is moving forward with its reopening process New York's death toll and total number of people sent to hospital due to Covid-19 have both fallen to the lowest points since the crisis began. On Monday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said this weekend had the fewest deaths on a three-day average since March. The number of positive tests has also continued to decline. Twenty-five people died of the virus on Sunday and there were just over 1,600 residents requiring hospital treatment for Covid-19 over the weekend. ""The facts are that new York is on the right track,"" he said, though noted it was unlikely the numbers would hit zero. ""It's coming down to what the doctor certifies as the cause of death, many people who pass away because of Covid have other underlying conditions."" The report comes as parts of the state enter the third phase of reopening; gatherings of up to 25 people will be allowed, up from 10, and many businesses are back open. But the governor also called out businesses and residents ignoring social distancing measures, saying the state had received 25,000 complaints of violations. The latest UK unemployment figures are due to be published by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow but several companies have announced plans to cut jobs today. Wickes owner Travis Perkins, the UK's biggest builders' merchant,plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. The group says it expects a UK recession to hit demand for building materials this year and in 2021. Jaguar Land Rover is set to cut up to 1,100 temporary jobs from its factory floors after it reported a Â£501m loss in the final quarter of its financial year. And75 jobs are under threat at the Titanic Belfast visitor centre, the BBC understands. The company has started a consultation over the potential redundancies. Frank KeoghBBC Sport Royal Ascot starts on Tuesday - but the famous British horse racing meeting will have a very different feel this year. The action will take place behind closed doors amid strict safety protocols because of the coronavirus pandemic - jockeys must undergo temperature checks and wear face masks. And while the fixture retains its regal title and branding, the Queen will not be in attendance for the first time in her 68-year reign. She is expected to watch television coverage from Windsor Castle. Racehorse owners are not allowed at the Berkshire track but will have access to a 360-degree live camera feed of runners in the parade ring, while people are being encouraged to wear a hat and dress up at home.

"More than one million people have fallen through cracks in government schemes designed to support them during the coronavirus crisis, MPs says. The Treasury Select Committee called on ministers to plug gaps in the schemes to fulfil the government's promise of ""doing whatever it takes"". Freelancers and recent employees are among those who cannot access support, the MPs say. The Treasury said the schemes protected millions of jobs and livelihoods. But the committee's interim report, which was unanimously agreed by members, said it was still not enough. ""The Treasury's interventions have been welcomed by many but rolling out financial support at pace and scale has inevitably resulted in some hard edges in policy design and some critical gaps in provision,"" the committee said. ""The government must assist these people if it is to completely fulfil its promise to do whatever it takes to protect people from the economic impact of coronavirus."" 'Forgotten' TV freelancers call for 'urgent help' Bank of England 'ready to act' as economy reels The MPs said hundreds of thousands of people are suffering financial hardship through no fault of their own, often due to unfortunate timing in starting a new job or their employer's choice of timing in submitting payroll paperwork to the HMRC tax authority. When lockdown first started, the Treasury said it would cover up to 80% of the salaries of workers who were unable to do their job from home. But those who started a new job after the government's 28 February cut-off date are not covered by the scheme. Although this was later extended by three weeks, many have still been left behind, the committee said. Retailers get ready to reopen after three months Which areas have the most furloughed workers? Do you feel you have missed out on the support offered by the government during the coronavirus crisis? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The committee also said the government is failing to help those who have become self-employed within the last year and those whose companies have annual trading profits of more than Â£50,000. Another group that has fallen through the net is freelancers or those on short-term contracts. The MPs said that in industries such as television and theatre, where short-term contracts are the norm, many workers are not entitled to support under the schemes. The report said: ""This cannot be right. The government should give this group access to financial support that equates to 80% of their average monthly income, up to a total of Â£2,500 per month."" The report comes amid growing unease about the health of the economy, which contracted by a record 20.4% in April. There are warnings of huge job losses once the furlough schemes are wound down. On Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged on the Andrew Marr show ""there is going to be hardship ahead"". Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride said: ""The chancellor has said that he will do whatever it takes to support people and businesses from the economic impact of the pandemic. Overall, he has acted at impressive scale and pace. ""However, the committee has identified well over a million people who, through no fault of their own, have lost livelihoods while being locked down and locked out of the main support programmes."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The swift and targeted action we've taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee. ""Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world - with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than Â£6.5 billion injected into the welfare safety net. ""All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.""

Savile Row tailors were among the shops opening - with a new sartorial addition As our live page draws to a close, this is a chance to catch up with the coronavirus news from the UK today. Here are the highlights from ourevening update:  Ahead of our pause in live coverage about the coronavirus pandemic, here's an update of developments from around the world: Next year's Oscars ceremony has been pushed back by two months, the latest major event to have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. The Academy Awards were due to take place on 28 February next yearbut have now been put back until 25 April. The pandemic has already halted work on a number of films that were due to be released by the end of the year. Organisers have also agreed to extend the cut-off date for Oscar-eligible films beyond 31 December 2020 to the end of February. Meanwhile, organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have announced the dates of next year's competitionfollowing the cancellation of this year's event. The semi-finals will take place on 18 and 20 May, followed by the grand final on 22 May. They will all be held in Rotterdam, where this year's event had been due to take place last month. With the end of the economic impact of coronavirus nowhere near in sight, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is making plans to extend economic aid. Ezekiel Elliott at a game in January Several NFL players for the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans  have tested positive for Covid-19,NFL Network,externalreports. Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliot is among the players with the virus, but is doing well, according to his agent. He recently made headlines, along with a number of other top football players, for a video criticising the league over its response to black rights issues that was released the day of African American George Floyd's funeral. Texans players were also given time off if they wished to attend the funeral service. None of the players were in team facilities, according to NFL Network, and the Cowboys and Texans have been following health protocols. The teams have not offered further details. NFL coaches and staff have started returning to facilities, but no players have yet done so. The league is still aiming to start its 2020 season in September, and is hopeful that training camps will happen before then. This month, Roger Goodell, NFL commissioner, sent teams guidelines on reopening, with rules addressing distancing, equipment cleaning, food service, and personal protective equipment requirements. The sunbeds are out in Benidorm There is some hopeful news for those in the UK who feel the need to head south for warmer weather. A spokesperson for the Spanish government has told the BBC that British travellers are âwelcome to travel to Spainâ from Sunday without facing quarantine measures or restrictions on arrival. It confirms a tweet posted earlier by the British embassy in Madrid, which said the UK had been included on the list of countries that will not face restrictions when Spain's borders reopen. Travellers returning to the UK will still have to self isolate for two weeks afterwards, however, and the UK government's official advice is still against any non-essential international travel.

The arrangement would allow UK visitors to avoid mandatory quarantine when they return home. ""We are working towards an agreement and will wait for it to happen,"" Costa told reporters. But he could not say when the air bridge might be in place. Government scientific and medical advisers were absent from the UK briefing today, but one, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has been speaking to football legend Ian Wright about the return of Premier League games this week. Prof Van-Tam says he is ""desperate to get back to the stadium"" of his beloved Boston United in Lincolnshire. But he cautions that it has to be done in a way that prevents transmission of the virus starting again - and that's why football's restart is limited to behind closed doors.

Manager Brad Parscale said the ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, would be taking precautions for Covid-19 and the summer heat, including handing out masks and bottled water. And,as we reported earlier, those purchasing tickets for Trump's rally will have to sign a waiver confirming they ""voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19"" and will not hold the president's campaign responsible for ""any illness or injury"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters the campaign was making ""good"" decisions and that there was a ""recognition that there are guidelines in place that should be followed"". Health officials in the state have expressed concerns over the event, with Tulsa's health department chief sayinghe wished the rally would be postponed,external. Oklahoma has one of the country's lowest infection rates, and businesses are reopening, but the governor has urged residents to continue social distancing and minimise time in crowds.

Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor Food is more than twice as expensive as it was last year in Syria No-one knows exactly how much damage Syriaâs civil war
has done to the economy. One estimate is something like half a
trillion pounds ($630bn) worth of destruction. The pieces that remain are being battered by a new and
severe crisis. The result, says UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, is
that ""Syrians are hungry now en masse in a way which wasn't true one or
two years ago"". It is happening, he adds, as the economic
consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic start kicking in, not just in Syria but
across the world. ""What we're projecting globally is a doubling of the
people all across the planet who will be at starvation levels of hunger."" Read more:Assad under pressure as economic crisis batters Syria The government has released its latest figures and data on how the virus is affecting the UK. Here are graphs showing how the numbers are changing. You can find other key statistics - including how many cases there are in your area -here. Norway's health authorities have halted the roll-out of a coronavirus mobile phone app after it was criticised by the data protection authority. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) said it would delete all information collected so far, but warned that the move would weaken the fight against coronavirus. Norway's data protection authority (DPA) said on Friday that the potentially intrusive nature of the app Smittestopp (Infection stop) was not warranted, given the low rate of infection. About 1.5 million people downloaded it in the first week of its launch in April - more than a quarter of the population. The app is designed to show researchers where people are moving and to alert those who have been in contact with a Covid-19 carrier. ""We don't agree with the DPA's evaluation but feel it is necessary to delete all data and put work on hold as a result of
this,"" NIPH said in a statement. Read more: Contact-tracing apps face further hitches Social distancing rules mean only a quarter of students can be in school at once Secondary school students in England have begun to return to classes today - but how much time will they actually spend in school? A survey of 8,000 teachers suggests that 90% of their pupils will be in class for less than two days a week. Social distancing means schools can only accommodate a quarter of pupils in Years 10 and 12 at any one time, so different groups of students have to take turns to attend. Less than a third of schools are teaching all subject options, with most focusing on English, maths and science. Read the full story Testing has been increased in the area of the new outbreak in Beijing The World Health Organization says it expects China to share the full genetic sequence from the new coronavirus outbreak in Beijing with the rest of the world. Speaking in Geneva, head of health emergencies Dr Mike Ryan said it was expected as ""they have done in the past"". Beijing has seen a cluster of about 100 new cases of the virus, and is investigating the origins. Experts said the strain did not resemble the type found elsewhere in the country and genetic traces have suggested it could have originated in Europe. ""The finding that this may represent a strain more common in transmission in Europe is important and it may reflect
human-to-human transmission more than any other hypotheses,"" Dr Ryan said. Local media said the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at a market, leading to speculation that it was brought in on the fish or its packaging.
 
Dr Ryan said the safety of food and its packaging should be looked at but added that he was ""reticent"" to say all food packaging needed testing. The Duke of Cambridge has made a surprise video call to a woman and her young son who have been shielding for the past three months. Prince William spoke to Leanne and five-year-old Kaydyn, who has cystic fibrosis, at their home in Corby, Northamptonshire. Footage of the call will feature on BBC One's The One Show at 19:00 on Tuesday.
Leanne was shown covering her mouth with her hands in shock as the duke called from his home in Norfolk. Last week, the Duke of Cambridge revealed he had been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. You can read more about his callhere. Iran's daily death count is more than 100 once again, raising alarm from the authorities Iran has warned it may have to reimpose strict measures against the coronavirus, as it reported more than 100 deaths for a second day running. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said there had been 113 new fatalities, taking the official death toll to 8,950 since Iran's outbreak began in February. She said a further 2,449 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. Iran started to relax its lockdown in mid-April after infections declined but has since seen a surge. There have also been concerns the official figures do not reflect the full extent of deaths and infections. On Monday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei criticised the lack of social distancing by people at holy sites and on public transport. ""In the [Tehran] subway, although 90% of passengers use masks, social distancing is not being observed,"" he said. ""If we find that the spread of the virus is out of control... then we will definitely apply strict decisions again."" A bargain dress or a new watchstrap - what do you really need after three months? As the coronavirus lockdown was eased further in England, queues formed outside many shops before they opened for the first time since March. Industry data shows the number of visitors to high streets, shopping centres and retail parks was up by almost half this morning, compared with last week -  but the levels were still far below the same period last year. Retailers have had to introduce strict safety measures such as plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Many shoppers seem confident in the measures being taken and were keen for a bargain - we spoke to some about their experiences and their first purchases and you can read about thathere. In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland.  The state is moving forward with its reopening process New York's death toll and total number of people sent to hospital due to Covid-19 have both fallen to the lowest points since the crisis began. On Monday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said this weekend had the fewest deaths on a three-day average since March. The number of positive tests has also continued to decline. Twenty-five people died of the virus on Sunday and there were just over 1,600 residents requiring hospital treatment for Covid-19 over the weekend. ""The facts are that new York is on the right track,"" he said, though noted it was unlikely the numbers would hit zero. ""It's coming down to what the doctor certifies as the cause of death, many people who pass away because of Covid have other underlying conditions."" The report comes as parts of the state enter the third phase of reopening; gatherings of up to 25 people will be allowed, up from 10, and many businesses are back open. But the governor also called out businesses and residents ignoring social distancing measures, saying the state had received 25,000 complaints of violations. The latest UK unemployment figures are due to be published by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow but several companies have announced plans to cut jobs today. Wickes owner Travis Perkins, the UK's biggest builders' merchant,plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. The group says it expects a UK recession to hit demand for building materials this year and in 2021. Jaguar Land Rover is set to cut up to 1,100 temporary jobs from its factory floors after it reported a Â£501m loss in the final quarter of its financial year. And75 jobs are under threat at the Titanic Belfast visitor centre, the BBC understands. The company has started a consultation over the potential redundancies. Frank KeoghBBC Sport Royal Ascot starts on Tuesday - but the famous British horse racing meeting will have a very different feel this year. The action will take place behind closed doors amid strict safety protocols because of the coronavirus pandemic - jockeys must undergo temperature checks and wear face masks. And while the fixture retains its regal title and branding, the Queen will not be in attendance for the first time in her 68-year reign. She is expected to watch television coverage from Windsor Castle. Racehorse owners are not allowed at the Berkshire track but will have access to a 360-degree live camera feed of runners in the parade ring, while people are being encouraged to wear a hat and dress up at home. An expanded programme sees six additional races for a total of 36 contests over five days. Â© 2025 BBC.

"There is ""much more that we need to do"" to tackle racism, Boris Johnson has said as he announced a new commission to look at all ""aspects of inequality"". Writing in the Telegraph,external, the PM said ""no-one who cares about this country"" could ignore the anti-racist protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd. But Labour's David Lammy said it was time for action, not another review. The PM also said the UK should not attempt to ""re-write the past"" by removing historical symbols. The UK's heritage should be left ""broadly in peace"", he added. The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Protesters clash with police in central London 'We stopped somebody from being killed' Mr Johnson condemned the ""far-right thugs"" involved in violent protests on Saturday, which saw more than 100 people arrested in London after thousands gathered saying they were protecting statues. He said their mission was ""utterly absurd"" but he added that it was ""deplorable"" that Sir Winston Churchill's statue had been in danger of attack. It comes after the statue in Parliament Square was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" last weekend. In Bristol, anti-racism protesters pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces inquiry into racial inequality Thousands of people have marched in the UK as part of Black Lives Matter demonstrationsfollowing the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. The prime minister said he was setting up a commission to look at inequality as it was ""no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism"". He wrote: ""There is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality - in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life."" Questions over inequality in health outcomes have been repeatedly raised during the coronavirus pandemic after figures showedmore people from ethnic minority backgrounds were ""disproportionately"" dying with the virus. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said a number of inquiries into racial inequality had already been carried out, such ashis own reporton the treatment of black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system and Theresa May'sRace Disparity Audit,external. ""You can understand why it feels like, yet again in the UK, we want figures, data, but we don't want action,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Black people aren't playing victim as Boris indicates, they're protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now."" Mr Lammy said the announcement lacked detail because it was ""written on the back of a fag packet yesterday to assuage the Black Lives Matter protest"". He called for legislation and the recommendations of past reviews to be implemented. The Race Disparity Audit, published by then Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017, showed inequalities between ethnicities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and the courts The 2017Lammy Reviewfound evidence of bias and discrimination against people from ethnic minority backgrounds in the justice system in England and Wales Also in 2017,the McGregor-Smith Reviewof race in the workplace found people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were still disadvantaged at work and faced lower employment rates than their white counterparts Anindependent review of the Windrush scandal, published in March, found the Home Office showed ""institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race"" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the new commission would be run out of the Cabinet Office and report to the prime minister, and it would be asked to finish its work by Christmas. A chair has not yet been identified but the commission will be overseen by Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, with independent members also on the panel. There are expected to be public evidence sessions and legislation may follow. Lord Simon Woolley, founder of Operation Black Vote and the advisory chair of the government's Race Disparity Unit, said he was ""encouraged"" by the announcement of the commission. However, he said it must lead to action and structural change, to tackle the inequalities in employment, health and education laid bare by the pandemic. This video can not be played Racism in the UK: 'I feel like an alien' Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova said: ""We are in the midst of a global health pandemic that has sharply exposed deep structural inequalities which have long since needed urgently addressing."" She criticised some of Mr Johnson's words, after he told broadcasters he wanted to ""change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination"". Ms de Cordova described this as ""condescending"" and ""designed to let himself and his government off the hook"". Lord Woolley also said the phrase was ""frankly unhelpfulâ¦ unnecessary and to some hurtful"". Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine said the commission was a ""welcome first step"" and showed the Black Lives Matter protests were working. But she added: ""Its findings must not become simply another report on a shelf in Whitehall - the government must implement them without delay."" Meanwhile, a survey of people's attitudes to race in Britain carried out during recent protests suggests people are increasingly optimistic that the UK will become more tolerant and diverse. When asked if they were optimistic Britain would be more tolerant and diverse in 10 years' time, two thirds of people polled by Ipsos Mori said they were, up from half in 2009. And 84% of people strongly disagreed when asked if someone has to be white to be truly British - up from 55% a decade earlier. Anti-racism protesters in Bristol pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Mr Johnson said the ""serious points"" being raised by the anti-racism demonstrators should be taken seriously. However, he said that did not mean ""wasting time"" disputing the life and opinions of ""every historical personality currently immortalised in bronze or stone"". ""Let's fight racism, but leave our heritage broadly in peace. If we really want to change it, there are democratic means available in this country - thanks, by the way, to Winston Churchill,"" he said. It comes as English Heritage is reviewing London's 950 blue plaques to check if any have ""problematic"" connections and will warrant extra context published about them online,as first reported in the Times.,external As for statues, English Heritage also said it believes the best course of action is to give extra context to ensure the stories of individuals are told ""without embellishment or excuses"".

"Free visa extensions should be given to all foreign NHS and social care workers, a group of MPs has said. It is ""unfair"" that some of the lowest paid workers face charges of thousands of pounds to stay in the country, ministers have been told. The Home Office has given a one-year free visa extension for some staff in the NHS and care sectors. The government said it was ""incredibly grateful"" to health and care staff working on the frontline against Covid. But the cross-party Commons Home Affairs Committee said all staff in the sector should be covered in the scheme. The Home Office's visa extension list was initially limited to NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics, but in April it was extended to include more NHS staff, such as radiographers and social workers, plus some social care staff. But the list does not include jobs such as porters and cleaners. For those eligible, the extension covers visas which expire between 31 March and 1 October 2020. The scheme has been extended to about 3,000 key frontline health workers, the government said. Racism 'could play a part in BAME Covid deaths' BAME doctors 'let down' over Covid risk checks But the committee said that excluding care workers and lower-paid NHS staff from the extension scheme ""fails to recognise the scale of their contribution to the UK fight against Covid-19"". ""Many of the excluded NHS employees - who include hospital porters, cleaners and administrative staff - are providing essential services to the NHS and its patients at this most trying time,"" the committee said. ""They are also more likely to be in lower-paid job roles, meaning that the necessity of paying visa renewal fees is a much greater financial burden."" THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? Labour MP, Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, said the NHS and social care sector have relied on help during the coronavirus crisis from foreign workers. ""Excluding the care workers who hold dying residents' hands, the cleaners who scrub the door handles and floors of the Covid wards, or the porters who take patients to intensive care is just wrong,"" Ms Cooper said. She said that she will table an amendment with cross-party backing to the government's Immigration Bill. Last month, the governmentscrapped the immigration health surchargefor all NHS staff and care workers. The Home Office has alsoextended its bereavement schemeso families of overseas NHS support staff and care workers who have died with coronavirus can stay in the UK permanently. In its report, the committee urged the government to make it easier for overseas health and care workers to settle in the UK. ""We believe that people who have given so much, and in many cases risked their own health, for the nations and people of the UK should be assisted to become permanent members of the society to which they have dedicated themselves,"" the report stated. A government spokesperson said: ""We are incredibly grateful for all the hard work that health and care workers continue to do in the fight against coronavirus.

"Paul and Elaine Gait said at the time they felt ""violated"" by Sussex Police A police force has paid out Â£200,000 over the arrest of a couple falsely accused of causing chaos at Gatwick Airport with a drone. Armed officers stormed the home of Paul and Elaine Gait in December 2018, and held them for 36 hours after drones caused the airport to close repeatedly. The couple were released without charge, and sued Sussex Police for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment. The Gait's legal team said the force had agreed an out-of-court settlement. Airport chiefs said 120,000 people due to arrive or fly had not been able to travel Sussex Police confirmed it has paid the couple the Â£55,000 owed in damages, and law firm Howard Kennedy said it has billed the force an additional Â£145,000 in legal costs. Flights were cancelled in droves over a three-day period, as police investigated multiple reported drone sightings. No-one has ever been charged, and police have said that some reported drone sightings may have been Sussex Police's own craft. Police 'sorry' for drone arrest distress Drone arrest couple 'feel violated' How can a drone cause so much chaos? Twelve armed officers swooped on Mr and Mrs Gait's home, even though they did not possess any drones and had been at work during the reported sightings. In a statement released by their legal team on Sunday, the couple said: ""We are delighted to have finally received vindication, it has been a very long fight for justice. ""It has taken lengthy legal proceedings to obtain resolution from the police and to finally have closure on this distressing time."" Anti-drone equipment was used at Gatwick Airport after the drone stopped flights intermittently for days In a letter to the couple, Sussex Police Assistant Chief Constable David Miller said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the ""unpleasantness"" the couple experienced, and acknowledged it would have been ""traumatic"". He added: ""Unfortunately, when the police carry out their functions on behalf of the public, sometimes innocent people are arrested as part of necessary police investigations in the public interest. ""However, we recognise that things could have been done differently and, as a result, Sussex Police have agreed to pay you compensation and legal costs."" The force commissioned a ""thorough independent review"" of the drone incident last year. It revealed96 people ""of interest"" were identified, researched and ruled outduring the investigation and the cost of the operation and subsequent investigation was Â£790,000.

"This video can not be played What's it now like shopping for clothes? After three months of hibernation, non-essential shops in England will finally be able to re-open on Monday. But it is clear Covid-19 will have a lasting impact on retail well beyond the end of lockdown. There's socially distanced shopping, for starters. The new retail rules during this pandemic may take a bit of getting used to. It's one thing queueing for groceries, but we're going to have to be prepared to queue to get into all the other shops, too. We're being encouraged to shop alone and to avoid touching things, where possible. You may have to forget trying clothes on as the guidance says fitting rooms should be closed wherever possible. Coronavirus is going to suck some of the fun out of one of our most popular social activities and not all of us will fancy waiting in line when we can buy what we want online. Shoppers outside a reopened Ikea store: queueing when we shop will now be more common Duncan Brewer, head of the UK retail and consumer team at consultants Oliver Wyman, says people may also be more careful with their money. ""Consumers have changed their spending habits, and will be increasingly used to going without much of their discretionary shopping. ""With the inevitable recession coming, it's likely that many will continue to be careful with spending, even if they are comfortable shopping in the first place."" There's clearly a bit of pent-up demand, given the spectacular queues outside Ikea stores when they recently re-opened. But even if queueing becomes part of everyday life for now, it doesn't mean bumper profits for retailers. Social distancing makes it hard for many firms to trade profitably. Fewer shoppers means fewer transactions which may not cover all the costs of running stores, especially when government support measures start to ebb away. ""When we do start opening up, it certainly won't be profitable, but we've got to start somewhere,"" the retail entrepreneur and businessmen Theo Paphitis told me recently as he prepared to reopen his Robert Dyas, Boux Lingerie and Ryman stores. This video can not be played Theo Paphitis: âMrs P has been ordering online every day!â He believes coronavirus has speeded up our changing shopping habits. Online sales have been rising steadily over the last decade but they've rocketed during the pandemic. According to a survey by Visa,external, a third of Britons bought items online for the first time during lockdown.  And that is likely to be a permanent shift - just look at food shopping. According to the most recent monthly figures from Kantar, nearly one in five households ordered groceries online - 1.6 million more than this time last year. Non-food retailers have also seen a huge spike in online sales. KPMG estimates online retailing could reach 50% of the total goods we buy by 2025, five years earlier than previously anticipated. ""The necessity for many retailers to change business models, review their cost base including the amount of physical space they require, has been turbo-charged,"" says Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG. Numbers in stores will be limited to comply with social distancing With more done online, retailers need fewer shops. This was so long before coronavirus came along, yet the economics of store-based retailing look even more tricky now. Not all shops will open immediately. It will be a gradual re-opening for some big chains. And some shops will never re-open, although as yet it's difficult to say how many. Debenhams - in administration for the second time - has already said 17 of its stores will remain permanently closed. Others have already failed to make it through lockdown - Cath Kidston, Oasis and Warehouse - and there will be more to come. High Street fashion chain Oasis has been one of the retail casualties of the lockdown ""There will continue to be business failures - but there is also opportunity for the better capitalised and more agile retailers,"" says Lisa Hooker, PWC's head of retail and consumer markets. Retailers have been able to furlough workers and save huge sums with a year-long business rates holiday, but many costs have continued leaving them with an almighty cash squeeze. Some won't be able to pay their rent for months to come. Also, given the problems and debt burdens that many big businesses have, access to the government's bailout loan schemes is proving challenging given the strict credit worthiness tests from lenders.  More debt is the last thing some retailers need as any loans will later have to be paid off alongside deferred costs such as VAT. Debenhams has already said 17 of its department stores will remain permanently closed For weaker businesses, coronavirus has brought all their problems to a head. Watch out for Darwinism in retail over the next 18 months, says Paul Martin. ""Those with an appealing customer proposition and valid business models, that are really fit for purpose with strong balance sheets will survive. Those that have neither will fall by the wayside"" If more shops shut, who and what will fill the gaps? ""There are so many implications for town centres,"" says Ojay McDonald, CEO of the Association of Town and Centre Management. ""Many businesses in some city locations may be unviable as organisations who use large office spaces may be more supportive of home working, which will mean a big decrease in footfall and spend in these areas."" Over the next 12-18 months there will plenty of turmoil on Britain's High Streets But equally, there could be a boost to towns and villages, if more people are working from home. ""Covid-19 has shone a light on the need for many big chains to accelerate store closures but the lockdown has also led us to want to shop locally - so some High Streets will flourish,"" believes Lisa Hooker. Duncan Brewer also thinks there will be opportunities for new businesses: ""Up to 25% of retail sites could be vacant. This large amount of retail space available will allow new entrants to launch new businesses without all the historic barriers to entry,"" Coronavirus could help reinvent our High Streets and town centres. But over the next 12-18 months there will plenty of turmoil, too.

"More than one million people have fallen through cracks in government schemes designed to support them during the coronavirus crisis, MPs says. The Treasury Select Committee called on ministers to plug gaps in the schemes to fulfil the government's promise of ""doing whatever it takes"". Freelancers and recent employees are among those who cannot access support, the MPs say. The Treasury said the schemes protected millions of jobs and livelihoods. But the committee's interim report, which was unanimously agreed by members, said it was still not enough. ""The Treasury's interventions have been welcomed by many but rolling out financial support at pace and scale has inevitably resulted in some hard edges in policy design and some critical gaps in provision,"" the committee said. ""The government must assist these people if it is to completely fulfil its promise to do whatever it takes to protect people from the economic impact of coronavirus."" 'Forgotten' TV freelancers call for 'urgent help' Bank of England 'ready to act' as economy reels The MPs said hundreds of thousands of people are suffering financial hardship through no fault of their own, often due to unfortunate timing in starting a new job or their employer's choice of timing in submitting payroll paperwork to the HMRC tax authority. When lockdown first started, the Treasury said it would cover up to 80% of the salaries of workers who were unable to do their job from home. But those who started a new job after the government's 28 February cut-off date are not covered by the scheme. Although this was later extended by three weeks, many have still been left behind, the committee said. Retailers get ready to reopen after three months Which areas have the most furloughed workers? Do you feel you have missed out on the support offered by the government during the coronavirus crisis? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The committee also said the government is failing to help those who have become self-employed within the last year and those whose companies have annual trading profits of more than Â£50,000. Another group that has fallen through the net is freelancers or those on short-term contracts. The MPs said that in industries such as television and theatre, where short-term contracts are the norm, many workers are not entitled to support under the schemes. The report said: ""This cannot be right. The government should give this group access to financial support that equates to 80% of their average monthly income, up to a total of Â£2,500 per month."" The report comes amid growing unease about the health of the economy, which contracted by a record 20.4% in April. There are warnings of huge job losses once the furlough schemes are wound down. On Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged on the Andrew Marr show ""there is going to be hardship ahead"". Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride said: ""The chancellor has said that he will do whatever it takes to support people and businesses from the economic impact of the pandemic. Overall, he has acted at impressive scale and pace. ""However, the committee has identified well over a million people who, through no fault of their own, have lost livelihoods while being locked down and locked out of the main support programmes."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The swift and targeted action we've taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee. ""Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world - with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than Â£6.5 billion injected into the welfare safety net. ""All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.""
