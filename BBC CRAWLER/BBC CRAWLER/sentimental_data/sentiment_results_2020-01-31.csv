"Britain has left the EU, more than three years and three prime ministers after it voted out. It's been a political rollercoaster full of twists and turns, and a journey which can be tracked by what people said at the time. Some have aged better than others, but here are a few of the key quotes from before the referendum until Brexit day. Then-PM David Cameron wasspeaking aboutBritain's response to Europe's debt crisis. MPs in Parliament had just voted against holding an EU referendum, after 100,000 people signed a petition calling for one. But back then, the word Brexit hadnot even been invented.In the summer of 2012, as London readied itself for hosting the Olympics, the ""B"" word emerged, albeit with a different spelling to what we know today: Meanwhile, the PM faced more pressure to hold a EU referendum.Nearly 100 Tory MPssigned a letter to him calling for one. The following year, Mr Cameron agreed,promisinga referendum on Britain staying in the EU. He planned to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before giving people a ""simple choice"" of in or out. In Europe, politicians reacted: Meanwhile UKIP was becoming a force in British politics. Leader Nigel Faragesaidhe wanted a referendum to happen quickly. By December 2013 the party claimed that arecord year of growth had taken its membership above 30,000 for the first time. Back in Brussels, the time had come for an EU summit, with Mr Cameron pledging to deliver a strong message to EU leaders. During the next year, his plans to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU were discussed. Mr Cameron, fresh from a general election victory, went on tostrike a dealon a new UK-EU relationship. He promised ""We'll be out of the parts of Europe that don't work for us"" and ""never be part of a European super-state"". He thenannounceda date for the referendum - 23 June 2016. Most other parties - except the DUP and UKIP - backed Remain, including Labour. Among those warning against Brexit was the then-US president. The UK, he said,would not be seen as a priorityfor trade deals. And a group of nearly 300 actors, musicians, writers and artistssigneda letter urging people to vote Remain. Meanwhile, it was during the campaign that the then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson famously, and wrongly, echoedVote Leave's claim,externalthat the UK pays the EU Â£350m a week - higher thanthe actual amountat the time. A computer glitch meant thousands of people wereunable to register to votein time. The government blamed the snag on record demand and extended the deadline, allowing another 430,000 more people to register. With just over a week to go, polling expert Prof John CurticesaidRemain was no longer the frontrunner. Nevertheless, there was surprise for many when, on referendum night, the results started to show a lead for Leave. Later, the full result was in: Britain had voted to leave the EU and Europe was in shock. Across the continent and beyond, front pagesreactedto the ""24 hours in which the world has changed"". The following day, Mr Cameron - who fronted the Remain campaign -quit, saying he had fought the campaign ""head, heart and soul"". It sparked a race for the next Conservative Party leader. Boris Johnson was immediately installed as the bookies' favourite to win and was backed by his fellow Leave campaigner, Michael Gove. But, in a shock twist, Mr Goveannouncedthat instead of backing his friend and colleague, he himself would run for the top job. Mr Johnson pulled out of the contest. Seven things Brexit will change, and seven it won't Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? 12 moments in the UK-EU relationship Theresa May became the frontrunner, andset outher ambitions to win. She took over the following month and with a new UK prime minister came a new slogan: A year later, she called a snap election which saw the Conservative Partylose their majority,while Labour made gains. Meanwhile, negotiations had begun - with leading EU figures making their opinions clear. Donald Tuskquoted John Lennon to suggestthe door remained open to the UK staying. After months of talks,Theresa May announcedthat her top team had backed her Brexit deal. Jean-Claude Junckerlater insisted: ""I'm never changing my mind. Abba star Bjorn Ulvaeusshared his thoughts,externalon Theresa May dancing on to the stage to the sound of Dancing Queen at the Conservative Party conference. Meanwhile, as Theresa May struggled to get her deal through Parliament, Mr Tuskwas criticisedfor taking aim at Brexiteers. Brexit was postponed to 31 October, after MPs rejected the Brexit deal and voted against leaving without a deal.Mr Tusk saidthe extension was ""enough"" to get a solution. Amid a backlash from her own MPs against her Brexit plan - and after the deal was rejected three times -Mrs May quitas prime minister after three years. Two months later, and the UK had a new PM, after Mr Johnson won the Conservative leadership vote against Jeremy Hunt. He referred to Brexit inhis maiden speech,saying ""the buck stops here"". Early on, Mr Johnson faced criticism aftersuspending Parliamentjust days after MPs returned to work. But pressing on with his ""get Brexit done"" message, Mr Johnson was adamant Brexit would not be postponed again. Then, at the end of September, Mr Johnson suffered a blow when his decision to suspend Parliamentwas ruledto be unlawful by the UK's top court. MPs returned to work straight away - andthe mood in the Commonswas angry. Mr Johnson became embroiled in a row about the language used, and wascriticisedfor one comment in particular: Meanwhile, for the PM's adviser, Dominic Cummings - who also ran the Vote Leave campaign -being in governmentwas less pressure than the Brexit campaign. Finally,Mr Johnson sent a request to the EU asking for a delay to Brexit- but without his signature - and accompanied by a second letter, which he did sign, saying he believed a delay would be a mistake. And despite his ""do or die"" pledge, he agreed to an extension until 31 January. After several attempts to get a general election, Mr Johnson finally succeeded - the UK's first December election for 96 years. Hewon with a big majority,meaning the path to ""get Brexit done"" suddenly became a lot smoother. Last week,the PM signedthe Brexit withdrawal agreement, saying he hoped it would ""bring to an end far too many years of argument and division"".

" By Chris Morris The United Kingdom was always one step removed from the vision of a united Europe. It was a vision born after World War Two, with an underlying aim - to pool economic resources on a shattered and divided continent, and to make sure that war between France and Germany would never happen again. But, from the start, a big question loomed in the background - where would Europe’s great island nation fit in? It was not until four years after the EEC was established in 1957, that the UK belatedly applied to join. The application was motivated in part by fear of isolation as a new power bloc began to emerge in western Europe. With the Cold War against the Soviet Union firmly entrenched, governments in Paris and Bonn, and a new bureaucracy based in Brussels, were leading six countries towards ever-closer economic integration. The UK was certainly looking for an economic boost, but it never quite shook off suspicion of the shared sovereignty that membership of the new European institutions implied. And while the British Empire was fading fast, London was also anxious to retain the independent trading links forged by its historic ties to the countries of the Commonwealth. This sense of hesitation set the tone for decades to come. The French President Charles de Gaulle certainly smelled a rat. He vetoed the British application in 1963 and again in 1967, citing Britain’s “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project. The UK, he once said, “is maritime; it is bound by trade, by its markets, to the most diverse array of countries - and often the most far-flung... its habits and traditions are very different.” It was only in 1969, after de Gaulle’s resignation, that the green light was finally given for talks on British membership of the European Communities (EC) to begin. Right: The signing of the Treaty of Rome, 1957 Negotiations to join were just as difficult as negotiations to leave turned out to be nearly 50 years later. The UK discovered that the EC (later to become the EU) was above all a community based on rules. If you wanted to join, however big you were, you had to play by those rules. There were arguments about sovereignty, agriculture and the free movement of labour. Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath was possibly the most pro-European ever to have held the office but then, as now, divisions over Europe existed in both main parties. Labour opposed what it called the “Tory terms” of entry to the Common Market but 69 rebels, led by Shadow Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, defied their party line and voted to join the EEC. Jenkins was greeted with cries of “traitor” from his own benches. But he later wrote: ""I was convinced that it was one of the decisive votes of the century, and had no intention of spending the rest of my life answering the question of what did I do in the great division by saying 'I abstained.’” Others were less captivated by any sense of history. The UK joined the EC on New Year’s Day 1973 with little fanfare or ceremony - there were only small demonstrations for and against. “We’re in - but without the fireworks,” said the headline in The Guardian.   In 1974 Labour came to power under Harold Wilson, promising to renegotiate the deal and then hold a referendum. The negotiations didn’t achieve fundamental change and in June 1975 the country’s first nationwide referendum posed the question, “Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (the Common Market)?” Tony Benn campaigning for a ""No"" vote Tony Benn campaigning for a ""No"" vote Opposition to a Yes vote included voices from the right, but it was dominated by leading Labour MPs. These included cabinet members such as Michael Foot, Barbara Castle and notably Tony Benn, who described entry into Europe as “the decapitation of British democracy”, and once said of visiting Brussels, “I felt as if I were going as a slave to Rome”. But all major party leaders and the mainstream media campaigned for a Yes vote and the outcome was never really in doubt - a resounding 67.2% voted in favour of remaining “in Europe”. The margin of victory was large but the argument in the No campaign’s official leaflet - that “the fundamental question is whether or not we remain free to rule ourselves in our own way” - would rumble on. “What we are asking,” said Margaret Thatcher in 1980, “is for a very large amount of our own money back.” Having played a leading role in campaigning to keep the UK in the EC in 1975, Thatcher’s attitude as prime minister became far more confrontational. Launching a campaign for the UK’s budget contributions to be reduced, she declared simply, “We are giving you notice that we just cannot afford it!” At the heart of her complaint was the UK’s contribution to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). A system designed to subsidise European farmers and stabilise food prices, it was always associated in British eyes with butter mountains and wine lakes, with overproduction and waste. At the time, CAP accounted for 70% of the EU budget, but the benefits were felt far more in countries, like France, with a large agricultural sector. The UK received relatively little. Nevertheless, it took four more years to reach a deal on what became known as the UK budget rebate, or – more contemptuously in French – “le chèque britannique”. The rebate was permanent and worth several billion pounds a year. It could only be amended with British consent. Despite her reservations about many aspects of European integration, Thatcher was also one of the driving forces behind the creation of a single European market. In February 1986 she signed the Single European Act along with the leaders of other countries in the EC, which had now expanded to 12 member states. In the 1980s the Common Market was still littered with national barriers to trade and Thatcher’s goal was simple - to open up Europe fully to British exporters. “A single market without barriers - visible or invisible,” she told business leaders in 1988, “giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people.” But where she saw “Thatcherism on a European scale” others, led by the Commission’s influential President Jacques Delors, saw something quite different. The Single European Act set a deadline for creating a genuine single market by 1992, but it also deepened prospects for political integration, making it easier for European laws to be passed, and for common European foreign and home affairs policies to emerge. For the founding fathers of European cooperation, like Jean Monnet, this was always part of the plan. “Continue continue,” Monnet was often quoted as saying, “there is no future for the people of Europe other than in union.” Right: European leaders in Luxembourg, December 1985, ahead of talks leading to the Single European Act “We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.” Margaret Thatcher’s words at the College of Europe in Bruges were a defining moment in the UK’s relationship with the project of European integration. It was not an isolationist speech - quite the opposite. Thatcher spoke passionately about the UK’s long European history. “The UK does not dream,” she said, “of some cosy, isolated existence on the fringes of the European Community. Our destiny is in Europe, as part of the Community.” But it should be based, she insisted, on willing and active cooperation between independent sovereign states. Shortly before she was forced to step down as prime minister in 1990, she responded to the plans for further integration, laid out by Delors, with three words delivered in a packed House of Commons: “No, no, no.” The Sun newspaper echoed this sentiment, with an even more direct message: “Up Yours, Delors.” Right: European Commission President Jacques Delors displays the new EU flag in 1987 The goal of ever closer union was never abandoned, and the Maastricht Treaty was a step change in European integration. It created the EU, laid the foundation for a single European currency and established the European Central Bank. It also introduced the idea of European citizenship, created a common foreign and security policy, and closer co-operation on police and judicial issues. The reaction in the UK was explosive. Foreign secretary Douglas Hurd (left) and Prime Minister John Major at the Maastricht summit, 1991 Foreign secretary Douglas Hurd (left) and Prime Minister John Major at the Maastricht summit, 1991 To try to placate an increasingly vocal eurosceptic wing in his own party, Thatcher’s successor John Major had negotiated opt-outs for the UK on joining the euro, and on the social chapter, dealing with issues like workers’ rights and health and safety. But that wasn’t enough for rebellious backbenchers, or the critics within his own cabinet (whom he was once caught unawares referring to as “bastards”). With only a small majority in Parliament, Major spent more than a year narrowly fending off attempts to stop the treaty being adopted in British law. The battle over the UK’s place in Europe would continue to dominate Conservative politics for the next 25 years. And among those who resigned from the Tory party in protest against Maastricht was a former commodities broker named Nigel Farage. In the midst of the Maastricht drama, another seismic event took place which deepened political divisions over Europe. “There are more myths about Black Wednesday than the Greeks ever created,” Major observed many years later. But it was a political humiliation from which his government never recovered. Black Wednesday was the day the UK crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a forerunner of the euro. The ERM was designed to keep exchange rates stable between European member currencies, by pegging their value to the Deutsche mark. Sterling had joined in 1990 but by September 1992, foreign currency speculators (most famously, George Soros) were betting against sterling being able to stay in the ERM. Despite spending billions trying to support it, and announcing that interest rates would rise to 15%, by the evening of 16 September, the government had to admit defeat. The UK left the ERM and the value of the pound was allowed to fall sharply. “Out of Control” and “On Skid Row” were two of the more polite headlines at the time, although many economists argue that Black Wednesday marked the start of an economic upturn for the UK. It also crystallised visceral opposition inside the Conservative party to big European projects and helped set the UK on the long road to Brexit. The single currency was the EU’s most ambitious project, but the UK wasn’t in it. The euro was launched in 1999 but it was not until New Year’s Day 2002 that the new currency became a daily reality for 300 million citizens in 12 countries. “We are witnessing the dawn of an age that the people of Europe have dreamed of for centuries,” said the German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. “Borderless travel and payment in a common currency.” The curious queued at cash machines at midnight, there were mutterings of price rises by stealth, but the drachma and the franc, the lira and the mark were all being phased out. The UK had opted not to join. The Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown devised five economic tests to assess the UK’s readiness to take part in monetary union - tests that were never satisfactorily met. Later, Brown wrote: ""I was ready to resign as Chancellor if I was unable to persuade my colleagues of the grave risks of taking us immediately into euro membership.” It was soon to become unthinkable as the eurozone was embroiled in financial crisis in Greece and elsewhere. But the euro stabilised and, at a cost, it survived. By the time the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, 19 countries were members of this club within a club - the inner circle of European integration. Every night, they came by the coachload. Polish workers streamed into the UK after the post-war political division of Europe - into east and west - finally came to an end. The European Union’s most ambitious enlargement ever took place on a sunny May Day in 2004. Ten new member states joined - eight of them former communist countries in eastern and central Europe. Prime Minister Tony Blair called the “Big Bang” a “great opportunity for Britain”. “The countries coming into Europe share our view of a Europe of independent nation states,” he said, “working together for the common good of all.” But there were now huge disparities of income within the EU and only three countries - the UK, Ireland and Sweden - opened their labour markets to citizens of the new member states immediately, without any restrictions. Over the next few years hundreds of thousands of eastern Europeans came to live and work in the UK, changing the debate on immigration, free movement and open borders. The UK Independence Party (UKIP) began to make headway by linking immigration and EU membership in its election campaigns. UKIP came third in the European elections in 2004. A decade later, led by Farage, it came first. Right: Polish workers board coaches bound for London, 2006 When EU leaders gathered in the 16th Century monastery of Jerónimos to sign the Lisbon Treaty, the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown wasn’t even there. He turned up three hours late and eventually signed the treaty on his own. His “beneath the radar” approach to a big European moment rather summed up the growing ambivalence of the UK’s position. Lisbon was designed to streamline EU institutions to make them work more smoothly. But critics in the UK saw it as a further threat to national sovereignty, not least because it resurrected many elements of a failed attempt in 2004 to introduce an EU constitution. The word “constitution” disappeared from the 2007 treaty, as did any written reference to a flag or an anthem. Ramification in the UK came via a vote in parliament, despite bitter criticism from Eurosceptics. “Every time the people have insisted on a halt to integration,” Nigel Farage wrote of Lisbon, “they have been force-fed yet more.” Right: Gordon Brown, photographed during the signing of the Lisbon Treaty Stop “banging on about Europe”, David Cameron urged his party in 2006, a year after being elected leader. But during 13 years in opposition, Conservative eurosceptic voices grew ever louder, as did pressure to give the people a say on Europe. So when Cameron came to power as prime minister in 2010, he was determined to lance the boil. In January 2013 - at the headquarters of Bloomberg in London - he pledged to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the EU and then hold an In/Out referendum on membership, if his party won the next election. ""It is time to settle this European question in British politics,” Cameron announced. “I say to the British people: this will be your decision."" His critics accused him of taking a huge gamble. Headlines had been dominated for the past few years by the eurozone crisis, and increasingly by stories of the many people fleeing Syria and elsewhere for Europe, overwhelming the EU’s ability to cope and threatening its unity. But the Conservatives won the 2015 general election, and Cameron was bound by his promise. His promised renegotiation of the UK’s terms of membership proved, politically, to be a damp squib - the most the EU was able to offer was always going to be less than the minimum the prime minister’s rebellious colleagues were prepared to accept. Mr Cameron himself campaigned to remain in the EU, but the die was cast. Right: David Cameron announces plans for a referendum  The signing of the Treaty of Rome, 1957 The signing of the Treaty of Rome, 1957 The United Kingdom was always one step removed from the vision of a united Europe.

Polish workers streamed into the UK after the post-war political division of Europe - into east and west - finally came to an end. The European Union’s most ambitious enlargement ever took place on a sunny May Day in 2004. Ten new member states joined - eight of them former communist countries in eastern and central Europe. Prime Minister Tony Blair called the “Big Bang” a “great opportunity for Britain”. “The countries coming into Europe share our view of a Europe of independent nation states,” he said, “working together for the common good of all.” But there were now huge disparities of income within the EU and only three countries - the UK, Ireland and Sweden - opened their labour markets to citizens of the new member states immediately, without any restrictions. Over the next few years hundreds of thousands of eastern Europeans came to live and work in the UK, changing the debate on immigration, free movement and open borders. Polish language signs became a common sight in the UK after 2004 Polish language signs became a common sight in the UK after 2004 The UK Independence Party (UKIP) began to make headway by linking immigration and EU membership in its election campaigns. UKIP came third in the European elections in 2004. A decade later, led by Farage, it came first.  Gordon Brown at the signing of the Lisbon Treaty Gordon Brown at the signing of the Lisbon Treaty When EU leaders gathered in the 16th Century monastery of Jerónimos to sign the Lisbon Treaty, the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown wasn’t even there. He turned up three hours late and eventually signed the treaty on his own. His “beneath the radar” approach to a big European moment rather summed up the growing ambivalence of the UK’s position. Lisbon was designed to streamline EU institutions to make them work more smoothly. But critics in the UK saw it as a further threat to national sovereignty, not least because it resurrected many elements of a failed attempt in 2004 to introduce an EU constitution. That proposal had been rejected in French and Dutch referendums. The UK sidestepped a promise to hold a similar vote in the UK, which would probably have produced the same result. The word “constitution” disappeared from the 2007 treaty, as did any written reference to a flag or an anthem. Ramification in the UK came via a vote in parliament, despite bitter criticism from eurosceptics. “Every time the people have insisted on a halt to integration,” Nigel Farage wrote of Lisbon, “they have been force-fed yet more.”  David Cameron announces the European referendum, 2013 David Cameron announces the European referendum, 2013 Stop “banging on about Europe”, David Cameron urged his party in 2006, a year after being elected leader. But during 13 years in opposition, Conservative eurosceptic voices grew ever louder, as did pressure to give the people a say on Europe. So when Cameron came to power as prime minister in 2010, he was determined to lance the boil. In January 2013 - at the headquarters of Bloomberg in London - he pledged to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the EU and then hold an In/Out referendum on membership, if his party won the next election. ""It is time to settle this European question in British politics,” Cameron announced. “I say to the British people: this will be your decision."" His critics accused him of taking a huge gamble. Headlines had been dominated for the past few years by the eurozone crisis, and increasingly by stories of the many people fleeing Syria and elsewhere for Europe, overwhelming the EU’s ability to cope and threatening its unity. But the Conservatives won the 2015 general election, and Cameron was bound by his promise. His promised renegotiation of the UK’s terms of membership proved, politically, to be a damp squib - the most the EU was able to offer was always going to be less than the minimum the prime minister’s rebellious colleagues were prepared to accept. Mr Cameron himself campaigned to remain in the EU, but the die was cast.  ",Positive,1.0
"Jessica Mann said she ""entered into what I thought was going to be a real relationship with him"" A one-time aspiring actress says Harvey Weinstein subjected her to ""degrading"" abuse, in some of the most graphic testimony shared in his trial so far. Jessica Mann detailed a catalogue of abuse by the Hollywood producer, saying he once trapped her in a hotel bedroom and raped her. Three of the five charges against Mr Weinstein relate to Ms Mann. He denies non-consensual sex and his lawyers say emails prove his and Ms Mann's relationship was consensual. WARNING: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting Ms Mann's evidence came at the end of the fourth week of the Manhattan trial of the Oscar-winning Hollywood mogul, who produced films including Shakespeare in Love and The English Patient. The 34-year-old said she met him in late 2012 or early 2013 at a party, and she told him of her ambition to be an actress. Later, she said, he invited her and a friend to a Los Angeles hotel suite. He then allegedly pulled Ms Mann into a bedroom and performed oral sex on her. Ms Mann then began a relationship with Mr Weinstein. ""I entered into what I thought was going to be a real relationship with him and it was extremely degrading from that point on,"" she said. She said he once urinated on her, and in 2013 raped her in a Manhattan hotel room. ""If he heard the word 'no,' it was like a trigger for him,"" she said. When asked why she stayed in the relationship, Ms Mann said in tears that there was ""no short answer"". ""One of the aspects initially was that I had had a sexual encounter"" with him, she said. ""That wasn't something I could undo. That really confused me and hurt me."" She stayed with him partly out of fear, she said. Weinstein arrives in court using a walking frame One of Mr Weinstein's lawyers, Damon Cheronis, said Ms Mann sent ""flattering"" emails to Mr Weinstein during their relationship, one of which said ""Miss you, big guy."" These prove the relationship was not abusive, the defence alleges. In Friday's testimony, Ms Mann also alleged that Mr Weinstein had ""extreme scarring"" on his body and used erectile dysfunction medication. She also believed he was intersex, and it appeared he had a vagina and no testicles. Since October 2017, more than 80 women have publicly accused Mr Weinstein of sexual misconduct but this criminal case involves only a few of them. Some consider the trial a watershed moment, where some of Mr Weinstein's alleged victims have had their voices heard in court for the first time. Mr Weinstein is on trial for five offences, including rape and predatory sexual assault. He denies the charges and all allegations of wrongdoing, but if convicted could face life in prison. Here is what has happened in the trial so far. Mr Weinstein turned up to his first court appearance heavily aided and using a walking frame. Crowds of protesters, including some accusers, gathered outside the courthouse to try and face him down. ""You thought you could terrorise me and others into silence. You were wrong,"" actress Rose McGowan, who accuses him of rape, said reading from an open letter. ""Today Lady Justice is staring down a super predator,"" Ms McGowan told reporters The same day, on 6 January, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced new charges against Mr Weinstein. After the New York trial, he is expected to appear in court in California. Finding an impartial jury for the New York case was a difficult task, with hundreds summoned as potential jurors. Mr Weinstein's legal team even filed a last-minute motion to move the trial outside Manhattan over the ""carnival-like atmosphere"" surrounding proceedings. They cited the media hype about model Gigi Hadid being among the potential jurors. Potential Weinstein juror speaks of 'disgust' Harvey Weinstein trial: What you need to know How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded The first week of proceedings ended with a flash-mob of protesters performing an anti-rape chant outside, which could be heard inside the courtroom. During the process, prosecutors accused Mr Weinstein's defence team of ""systematically eliminating"" young white women as jurors. The selection process concluded with five women and seven men on the panel. ""This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement. It is not a referendum on sexual harassment,"" Judge James Burke told the jury, saying they must only decide if Mr Weinstein ""committed certain acts which constitute a particular crime"". ""The man seated right there was not just a titan in Hollywood, he was a rapist,"" prosecutor Meghan Hast said in her opening statement on 22 January. She accused him of using his celebrity status to manipulate women and explicitly detailed allegations against him. Only two of the accusers' cases, Mimi (Miriam) Haleyi and Jessica Mann, have led to individual criminals charges in New York but the testimony of others is being used as supporting evidence. Ms Hast, Assistant District Attorney, describes the Hollywood figure as a ""sexual predator"" Ms Hast described how Mr Weinstein allegedly ""lunged at"" Ms Haleyi in 2006 to perform a forced sex act on her. Ms Mann alleges he raped her in a New York hotel in 2013. One of Mr Weinstein's lawyers, Damon Cheronis, insists the state's case would ""unravel"" during the trial and urged the jury: ""While the narrative they painted for you is one that may reinforce your preconceived notions, it's not the truth."" The defence aim to present the sexual interactions as consensual. At the opening, Mr Cheronis alleged one accuser had even described Mr Weinstein as ""her casual boyfriend"". US actress Annabella Sciorra testified on 23 January that the film producer raped her in the winter of 1993/4. Her allegations, outside New York's statue of limitations, are being used to support the most serious charge of predatory sexual assault. She said Mr Weinstein forced his way into her apartment after a dinner with others. ""I was trying to get him off me,"" she told the jury. ""I was punching him, kicking him."" The former Sopranos actress described her body shaking after the alleged assault and said she did not go public with it for years because she was ""afraid for her life"". Ms Sciorra's friend, fellow actress Rosie Perez, testified that she shared some details of the incident with her at the time, but on cross-examination lawyers challenged Ms Sciorra's ability to remember the exact date of the alleged attack. Lawyer Donna Rotunno tried to poke holes in the Sopranos actress' account A forensic psychiatrist, Dr Barbara Ziv, also testified as an expert witness to explain misconceptions around rape and the behaviour of victims. Production assistant Mimi Haleyi told the court that Mr Weinstein assaulted her twice in Manhattan in 2006, after he helped her get a job on a television show he produced. She detailed an incident at his apartment where she alleges he performed oral sex on her, without consent, when she was on her period. What we learned from Weinstein documentary Who has accused Weinstein of what? ""Every time I tried to get off the bed he would push me back and hold me down,"" Ms Haleyi said during emotional testimony. ""At this point I realised what was happening. I'm being raped."" She told the court he convinced her to meet again weeks later. On that occasion she allegedly ""laid there"" as he had sex with her in an incident that left her feeling ""numb"" and like ""an idiot"". Mr Weinstein has only been charged over first alleged encounter. This video can not be played Hired by Weinstein to extract information on celebrities During cross-examination Mr Weinstein's defence focused on her continued contact with him after the alleged incidents and presented email exchanges between the two including one she signed off with ""lots of love"". Throughout the week further ""prior bad acts"" witnesses continued to testify. Former actress Dawn Dunning alleged Mr Weinstein put her hands up her skirt and touched her genitals at a hotel in Soho in 2004 and later tried to offer her film roles in exchange for sex. Tarale Wulff alleged Mr Weinstein masturbated in front of her in 2005 when she worked as a waitress. She said she was later invited to read scripts by Weinstein Company staff and was taken to his apartment, where he allegedly raped her.

"The bulk of British Steel's 4,000 staff work at the Scunthorpe plant The sale of British Steel to Chinese firm Jingye could be scuppered by French intervention. Jingye agreed in November to buy the collapsed business for Â£50m and save about 4,000 jobs. However, the approval of the French government is required because British Steel has a plant in France that is considered a strategic national asset. Now French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has threatened to veto the deal,as first reported by Sky News.,external Mr Le Maire told Chancellor Sajid Javid of his intentions last week during a meeting in Brussels, government sources confirmed to the BBC. The Anglo-French row centres on British Steel's plant in Hayange, which supplies the French railway network, including state-owned train operator SNCF. France has the power to block the sale of the Hayange plant, which has already beenadvertised for sale separately from the UK operation, apparently with the blessing of the French authorities. When British Steel collapsed more than seven months ago, control of the holding company passed to the UK Insolvency Service, which is responsible for selling the assets. Although the service is the beneficial owner of Hayange, day-to-day operational control of the factory remains in France. There is another potential bidder for British Steel waiting in the wings. Earlier this week, Turkish construction conglomerate Cengiz Holdings confirmed its ""intention and ability to make an offer for the whole of British Steel, should the current talks with Jingye Group fall away"". Cengiz chief executive Omer Mafa said the company was ""ready and waiting to engage with the UK government and British Steel's receivers to progress towards a full offer"". Mr Mafa added that Cengiz enjoyed a ""strong trading relationship with French industries such as energy, mining and aviation"". Government sources confirm that the French finance minister has indicated to Chancellor Sajid Javid that he is opposed to Chinese ownership of what the French consider strategically important assets. As a major supplier of steel to state-owned rail company SNCF, the French government considers the British Steel owned plant at Hayange in north-east France to fall into that category. The French position is different to that of the UK government, despite the fact that British Steel is a major supplier to state-owned Network Rail. Sources within the steel industry also confirm knowledge of the French objections. There is also widespread unease within the UK steel industry of the scale of Chinese ambitions within the UK. Jingye's ambitions to significantly increase production at Scunthorpe, along with the acquisition a week ago of UK steel trading company Stemcor, have caused alarm among other steel producers at the increasing penetration of Chinese interests in an important primary industry. French objections were widely anticipated and a process to carve out the French plant from the rest of British Steel if necessary has been under way for several months. The government remains hopeful that the deal with Jingye can still be completed and talks to seal that deal are ongoing. Carving out the profit-making French business is thought to make the overall deal less attractive to Jingye and for that reason, a deal with Turkish group Cengiz has been lined up as a potential fallback option if the deal with Jingye collapses.

"This video can not be played What's the deal with the controversial Nike Vaporfly trainers? Nike's controversial Vaporfly range will not be banned but there will be tighter regulations around high-tech running shoes, World Athletics says. Any new shoe technology developed after 30 April will have to be available on the open market for four months before an athlete can use it in competition. World Athletics has also introduced an immediate indefinite ban on any shoes that have a sole thicker than 40mm. The body will also investigate any shoes that ""may not be compliant"". An immediate indefinite ban has also been introduced on any shoe that contains more than one ""rigid embedded plate or blade"". For shoes with spikes, an additional plate or blade is allowed for the purpose of attaching the spikes, but the sole must be no thicker than 30mm. The 'Alphafly' prototype shoes worn by Eliud Kipchoge when he became the first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours in October 2019 will be banned. 'It feels like running on trampolines' Kipchoge breaks two-hour marathon mark The shoe worn by Eliud Kipchoge when he became the first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours will be banned indefinitely A group of experts were asked to consider whether Nike's Vaporfly shoes give their wearers an unfair advantage. Athletes wearing the new footwear including Nike's latest Vaporfly have taken 31 of 36 top-three finishes in major marathons last year. Kipchoge's Kenyan compatriot Brigid Kosgei wore a Vaporfly prototype when she broke Paula Radcliffe's long-standing women's marathon world record in October 2019. World Athletics president Lord Coe said: ""It is not our job to regulate the entire sports shoe market but it is our duty to preserve the integrity of elite competition by ensuring the shoes worn by elite athletes in competition do not offer any unfair assistance or advantage. ""As we enter the Olympic year, we don't believe we can rule out shoes that have been generally available for a considerable period of time, but we can draw a line by prohibiting the use of shoes that go further than what is currently on the market while we investigate further. ""I believe these new rules strike the right balance by offering certainty to athletes and manufacturers as they prepare for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, while addressing the concerns that have been raised about shoe technology. ""If further evidence becomes available that indicates we need to tighten up these rules, we reserve the right to do that to protect our sport."" World Athletics will now establish an ""expert working group"" to ""guide future research"" into shoe technology as well as assessing any new shoes that enter the market. The shoes have been criticised for ""distorting the record books"", with some arguing they prevent fair competition with athletes not sponsored by Nike. Vaporflys claim to improve an athlete's performance by 4%, and the five fastest marathons of all time have been run in the past 16 months by athletes wearing varying forms of the technology. Former British Olympic marathon runner Mara Yamauchi previously told BBC Sport that ""we no longer truly have fair competition"". ""It's up to World Athletics to provide a level playing field for all... to be brutally honest, it's hard to see how anybody not wearing Vaporflys at Tokyo is going to win medals,"" she said. ""Athletics has had several years of doping stories coming out in the press and the single most important thing is to restore trust and bring in more fans and sponsors. ""But if we see every medal winner wearing the Vaporflys and other athletes not getting a look in, I'm not sure that people watching can really say I believe that performance 100%."" Nike said in a previous statement they ""respect the spirit of the rules and we do not create any running shoes that return more energy than the runner expends"". BBC sports editor Dan Roan Amid mounting confusion that running was becoming distorted, World Athletics has tried to provide some clarity before the Tokyo Olympics and halt what some see as an 'arms race' in shoe technology. Although more research will now be conducted and the rules could still develop, it seems significant the governing body admits ""concerns that the integrity of the sport might be threatened"". The news will come as a relief for Nike and the athletes it sponsors. The prototype 'AlphaFly' that Eliud Kipchoge used to go sub-two hours last year exceeds the new restrictions and is now banned for elite runners. But as expected, the Vaporfly range that has revolutionised distance running is cleared, including the 'Vaporfly Next%' that Brigid Kosgei wore when smashing the women's world record last year. That will lead to fears that the new restrictions have been conceived with that shoe's specific dimensions in mind, are too little too late, and mean athletes sponsored by other manufacturers are at a disadvantage. The changes also put pressure on rival companies to quickly develop any new prototype shoes. They have three months to do so. After that they will need to have been widely available to buy for four months before being allowed in elite competition, ruling out their use at the Olympics.

"Messaging service WhatsApp will no longer work on millions of smartphones from 1 February. Android and iPhone devices which only support outdated operating systems will no longer be able to run the Facebook-owned app. WhatsApp said the move was necessary in order to protect the security of its users. Smartphones using Android 2.3.7 and older, and iPhone iOS 8 or older, are those affected by the update. The operating systems that WhatsApp is dropping support for are legacy operating systems, which are no longer updated or installed on new devices. Most users will simply be able to update their operating systems in order to continue using the messaging service. WhatsApp: Indians among those 'targeted' by spyware Facebook's Sir Nick Clegg criticised over WhatsApp security However, certain devices, such as the iPhone 4, which only supports iOS 7, will no longer be compatible with the app. ""WhatsApp clearly had no option but to ensure its service remains secure, however it faces the difficult side-effect that the app is no longer compatible with older smartphones,"" said CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood. ""This is likely to disproportionally impact the long-tail of its users, particularly in growth markets where there is a high proportion of older devices."" WhatsApp,which was one of the most-downloaded apps of the decade, first warned users that these changes would happen back in 2017. ""This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp,"" said a spokesperson for the company. It is the latest in a series of moves after the messaging app withdrew support for numerous devices in 2016, and then from all Windows phones on 31 December, 2019.

"This video can not be played Spanish guitarist Antonio De Mata, who plays for Benidorm tourists, explains what Brexit means to him Forty-seven years ago, in 1973, the UK joined an organisation that aimed to bring European nations closer together. The British people voted two years later to remain in what became the European Union (EU), but in a 2016 referendum voted to leave. On Friday 31 January, at 23:00 GMT, the UK made history as the first EU member state to legally leave the bloc. Europeans from several of the remaining 27 member states have shared their thoughts about Brexit and the EU. Justyna Grudzien, 20, violinist from Poland As a member of the European Union Youth Orchestra, I've met several people from the UK - and they're all concerned about Brexit. For them, it means they can no longer be members of the orchestra, whose main goal is to connect people from EU countries. This orchestra has over 40 years of history and from the beginning people from the UK were a very important part. I think most of the organisers are British. For the rest of the orchestra, including me, travelling to the UK will not be as easy. We previously only needed a form of ID, but now who knows what will happen - we probably won't be able to travel without a visa. It is heart-breaking. How leaving the EU could change gigs for artists and fans On the other hand, I think the EU can, in some cases, put too much pressure on member states. The union is a wonderful idea for connecting European countries, but right now it doesn't seem to work. Gabriele Caredda, 27, NHS nurse from Sardinia, Italy As an NHS staff member, I was advised to apply for pre-settled status as it would, in theory, be enough for me to continue living and working in the UK. The uncertainty of a no-deal Brexit worries me, though, as we don't know if the situation will change, or what will be required of EU citizens in order for us to continue working in the country in the future. I think UK membership of the EU has been positive for both parties. It has allowed the free flow of people and ideas, and enabled a lot of young people to have experiences abroad, to face and explore a different culture and way of thinking. Migrant salary threshold fall 'would boost public sector' I was really disappointed with the Brexit result because I always thought the UK was a kind of multicultural oasis, where everybody could find their place in a society that appreciated them for what they were bringing to the table. Kate O'Sullivan, 27, Irelands Eye Knitwear, Ireland Brexit will have some affect on our business, but not a huge impact. As a company based out of the island of Ireland, we have always relied on export markets to grow our business, and approximately 55% of what we produce is exported to over 20 countries worldwide. Our exports to the UK make up about 3% of our overall business - so quite a small portion. To lose this business would be a pity, however we are in a better position than some other Irish companies who rely heavily on their UK customers. In preparation for Brexit, we are focusing more on other export markets such as Germany, France, and the Netherlands in order to achieve growth there, although it is difficult to prepare when we do not know the exact outcomes. The EU has been very good for Europe - the facilitation of trade agreements, the opportunities to do business and the facilitation of trade routes have all been extremely helpful, where Ireland is concerned in particular. Tudor Blaj, 43, tour operator in Romania I have no idea what will happen with Brexit - free movement of people is my main concern. I could have fewer British clients, so it may get more difficult for me. About 60% of my clients are British. UK membership of the EU and all the European construction has been a good thing. The EU has meant European states getting together to survive economic pressure from the US and China etc. Having a bigger market helps us compete with those big powers. I don't think Brexit will lead to a break-up of the EU. It could make the EU more united as they will examine what made the UK leave. There was a lack of communication about the EU's goals. Birte Wassenberg, 52, professor in contemporary history, Strasbourg Brexit is a kind of revolution in what it means to be in the EU. Nobody has ever left before, so this raises fundamental questions. It may get more difficult to invite British academics to Strasbourg to talk. UK membership has been good for Europe and the British were doing really well in the EU. They were essential for the common defence policy - without them it's a big problem. They helped the EU to develop real political power, not only economic. A lot of French people are glad that the British are leaving - they felt the British never really belonged. But Germans really regret the UK leaving. Having witnessed the mess of leaving the EU, others will be dissuaded from leaving too. Edwin van Gils, 50, florist, the Netherlands My granddad was a florist, then my father, and now it's me running this company exporting flowers to more than 1,000 supermarkets in the UK. We've been preparing for about a year and a half. We're in contact with transport companies in the UK. It's like a long-running soap opera that started in 2016 - now it's 2020 and nothing has changed. We are not looking at other markets. The UK is the market we know. We have a similar business sense and sense of humour. In five or six years I think things will settle down. I don't think the British will abandon Dutch flowers. A lot of countries that were considering leaving now see how much work it is and what it will cost. When you see the uncertainty in the UK you think twice.

"Thousands are still killed by landmines every year US President Donald Trump has lifted restrictions on the deployment of anti-personnel landmines by American forces. The decision reverses a 2014 Obama administration ban on the use of such weapons, which applied everywhere in the world except for in the defence of South Korea. The Trump administration said Mr Obama's policy could put US troops ""at a severe disadvantage"". Thousands of people are injured and killed by landmines every year. US forces will now be free to use the weapons across the world ""in exceptional circumstances"", the White House said. Where are the world's landmines? The US is not a signatory to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which restricts the development or use of anti-personnel land mines. The Obama-era ban applied to the US military everywhere but on the Korean Peninsula. That exception was made under pressure from military planners, to protect US troops based across the de-militarized zone from the North Korean military. Mr Obama also ordered the destruction of landmine stockpiles not made to defend South Korea.

Ms Stohl said the decision put lives at risk and was another example of the Trump administration ""defining its own rules and ignoring global standards of behaviour"". While the Obama administration refused to join the global ban on anti-personnel landmines, it broadly sympathised with the aims of the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty.

"Airbus will pay nearly â¬1bn (Â£840m) to settle corruption cases with UK authorities. The deal follows a lengthy investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) into the aircraft maker's use of middlemen to secure plane deals. The settlement is part ofa â¬3.6bn (Â£3bn) dealthat also involves payments to US and French authorities. The payments are being made under a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) - a type of corporate plea bargain. The French national prosecutor, the Parquet National Financier, (PNF), will receive about â¬2.1bn, while Airbus will also pay the US Department of Justice some â¬500m. The settlement was announced earlier this week and was approved by courts in the three countries on Friday. The European planemaker, based in Toulouse in south-west France, employs more than 130,000 people globally, including about 10,000 in the UK. The SFO, and later its French counterpart, opened investigations into Airbus in 2016 after the firm reported itself and asked regulators to look at documentation about its use of overseas agents. In the run-up to the SFO's investigation, UK, French and German authorities froze export credit applications by Airbus, but reversed that decision in 2018. Export credits are used by many governments to support exporters, often by giving their backing to bank loans offered to overseas buyers of UK products. In the past, they have proved useful in giving cash-strapped airlines the ability to afford new Airbus planes. The investigations followed concern that Airbus had failed to disclose the use of middlemen in such deals. These settlements will cost Airbus a lot of money - and cause a fair amount of embarrassment - but the company will at least avoid prosecution. The UK part of the deal gives the Serious Fraud Office a much-needed success as well. The statement of facts published alongside the deferred prosecution agreement is certainly eyebrow-raising. It describes how, in one case, Airbus paid $50m (Â£38m) in sponsorship to a sports team owned by airline executives, to help win a contract for 180 aircraft. In another, the wife of an airline executive was used as a consultant on an aircraft contract, despite her having no experience in aviation. It later misled the UK's export credit agency about her identity when it was applying for assistance in  funding the deal. The punishment could have been a lot more severe - but Airbus received credit for reporting the wrongdoing to the authorities itself. Since then, there's been a management clearout, and a major overhaul of Airbus' sales operations. A new regime has emerged under CEO Guillaume Faury. He clearly sees the settlements as uncomfortable medicine the company has no choice but to take. And he wants the bribery allegations themselves filed squarely under ""sins of the past"". The US also requested information from the UK and French investigations, amid suspicions that arms export rules could have been violated. This is by far the biggest DPA settlement the SFO has made. It is the seventh DPA agreed between the SFO and a company since they were introduced in 2013. The total value of all seven is about Â£1.53bn. In 2017, engineering giant Rolls-Royce paid Â£497m plus costs to the SFO to settle a corruption case. The SFO had found conspiracy to corrupt or failure to prevent bribery by Rolls-Royce in China, India and other markets. The firm apologised ""unreservedly"" for the cases spanning nearly 25 years.

"This video can not be played Pre-recorded bongs from Big Ben played out as the UK left the European Union The UK has officially left the European Union after 47 years of membership - and more than three years after it voted to do so in a referendum. The historic moment, which happened at 23:00 GMT, was marked by both celebrations and anti-Brexit protests. Candlelit vigils were held in Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU, while Brexiteers partied in London's Parliament Square. Boris Johnson has vowed to bring the country together and ""take us forward"". Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't In a message released on social media an hour before the UK's departure, the prime minister said: ""For many people this is an astonishing moment of hope, a moment they thought would never come. ""And there are many of course who feel a sense of anxiety and loss."" He said some had worried the political ""wrangle"" would not end but it was his job to take the country forward. Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? Brexitcast: The live final 12 moments in the UK-EU relationship Brexit supporters held a party in Parliament Square Brexit parties were held in pubs and social clubs across the UK as the country counted down to its official departure. Thousands gathered in Parliament Square to celebrate Brexit, singing patriotic songs and cheering speeches from leading Brexiteers, including Nigel Farage. The Brexit Party leader said: ""Let us celebrate tonight as we have never done before. ""This is the greatest moment in the modern history of our great nation."" Pro-EU demonstrators earlier staged a march in Whitehall to bid a ""fond farewell"" to the union - and anti-Brexit rallies and candlelit vigils were held in Scotland. Police in Whitehall arrested four men and also charged one man with criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly, while in Glasgow one man was arrested. Meanwhile, other symbolic moments on a day of mixed emotions included: The Union flag being removed from the European Union institutions in Brussels The Cabinet meeting in Sunderland, the first city to declare in favour of Brexit when the 2016 results were announced A light show illuminating 10 Downing Street and Union flags lining The Mall A 50p coin to mark the occasion entering circulation The building of the UK government's delegation to the EUchanged its name and sign,external The government's EU delegation has changed its name from ""representation"" to ""mission"" A pro-EU group earlier projected a message onto the White Cliffs of Dover In Northern Ireland, the campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit staged a series of protests in Armagh, near to the border with the Irish Republic. The Irish border - now the UK's land border with the EU - wasa major sticking pointin the Brexit divorce talks. NI and the Irish Republic ""will continue to remain neighbours"",said NI First Minister Arlene Fosteron RTÃ on Friday. At 23:00 GMT, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a picture of the EU flag, adding: ""Scotland will return to the heart of Europe as an independent country - #LeaveALightOnForScotland"". Ms Sturgeonis calling for a new referendumon Scottish independence, arguing that Brexit is a ""material change in circumstances"". Speaking in Cardiff, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales, which voted to leave the EU, remained a ""European nation"". Can laughing at Brexit bring Leavers and Remainers together? How the UK celebrated joining Europe Brexit in key quotes Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit select committee and backed Remain, said he was ""sad last night... but we have to accept it"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was always a ""reluctant"" EU nation, adding: ""We joined late and we left early."" Pro-EU campaigners take part in a ""Missing EU Already"" rally outside the Scottish Parliament What now? It's happened. A dreary night didn't discourage those celebrating in Parliament Square. We wake this morning out of the European Union. But we follow their rules until the end of the year, without a say. We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills. But what the prime minister hails as a new era, a bright new dawn, starts months of hard bargaining with our neighbours across the Channel. The UK's requests: a free trade agreement, cooperation on security, and new arrangements for fishing are just some of the vital arguments that lie ahead. Read more from Laura here. UK citizens will notice few immediate changes now that the country is no longer in the European Union. Most EU laws will continue to be in force - including the free movement of people - until 31 December, when thetransition periodcomes to an end. The UK is aiming to sign a permanent free trade agreement with the EU, along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada. But European leaders have warned that the UK faces a tough battle to get a deal by that deadline. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said agreeing a trade deal was ""not a charitable exercise, this is an exercise of both sides recognising their own best interests"". ""From today, we are their [the EU's] biggest export market,"" he told the Today programme. Officials remove the British flag at European Union Council in Brussels In anopen letter to the British people,,externalFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he was ""deeply sad"" but: ""The channel has never managed to separate our destinies; Brexit will not do so, either."" He also defended the way France acted in the negotiations, saying neither the French nor anyone else in the EU was ""driven by a desire for revenge or punishment"". Meanwhile, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinatorGuy Verhofstadt said,externalhe would ""look after your star and work to ensure the EU is a project you'll want to be a part of again soon"". European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has said Britain and Brussels will fight for their interests in trade talks. She paid tribute to UK citizens who had ""contributed to the European Union and made it stronger"" and said the UK's final day in the EU was ""emotional"". Whilst never the most enthusiastic member, the UK was part of the European project for almost half a century. On a personal level, EU leaders tell me they'll miss having the British sense of humour and no-nonsense attitude at their table. If they were to be brutally honest they'd have admitted they'll mourn the loss of our not-insignificant contribution to the EU budget too. But now we've left the ""European family"" (as Brussels insiders sometimes like to call the EU) and as trade talks begin, how long will it take for warm words to turn into gritted teeth? Read more from Katya here. European Council President Charles Michel warned: ""The more the UK will diverge from the EU standards, the less access to the single market it will have."" Mairead McGuinness, the vice president of the European Parliament, said she fears progress to agree a trade deal - which Mr Johnson hopes to secure by December 2020 - ""might be left to the very last minute"". ""Normally in trade negotiations we're trying to come together,"" she said. ""For the first time we're going try and negotiate a trade agreement where somebody wants to pull away from us. I can't get my head around that and I think it's going to be quite complicated."" US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said he was ""pleased"" the UK and EU had agreed a Brexit deal and the US would continue to build its ""strong, productive, and prosperous relationship with the UK"". Washington's ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said Brexit had been ""long supported"" by President Donald Trump.

Two years later the country voted by an overwhelming majority to remain in the bloc in the first nationwide referendum. Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron held another referendum in June 2016, amid growing pressure from his own MPs and Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party. Mr Cameron led the campaign to stay in the EU but lost by the narrow margin of 52% to 48% to the Leave campaign, fronted by fellow Conservative Boris Johnson. Mr Cameron's successor as prime minister, Theresa May, repeatedly failed to get her version of an EU withdrawal agreement passed by Parliament and was replaced by Mr Johnson, who also failed to get his plans through. Mr Johnson managed to secure an early general election in December last year, which he won with an 80-seat majority on a promise to ""get Brexit done"". The PM's EU withdrawal deal was approved by MPs just before Christmas, and the bill became law earlier this year.

"The two people with coronavirus stayed at the Staycity apartment-hotel in York Two people from the same family have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, the chief medical officer for England has announced. The Chinese nationals were guests at the Staycity apartment-hotel in York, before being taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. The hotel remains open for business but their apartment will be thoroughly disinfected, the company said. Meanwhile 83 Britons evacuated from Wuhan in China are in quarantine. They were taken to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, where they will remain for 14 days, aftertheir flight landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshireon Friday. The new coronavirus has caused the deaths of 213 people so far - all in China. Cases of the virus have reached nearly 10,000 in China - and more than 100 cases have been reported in 22 other countries. Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Coronavirus declared global health emergency Coronavirus: What it does to the body Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said the NHS was ""extremely well-prepared for managing infections"" and it was quickly trying to identify any close contacts the two patients had to prevent further spread. But he said the confirmed cases could not be identified because of patient confidentiality. Anyone who is within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes. Probably for 15 minutes, but it is unlikely to survive on surfaces, like door handles, for more than 24 hours. Source: Public Health England The two people with coronavirus were moved from their York apartment-hotel to be treated initially at Castle Hill Hospital in Hull, before being taken to the infectious diseases unit in Newcastle. Public Health England said there was minimal risk of infection to either guests or staff at the Staycity property in York. Those identified as close contacts would be given health advice about symptoms and an emergency number in case they became unwell - but wouldn't be quarantined, PHE said. Prof Whitty said the specialist unit at the Newcastle hospital was experienced in treating people with infectious diseases and there was ""a high chance people would get better"", based on current information. ""A lot of people will end up with a relatively minor disease,"" he said. The small number who go on to be more seriously ill tend to develop respiratory problems which ""will be dealt with as anyone else with a respiratory disease"", Prof Whitty added. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""There is a high chance that people will get better and end up with a relatively minor disease"" Some GPs have started sending text messages to patients, telling them to stay away from their local surgery and phone them instead, if they feel unwell and have been to China in the last two weeks. Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading, said the possibility of further spread was ""minimal"" because the cases were caught early. Virus experts said they were not surprised to see cases in the UK but there was no reason to panic. The WHO declared the outbreak a global emergency on Thursday. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has now surpassed that of the Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003. The mortality rate for the new strain of coronavirus is currently low, at 2% - less than Sars at 10% and Ebola at 70%, the chief medical officer says. But the death rate could yet go up if more of those in hospital die, or down if it's discovered there are many other people with mild symptoms. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The quarantined Britons are being isolated from the general public, but not in ""solitary confinement"", according to the chief medical officer. ""We intend them to be housed in a way which is pleasant,"" he added. Global coronavirus cases surpass Sars epidemic Can people recover? And other questions Coronavirus: Why are we catching more diseases from animals? Pat Hackett, leader of Wirral Council, said: ""All services in the hospital are running as usual including emergency services, outpatients and planned surgery. Staff working in the hospital will not be in contact with these UK citizens."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is not a surprise and is a moment the country has been preparing for. The response now will be two-fold. The first is to treat the patients while preventing any spread of the virus. This is something specialist centres in the NHS have plenty of experience of - including when caring for patients who caught Ebola during the outbreak in West Africa in 2014. The second is a massive feat of detective work to find out who these patients may have passed the virus on to. Last night, doctors in Germany confirmed cases there had spread before people even developed symptoms. Effective ""contact tracing"" is how the virus can be contained.

"What will change? Well, everything and nothing. Today, the UK is embarking on a totally different course. We are unplugging from the legal and political infrastructure that we have been part of for four decades. Do not underestimate how big a step it is. The general election result confirmed the decision that the UK made in 2016 narrowly, to leave the European Union. That creates opportunity and extra freedoms. Laws decided in our Parliament will be supreme. One of the fundamental concepts of the EU - citizens being able to travel, to work and live anywhere in the bloc without restrictions - won't apply any more, meaning that the UK will set the terms for people who want to come from all over the world to live here. We will no longer be part of a club that might squabble amongst itself about big decisions, but is legally committed to sticking together, more at liberty to go our own way. Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't Our departure makes for added risk too. We are taking a huge step without clarity about exactly what is next. Without doubt, leaving creates disruption for much of the economy, and the consensus among number crunchers is that the country's wealth will grow more slowly than if we were staying in. Of course, the government wants to prove that it will be worth it in time, that there will be more winners than losers. That won't be straightforward, and politicians will argue about it for decades. Nor is it easy to see precisely how the UK's place in the world will evolve. We won't have a seat at the EU table any more, but are still one of the world's biggest economies, with a big diplomatic presence, a seat at the table. One voice is easier to ignore than 27. But if that voice is credible, nimble and persuasive, it could have a no doubt different, but significant force. At one minute past 11 on Friday though, in practical ways we can easily feel, not very much will be different. Red, white and blue lights will dance over Whitehall. The Tories' Brexit countdown clock will finally reach zero. One of those who campaigned most fervently to leave the EU told me he was planning to stay up through the night to watch the dawn -  ""It will only happen once,"" they said. But while we will be technically out of the European Union in pragmatic ways, we'll be in the departure lounge, rather than en route to a clearly different future. Until the end of the year UK businesses, and the government, will have to abide by the EU's rules, and will we continue paying handsomely into the budget. The immediate difference in that regard, is that we won't be part of making the decisions. A white-knuckle ride of negotiations and deal making over trade, security, and countless other issues lies ahead. Brexit: Johnson to hail 'dawn of a new era' Lib Dems plea to unite in fight for soft Brexit But after the drama and the hyperspeed of events in the last few years, our political landscape has already changed dramatically. The fundamental question of whether we stay, or leave, has been settled. Westminster's agonies over that dilemma were a big part of securing a thumping Conservative majority. And as a result, gone are the days, for now, when it wasn't clear if the government was going to get its way in the House of Commons. That is not the same as winning arguments. But winning votes is what being in power is all about. And for the foreseeable future we have a government that will be able to do that without worrying too much. The status quo will persist in some senses during the transition period, but the big question has been settled, the decision to change won't be unpicked, even though what it will bring precisely can't yet be clear. And that's already changed Westminster so much. The Tory Party needs something new to argue about. The 40 year internal war that spilled out into a vote that will change all of our lives is over, for now. The political dynamic has already changed, and will change perhaps faster than we imagine. Michael Govetold us this weekthat ""I can't blame Europe,"" as a politician, there would be no more 'hiding from the voters.' For the Tories in particular, there will be no convenient bogeyman. Will this mean that UK politicians change? I wonder if they, and we, have really begun yet to understand the extent of the change that might unfold. When I started working in and around Westminster nearly 20 years ago, the question of Europe was important, but one for political hobbyists. There were those who cared, cared very much, but it was low on the list for many MPs, let alone members of the public. In the early 2000s, anyone predicting that our membership of the EU would have been the defining issue of politics for four years might have been dismissed as a crackpot. Even in 2015, a senior member of the then government told me without any remote hesitation, the chances of us voting to leave the EU were no higher than one in five. Buildings on the Grand Place in Brussels are illuminated with the colours of the British flag in an event marking the UK's departure from the EU And yet here we are, on the edge of a moment that will without question, affect all of our lives, and the generations that will come next. The roots, risks and opportunities of Brexit, we've discussed on these pages many times are of course still hotly disputed. And of course, we won't have a parallel universe to compare. In the coming years, I have no doubt, there will be plenty of 'what if', lots of 'if onlys'. It's perfectly likely that in decades and decades, historians will still argue over whether, as a country, we did the right thing. But Brexit, with all its possibilities, and potential pitfalls, is now here. And if anything, perhaps this is a moment to remember that for good, or for ill, the crosses we make in the box, the decisions we make in the privacy of the polling booth, can and do change the course of our country.

"Coaches carrying British evacuees from Wuhan were escorted by police and ambulances as they left RAF Brize Norton for Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral Britons evacuated from coronavirus-hit Wuhan have arrived at a hospital in the Wirral where they will spend the next 14 days in quarantine. A convoy of coaches arrived at Arrowe Park Hospital shortly after 19:15 GMT. Eighty-three Britons were transported from RAF Brize Norton, where their evacuation flight from Wuhan landed. It comes as officials urgently try to trace those who came into contact withtwo people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK. The British passengers are being housed in an NHS staff accommodation block at the Merseyside hospital, where they will be put in ""supported isolation"" for 14 days with ""all necessary medical attention"". Six coaches were led by a police escort to the rear of the hospital and on to a side road leading to the accommodation block. Patients disembarked from behind barriers covering the accommodation entrance, but some could be seen inside wearing masks as they walked upstairs to their rooms for the next fortnight. Ben Williams had to leave his new Chinese wife behind after being given short notice to get to the evacuation plane. The flight was delayed by around three hours to allow as many UK and EU citizens as possible to get to the airport on time amid a suspension of the city's public transport. Mr Williams, who married his new wife in Wuhan and was honeymooning there, said: ""By the time we got out the door it was very much a close call to get to the meeting point to get on this flight. ""Sadly, my wife has nothing prepared and it wasn't right for her to enter the UK with essentially nothing."" What coronavirus does to the body A visual guide to the outbreak Your Coronavirus questions answered Speaking from the plane after it touched down, he said: ""We'll leave the plane one by one or in families for a full health screening and, I believe, just get on a coach to our final destination for our extended vacation."" Asked about the mood on the flight he added: ""It's quite mellow to be honest. Everyone's got quite used to wearing face masks and trying their best to do deep cleans."" The newlywed said he hoped he and his wife would be reunited in less than ""a few months"". This video can not be played Britons Matt Raw and Adam Bridgeman spoke to the BBC about trying to leave China. Patrick Graham, another British citizen evacuated from Wuhan, shared footage of the plane touching down at RAF Brize Norton. He joked with his social media followers, ""The infected are coming"", before adding: ""Thank you staff Wamosair for getting us home - they also have to go into a period of quarantine for bringing us home."" Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said all the Britons were screened before boarding the plane and were subject to continuous risk assessment during the flight. ""Everybody who has got on the plane is a well passenger,"" she said. ""If any of those passengers do show symptoms there are set procedures to isolate them."" How quarantine has fought disease through the ages Coronavirus declared global health emergency The Wamos Air plane arrived at RAF Brize Norton The British passengers will be housed in a separate building from the hospital wards, Wirral Council said. A spokesman added that services in the hospital will be running as usual and staff will be kept separate from the quarantined Britons. But a group of local MPs have raised concerns about hospital staff and have asked the government for assurances on matters including safeguards and where the staff treating the patients will come from. Preparations were seen being made at Arrowe Park Hospital ahead of the arrival of Britons evacuated from China The private coach company transporting them said its drivers had agreed to take the job and will be given paid leave to ""remain at home for the next 10 days"". Horseman Coaches added that its vehicles will be ""deep cleaned"" and then removed from service for a minimum of 10 days. What does being in quarantine mean? Trump official: Coronavirus could boost US jobs Some UK citizens did not make the evacuation flight after being told family members with Chinese passports would be unable to join them. That decision was reversed hours before the plane was due to depart, but it was too late for some to get to the airport. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News the government would send another plane to Wuhan to rescue British citizens if necessary. The remaining 27 foreign nationals on the plane - thought to be EU citizens - later landed in Spain, Reuters reports. Spanish passengers will be quarantined for 14 days at a military hospital, while four Danish citizens and one Norwegian on board will be flown back to their home countries,according to Spain's health ministry.,external Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic has suspended flights to Shanghai for two weeks from 1 February,urging affected customers,externalto contact them to receive a refund. It follows British Airways' decision to extend its cancellation of services to mainland China until 29 February.

"Now that the UK has formally left the European Union, it immediately enters an 11-month transition period. During the transition the UK will continue to obey EU rules and pay money to the EU. Most things will stay the same but there will be some changes: The Brexit Party won the most UK seats in the May 2019 European elections Familiar faces such as Nigel Farage and Ann Widdecombe are among the UK's 73 MEPs who will automatically lose their seats in the European Parliament. That's because, at the moment of Brexit, the UK will leave all of the EU's political institutions and agencies. However, in addition to the UK following EU rules during the transition period, the European Court of Justice will continue to have the final say over legal disputes. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will have to be specially invited if he wants to join other leaders at EU Council summits in the future. British ministers will also no longer attend regular EU meetings that decide things such as fishing limits. The UK will be able to start talking to countries around the world about setting new rules for buying and selling goods and services. It has not been allowed to hold formal trade negotiations with countries like the US and Australia while it remained an EU member. Brexit supporters argue that having the freedom to set its own trade policy will boost the UK's economy. There's also a lot to be discussed with the EU. Agreeing a UK-EU trade deal is a top priority, so extra charges on goods and other trade barriers aren't needed when the transition ends. If any trade deals are reached, they won't be able to start until the transition period ends. Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Blue passports were replaced in 1988 with the burgundy design Blue passports will be making a return, more than 30 years after they were replaced by the current burgundy design. Announcing the change in 2017, then Immigration Minister, Brandon Lewis, praised thereturn to the ""iconic"" blue-and-gold design, first used in 1921. The new colour will be phased in over a number of months, with all new passports issued in blue by the middle of the year. Existing burgundy passports will continueto be valid. The coins had to be re-made after Brexit was delayed About three million commemorative 50p Brexit coins bearing the date ""31 January"" and the inscription: ""Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"", will enter circulation on Friday. Thecoin has received a mixed reaction,with some Remain supporters saying they will refuse to accept it. The government had planned to introduce a similar coin on 31 October, the date Brexit was previously meant to happen. However, those coins had to be melted down and recycled after the deadline was extended. The team that handled the UK-EU negotiations andno-deal preparationswill disband on Brexit day. The Department for Exiting the European Union was set up by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2016. For the upcoming talks, the UK's negotiating team will be based in Downing Street. It won't be possible for some suspected criminals to be brought back to the UK if they flee to Germany. Germany's constitution does not allow its citizens to be extradited, unless it's to another EU country. ""This exception cannot apply any more after the UK has left EU,"" a spokesman from the German Federal Ministry of Justice told BBC News. It's unclear if the same restrictions will apply to other countries. Slovenia, for example, says the situation is complicated, while the European Commission was unable to provide comment. The UK Home Office says the European Arrest Warrant will continue to apply during the transition period. (That means Germany will be able to extradite non-German citizens.) However, it adds that if a country's laws prevent extradition to the UK it ""will be expected to take over the trial or sentence of the person concerned"". A really simple guide to Brexit What is the transition period? Because thetransition periodbegins immediately after Brexit, the vast majority of other things remain the same - at least until 31 December 2020 including: UK nationals will still be treated the same as EU nationals during the transition Flights, boats and trains will operate as usual. When it comes to passport control, during the transition period, UK nationals will still be allowed to queue in the areas reserved for EU arrivals only. As long as they are valid, these will continue to be accepted. Driving after Brexit: What you need to know EHICs will still be valid during the transition These are the cards that provide UK nationals with state-provided medical treatment in case of illness or accident. They can be used in any EU country (as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and will continue to be valid during the transition period. Will the EHIC still be valid after Brexit? Freedom of movement will continue to apply during the transition, so UK nationals will still be able to live and work in the EU as they currently do. The same applies for EU nationals wanting to live and work in the UK. UK nationals living in the EU will continue to receive their state pension and will also receive the annual increase. How will Brexit affect UK pensioners in Europe? The UK will continue to pay into the EU budget during the transition. This means existing schemes, paid for by EU grants, will continue to be funded. UK-EU trade will continue without any extra charges or checks being introduced.

"The two people with coronavirus stayed at the Staycity apartment-hotel in York Two people from the same family have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, the chief medical officer for England has announced. The Chinese nationals were guests at the Staycity apartment-hotel in York, before being taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. The hotel remains open for business but their apartment will be thoroughly disinfected, the company said. Meanwhile 83 Britons evacuated from Wuhan in China are in quarantine. They were taken to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, where they will remain for 14 days, aftertheir flight landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshireon Friday. The new coronavirus has caused the deaths of 213 people so far - all in China. Cases of the virus have reached nearly 10,000 in China - and more than 100 cases have been reported in 22 other countries. Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Coronavirus declared global health emergency Coronavirus: What it does to the body Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said the NHS was ""extremely well-prepared for managing infections"" and it was quickly trying to identify any close contacts the two patients had to prevent further spread. But he said the confirmed cases could not be identified because of patient confidentiality. Anyone who is within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes. Probably for 15 minutes, but it is unlikely to survive on surfaces, like door handles, for more than 24 hours. Source: Public Health England The two people with coronavirus were moved from their York apartment-hotel to be treated initially at Castle Hill Hospital in Hull, before being taken to the infectious diseases unit in Newcastle. Public Health England said there was minimal risk of infection to either guests or staff at the Staycity property in York. Those identified as close contacts would be given health advice about symptoms and an emergency number in case they became unwell - but wouldn't be quarantined, PHE said. Prof Whitty said the specialist unit at the Newcastle hospital was experienced in treating people with infectious diseases and there was ""a high chance people would get better"", based on current information. ""A lot of people will end up with a relatively minor disease,"" he said. The small number who go on to be more seriously ill tend to develop respiratory problems which ""will be dealt with as anyone else with a respiratory disease"", Prof Whitty added. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""There is a high chance that people will get better and end up with a relatively minor disease"" Some GPs have started sending text messages to patients, telling them to stay away from their local surgery and phone them instead, if they feel unwell and have been to China in the last two weeks. Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading, said the possibility of further spread was ""minimal"" because the cases were caught early. Virus experts said they were not surprised to see cases in the UK but there was no reason to panic. The WHO declared the outbreak a global emergency on Thursday. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has now surpassed that of the Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003. The mortality rate for the new strain of coronavirus is currently low, at 2% - less than Sars at 10% and Ebola at 70%, the chief medical officer says. But the death rate could yet go up if more of those in hospital die, or down if it's discovered there are many other people with mild symptoms. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The quarantined Britons are being isolated from the general public, but not in ""solitary confinement"", according to the chief medical officer. ""We intend them to be housed in a way which is pleasant,"" he added. Global coronavirus cases surpass Sars epidemic Can people recover? And other questions Coronavirus: Why are we catching more diseases from animals? Pat Hackett, leader of Wirral Council, said: ""All services in the hospital are running as usual including emergency services, outpatients and planned surgery. Staff working in the hospital will not be in contact with these UK citizens."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is not a surprise and is a moment the country has been preparing for. The response now will be two-fold. The first is to treat the patients while preventing any spread of the virus. This is something specialist centres in the NHS have plenty of experience of - including when caring for patients who caught Ebola during the outbreak in West Africa in 2014. The second is a massive feat of detective work to find out who these patients may have passed the virus on to. Last night, doctors in Germany confirmed cases there had spread before people even developed symptoms. Effective ""contact tracing"" is how the virus can be contained. There is still much we do not know about these cases, but the situation in the UK is completely different to China where there are nearly 10,000 cases and the authorities are still trying to get on top of the outbreak.

"This video can not be played Pre-recorded bongs from Big Ben played out as the UK left the European Union The UK has officially left the European Union after 47 years of membership - and more than three years after it voted to do so in a referendum. The historic moment, which happened at 23:00 GMT, was marked by both celebrations and anti-Brexit protests. Candlelit vigils were held in Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU, while Brexiteers partied in London's Parliament Square. Boris Johnson has vowed to bring the country together and ""take us forward"". Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't In a message released on social media an hour before the UK's departure, the prime minister said: ""For many people this is an astonishing moment of hope, a moment they thought would never come. ""And there are many of course who feel a sense of anxiety and loss."" He said some had worried the political ""wrangle"" would not end but it was his job to take the country forward. Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? Brexitcast: The live final 12 moments in the UK-EU relationship Brexit supporters held a party in Parliament Square Brexit parties were held in pubs and social clubs across the UK as the country counted down to its official departure. Thousands gathered in Parliament Square to celebrate Brexit, singing patriotic songs and cheering speeches from leading Brexiteers, including Nigel Farage. The Brexit Party leader said: ""Let us celebrate tonight as we have never done before. ""This is the greatest moment in the modern history of our great nation."" Pro-EU demonstrators earlier staged a march in Whitehall to bid a ""fond farewell"" to the union - and anti-Brexit rallies and candlelit vigils were held in Scotland. Police in Whitehall arrested four men and also charged one man with criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly, while in Glasgow one man was arrested. Meanwhile, other symbolic moments on a day of mixed emotions included: The Union flag being removed from the European Union institutions in Brussels The Cabinet meeting in Sunderland, the first city to declare in favour of Brexit when the 2016 results were announced A light show illuminating 10 Downing Street and Union flags lining The Mall A 50p coin to mark the occasion entering circulation The building of the UK government's delegation to the EUchanged its name and sign,external The government's EU delegation has changed its name from ""representation"" to ""mission"" A pro-EU group earlier projected a message onto the White Cliffs of Dover In Northern Ireland, the campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit staged a series of protests in Armagh, near to the border with the Irish Republic. The Irish border - now the UK's land border with the EU - wasa major sticking pointin the Brexit divorce talks. NI and the Irish Republic ""will continue to remain neighbours"",said NI First Minister Arlene Fosteron RTÃ on Friday. At 23:00 GMT, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a picture of the EU flag, adding: ""Scotland will return to the heart of Europe as an independent country - #LeaveALightOnForScotland"". Ms Sturgeonis calling for a new referendumon Scottish independence, arguing that Brexit is a ""material change in circumstances"". Speaking in Cardiff, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales, which voted to leave the EU, remained a ""European nation"". Can laughing at Brexit bring Leavers and Remainers together? How the UK celebrated joining Europe Brexit in key quotes Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit select committee and backed Remain, said he was ""sad last night... but we have to accept it"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was always a ""reluctant"" EU nation, adding: ""We joined late and we left early."" Pro-EU campaigners take part in a ""Missing EU Already"" rally outside the Scottish Parliament What now? It's happened. A dreary night didn't discourage those celebrating in Parliament Square. We wake this morning out of the European Union. But we follow their rules until the end of the year, without a say. We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills. But what the prime minister hails as a new era, a bright new dawn, starts months of hard bargaining with our neighbours across the Channel. The UK's requests: a free trade agreement, cooperation on security, and new arrangements for fishing are just some of the vital arguments that lie ahead. Read more from Laura here. UK citizens will notice few immediate changes now that the country is no longer in the European Union. Most EU laws will continue to be in force - including the free movement of people - until 31 December, when thetransition periodcomes to an end. The UK is aiming to sign a permanent free trade agreement with the EU, along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada. But European leaders have warned that the UK faces a tough battle to get a deal by that deadline. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said agreeing a trade deal was ""not a charitable exercise, this is an exercise of both sides recognising their own best interests"". ""From today, we are their [the EU's] biggest export market,"" he told the Today programme. Officials remove the British flag at European Union Council in Brussels In anopen letter to the British people,,externalFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he was ""deeply sad"" but: ""The channel has never managed to separate our destinies; Brexit will not do so, either."" He also defended the way France acted in the negotiations, saying neither the French nor anyone else in the EU was ""driven by a desire for revenge or punishment"". Meanwhile, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinatorGuy Verhofstadt said,externalhe would ""look after your star and work to ensure the EU is a project you'll want to be a part of again soon"". European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has said Britain and Brussels will fight for their interests in trade talks. She paid tribute to UK citizens who had ""contributed to the European Union and made it stronger"" and said the UK's final day in the EU was ""emotional"". Whilst never the most enthusiastic member, the UK was part of the European project for almost half a century. On a personal level, EU leaders tell me they'll miss having the British sense of humour and no-nonsense attitude at their table. If they were to be brutally honest they'd have admitted they'll mourn the loss of our not-insignificant contribution to the EU budget too. But now we've left the ""European family"" (as Brussels insiders sometimes like to call the EU) and as trade talks begin, how long will it take for warm words to turn into gritted teeth? Read more from Katya here. European Council President Charles Michel warned: ""The more the UK will diverge from the EU standards, the less access to the single market it will have."" Mairead McGuinness, the vice president of the European Parliament, said she fears progress to agree a trade deal - which Mr Johnson hopes to secure by December 2020 - ""might be left to the very last minute"". ""Normally in trade negotiations we're trying to come together,"" she said. ""For the first time we're going try and negotiate a trade agreement where somebody wants to pull away from us. I can't get my head around that and I think it's going to be quite complicated."" US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said he was ""pleased"" the UK and EU had agreed a Brexit deal and the US would continue to build its ""strong, productive, and prosperous relationship with the UK"". Washington's ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said Brexit had been ""long supported"" by President Donald Trump. Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit How the UK celebrated joining Europe Tears and relief as the UK's MEPs bid goodbye This video can not be played Brexit: The last four years in under two minutes Britain joined what was then European Economic Community on 1 January, 1973, at the third attempt. Two years later the country voted by an overwhelming majority to remain in the bloc in the first nationwide referendum. Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron held another referendum in June 2016, amid growing pressure from his own MPs and Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party. Mr Cameron led the campaign to stay in the EU but lost by the narrow margin of 52% to 48% to the Leave campaign, fronted by fellow Conservative Boris Johnson. Mr Cameron's successor as prime minister, Theresa May, repeatedly failed to get her version of an EU withdrawal agreement passed by Parliament and was replaced by Mr Johnson, who also failed to get his plans through. Mr Johnson managed to secure an early general election in December last year, which he won with an 80-seat majority on a promise to ""get Brexit done"". The PM's EU withdrawal deal was approved by MPs just before Christmas, and the bill became law earlier this year.

"An anti-Brexit protest was held outside the Northern Ireland Assembly last year The UK is due to leave the European Union on Friday at 23:00 GMT. Brexit is happening just weeks after the return of devolution in Northern Ireland, following three years of political deadlock. But are the parties and officials at Stormont prepared for what comes next? There are 90 assembly members in the Northern Ireland Assembly, all with varying perspectives. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - the biggest unionist party - was originally in favour of Brexit, while the largest nationalist party - Sinn FÃ©in - opposed it. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in fought each other along Brexit battle lines during last year's general election campaign Brexit was a dividing line between them during the general election campaign - but since devolution has returned, they have had to change course. They now share power together in the Stormont executive, and will have to present a united front to No 10. Along with the smaller parties, they unanimously rejected Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and what it would mean for Northern Ireland. Last week, the assemblyagreed to withhold its consent for the government's Brexit bill- echoing the views of the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, who also voted against it. Under Mr Johnson's deal, Northern Ireland will effectively stay in the EU's single market for goods but Stormont can vote to end that arrangement. At the end of the transition period in December 2020, Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK will not. The whole of the UK will leave the customs union - but EU customs procedures will still apply on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, in order to avoid checks at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The plan has been criticised by the Stormont parties, who argue it could interfere with GB-NI trade. The deal states that four years after the end of the transition period - 2024 - the assembly will get a say on whether to approve such arrangements continuing. A straight - or simple - majority vote by the 90 assembly members (MLAs) would keep the arrangements in place for another four years. Alternatively, if the arrangements received cross-community consent, passed by most nationalists and most unionists, they would remain in place for eight years. Some unionists and loyalists have described Boris Johnson's Brexit deal as ""betrayal"" If Stormont voted to end them, there would be a two-year notice period, during which the UK and the EU would have to agree ways to protect the peace process and avoid a hard border. Some MLAs have raised concerns that giving the assembly a vote on Brexit every four years would cause more division between the parties. TheNew Decade, New Approach document,external, agreed by the Stormont parties and the British and Irish governments on 10 January 2020, makes several commitments. The British government promises ""unfettered access for Northern Ireland's businesses to the whole of the UK"" and to have it written in law for 1 January 2021. No checks on goods between NI and GB, says PM It is a claim that has been repeated by the prime minister and other cabinet ministers in recent weeks - but much will depend on the definition of ""unfettered access"". On Monday, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said new checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britainwere an ""indispensable"" consequenceof the Brexit deal. Michel Barnier delivered a lecture at Queen's University in Belfast Businesses in Northern Ireland have also expressed concernabout the possibility of some new administration, such as exit declaration forms on NI-GB trade. The government has also committed to giving Stormont ministers a role in bodies which will oversee the Northern Ireland elements of the Brexit deal, and there will be a specialised committee which will focus solely on the NI part of the agreement. The government also says it will ensure representatives from Stormont will be part of the UK delegation in any meetings that are discussing NI-specific matters, and that are also being attended by the Irish government as part of the EU's delegation. First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill will need to speak with one voice on Brexit Despite being an issue that has deeply divided Northern Ireland politics since the 2016 referendum, the recently-restored executive appears to have a new strategy on Brexit, which for many, cannot come a moment too soon. Northern Ireland had no ministers representing it throughout the Brexit negotiations, due to the absence of devolution. On Tuesday, First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill attended a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Council in Cardiff, appearing to speak as one. They recognise their parties look at Brexit through different lenses but want to ensure its outworkings do not impact Northern Ireland negatively. The Executive Office is setting up a sub-committee to oversee how Brexit is managed. A Stormont source told BBC News NI the committee was due to meet for the first time on Tuesday.

"Now that the UK has formally left the European Union, it immediately enters an 11-month transition period. During the transition the UK will continue to obey EU rules and pay money to the EU. Most things will stay the same but there will be some changes: The Brexit Party won the most UK seats in the May 2019 European elections Familiar faces such as Nigel Farage and Ann Widdecombe are among the UK's 73 MEPs who will automatically lose their seats in the European Parliament. That's because, at the moment of Brexit, the UK will leave all of the EU's political institutions and agencies. However, in addition to the UK following EU rules during the transition period, the European Court of Justice will continue to have the final say over legal disputes. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will have to be specially invited if he wants to join other leaders at EU Council summits in the future. British ministers will also no longer attend regular EU meetings that decide things such as fishing limits. The UK will be able to start talking to countries around the world about setting new rules for buying and selling goods and services. It has not been allowed to hold formal trade negotiations with countries like the US and Australia while it remained an EU member. Brexit supporters argue that having the freedom to set its own trade policy will boost the UK's economy. There's also a lot to be discussed with the EU. Agreeing a UK-EU trade deal is a top priority, so extra charges on goods and other trade barriers aren't needed when the transition ends. If any trade deals are reached, they won't be able to start until the transition period ends. Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Blue passports were replaced in 1988 with the burgundy design Blue passports will be making a return, more than 30 years after they were replaced by the current burgundy design. Announcing the change in 2017, then Immigration Minister, Brandon Lewis, praised thereturn to the ""iconic"" blue-and-gold design, first used in 1921. The new colour will be phased in over a number of months, with all new passports issued in blue by the middle of the year. Existing burgundy passports will continueto be valid. The coins had to be re-made after Brexit was delayed About three million commemorative 50p Brexit coins bearing the date ""31 January"" and the inscription: ""Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"", will enter circulation on Friday. Thecoin has received a mixed reaction,with some Remain supporters saying they will refuse to accept it. The government had planned to introduce a similar coin on 31 October, the date Brexit was previously meant to happen. However, those coins had to be melted down and recycled after the deadline was extended. The team that handled the UK-EU negotiations andno-deal preparationswill disband on Brexit day. The Department for Exiting the European Union was set up by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2016. For the upcoming talks, the UK's negotiating team will be based in Downing Street. It won't be possible for some suspected criminals to be brought back to the UK if they flee to Germany. Germany's constitution does not allow its citizens to be extradited, unless it's to another EU country. ""This exception cannot apply any more after the UK has left EU,"" a spokesman from the German Federal Ministry of Justice told BBC News. It's unclear if the same restrictions will apply to other countries. Slovenia, for example, says the situation is complicated, while the European Commission was unable to provide comment. The UK Home Office says the European Arrest Warrant will continue to apply during the transition period. (That means Germany will be able to extradite non-German citizens.) However, it adds that if a country's laws prevent extradition to the UK it ""will be expected to take over the trial or sentence of the person concerned"". A really simple guide to Brexit What is the transition period? Because thetransition periodbegins immediately after Brexit, the vast majority of other things remain the same - at least until 31 December 2020 including: UK nationals will still be treated the same as EU nationals during the transition Flights, boats and trains will operate as usual. When it comes to passport control, during the transition period, UK nationals will still be allowed to queue in the areas reserved for EU arrivals only. As long as they are valid, these will continue to be accepted. Driving after Brexit: What you need to know EHICs will still be valid during the transition These are the cards that provide UK nationals with state-provided medical treatment in case of illness or accident. They can be used in any EU country (as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and will continue to be valid during the transition period. Will the EHIC still be valid after Brexit? Freedom of movement will continue to apply during the transition, so UK nationals will still be able to live and work in the EU as they currently do. The same applies for EU nationals wanting to live and work in the UK. UK nationals living in the EU will continue to receive their state pension and will also receive the annual increase. How will Brexit affect UK pensioners in Europe? The UK will continue to pay into the EU budget during the transition. This means existing schemes, paid for by EU grants, will continue to be funded. UK-EU trade will continue without any extra charges or checks being introduced.

But with negotiations on the UK's future relationship with Europe still to come, this won't be the last you hear of Brexit.... Katya AdlerEurope Editor As Brexit dawned, I found myself reporting for the BBC from outside the glass and concrete behemoth, otherwise known as the European Commission building, in Brussels. It's the same place I've regularly stood over the past three and a half years, attempting to explain the EU perspective on Brexit following our referendum and throughout the divorce negotiations. It struck me that the impersonal, impenetrable-looking monolith embodies the image so many back in the UK have of the EU as a whole. But going through my mind on Friday night were all the ""ordinary"" Europeans I've met across the continent while covering the Brexit story: engineers, teachers, bakers and bus drivers who asked ""Why are you doing this?"" and insisted: ""Don't leave!""

We wake this morning out of the European Union. But we follow their rules until the end of the year, without a say. We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills. But what the prime minister hails as a new era, a bright new dawn, starts months of hard bargaining with our neighbours across the Channel. Read more from Laura here.

Pre-recorded bongs from Big Ben played out as the UK left the European Union. Richard MossPolitical Editor, BBC Look North A few hundred people walked down Newcastle's Northumberland Street to Monument as part of a vigil tonight. The symbolic nature of today - the fact Boris Johnson brought the cabinet to Sunderland - has emphasised the centrality of north-east England in this whole debate. And that won't go away because although we are leaving the European Union there is still to be settled our future trading relationship with our biggest trading partner in the region, the European Union. There will be pressure from businesses like Nissan to have as close a relationship as almost we have now to make it as easy as possible for them to sell their cars, pressure perhaps from Conservative MPS in the region that if we are leaving a club we don't like being members of we shouldn't necessarily stick with the rules afterwards. Boris Johnson's biggest challenge is to prove these people at the vigil wrong, that Brexit will not be an historic blunder that will leave us lagging behind, that it can be coupled with an opportunity to make life better and make us wealthier in places like the north-east of England and Cumbria. The SNP's Ian Blackford says there is ""sadness and anger"" across Scotland at the UK's exit and the Scottish public will not ""stand for it"". He says the Scottish people will demand a say in their future and suggests an independence referendum will provide a path ""back into Europe"". He argues that the UK that Scotland voted to remain a part of in 2014 ""no longer exists"". Chris DoidgeBBC Radio Derby, political reporter Remainers at a vigil held outside Derby's council house have renamed themselves ""rejoiners"" now we have left the European Union. The event was held just round the corner from a Brexit bash in a local bar. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor First of all itâs a long, long period of hard bargaining
between the UK and the EU. The UK government is determined to try to get a free-trade
deal done by the end of this year but that will not be straight forward â not least
because there are so many things that have to be sorted out. But also because the EU will drive a hard bargain. Yes, both
sides say they still want to be friends and partners and respectful neighbours
and people want to do lots of business with each other. But the UK government has already acknowledged that will mean
some friction. And also, until itâs all done and dusted thereâs still uncertainty for
businesses and people around the country who want to know exactly what is next. But although there is legions of details to be worked out, many
more political controversies along the way, be in no doubt â the fundamental
question which has been hanging over the country for more than three years has
been settled. And thatâs already completely changed the political dynamic â
and therefore the dynamic in the country too. Foreign Secretary tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The UK left the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 31 January, but that is not the end of the Brexit story. That's because the UK is now in an 11-month period, known as the transition, that keeps the UK bound to the EU's rules. So what is the transition and why is it necessary? The transition (sometimes called the implementation period) will end on 31 December 2020. It cannot be extended beyond that date. While in transition, the UK remains in both the EU customs union and single market. That means - until the transition ends - most things will stay the same. This includes: Travelling to and from the EU (including the rules around driving licences and pet passports) Freedom of movement (the right to live and work in the EU and vice versa) UK-EU trade, which will continue without any extra charges or checks being introduced Despite many things staying the same the UK has already left the EU's political institutions, including the European Parliament and European Commission. So while the UK will no longer have any voting rights, it will continue to follow EU rules during the transition. For example, the European Court of Justice will have the final say over any legal disputes. The transition also means theUK will continue to contribute to the EU's budget.,external Seven things that changed after Brexit day Brexit: All you need to know The idea behind the transition period is to give some breathing space while new UK-EU negotiations take place. These talks will determine what the future relationship will eventually look like. Negotiations started in March and both sides have agreed to intensify talks over the summer. Talks have been taking place via video link due to the coronavirus pandemic. Top of the to-do list will be a UK-EU free trade deal. This will be essential if the UK wants to be able to continue to trade with the EU with no tariffs, quotas or other barriers after the transition. Tariffs are a type of tax, usually paid on imported goods. If goods are subject to quotas, it means there are limits on how many can be traded over a given period. Both sides will also need to decide how far the UK is allowed to move away from existing EU regulations (known aslevel playing field rules). However, a free trade deal will not eliminate all checks between the UK and EU - so businesses will need to prepare. In 2018, total UK trade (goods and services) was valued at Â£1.3 trillion, of which the EU made up 49%. As well as negotiating a UK-EU trade deal, the transition will also allow the UK to hold formal trade talks with other countries - such as the US and Australia. If completed and ready in time, these deals could also take effect at the end of the transition. The pro-Brexit camp has long argued that allowing the UK freedom to set its own trade policy will benefit the economy - although critics say it's more important to remain close to the EU. Aside from trade, many other aspects of the future UK-EU relationship will need to be decided. For example: Law enforcement, data sharing and security Aviation standards and safety Access to fishing waters Supplies of electricity and gas Licensing and regulation of medicines The UK will also need to design and implement many new systems, such as how it will handle immigration once freedom of movement comes to an end. Why does a UK-EU trade deal matter? What are level playing field rules? At the end of the transition phase, there will be two possible outcomes: A UK-EU trade deal comes into force If a UK-EU trade deal is ready by the end of the year, the UK could begin the new trading relationship as soon as the transition ends. If the trade deal is reached but questions remain in other areas - like the future of security co-operation - than the trade deal might go ahead, with contingency plans used for other parts of the relationship. However, the EU wants one comprehensive deal covering all aspects of the future relationship while the UK argues there should be a series of separate agreements, including a basic free trade deal. Brexit trade deal: What are the sticking points? Ursula von der Leyen will head the European Commission during the transition period The UK exits transition with no EU trade deal Under this scenario, UK and EU negotiators fail to agree and implement a trade deal by 1 January 2021 and no transition extension is agreed. That would leave the UK trading on WTO (World Trade Organization) terms with the EU. This means that most UK goods would be subject to tariffs until a free trade deal was ready to be brought in. If other aspects of the future relationship aren't ready, they too would have to proceedon no-deal terms. The deadline for extending the transition has now passed.

"Rules on travelling between the UK and European Union countries change on 1 January 2021, after an agreement to keep many rules the same for 11 months after Brexit comes to an end. At the moment, no. Because of Covid, travellers from most non-EU countries can't visit except for essential reasons. After 31 December, the UK will no longer be treated like a member of the EU, so becomes subject to these rules. The only non-EU countries exempt from these restrictions are those with very low infection rates, such as New Zealand. The EU could choose to exempt the UK, and individual EU countries could create a ""travel corridor"" with the UK, allowing restriction-free travel. If the rules are changed, you'll be able to travel to all EU countries - plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - as a tourist, without needing a visa. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal You'll be able to stay for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. So, an Easter weekend in Spain, followed by a June fortnight in Italy, would be covered by your 90-day limit. The rules for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are different. You could make a 90-day trip to any of them and still not use up your 90-day allowance for other EU countries. You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, to work or study, or forbusiness travel.,external From 2022, UK nationals will have to pay for avisa-waiver scheme,externalin order to visit many European countries. No. Your current passport will be valid as long as: It is less than 10 years old And has six months left before it runs out The six-month rule won't apply for visits to Ireland, because it is part ofthe Common Travel Area.,external If you need a new passport -which will be a different colour- the government says youshould apply in plenty of time.,external The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)has entitled about 27 million UK citizens to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in EU countries, as well as a number of others. All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date (on the front of your card). The government says it will issue a new card, called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Like EHIC, it will cover chronic or existing illnesses, routine maternity care and emergencies. However, there are no further details yet on when it will start. Its advice,externalis that you should buy travel insurance with healthcare cover before going on holiday - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. You'll no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes. When you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland), be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay. It could also takelonger to cross the UK border.,external The guarantee of free roaming throughout the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norwayends on 1 January 2021. You should check with your mobile provider to see if you're likely to face extra charges. The four main UK operators have said they have no plans to reintroduce roaming fees. The EU and the UK agreed to co-operate on international mobile roaming. But there is nothing in the post-Brexit trade agreement that would stop travellers being charged for using their phone in the EU, and vice versa, in the future. The government has passed laws to protect customers, including: A Â£45-a-month cap on using mobile data abroad (then you must opt in to use more) Requirements for customers to be informed when they've reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Yes, but you'll need to take your driving licence, as well as your log book (V5C) and valid insurance documents if you are taking your own car. You will need to contact your insurer six weeks before you travel to get a green card that will prove you have insurance. Most drivers will not need to buy an International Driving Permit, with the exception of those with paper licences (not photocards) and those with licences issued in Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man, who will need one for some European countries. What are the rules on driving in the EU after transition? Pet passports issued in Great Britain will not be valid for travel to the EU from 1 January 2021. From that date,pets travelling from Great Britain to the EU will need to have an animal health certificate (AHC).,externalThe same rules will apply if you are taking your pet to Northern Ireland. In 2002, this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport AHCs will be issued by a vet, will be valid for four months and must be obtained no more than 10 days before travel. AHCs will be valid for a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain. Your pet must have been microchipped and have had a rabies vaccination. It will also have to have a treatment againstEchinococcus multilocularis(a type of tapeworm) for entry into Finland, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway or Malta. Passengers from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) travelling to EU countries cantake advantage of duty-free shopping,externalfrom January 2021. Limits on tobacco and alcohol will increase.

"Mrs O'Neill had already put in a lot of work to prepare the way for Glasgow In a surprise move, the woman appointed to run the crucial UN climate summit in Glasgow in November has been sacked. Claire Perry O'Neill, a former climate minister, had been assigned the post of ""president"" of the event, known as COP 26. The British government has confirmed that the job will now be handled by the business department, Beis. In a tweet, Mrs O'Neill said she was ""very sad"" to lose the role, and went on to criticise the government. It couldn't ""cope"" with an independent unit managing preparations for the conference, she said. And in a sharp dig at No 10's green credentials, she also added: ""A shame we haven't had one climate cabinet meeting since we formed."" Allow Twitter content?

In response, a Cabinet Office statement said the prime minister thanked Mrs O'Neill for her work so far. ""Preparations will continue at pace for the summit, and a replacement will be confirmed shortly,"" it said. ""Going forward, this will be a ministerial role."" This will come as a shock to many of the business and environmental groups working with her in the run-up to the summit. It will also surprise diplomats and negotiators from other countries with whom Mrs O'Neill had formed bonds. At the last UN summit, held in Madrid last December, she played a highly visible role as part of her preparation for the UK to take over the presidency. In an interview recorded at that time, she said she believedthe world had ""one shot"" at the Glasgow summitto take meaningful action on climate change - or people would question the whole process. A lively and personable figure, she seemed determined to bring new impetus to the negotiations and, in private, had ambitious plans for the event. Although the summit is not until November, there's a huge diplomatic and logistical task to get ready for it. Governments worldwide are meant to come forward with tougher targets for cutting the gases heating the planet. Some might wonder whether the UK government has allowed itself enough time. Sources close to Mrs O'Neill say the UK's preparations for Glasgow are in disarray, with cabinet ministers vying for control over this prestigious event. They say there is no firmly agreed venue or budget. And they warn that Boris Johnson provoked a backlash in Scotland by shutting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon out of the summit. Mrs O'Neill has become increasingly frustrated by the prime minister's lack of engagement with the conference. She has been heaping pressure on the organising team to publish an agenda, and she's trodden hard on many toes. Her relations with some civil servants are described as terrible. She admits she's a bad diplomat - but someone who gets things done. With many major nations refusing to offer deeper cuts in emissions, she has been focusing on potentially deliverable outcomes such as international agreements from industrial sectors to pollute less. Whoever takes over her role has a mountain to climb. Richard Black, director of the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, commented on Twitter: ""While Claire Perry has a background in climate change, she doesn't in foreign affairs. Arguably that's more important - no doubt one of the real stars of the #ParisAgreement was Laurent Fabius, steeped in diplomacy but not, prior to 2015, in climate change."" Allow Twitter content?

And Mohamed Adow, director of another climate and energy think-tank, Power Shift Africa, said: ""It was always going to be a challenge to have a president who had no formal role in Government. ""For a successful outcome you want the person presiding over the negotiations to be someone with genuine political power, who can fully represent the UK government and 'knock heads together' to ensure real progress is made.  With Claire O'Neill not even being an MP that was always going to be a challenge.""

"Coaches carrying British evacuees from Wuhan were escorted by police and ambulances as they left RAF Brize Norton for Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral Britons evacuated from coronavirus-hit Wuhan have arrived at a hospital in the Wirral where they will spend the next 14 days in quarantine. A convoy of coaches arrived at Arrowe Park Hospital shortly after 19:15 GMT. Eighty-three Britons were transported from RAF Brize Norton, where their evacuation flight from Wuhan landed. It comes as officials urgently try to trace those who came into contact withtwo people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK. The British passengers are being housed in an NHS staff accommodation block at the Merseyside hospital, where they will be put in ""supported isolation"" for 14 days with ""all necessary medical attention"". Six coaches were led by a police escort to the rear of the hospital and on to a side road leading to the accommodation block. Patients disembarked from behind barriers covering the accommodation entrance, but some could be seen inside wearing masks as they walked upstairs to their rooms for the next fortnight. Ben Williams had to leave his new Chinese wife behind after being given short notice to get to the evacuation plane. The flight was delayed by around three hours to allow as many UK and EU citizens as possible to get to the airport on time amid a suspension of the city's public transport. Mr Williams, who married his new wife in Wuhan and was honeymooning there, said: ""By the time we got out the door it was very much a close call to get to the meeting point to get on this flight. ""Sadly, my wife has nothing prepared and it wasn't right for her to enter the UK with essentially nothing.""

Asked about the mood on the flight he added: ""It's quite mellow to be honest. Everyone's got quite used to wearing face masks and trying their best to do deep cleans.""

"This video can not be played What's the deal with the controversial Nike Vaporfly trainers? Nike's controversial Vaporfly range will not be banned but there will be tighter regulations around high-tech running shoes, World Athletics says. Any new shoe technology developed after 30 April will have to be available on the open market for four months before an athlete can use it in competition. World Athletics has also introduced an immediate indefinite ban on any shoes that have a sole thicker than 40mm. The body will also investigate any shoes that ""may not be compliant"". An immediate indefinite ban has also been introduced on any shoe that contains more than one ""rigid embedded plate or blade"". For shoes with spikes, an additional plate or blade is allowed for the purpose of attaching the spikes, but the sole must be no thicker than 30mm. The 'Alphafly' prototype shoes worn by Eliud Kipchoge when he became the first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours in October 2019 will be banned. 'It feels like running on trampolines' Kipchoge breaks two-hour marathon mark The shoe worn by Eliud Kipchoge when he became the first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours will be banned indefinitely A group of experts were asked to consider whether Nike's Vaporfly shoes give their wearers an unfair advantage. Athletes wearing the new footwear including Nike's latest Vaporfly have taken 31 of 36 top-three finishes in major marathons last year. Kipchoge's Kenyan compatriot Brigid Kosgei wore a Vaporfly prototype when she broke Paula Radcliffe's long-standing women's marathon world record in October 2019. World Athletics president Lord Coe said: ""It is not our job to regulate the entire sports shoe market but it is our duty to preserve the integrity of elite competition by ensuring the shoes worn by elite athletes in competition do not offer any unfair assistance or advantage. ""As we enter the Olympic year, we don't believe we can rule out shoes that have been generally available for a considerable period of time, but we can draw a line by prohibiting the use of shoes that go further than what is currently on the market while we investigate further. ""I believe these new rules strike the right balance by offering certainty to athletes and manufacturers as they prepare for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, while addressing the concerns that have been raised about shoe technology. ""If further evidence becomes available that indicates we need to tighten up these rules, we reserve the right to do that to protect our sport."" World Athletics will now establish an ""expert working group"" to ""guide future research"" into shoe technology as well as assessing any new shoes that enter the market. The shoes have been criticised for ""distorting the record books"", with some arguing they prevent fair competition with athletes not sponsored by Nike. Vaporflys claim to improve an athlete's performance by 4%, and the five fastest marathons of all time have been run in the past 16 months by athletes wearing varying forms of the technology. Former British Olympic marathon runner Mara Yamauchi previously told BBC Sport that ""we no longer truly have fair competition"". ""It's up to World Athletics to provide a level playing field for all... to be brutally honest, it's hard to see how anybody not wearing Vaporflys at Tokyo is going to win medals,"" she said. ""Athletics has had several years of doping stories coming out in the press and the single most important thing is to restore trust and bring in more fans and sponsors. ""But if we see every medal winner wearing the Vaporflys and other athletes not getting a look in, I'm not sure that people watching can really say I believe that performance 100%."" Nike said in a previous statement they ""respect the spirit of the rules and we do not create any running shoes that return more energy than the runner expends"". BBC sports editor Dan Roan Amid mounting confusion that running was becoming distorted, World Athletics has tried to provide some clarity before the Tokyo Olympics and halt what some see as an 'arms race' in shoe technology. Although more research will now be conducted and the rules could still develop, it seems significant the governing body admits ""concerns that the integrity of the sport might be threatened"". The news will come as a relief for Nike and the athletes it sponsors. The prototype 'AlphaFly' that Eliud Kipchoge used to go sub-two hours last year exceeds the new restrictions and is now banned for elite runners. But as expected, the Vaporfly range that has revolutionised distance running is cleared, including the 'Vaporfly Next%' that Brigid Kosgei wore when smashing the women's world record last year. That will lead to fears that the new restrictions have been conceived with that shoe's specific dimensions in mind, are too little too late, and mean athletes sponsored by other manufacturers are at a disadvantage. The changes also put pressure on rival companies to quickly develop any new prototype shoes. They have three months to do so. After that they will need to have been widely available to buy for four months before being allowed in elite competition, ruling out their use at the Olympics.

Brexit supporters are gathering in Parliament Square Supporters of the EU are expected to take part in a procession through Whitehall Brexit was originally scheduled for 29 March last year but was repeatedly delayed when MPs rejected a previous withdrawal agreement reached by the EU and former Prime Minister Theresa May. Mr Johnson got his own deal through Parliament after winning December's general election with a House of Commons majority of 80, on a pledge to ""get Brexit done"".

Sunderland University students posted a video on social media of a small group of protesters chanting ""Boris you're not welcome here"" and ""Tory cuts not welcome here"". Mr Johnson told the Cabinet it was time to start a ""new chapter in the United Kingdom's story"" and end the division of the past three and a half years, according to a Downing Street spokesman. The Cabinet discussed future trade deals, including seeking a a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU, and Mr Johnson thanked Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay for the work of his department, which is being wound up. The PM told ministers the government aimed to have 80% of the UK's trade with other nations covered by free trade agreements within three years. Ministers also received updates from Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on measures to deal with the coronavirus. In his video message, filmed in Downing Street, Mr Johnson will say: ""The most important thing to say tonight is that this is not an end but a beginning.

We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills. But what the prime minister hails as a new era, a bright new dawn, starts months of hard bargaining with our neighbours across the Channel. The UK's requests: a free trade agreement, cooperation on security, and new arrangements for fishing are just some of the vital arguments that lie ahead. Read more from Laura here. UK citizens will notice few immediate changes now that the country is no longer in the European Union. Most EU laws will continue to be in force - including the free movement of people - until 31 December, when thetransition periodcomes to an end. The UK is aiming to sign a permanent free trade agreement with the EU, along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada. But European leaders have warned that the UK faces a tough battle to get a deal by that deadline.

Meanwhile, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinatorGuy Verhofstadt said,externalhe would ""look after your star and work to ensure the EU is a project you'll want to be a part of again soon"". European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has said Britain and Brussels will fight for their interests in trade talks. She paid tribute to UK citizens who had ""contributed to the European Union and made it stronger"" and said the UK's final day in the EU was ""emotional"". Whilst never the most enthusiastic member, the UK was part of the European project for almost half a century. On a personal level, EU leaders tell me they'll miss having the British sense of humour and no-nonsense attitude at their table. If they were to be brutally honest they'd have admitted they'll mourn the loss of our not-insignificant contribution to the EU budget too. But now we've left the ""European family"" (as Brussels insiders sometimes like to call the EU) and as trade talks begin, how long will it take for warm words to turn into gritted teeth?

Two years later the country voted by an overwhelming majority to remain in the bloc in the first nationwide referendum.

Mr Cameron led the campaign to stay in the EU but lost by the narrow margin of 52% to 48% to the Leave campaign, fronted by fellow Conservative Boris Johnson. Mr Cameron's successor as prime minister, Theresa May, repeatedly failed to get her version of an EU withdrawal agreement passed by Parliament and was replaced by Mr Johnson, who also failed to get his plans through. Mr Johnson managed to secure an early general election in December last year, which he won with an 80-seat majority on a promise to ""get Brexit done"".

"Struggling luxury UK carmaker Aston Martin has announced plans to raise emergency funding worth Â£500m. A consortium led by billionaire Lawrence Stroll will put in Â£182m, with the rest of the money coming from existing investors. Mr Stroll partly owns the Racing Point Formula 1 team, which will be branded Aston Martin from 2021 under the deal. The move comes hours after a board meeting held to discuss how to prop up the ailing firm. Aston Martin's best known customer is fictional spy James Bond and the company recently revealed that four of its cars will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die. Lawrence Stroll partly owns the Racing Point Formula 1 team The carmaker said its latest financial moves were aimed at strengthening its balance sheet after its ""disappointing performance"" in 2019. Mr Stroll's consortium will take a 20% stake in the company and he will become its executive chairman. As a result, Penny Hughes will be stepping down as Aston Martin's chairman once the deal is completed. It's all very well to build James Bond's company cars, but Aston Martin can't rely on a flashy brand alone. Many of its troubles can be traced to the decision to build a new factory at St Athan in South Wales, where it will produce its long-anticipated sports utility vehicle, the DBX. An ambitious move, it could have big long-term benefits for the carmaker. But in the short term, it has been struggling to generate enough cash to pay its bills, including the costs of setting up the factory. Dealers have been reducing stock rather than ordering new cars, while average selling prices have been falling, weighing on profits. Last year, the company was forced to borrow Â£120m at a steep interest rate in order to prop up its operations. It had been facing the prospect of borrowing even more. The new funding from Lawrence Stroll will give Aston Martin some much-needed stability. It now has breathing space in which to get the DBX into production, and implement a cost-cutting programme. Meanwhile the Canadian billionaire will be able to put an Aston Martin badge on his F1 cars - opening up new opportunities both to burnish the brand and to exploit its petrol-scented cachet. She said: ""The difficult trading performance in 2019 resulted in severe pressure on liquidity which has left the company with no alternative but to seek substantial additional equity financing. ""Without this, the balance sheet is not robust enough to support the operations of the group. ""Notwithstanding recent weak trading, the strength of the Aston Martin brand and our expanding portfolio of cars has allowed us to attract a strong new partner in Mr Stroll to support the turnaround of the business."" Four Aston Martins will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die Earlier this month,the 106-year-old firm issued a profit warning, saying annual earnings were expected to fall by nearly half from a year earlier. It said core retail sales - which covers sales from Aston Martin dealers to consumers - were up 12% from a year earlier. However, wholesale volumes - which covers how many cars the dealers are ordering from Aston Martin itself - were down 7% to 5,809. The company said it was expecting earnings of between Â£130m and Â£140m, well below the Â£247.3m it reported last year.

"Mo O'Brien (right) says her deafness made many elements of her 3,000-mile Atlantic row more challenging A 60-year-old pharmacy worker has become the first deaf person on record to row an ocean by finishing a 3,000-mile journey across the Atlantic. Mo O'Brien and her fellow crew members, including her daughter, landed on the Caribbean island of Antigua 49 days after setting out from the Canary Island of La Gomera in December. Their arrival late on Thursday local time makes them the fastest female trio to complete the challenge. Ms O'Brien said she felt ""relieved"". Ms O'Brien, from Bojewyan Stennack in Cornwall, rowed almost 3,000 miles (4,800km) of Atlantic Ocean with her daughter Bird Watts, 32, from Mevagissey in Cornwall, and their friend Claire Allinson, 45, from Exmouth, Devon. The trio rowed in pairs for four-hour shifts, then had two hours of rest, on a constant cycle for the entirety of the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge. Speaking to race organisers,externalafter they confirmed both records at the finish line in Antigua, Ms O'Brien said: ""I'm relieved to be here, but I kind of wish I was still out there, too. I absolutely loved it."" The pharmacy dispenser added that she is already making plans to row the Pacific. ""Give me a week to have a shower and some clean clothes,"" she joked. (L-R) Bird Watts, Claire Allinson and Mo O'Brien reached the finish line after 49 days, 13 hours and 49 minutes. Rowers lose an average of nearly two stone (12kg) during the 3,000-mile crossing Speaking on the phone to the BBC at the finish line in Antigua, Ms O'Brien said her favourite part of the challenge was rowing at night. ""The racing and the wind and the sea... it felt like you were going at about 100 miles an hour. I loved that feeling, the freedom - almost feeling like you're a part of the sea. It sounds corny, I know, but I've never experienced that before,"" she said. She added that the stars at night were ""magical"" and looked like ""somebody had opened a pot of glitter and scattered it across the sky"". Other highlights for the team included seeing wildlife such as orcas and humpback whales, which Ms Allinson described as ""absolutely breathtaking"". ""That's the kind of thing that you see on David Attenborough - it's not something you expect to see [yourself],"" she said. Ms Watts - who said it felt ""awesome but very wobbly"" to be back on dry land - said the only home comforts the crew members craved was a shower. In addition to the seasickness, being thrown around by huge waves, hit by flying fish and battling extreme sleep deprivation, Ms O'Brien said it had been ""very much a learning curve"" for the crew to manage her deafness. Ms Watts said her mother's profound deafness was ""a bit of a nightmare"" as rowers ""rely a lot on your hearing"". Ms O'Brien usually uses lip-reading to communicate, but rowers do not face each other in the boat, so she could not have a conversation while at the oars. Ms Watts, a newly-qualified radiographer, said: ""If we're going over in a storm and our boat is going to capsize, you would [usually] shout through to people in the air-tight cabin to stay inside. But you can't communicate anything like that with mum. ""We just do our best. We have certain hand signals that mean certain things. And for example, if she's in the cabin in stormy weather, she doesn't come out unless we tell her."" ""Every challenge you might think of that you might encounter on a boat, we also have to think how to overcome for someone who can't hear,"" Ms Watts added. The trio set off from La Gomera in the Canary Islands on 12 December 2019 Linda Whittaker (second from left) withdrew from the challenge shortly before it began due to extreme seasickness - meaning more rowing for the remaining three crew members In a blog post,external, Ms O'Brien said the team needed ""humour in abundance"" to complete the challenge, adding: ""I often mishear things and respond with ridiculous answers although I'm not sure which is funnier - my nonsense or the recipient's face."" Ms O'Brien said she had wanted to mark turning 60 by doing ""something bigger, something more challenging"" than other endurance events she has taken part in, such as a marathon and a charity cycle in Kenya. The mother-of-two was inspired to do the challenge after reading a book aboutfour Yorkshire women who became the oldest all-female crew to make the crossing. Ms O'Brien relies on lip-reading to communicate - and can therefore sometimes miss instructions Ms O'Brien was born with nerve deafness but grew up undiagnosed - her parents believed she was just ""painfully shy"". She said deafness can be ""very isolating"". ""Deaf people withdraw from life,"" she added. ""There are lots of things that I know that I stopped myself doing, because it was so difficult."" Deaf children 'fall behind at school' How radio aids helped my deaf son Brothers become fastest trio to row the Atlantic Ms O'Brien struggled to cope with NHS hearing aids when she eventually got them at about the age of 30. They boosted her hearing to 30% of what most people can hear, but with disorientating background noise. But then one of the crew's sponsors, ReSound, shared cutting-edge equipment with her, including a microphone which can be tuned into her hearing aid via Bluetooth. Ms O'Brien uses an app on her phone so that what she wants to hear - whether it be a conversation, birdsong, or music - is clearly separated from background noise. This meant she could hear instructors and pass mandatory courses to take part in the Atlantic row - and could hear her fellow rowers. Ms O'Brien said she ""cried all night"" when she lost her phone during the challenge, because the hearing aids stopped working properly. ""My immediate thought was 'I can no longer hear at all and that's a problem for me and the rest of the crew, for safety reasons',"" she said. ReSound helped her to reconnect after a couple of days. Ms O'Brien says she has become more sociable in the last 18 months, with the help of an innovative new hearing aid Ms O'Brien, who has been an amateur rower for 20 years, said her ""crack on, just do it"" mentality has helped her to overcome difficulties. ""The fact that my mum died when she was 56, I feel very aware that time goes so quickly and we really need to do things while we can,"" she said. ""There's something in me that just says don't do the ordinary, don't go to work every day, pay your mortgage, go home, watch a bit of telly, or whatever your routine is."" The crew say they're ""ordinary women achieving the extraordinary"" Guinness World Records does not award records in relation to disabilities, but race organisers Atlantic Campaigns - who confirm and validate their own records - said Ms O'Brien is the first deaf person to row an ocean. The Ocean Rowing Society - which keeps a database of all ocean rows - said as of 14 January, 1,083 people had rowed an ocean, including about 440 crews that have crossed the Atlantic from east to west. The British Deaf Association congratulated Ms O'Brien on Friday, with a spokesperson saying: ""Mo is an inspiration to many and is an example of what deaf people can achieve.""

"This video can not be played What's the deal with the controversial Nike Vaporfly trainers? Nike's controversial Vaporfly range will not be banned but there will be tighter regulations around high-tech running shoes, World Athletics says. Any new shoe technology developed after 30 April will have to be available on the open market for four months before an athlete can use it in competition. World Athletics has also introduced an immediate indefinite ban on any shoes that have a sole thicker than 40mm. The body will also investigate any shoes that ""may not be compliant"". An immediate indefinite ban has also been introduced on any shoe that contains more than one ""rigid embedded plate or blade"". For shoes with spikes, an additional plate or blade is allowed for the purpose of attaching the spikes, but the sole must be no thicker than 30mm. The 'Alphafly' prototype shoes worn by Eliud Kipchoge when he became the first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours in October 2019 will be banned. 'It feels like running on trampolines' Kipchoge breaks two-hour marathon mark The shoe worn by Eliud Kipchoge when he became the first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours will be banned indefinitely A group of experts were asked to consider whether Nike's Vaporfly shoes give their wearers an unfair advantage. Athletes wearing the new footwear including Nike's latest Vaporfly have taken 31 of 36 top-three finishes in major marathons last year. Kipchoge's Kenyan compatriot Brigid Kosgei wore a Vaporfly prototype when she broke Paula Radcliffe's long-standing women's marathon world record in October 2019. World Athletics president Lord Coe said: ""It is not our job to regulate the entire sports shoe market but it is our duty to preserve the integrity of elite competition by ensuring the shoes worn by elite athletes in competition do not offer any unfair assistance or advantage. ""As we enter the Olympic year, we don't believe we can rule out shoes that have been generally available for a considerable period of time, but we can draw a line by prohibiting the use of shoes that go further than what is currently on the market while we investigate further. ""I believe these new rules strike the right balance by offering certainty to athletes and manufacturers as they prepare for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, while addressing the concerns that have been raised about shoe technology. ""If further evidence becomes available that indicates we need to tighten up these rules, we reserve the right to do that to protect our sport."" World Athletics will now establish an ""expert working group"" to ""guide future research"" into shoe technology as well as assessing any new shoes that enter the market. The shoes have been criticised for ""distorting the record books"", with some arguing they prevent fair competition with athletes not sponsored by Nike. Vaporflys claim to improve an athlete's performance by 4%, and the five fastest marathons of all time have been run in the past 16 months by athletes wearing varying forms of the technology. Former British Olympic marathon runner Mara Yamauchi previously told BBC Sport that ""we no longer truly have fair competition"". ""It's up to World Athletics to provide a level playing field for all... to be brutally honest, it's hard to see how anybody not wearing Vaporflys at Tokyo is going to win medals,"" she said. ""Athletics has had several years of doping stories coming out in the press and the single most important thing is to restore trust and bring in more fans and sponsors. ""But if we see every medal winner wearing the Vaporflys and other athletes not getting a look in, I'm not sure that people watching can really say I believe that performance 100%."" Nike said in a previous statement they ""respect the spirit of the rules and we do not create any running shoes that return more energy than the runner expends"". BBC sports editor Dan Roan Amid mounting confusion that running was becoming distorted, World Athletics has tried to provide some clarity before the Tokyo Olympics and halt what some see as an 'arms race' in shoe technology. Although more research will now be conducted and the rules could still develop, it seems significant the governing body admits ""concerns that the integrity of the sport might be threatened"". The news will come as a relief for Nike and the athletes it sponsors. The prototype 'AlphaFly' that Eliud Kipchoge used to go sub-two hours last year exceeds the new restrictions and is now banned for elite runners. But as expected, the Vaporfly range that has revolutionised distance running is cleared, including the 'Vaporfly Next%' that Brigid Kosgei wore when smashing the women's world record last year. That will lead to fears that the new restrictions have been conceived with that shoe's specific dimensions in mind, are too little too late, and mean athletes sponsored by other manufacturers are at a disadvantage. The changes also put pressure on rival companies to quickly develop any new prototype shoes. They have three months to do so. After that they will need to have been widely available to buy for four months before being allowed in elite competition, ruling out their use at the Olympics.

"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has overtaken that of the Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003. There were around 8,100 cases of Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - reported during the eight-month outbreak. But nearly 10,000 cases of the new virus have been confirmed, most in China, since it emerged in December. More than 100 cases have been reported outside China, in 22 countries. The number of deaths so far stands at 213 - all in China. In total, 774 people were killed by Sars. On Thursday,the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergencyover the new outbreak. The UK on Fridayconfirmed its first two cases of the virus. In another development, the US also declared a public health emergency and said it would bar any foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks from entering the country. Estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the true total number of cases could be far higher than official figures suggest. Based on mathematical models of the outbreak, experts there say more than 75,000 people may have been infected in the Chinese city of Wuhan alone, where the virus originated. Can people recover from coronavirus? And other questions How quarantine has fought disease through the ages The lessons learned from the Sars outbreak Most cases outside China are in people who have been to Wuhan. But Germany, Japan, Vietnam, the United States, Thailand and South Korea have reported person-to-person cases - patients being infected by people who had travelled to China. Wuhan's Communist Party chief said on Friday the city should have taken measures sooner to contain the virus. ""If strict control measures had been taken earlier, the result would have been better than now,"" Ma Guoqiang told state broadcaster CCTV. As governments around the world acted to contain the virus, WHO spokesman Chris Lindmeier warned that closing borders could in fact accelerate its spread, with travellers entering countries unofficially. ""As we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases, whenever people want to travel, they will. And if the official paths are not opened, they will find unofficial paths,"" he said. He said the best way to track the virus was at official border crossings. Sars was a type of coronavirus that first emerged in China's Guangdong province in November 2002. By the time the outbreak ended the following July, it had spread to more than two dozen countries. The new coronavirus emerged only last month. So far, it has spread to fewer countries and - while more people have been infected globally - it has resulted in fewer deaths. On Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases within China surpassed the Sars epidemic. Sars was also estimated to have cost the global economy more than $30bn (Â£22bn). But economists have said the new coronavirus could have an even bigger impact on the world economy. It has forced global companies including tech giants, car makers and retailers to shut down temporarily in China. China was also criticised by the UN's global health body for concealing the scale of the original Sars outbreak. It has been praised for responding to the latest virus with tough measures, including effectively quarantining millions of residents in cities. But in his interview with CCTV on Friday, the Wuhan Communist Party chief said transport restrictions should have been brought in at least 10 days earlier. ""The epidemic may have been alleviated somewhat, and not got to the current situation,"" Mr Ma said. The estimates from the University of Hong Kong suggest the epidemic is doubling in size roughly every week and that multiple Chinese cities may have imported sufficient cases to start local epidemics. ""Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could potentially also become outbreak epicentres because of substantial spread of pre-symptomatic cases unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately,"" Professor Joseph Wu said. Why is this outbreak more difficult to stop than Sars? The answer is not down to China - the speed and scale of the country's response to this new virus is widely considered to be unprecedented. The difference is the way the virus behaves inside the human body. Sars was a brutal infection that you couldn't miss - patients were contagious only when they had symptoms. This made it relatively easy to isolate the sick and quarantine anyone who might have been exposed. But the new virus, 2019-nCov, is harder to spot and therefore harder to stop. From the virus's perspective, it has a far smarter evolutionary survival strategy than Sars. The best estimate is only one-in-five cases cause severe symptoms, so instead of infected people turning up in hospital, you have to go out and find them. And we are getting detailed documented cases of people spreading the virus before they even have symptoms. There is a tendency to focus only on how deadly a virus is. But it is this, in combination with a virus's ability to spread, that determines its true threat. A confirmed case in Tibet means the virus has now reached every region in mainland China. The central province of Hubei, where nearly all deaths have occurred, is in a state of lockdown. The province of 60 million people is home to Wuhan, which is at the heart of the outbreak. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Coronavirus: What it does to the body Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began The city has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus. People who have been in Hubei are also being told to work from home. China has said it will send charter planes to bring back Hubei residents who are overseas ""as soon as possible"". A foreign ministry spokesman said this was because of the ""practical difficulties"" Chinese citizens had faced abroad. The virus is affecting China's economy, the world's second-largest, with a growing number of countries advising their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the country. Voluntary evacuations of hundreds of foreign nationals from Wuhan are under way. The UK, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand are expected to quarantine all evacuees for two weeks to monitor them for symptoms and avoid contagion.

"The bulk of British Steel's 4,000 staff work at the Scunthorpe plant The sale of British Steel to Chinese firm Jingye could be scuppered by French intervention. Jingye agreed in November to buy the collapsed business for Â£50m and save about 4,000 jobs. However, the approval of the French government is required because British Steel has a plant in France that is considered a strategic national asset. Now French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has threatened to veto the deal,as first reported by Sky News.,external Mr Le Maire told Chancellor Sajid Javid of his intentions last week during a meeting in Brussels, government sources confirmed to the BBC. The Anglo-French row centres on British Steel's plant in Hayange, which supplies the French railway network, including state-owned train operator SNCF. France has the power to block the sale of the Hayange plant, which has already beenadvertised for sale separately from the UK operation, apparently with the blessing of the French authorities. When British Steel collapsed more than seven months ago, control of the holding company passed to the UK Insolvency Service, which is responsible for selling the assets. Although the service is the beneficial owner of Hayange, day-to-day operational control of the factory remains in France. There is another potential bidder for British Steel waiting in the wings. Earlier this week, Turkish construction conglomerate Cengiz Holdings confirmed its ""intention and ability to make an offer for the whole of British Steel, should the current talks with Jingye Group fall away"". Cengiz chief executive Omer Mafa said the company was ""ready and waiting to engage with the UK government and British Steel's receivers to progress towards a full offer"". Mr Mafa added that Cengiz enjoyed a ""strong trading relationship with French industries such as energy, mining and aviation"". Government sources confirm that the French finance minister has indicated to Chancellor Sajid Javid that he is opposed to Chinese ownership of what the French consider strategically important assets. As a major supplier of steel to state-owned rail company SNCF, the French government considers the British Steel owned plant at Hayange in north-east France to fall into that category. The French position is different to that of the UK government, despite the fact that British Steel is a major supplier to state-owned Network Rail. Sources within the steel industry also confirm knowledge of the French objections. There is also widespread unease within the UK steel industry of the scale of Chinese ambitions within the UK. Jingye's ambitions to significantly increase production at Scunthorpe, along with the acquisition a week ago of UK steel trading company Stemcor, have caused alarm among other steel producers at the increasing penetration of Chinese interests in an important primary industry. French objections were widely anticipated and a process to carve out the French plant from the rest of British Steel if necessary has been under way for several months. The government remains hopeful that the deal with Jingye can still be completed and talks to seal that deal are ongoing.

"This video can not be played What's the deal with the controversial Nike Vaporfly trainers? Nike's controversial Vaporfly range will not be banned but there will be tighter regulations around high-tech running shoes, World Athletics says. Any new shoe technology developed after 30 April will have to be available on the open market for four months before an athlete can use it in competition. World Athletics has also introduced an immediate indefinite ban on any shoes that have a sole thicker than 40mm. The body will also investigate any shoes that ""may not be compliant"". An immediate indefinite ban has also been introduced on any shoe that contains more than one ""rigid embedded plate or blade"". For shoes with spikes, an additional plate or blade is allowed for the purpose of attaching the spikes, but the sole must be no thicker than 30mm. The 'Alphafly' prototype shoes worn by Eliud Kipchoge when he became the first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours in October 2019 will be banned. 'It feels like running on trampolines' Kipchoge breaks two-hour marathon mark The shoe worn by Eliud Kipchoge when he became the first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours will be banned indefinitely A group of experts were asked to consider whether Nike's Vaporfly shoes give their wearers an unfair advantage. Athletes wearing the new footwear including Nike's latest Vaporfly have taken 31 of 36 top-three finishes in major marathons last year. Kipchoge's Kenyan compatriot Brigid Kosgei wore a Vaporfly prototype when she broke Paula Radcliffe's long-standing women's marathon world record in October 2019. World Athletics president Lord Coe said: ""It is not our job to regulate the entire sports shoe market but it is our duty to preserve the integrity of elite competition by ensuring the shoes worn by elite athletes in competition do not offer any unfair assistance or advantage. ""As we enter the Olympic year, we don't believe we can rule out shoes that have been generally available for a considerable period of time, but we can draw a line by prohibiting the use of shoes that go further than what is currently on the market while we investigate further. ""I believe these new rules strike the right balance by offering certainty to athletes and manufacturers as they prepare for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, while addressing the concerns that have been raised about shoe technology. ""If further evidence becomes available that indicates we need to tighten up these rules, we reserve the right to do that to protect our sport."" World Athletics will now establish an ""expert working group"" to ""guide future research"" into shoe technology as well as assessing any new shoes that enter the market. The shoes have been criticised for ""distorting the record books"", with some arguing they prevent fair competition with athletes not sponsored by Nike. Vaporflys claim to improve an athlete's performance by 4%, and the five fastest marathons of all time have been run in the past 16 months by athletes wearing varying forms of the technology. Former British Olympic marathon runner Mara Yamauchi previously told BBC Sport that ""we no longer truly have fair competition"". ""It's up to World Athletics to provide a level playing field for all... to be brutally honest, it's hard to see how anybody not wearing Vaporflys at Tokyo is going to win medals,"" she said. ""Athletics has had several years of doping stories coming out in the press and the single most important thing is to restore trust and bring in more fans and sponsors. ""But if we see every medal winner wearing the Vaporflys and other athletes not getting a look in, I'm not sure that people watching can really say I believe that performance 100%."" Nike said in a previous statement they ""respect the spirit of the rules and we do not create any running shoes that return more energy than the runner expends"". BBC sports editor Dan Roan Amid mounting confusion that running was becoming distorted, World Athletics has tried to provide some clarity before the Tokyo Olympics and halt what some see as an 'arms race' in shoe technology. Although more research will now be conducted and the rules could still develop, it seems significant the governing body admits ""concerns that the integrity of the sport might be threatened"". The news will come as a relief for Nike and the athletes it sponsors. The prototype 'AlphaFly' that Eliud Kipchoge used to go sub-two hours last year exceeds the new restrictions and is now banned for elite runners. But as expected, the Vaporfly range that has revolutionised distance running is cleared, including the 'Vaporfly Next%' that Brigid Kosgei wore when smashing the women's world record last year. That will lead to fears that the new restrictions have been conceived with that shoe's specific dimensions in mind, are too little too late, and mean athletes sponsored by other manufacturers are at a disadvantage. The changes also put pressure on rival companies to quickly develop any new prototype shoes. They have three months to do so. After that they will need to have been widely available to buy for four months before being allowed in elite competition, ruling out their use at the Olympics.

"Struggling luxury UK carmaker Aston Martin has announced plans to raise emergency funding worth Â£500m. A consortium led by billionaire Lawrence Stroll will put in Â£182m, with the rest of the money coming from existing investors. Mr Stroll partly owns the Racing Point Formula 1 team, which will be branded Aston Martin from 2021 under the deal. The move comes hours after a board meeting held to discuss how to prop up the ailing firm. Aston Martin's best known customer is fictional spy James Bond and the company recently revealed that four of its cars will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die. Lawrence Stroll partly owns the Racing Point Formula 1 team The carmaker said its latest financial moves were aimed at strengthening its balance sheet after its ""disappointing performance"" in 2019. Mr Stroll's consortium will take a 20% stake in the company and he will become its executive chairman. As a result, Penny Hughes will be stepping down as Aston Martin's chairman once the deal is completed. It's all very well to build James Bond's company cars, but Aston Martin can't rely on a flashy brand alone. Many of its troubles can be traced to the decision to build a new factory at St Athan in South Wales, where it will produce its long-anticipated sports utility vehicle, the DBX. An ambitious move, it could have big long-term benefits for the carmaker. But in the short term, it has been struggling to generate enough cash to pay its bills, including the costs of setting up the factory. Dealers have been reducing stock rather than ordering new cars, while average selling prices have been falling, weighing on profits. Last year, the company was forced to borrow Â£120m at a steep interest rate in order to prop up its operations. It had been facing the prospect of borrowing even more. The new funding from Lawrence Stroll will give Aston Martin some much-needed stability. It now has breathing space in which to get the DBX into production, and implement a cost-cutting programme. Meanwhile the Canadian billionaire will be able to put an Aston Martin badge on his F1 cars - opening up new opportunities both to burnish the brand and to exploit its petrol-scented cachet. She said: ""The difficult trading performance in 2019 resulted in severe pressure on liquidity which has left the company with no alternative but to seek substantial additional equity financing. ""Without this, the balance sheet is not robust enough to support the operations of the group. ""Notwithstanding recent weak trading, the strength of the Aston Martin brand and our expanding portfolio of cars has allowed us to attract a strong new partner in Mr Stroll to support the turnaround of the business."" Four Aston Martins will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die Earlier this month,the 106-year-old firm issued a profit warning, saying annual earnings were expected to fall by nearly half from a year earlier. It said core retail sales - which covers sales from Aston Martin dealers to consumers - were up 12% from a year earlier. However, wholesale volumes - which covers how many cars the dealers are ordering from Aston Martin itself - were down 7% to 5,809. The company said it was expecting earnings of between Â£130m and Â£140m, well below the Â£247.3m it reported last year.

Earlier this week, Turkish construction conglomerate Cengiz Holdings confirmed its ""intention and ability to make an offer for the whole of British Steel, should the current talks with Jingye Group fall away"". Cengiz chief executive Omer Mafa said the company was ""ready and waiting to engage with the UK government and British Steel's receivers to progress towards a full offer"". Mr Mafa added that Cengiz enjoyed a ""strong trading relationship with French industries such as energy, mining and aviation"". Government sources confirm that the French finance minister has indicated to Chancellor Sajid Javid that he is opposed to Chinese ownership of what the French consider strategically important assets. As a major supplier of steel to state-owned rail company SNCF, the French government considers the British Steel owned plant at Hayange in north-east France to fall into that category. The French position is different to that of the UK government, despite the fact that British Steel is a major supplier to state-owned Network Rail. Sources within the steel industry also confirm knowledge of the French objections. There is also widespread unease within the UK steel industry of the scale of Chinese ambitions within the UK. Jingye's ambitions to significantly increase production at Scunthorpe, along with the acquisition a week ago of UK steel trading company Stemcor, have caused alarm among other steel producers at the increasing penetration of Chinese interests in an important primary industry. French objections were widely anticipated and a process to carve out the French plant from the rest of British Steel if necessary has been under way for several months. The government remains hopeful that the deal with Jingye can still be completed and talks to seal that deal are ongoing. Carving out the profit-making French business is thought to make the overall deal less attractive to Jingye and for that reason, a deal with Turkish group Cengiz has been lined up as a potential fallback option if the deal with Jingye collapses.

"Caroline said the food bank signposted services to help her A woman who went from earning â¬1,000 a week to relying on a food bank has said she will ""never be able to thank"" its volunteers enough for the help given. Caroline had been living and working in the Netherlands, running an employment agency, when she became pregnant. But after the end of a relationship and facing housing and health problems, she was living on ""about Â£35 a week"". She said she would encourage anyone who was struggling financially to seek help from a food bank. Caroline, who only wants to use her first name, said without support from Stoke-on-Trent food bank ""I don't know where I would be right now"". ""The volunteers are amazing people,"" she said. ""The biggest thing I can say in my experience is, you are not judged, no matter what your background is nothing matters, just that you are educated in where to go to get help and move you from that situation."" This video can not be played Three people talk about using food banks: ""It means I can eat, it means I can get healthy"" She was earning up to â¬1,000 a week, with commission, before becoming pregnant with her daughter who is now nine. Caroline returned to England and about 18 months later became pregnant with her son, now seven, but the relationship with her children's father broke down and he remained in the Netherlands. She said she had no support with childcare, and complications after her children's births left her unable to work full time. Latest news from the West Midlands 'I hung around outside the food bank, embarrassed to go in' Student forced to food bank by loan delay Rising damp in their privately rented home meant she was spending Â£400 a month on utilities and she had to top up the rental payments, which were not fully covered by housing benefits. She said at times it felt like ""chaos"" where she had ""no control over anything"". ""I had ebbs and waves where we were living off barely anything,"" she said. While volunteering at children's centres she was given her first token for the food bank. Caroline said staff at Stoke-on-Trent food bank are ""angels"" As well as collecting food there once a month, staff also helped ""signpost"" her towards other support services. ""I was too proud to admit I needed help,"" she said. ""But I don't think that pride has a part to play these days in visiting a food bank because, if you need that help, it is one of the best places you can go."" Caroline, who now lives in Stone, Staffordshire, added: ""I am hoping for a brighter future. I am settled, the children are settled, I don't have debts, it just feels amazing to be in this position.

"Struggling luxury UK carmaker Aston Martin has announced plans to raise emergency funding worth Â£500m. A consortium led by billionaire Lawrence Stroll will put in Â£182m, with the rest of the money coming from existing investors. Mr Stroll partly owns the Racing Point Formula 1 team, which will be branded Aston Martin from 2021 under the deal. The move comes hours after a board meeting held to discuss how to prop up the ailing firm. Aston Martin's best known customer is fictional spy James Bond and the company recently revealed that four of its cars will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die. Lawrence Stroll partly owns the Racing Point Formula 1 team The carmaker said its latest financial moves were aimed at strengthening its balance sheet after its ""disappointing performance"" in 2019. Mr Stroll's consortium will take a 20% stake in the company and he will become its executive chairman. As a result, Penny Hughes will be stepping down as Aston Martin's chairman once the deal is completed. It's all very well to build James Bond's company cars, but Aston Martin can't rely on a flashy brand alone. Many of its troubles can be traced to the decision to build a new factory at St Athan in South Wales, where it will produce its long-anticipated sports utility vehicle, the DBX. An ambitious move, it could have big long-term benefits for the carmaker. But in the short term, it has been struggling to generate enough cash to pay its bills, including the costs of setting up the factory. Dealers have been reducing stock rather than ordering new cars, while average selling prices have been falling, weighing on profits. Last year, the company was forced to borrow Â£120m at a steep interest rate in order to prop up its operations. It had been facing the prospect of borrowing even more. The new funding from Lawrence Stroll will give Aston Martin some much-needed stability. It now has breathing space in which to get the DBX into production, and implement a cost-cutting programme. Meanwhile the Canadian billionaire will be able to put an Aston Martin badge on his F1 cars - opening up new opportunities both to burnish the brand and to exploit its petrol-scented cachet. She said: ""The difficult trading performance in 2019 resulted in severe pressure on liquidity which has left the company with no alternative but to seek substantial additional equity financing. ""Without this, the balance sheet is not robust enough to support the operations of the group. ""Notwithstanding recent weak trading, the strength of the Aston Martin brand and our expanding portfolio of cars has allowed us to attract a strong new partner in Mr Stroll to support the turnaround of the business."" Four Aston Martins will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die Earlier this month,the 106-year-old firm issued a profit warning, saying annual earnings were expected to fall by nearly half from a year earlier. It said core retail sales - which covers sales from Aston Martin dealers to consumers - were up 12% from a year earlier. However, wholesale volumes - which covers how many cars the dealers are ordering from Aston Martin itself - were down 7% to 5,809. The company said it was expecting earnings of between Â£130m and Â£140m, well below the Â£247.3m it reported last year.

"This video can not be played Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: ""We must all act together now to limit further spread"" The new coronavirus has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the outbreak continues to spread outside China. ""The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems. Meanwhile, the US has told its citizens not to travel to China. The state departmentissued a level four warning,external- having previously urged Americans to ""reconsider"" travel to China - and said any citizens in China ""should consider departing using commercial means"". China has said it will send charter plans to bring back Hubei province residents who are overseas ""as soon as possible"". A foreign ministry spokesman said this was because of the ""practical difficulties"" Chinese citizens have faced abroad. Hubei is where the virus emerged. At least 213 people in the China have died from the virus, mostly in Hubei, with almost 10,000 cases nationally. US advises against all travel to China over virus Cement mixers become celebrities in China lockdown The WHO said there had been 98 cases in 18 other countries, but no deaths. Most international cases are in people who had been to Wuhan in Hubei. However in eight cases - in Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the United States - patients were infected by people who had travelled to China.  18The number of countries with cases 14Cases in Thailand and Japan 13Singapore 11South Korea 8Australia and Malaysia 5France and USA Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, Dr Tedros described the virus as an ""unprecedented outbreak"" that has been met with an ""unprecedented response"". He praised the ""extraordinary measures"" Chinese authorities had taken, and said there was no reason to limit trade or travel to China. Trump official: Coronavirus may boost US jobs Britons on evacuation flight home from Wuhan ""Let me be clear, this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China,"" he said. But various countries have taken steps to close borders or cancel flights, and companies likeGoogle, Ikea, Starbucks and Tesla have closed their shops or stopped operations. The US Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, has said the outbreak could ""accelerate the returnof jobs to North America"". What happens if this virus finds its way into a country that cannot cope? Many low- and middle-income countries simply lack the tools to spot or contain it. The fear is it could spread uncontrollably and that it may go unnoticed for some time. Remember this is a disease which emerged only last month - and yet there are already almost 10,000 confirmed cases in China. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa - the largest in human history - showed how easily poorer countries can be overwhelmed by such outbreaks. And if novel coronavirus gets a significant foothold in such places, then it would be incredibly difficult to contain. We are not at that stage yet - 99% of cases are in China and the WHO is convinced the country can control the outbreak there. But declaring a global emergency allows the WHO to support lower- and middle-income countries to strengthen their disease surveillance - and prepare them for cases. The WHO declares a Public Health Emergency of International Concern when there is ""an extraordinary event which is determinedâ¦ to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease"". It has previously declared five global public health emergencies: Swine flu, 2009-The H1N1 virus spread across the world in 2009, with death toll estimates ranging from 123,000 to 575,400 Polio, 2014- Although closer than ever to eradication in 2012, polio numbers rose in 2013 Zika, 2016- The WHO declared Zika a public health emergency in 2016 after the disease spread rapidly through the Americas Ebola, 2014 and 2019- The first emergency over the virus lasted from August 2014 to March 2016 as almost 30,000 people were infected and more than 11,000 died in West Africa. A second emergency was declared last year as an outbreak spread in DR Congo This video can not be played Inside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccine A confirmed case in Tibet means the virus has reached every region in mainland China. According to the country's National Health Commission, 9,692 cases have tested positive. The central province of Hubei, where nearly all deaths have occurred, is in a state of lockdown. The province of 60 million people is home to Wuhan, the heart of the outbreak. The city has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus. People who have been in Hubei are also being told to work from home until it is considered safe for them to return. The virus is affecting China's economy, the world's second-largest, with a growing number of countries advising their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the country. Voluntary evacuations of hundreds of foreign nationals from Wuhan are under way. The UK, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand are expected to quarantine all evacuees for two weeks to monitor them for symptoms and avoid contagion.

"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has overtaken that of the Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003. There were around 8,100 cases of Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - reported during the eight-month outbreak. But nearly 10,000 cases of the new virus have been confirmed, most in China, since it emerged in December. More than 100 cases have been reported outside China, in 22 countries. The number of deaths so far stands at 213 - all in China. In total, 774 people were killed by Sars. On Thursday,the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergencyover the new outbreak. The UK on Fridayconfirmed its first two cases of the virus. In another development, the US also declared a public health emergency and said it would bar any foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks from entering the country. Estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the true total number of cases could be far higher than official figures suggest. Based on mathematical models of the outbreak, experts there say more than 75,000 people may have been infected in the Chinese city of Wuhan alone, where the virus originated. Can people recover from coronavirus? And other questions How quarantine has fought disease through the ages The lessons learned from the Sars outbreak Most cases outside China are in people who have been to Wuhan. But Germany, Japan, Vietnam, the United States, Thailand and South Korea have reported person-to-person cases - patients being infected by people who had travelled to China. Wuhan's Communist Party chief said on Friday the city should have taken measures sooner to contain the virus. ""If strict control measures had been taken earlier, the result would have been better than now,"" Ma Guoqiang told state broadcaster CCTV. As governments around the world acted to contain the virus, WHO spokesman Chris Lindmeier warned that closing borders could in fact accelerate its spread, with travellers entering countries unofficially. ""As we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases, whenever people want to travel, they will. And if the official paths are not opened, they will find unofficial paths,"" he said. He said the best way to track the virus was at official border crossings. Sars was a type of coronavirus that first emerged in China's Guangdong province in November 2002. By the time the outbreak ended the following July, it had spread to more than two dozen countries. The new coronavirus emerged only last month. So far, it has spread to fewer countries and - while more people have been infected globally - it has resulted in fewer deaths. On Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases within China surpassed the Sars epidemic. Sars was also estimated to have cost the global economy more than $30bn (Â£22bn). But economists have said the new coronavirus could have an even bigger impact on the world economy. It has forced global companies including tech giants, car makers and retailers to shut down temporarily in China. China was also criticised by the UN's global health body for concealing the scale of the original Sars outbreak. It has been praised for responding to the latest virus with tough measures, including effectively quarantining millions of residents in cities. But in his interview with CCTV on Friday, the Wuhan Communist Party chief said transport restrictions should have been brought in at least 10 days earlier. ""The epidemic may have been alleviated somewhat, and not got to the current situation,"" Mr Ma said. The estimates from the University of Hong Kong suggest the epidemic is doubling in size roughly every week and that multiple Chinese cities may have imported sufficient cases to start local epidemics. ""Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could potentially also become outbreak epicentres because of substantial spread of pre-symptomatic cases unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately,"" Professor Joseph Wu said. Why is this outbreak more difficult to stop than Sars? The answer is not down to China - the speed and scale of the country's response to this new virus is widely considered to be unprecedented. The difference is the way the virus behaves inside the human body. Sars was a brutal infection that you couldn't miss - patients were contagious only when they had symptoms. This made it relatively easy to isolate the sick and quarantine anyone who might have been exposed. But the new virus, 2019-nCov, is harder to spot and therefore harder to stop. From the virus's perspective, it has a far smarter evolutionary survival strategy than Sars. The best estimate is only one-in-five cases cause severe symptoms, so instead of infected people turning up in hospital, you have to go out and find them. And we are getting detailed documented cases of people spreading the virus before they even have symptoms. There is a tendency to focus only on how deadly a virus is. But it is this, in combination with a virus's ability to spread, that determines its true threat. A confirmed case in Tibet means the virus has now reached every region in mainland China. The central province of Hubei, where nearly all deaths have occurred, is in a state of lockdown. The province of 60 million people is home to Wuhan, which is at the heart of the outbreak. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Coronavirus: What it does to the body Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began The city has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus.

"Coaches carrying British evacuees from Wuhan were escorted by police and ambulances as they left RAF Brize Norton for Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral Britons evacuated from coronavirus-hit Wuhan have arrived at a hospital in the Wirral where they will spend the next 14 days in quarantine. A convoy of coaches arrived at Arrowe Park Hospital shortly after 19:15 GMT. Eighty-three Britons were transported from RAF Brize Norton, where their evacuation flight from Wuhan landed. It comes as officials urgently try to trace those who came into contact withtwo people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK. The British passengers are being housed in an NHS staff accommodation block at the Merseyside hospital, where they will be put in ""supported isolation"" for 14 days with ""all necessary medical attention"". Six coaches were led by a police escort to the rear of the hospital and on to a side road leading to the accommodation block. Patients disembarked from behind barriers covering the accommodation entrance, but some could be seen inside wearing masks as they walked upstairs to their rooms for the next fortnight. Ben Williams had to leave his new Chinese wife behind after being given short notice to get to the evacuation plane. The flight was delayed by around three hours to allow as many UK and EU citizens as possible to get to the airport on time amid a suspension of the city's public transport. Mr Williams, who married his new wife in Wuhan and was honeymooning there, said: ""By the time we got out the door it was very much a close call to get to the meeting point to get on this flight. ""Sadly, my wife has nothing prepared and it wasn't right for her to enter the UK with essentially nothing."" What coronavirus does to the body A visual guide to the outbreak Your Coronavirus questions answered Speaking from the plane after it touched down, he said: ""We'll leave the plane one by one or in families for a full health screening and, I believe, just get on a coach to our final destination for our extended vacation."" Asked about the mood on the flight he added: ""It's quite mellow to be honest. Everyone's got quite used to wearing face masks and trying their best to do deep cleans."" The newlywed said he hoped he and his wife would be reunited in less than ""a few months"". This video can not be played Britons Matt Raw and Adam Bridgeman spoke to the BBC about trying to leave China. Patrick Graham, another British citizen evacuated from Wuhan, shared footage of the plane touching down at RAF Brize Norton. He joked with his social media followers, ""The infected are coming"", before adding: ""Thank you staff Wamosair for getting us home - they also have to go into a period of quarantine for bringing us home."" Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said all the Britons were screened before boarding the plane and were subject to continuous risk assessment during the flight. ""Everybody who has got on the plane is a well passenger,"" she said. ""If any of those passengers do show symptoms there are set procedures to isolate them."" How quarantine has fought disease through the ages Coronavirus declared global health emergency The Wamos Air plane arrived at RAF Brize Norton The British passengers will be housed in a separate building from the hospital wards, Wirral Council said. A spokesman added that services in the hospital will be running as usual and staff will be kept separate from the quarantined Britons. But a group of local MPs have raised concerns about hospital staff and have asked the government for assurances on matters including safeguards and where the staff treating the patients will come from. Preparations were seen being made at Arrowe Park Hospital ahead of the arrival of Britons evacuated from China The private coach company transporting them said its drivers had agreed to take the job and will be given paid leave to ""remain at home for the next 10 days"". Horseman Coaches added that its vehicles will be ""deep cleaned"" and then removed from service for a minimum of 10 days. What does being in quarantine mean? Trump official: Coronavirus could boost US jobs Some UK citizens did not make the evacuation flight after being told family members with Chinese passports would be unable to join them. That decision was reversed hours before the plane was due to depart, but it was too late for some to get to the airport. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News the government would send another plane to Wuhan to rescue British citizens if necessary. The remaining 27 foreign nationals on the plane - thought to be EU citizens - later landed in Spain, Reuters reports.

"The UK left the EU at 23:00 GMT Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the ""dawn of a new era"" in a video message Brexiteers celebrated at a rally in a packed Parliament Square, London Earlier, supporters of the EU held a procession through Whitehall to ""bid a fond farewell"" to the union Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the country not to ""turn inwards"" after it leaves the bloc Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Brexit day is a ""pivotal moment"" for Scotland and the UK Kate Whannel, Becky Morton, Martha Buckley, Alice Cuddy and Gavin Stamp The European Union flag is taken down in Cardiff Bay as Brexit formally takes effect. After 47 years of membership and three and a half years since the country voted to leave, the UK has left the EU. Thanks for following our live coverage of this historic day. But with negotiations on the UK's future relationship with Europe still to come, this won't be the last you hear of Brexit.... Katya AdlerEurope Editor As Brexit dawned, I found myself reporting for the BBC from outside the glass and concrete behemoth, otherwise known as the European Commission building, in Brussels. It's the same place I've regularly stood over the past three and a half years, attempting to explain the EU perspective on Brexit following our referendum and throughout the divorce negotiations. It struck me that the impersonal, impenetrable-looking monolith embodies the image so many back in the UK have of the EU as a whole. But going through my mind on Friday night were all the ""ordinary"" Europeans I've met across the continent while covering the Brexit story: engineers, teachers, bakers and bus drivers who asked ""Why are you doing this?"" and insisted: ""Don't leave!"" Read more from Katya Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor What now? It's happened. A dreary night didn't discourage those celebrating in Parliament Square. We wake this morning out of the European Union. But we follow their rules until the end of the year, without a say. We are separate after more than 40 years, but remember much of the status quo will hold for now - the UK and the EU, the awkward couple, finally divorced - but still sharing a house and the bills. But what the prime minister hails as a new era, a bright new dawn, starts months of hard bargaining with our neighbours across the Channel. Read more from Laura here. ""Make leave not war"", the Sun proclaims on its front page, which carries the prime minister's plea to bring the UK together. The Daily Express strikes a jubilant tone, with the headline: ""Rise and shine: It's a glorious new Britain"". ""The day we said goodbye,"" the Guardian says more sombrely. And now the UK is finally out - ""what next?"", asks the i's headline. Read more of the front pages here. BBC Europe reporter tweets...  Allow Twitter content?

Pre-recorded bongs from Big Ben played out as the UK left the European Union. Richard MossPolitical Editor, BBC Look North A few hundred people walked down Newcastle's Northumberland Street to Monument as part of a vigil tonight. The symbolic nature of today - the fact Boris Johnson brought the cabinet to Sunderland - has emphasised the centrality of north-east England in this whole debate. And that won't go away because although we are leaving the European Union there is still to be settled our future trading relationship with our biggest trading partner in the region, the European Union. There will be pressure from businesses like Nissan to have as close a relationship as almost we have now to make it as easy as possible for them to sell their cars, pressure perhaps from Conservative MPS in the region that if we are leaving a club we don't like being members of we shouldn't necessarily stick with the rules afterwards. Boris Johnson's biggest challenge is to prove these people at the vigil wrong, that Brexit will not be an historic blunder that will leave us lagging behind, that it can be coupled with an opportunity to make life better and make us wealthier in places like the north-east of England and Cumbria. The SNP's Ian Blackford says there is ""sadness and anger"" across Scotland at the UK's exit and the Scottish public will not ""stand for it"". He says the Scottish people will demand a say in their future and suggests an independence referendum will provide a path ""back into Europe"". He argues that the UK that Scotland voted to remain a part of in 2014 ""no longer exists"". Chris DoidgeBBC Radio Derby, political reporter Remainers at a vigil held outside Derby's council house have renamed themselves ""rejoiners"" now we have left the European Union. The event was held just round the corner from a Brexit bash in a local bar. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor First of all itâs a long, long period of hard bargaining
between the UK and the EU. The UK government is determined to try to get a free-trade
deal done by the end of this year but that will not be straight forward â not least
because there are so many things that have to be sorted out. But also because the EU will drive a hard bargain. Yes, both
sides say they still want to be friends and partners and respectful neighbours
and people want to do lots of business with each other. But the UK government has already acknowledged that will mean
some friction. And also, until itâs all done and dusted thereâs still uncertainty for
businesses and people around the country who want to know exactly what is next. But although there is legions of details to be worked out, many
more political controversies along the way, be in no doubt â the fundamental
question which has been hanging over the country for more than three years has
been settled. And thatâs already completely changed the political dynamic â
and therefore the dynamic in the country too. Foreign Secretary tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A few moments ago, it looks like a man tried to gatecrash the stage at the Brexit rally, catching the security detail off guard a little. After a brief kerfuffle, he was escorted off the premises.

At that point, all the speakers had left the stage but the crowd chants Nigel, Nigel, Nigel and the Brexit Party leader stages an encore.  Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played A timelapse of the fires threatening Canberra Authorities in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have declared a state of emergency as massive bushfires rage south of Canberra. It is the worst fire threat to the territory in nearly two decades, officials said. The main blaze, in the territory's south, is burning over more than 18,500 hectares. Residents in suburbs of Canberra have been urged to ""remain alert"" for potential evacuations. ""The ACT is now facing the worst bushfire threat since the devastating fires of 2003,"" Chief Minister Andrew Barr told reporters on Friday. ""There's now no higher priority for the ACT government at this time than the bushfire threat."" This video can not be played Temperatures creep above 40C for Canberra, Hobart and Melbourne The small territory, located between Sydney and Melbourne, has about 400,000 residents. In 2003, bushfires in the suburbs of Canberra killed four people, injured another 500 and destroyed or damaged 470 homes. Similar weather conditions were being recorded on Friday, authorities said. US firefighters killed in plane crash Watch: Canberra engulfed in smoke Mr Barr warned the fires ""may become uncontrollable"" as temperatures climbed to 40C and were fuelled by strong winds. He said the worst blaze was just south of the district of Tuggeranong, a 20-minute drive south of Parliament House in Canberra. He added the state of emergency - which gives extra power and resources to fire authorities - would be in place for ""as long as Canberra is at risk"". Fires have raged near the city for weeks. Last Thursday, Canberra's airport was shut down when a blaze threatened to breach its perimeter. Three US firefighters died on the same day after their aircraft crashed over a fire zone near the city, in the Snowy Mountains region. What's Australia doing to fight the bushfires? A visual guide to Australia's bushfire crisis Earlier this week, photos of bushfires in the area turning skies red were shared widely on social media. It prompted authorities to issue warnings against ""disaster tourism"", following several reports of people driving near active fire zones to take pictures. ""I want to reinforce the message to disaster tourists they're not welcome as this fire approaches,"" Mr Barr said. Since September, bushfires in Australia have killed at least 33 people and destroyed thousands of homes. More than 11 million hectares of land has been scorched.

"Struggling luxury UK carmaker Aston Martin has announced plans to raise emergency funding worth Â£500m. A consortium led by billionaire Lawrence Stroll will put in Â£182m, with the rest of the money coming from existing investors. Mr Stroll partly owns the Racing Point Formula 1 team, which will be branded Aston Martin from 2021 under the deal. The move comes hours after a board meeting held to discuss how to prop up the ailing firm. Aston Martin's best known customer is fictional spy James Bond and the company recently revealed that four of its cars will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die. Lawrence Stroll partly owns the Racing Point Formula 1 team The carmaker said its latest financial moves were aimed at strengthening its balance sheet after its ""disappointing performance"" in 2019. Mr Stroll's consortium will take a 20% stake in the company and he will become its executive chairman. As a result, Penny Hughes will be stepping down as Aston Martin's chairman once the deal is completed. It's all very well to build James Bond's company cars, but Aston Martin can't rely on a flashy brand alone. Many of its troubles can be traced to the decision to build a new factory at St Athan in South Wales, where it will produce its long-anticipated sports utility vehicle, the DBX. An ambitious move, it could have big long-term benefits for the carmaker. But in the short term, it has been struggling to generate enough cash to pay its bills, including the costs of setting up the factory. Dealers have been reducing stock rather than ordering new cars, while average selling prices have been falling, weighing on profits. Last year, the company was forced to borrow Â£120m at a steep interest rate in order to prop up its operations. It had been facing the prospect of borrowing even more. The new funding from Lawrence Stroll will give Aston Martin some much-needed stability. It now has breathing space in which to get the DBX into production, and implement a cost-cutting programme. Meanwhile the Canadian billionaire will be able to put an Aston Martin badge on his F1 cars - opening up new opportunities both to burnish the brand and to exploit its petrol-scented cachet. She said: ""The difficult trading performance in 2019 resulted in severe pressure on liquidity which has left the company with no alternative but to seek substantial additional equity financing. ""Without this, the balance sheet is not robust enough to support the operations of the group. ""Notwithstanding recent weak trading, the strength of the Aston Martin brand and our expanding portfolio of cars has allowed us to attract a strong new partner in Mr Stroll to support the turnaround of the business."" Four Aston Martins will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die Earlier this month,the 106-year-old firm issued a profit warning, saying annual earnings were expected to fall by nearly half from a year earlier. It said core retail sales - which covers sales from Aston Martin dealers to consumers - were up 12% from a year earlier. However, wholesale volumes - which covers how many cars the dealers are ordering from Aston Martin itself - were down 7% to 5,809. The company said it was expecting earnings of between Â£130m and Â£140m, well below the Â£247.3m it reported last year.

"This video can not be played 'You have to be optimistic as a fisherman' The UK government will make getting a better deal for UK fishermen one of its five key negotiating principles with the EU. It is the only industry to figure specifically in the list of negotiating priorities and is described as a ""red line"" issue. The UK's hard line is expected to run into stiff opposition from EU fleets which account for over a third of the total catch in UK waters. The UK has some of the richest fishing grounds in the world but British vessels catch less than a third of all fish caught there. UK boats land 32%, EU boats 43% and Norwegian 21%. Laws for sustainable fishing planned post-Brexit Reality bites for the fishing industry Manufacturers urge clarity on post-Brexit trade In fact, the NAFC at the University of the Highlands and Islands estimates that EU fishing boats land almost eight times more fish and shellfish (by weight) in UK waters than UK boats land from EU waters. At the end of this year the UK will become an independent coastal state with its own Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the final word on who can come in and who can't. However, with fishing making up just 0.1% of the UK economy, fishermen have been fearful that their interests would be sacrificed to achieve greater EU market access for huge industries like finance - which is nearly 70 times more economically significant. Boat skipper Andy Mcleod, who has fished out of Brixham for 35 years, summed up his hopes and fears. ""I voted to leave because I wanted more control over our waters and a better share of the [fish] quotas - my worry is that we will be used as pawns to be sacrificed for the greater good of the country."" Fishermen like Andy will be heartened by the government's hard line on fishing. However, more UK fish for UK boats means less for others. Fish merchant Ian Perkes exports 95% of fish he buys in the UK - mainly to the EU. He does not expect EU countries - particularly France - to take a cut in their catch lying down. ""The French will make it very difficult for us if we take away their fishing. They will create mayhem - blockade ports, put on tariffs. Without that market we haven't got a business."" Symbolically and politically fishing punches way above its economic weight. It speaks to our identity as an island nation and is the life blood of coastal communities. Many fit the description of the ""left behind"" parts of Britain into which Boris Johnson has promised to inject new life. Communities in France, Denmark and the Netherlands feel the same way about their own fishing fleets. The political declaration signed by the UK and the EU recognised the importance of the industry and set a specific target of getting an agreement on fishing rights by July of this year. A battle at sea, or at least over it, is coming soon.

"An anti-Brexit protest was held outside the Northern Ireland Assembly last year The UK is due to leave the European Union on Friday at 23:00 GMT. Brexit is happening just weeks after the return of devolution in Northern Ireland, following three years of political deadlock. But are the parties and officials at Stormont prepared for what comes next? There are 90 assembly members in the Northern Ireland Assembly, all with varying perspectives. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - the biggest unionist party - was originally in favour of Brexit, while the largest nationalist party - Sinn FÃ©in - opposed it. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in fought each other along Brexit battle lines during last year's general election campaign Brexit was a dividing line between them during the general election campaign - but since devolution has returned, they have had to change course. They now share power together in the Stormont executive, and will have to present a united front to No 10. Along with the smaller parties, they unanimously rejected Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and what it would mean for Northern Ireland. Last week, the assemblyagreed to withhold its consent for the government's Brexit bill- echoing the views of the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, who also voted against it. Under Mr Johnson's deal, Northern Ireland will effectively stay in the EU's single market for goods but Stormont can vote to end that arrangement. At the end of the transition period in December 2020, Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK will not. The whole of the UK will leave the customs union - but EU customs procedures will still apply on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, in order to avoid checks at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The plan has been criticised by the Stormont parties, who argue it could interfere with GB-NI trade. The deal states that four years after the end of the transition period - 2024 - the assembly will get a say on whether to approve such arrangements continuing. A straight - or simple - majority vote by the 90 assembly members (MLAs) would keep the arrangements in place for another four years. Alternatively, if the arrangements received cross-community consent, passed by most nationalists and most unionists, they would remain in place for eight years. Some unionists and loyalists have described Boris Johnson's Brexit deal as ""betrayal"" If Stormont voted to end them, there would be a two-year notice period, during which the UK and the EU would have to agree ways to protect the peace process and avoid a hard border. Some MLAs have raised concerns that giving the assembly a vote on Brexit every four years would cause more division between the parties. TheNew Decade, New Approach document,external, agreed by the Stormont parties and the British and Irish governments on 10 January 2020, makes several commitments. The British government promises ""unfettered access for Northern Ireland's businesses to the whole of the UK"" and to have it written in law for 1 January 2021. No checks on goods between NI and GB, says PM It is a claim that has been repeated by the prime minister and other cabinet ministers in recent weeks - but much will depend on the definition of ""unfettered access"". On Monday, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said new checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britainwere an ""indispensable"" consequenceof the Brexit deal. Michel Barnier delivered a lecture at Queen's University in Belfast Businesses in Northern Ireland have also expressed concernabout the possibility of some new administration, such as exit declaration forms on NI-GB trade. The government has also committed to giving Stormont ministers a role in bodies which will oversee the Northern Ireland elements of the Brexit deal, and there will be a specialised committee which will focus solely on the NI part of the agreement. The government also says it will ensure representatives from Stormont will be part of the UK delegation in any meetings that are discussing NI-specific matters, and that are also being attended by the Irish government as part of the EU's delegation. First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill will need to speak with one voice on Brexit Despite being an issue that has deeply divided Northern Ireland politics since the 2016 referendum, the recently-restored executive appears to have a new strategy on Brexit, which for many, cannot come a moment too soon. Northern Ireland had no ministers representing it throughout the Brexit negotiations, due to the absence of devolution. On Tuesday, First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill attended a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Council in Cardiff, appearing to speak as one. They recognise their parties look at Brexit through different lenses but want to ensure its outworkings do not impact Northern Ireland negatively. The Executive Office is setting up a sub-committee to oversee how Brexit is managed. A Stormont source told BBC News NI the committee was due to meet for the first time on Tuesday.

Ms O'Brien, from Bojewyan Stennack in Cornwall, rowed almost 3,000 miles (4,800km) of Atlantic Ocean with her daughter Bird Watts, 32, from Mevagissey in Cornwall, and their friend Claire Allinson, 45, from Exmouth, Devon. The trio rowed in pairs for four-hour shifts, then had two hours of rest, on a constant cycle for the entirety of the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge. Speaking to race organisers,externalafter they confirmed both records at the finish line in Antigua, Ms O'Brien said: ""I'm relieved to be here, but I kind of wish I was still out there, too. I absolutely loved it."" The pharmacy dispenser added that she is already making plans to row the Pacific. ""Give me a week to have a shower and some clean clothes,"" she joked. (L-R) Bird Watts, Claire Allinson and Mo O'Brien reached the finish line after 49 days, 13 hours and 49 minutes. Rowers lose an average of nearly two stone (12kg) during the 3,000-mile crossing Speaking on the phone to the BBC at the finish line in Antigua, Ms O'Brien said her favourite part of the challenge was rowing at night. ""The racing and the wind and the sea... it felt like you were going at about 100 miles an hour. I loved that feeling, the freedom - almost feeling like you're a part of the sea. It sounds corny, I know, but I've never experienced that before,"" she said. She added that the stars at night were ""magical"" and looked like ""somebody had opened a pot of glitter and scattered it across the sky"". Other highlights for the team included seeing wildlife such as orcas and humpback whales, which Ms Allinson described as ""absolutely breathtaking"". ""That's the kind of thing that you see on David Attenborough - it's not something you expect to see [yourself],"" she said. Ms Watts - who said it felt ""awesome but very wobbly"" to be back on dry land - said the only home comforts the crew members craved was a shower. In addition to the seasickness, being thrown around by huge waves, hit by flying fish and battling extreme sleep deprivation, Ms O'Brien said it had been ""very much a learning curve"" for the crew to manage her deafness. Ms Watts said her mother's profound deafness was ""a bit of a nightmare"" as rowers ""rely a lot on your hearing"". Ms O'Brien usually uses lip-reading to communicate, but rowers do not face each other in the boat, so she could not have a conversation while at the oars. Ms Watts, a newly-qualified radiographer, said: ""If we're going over in a storm and our boat is going to capsize, you would [usually] shout through to people in the air-tight cabin to stay inside. But you can't communicate anything like that with mum. ""We just do our best. We have certain hand signals that mean certain things. And for example, if she's in the cabin in stormy weather, she doesn't come out unless we tell her."" ""Every challenge you might think of that you might encounter on a boat, we also have to think how to overcome for someone who can't hear,"" Ms Watts added. The trio set off from La Gomera in the Canary Islands on 12 December 2019 Linda Whittaker (second from left) withdrew from the challenge shortly before it began due to extreme seasickness - meaning more rowing for the remaining three crew members In a blog post,external, Ms O'Brien said the team needed ""humour in abundance"" to complete the challenge, adding: ""I often mishear things and respond with ridiculous answers although I'm not sure which is funnier - my nonsense or the recipient's face."" Ms O'Brien said she had wanted to mark turning 60 by doing ""something bigger, something more challenging"" than other endurance events she has taken part in, such as a marathon and a charity cycle in Kenya. The mother-of-two was inspired to do the challenge after reading a book aboutfour Yorkshire women who became the oldest all-female crew to make the crossing. Ms O'Brien relies on lip-reading to communicate - and can therefore sometimes miss instructions Ms O'Brien was born with nerve deafness but grew up undiagnosed - her parents believed she was just ""painfully shy"". She said deafness can be ""very isolating"". ""Deaf people withdraw from life,"" she added. ""There are lots of things that I know that I stopped myself doing, because it was so difficult."" Deaf children 'fall behind at school' How radio aids helped my deaf son Brothers become fastest trio to row the Atlantic Ms O'Brien struggled to cope with NHS hearing aids when she eventually got them at about the age of 30. They boosted her hearing to 30% of what most people can hear, but with disorientating background noise. But then one of the crew's sponsors, ReSound, shared cutting-edge equipment with her, including a microphone which can be tuned into her hearing aid via Bluetooth. Ms O'Brien uses an app on her phone so that what she wants to hear - whether it be a conversation, birdsong, or music - is clearly separated from background noise. This meant she could hear instructors and pass mandatory courses to take part in the Atlantic row - and could hear her fellow rowers. Ms O'Brien said she ""cried all night"" when she lost her phone during the challenge, because the hearing aids stopped working properly. ""My immediate thought was 'I can no longer hear at all and that's a problem for me and the rest of the crew, for safety reasons',"" she said. ReSound helped her to reconnect after a couple of days. Ms O'Brien says she has become more sociable in the last 18 months, with the help of an innovative new hearing aid Ms O'Brien, who has been an amateur rower for 20 years, said her ""crack on, just do it"" mentality has helped her to overcome difficulties. ""The fact that my mum died when she was 56, I feel very aware that time goes so quickly and we really need to do things while we can,"" she said. ""There's something in me that just says don't do the ordinary, don't go to work every day, pay your mortgage, go home, watch a bit of telly, or whatever your routine is."" The crew say they're ""ordinary women achieving the extraordinary"" Guinness World Records does not award records in relation to disabilities, but race organisers Atlantic Campaigns - who confirm and validate their own records - said Ms O'Brien is the first deaf person to row an ocean. The Ocean Rowing Society - which keeps a database of all ocean rows - said as of 14 January, 1,083 people had rowed an ocean, including about 440 crews that have crossed the Atlantic from east to west. The British Deaf Association congratulated Ms O'Brien on Friday, with a spokesperson saying: ""Mo is an inspiration to many and is an example of what deaf people can achieve."" Ms O'Brien said she hopes she can encourage the Deaf Association to enter an all-deaf crew into the challenge. ""I just feel it's showing people that they can do things... whatever disability you've got.""

"This video can not be played 'You have to be optimistic as a fisherman' The UK government will make getting a better deal for UK fishermen one of its five key negotiating principles with the EU. It is the only industry to figure specifically in the list of negotiating priorities and is described as a ""red line"" issue. The UK's hard line is expected to run into stiff opposition from EU fleets which account for over a third of the total catch in UK waters. The UK has some of the richest fishing grounds in the world but British vessels catch less than a third of all fish caught there. UK boats land 32%, EU boats 43% and Norwegian 21%. Laws for sustainable fishing planned post-Brexit Reality bites for the fishing industry Manufacturers urge clarity on post-Brexit trade In fact, the NAFC at the University of the Highlands and Islands estimates that EU fishing boats land almost eight times more fish and shellfish (by weight) in UK waters than UK boats land from EU waters. At the end of this year the UK will become an independent coastal state with its own Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the final word on who can come in and who can't. However, with fishing making up just 0.1% of the UK economy, fishermen have been fearful that their interests would be sacrificed to achieve greater EU market access for huge industries like finance - which is nearly 70 times more economically significant. Boat skipper Andy Mcleod, who has fished out of Brixham for 35 years, summed up his hopes and fears. ""I voted to leave because I wanted more control over our waters and a better share of the [fish] quotas - my worry is that we will be used as pawns to be sacrificed for the greater good of the country."" Fishermen like Andy will be heartened by the government's hard line on fishing. However, more UK fish for UK boats means less for others. Fish merchant Ian Perkes exports 95% of fish he buys in the UK - mainly to the EU. He does not expect EU countries - particularly France - to take a cut in their catch lying down. ""The French will make it very difficult for us if we take away their fishing. They will create mayhem - blockade ports, put on tariffs. Without that market we haven't got a business."" Symbolically and politically fishing punches way above its economic weight. It speaks to our identity as an island nation and is the life blood of coastal communities. Many fit the description of the ""left behind"" parts of Britain into which Boris Johnson has promised to inject new life. Communities in France, Denmark and the Netherlands feel the same way about their own fishing fleets. The political declaration signed by the UK and the EU recognised the importance of the industry and set a specific target of getting an agreement on fishing rights by July of this year. A battle at sea, or at least over it, is coming soon.

"A major investor in leading e-cigarette-maker Juul has seen its stake in the company drop by more than two-thirds. Tobacco giant Altria Group has blamed the $8.5bn (Â£6.5bn) fall in value on rising legal and regulatory threats. Having paid $12.8bn for a 35% stake in Juul in 2018, it revealed a $4.1bn  write-down to investors on Thursday. Altria chief Howard Willard said he was ""highly disappointed"" with the lower valuation. The firm had already announced a $4.5bn hit last year. Altria paid what was considered a high price for its stake in Juul, with a deal that valued the firm more than double what previous investors had. But Altria had defended its decision, saying it was buying into Juul's explosive growth, while traditional smoking was on the decline. In 2018, Juul, which remains privately owned, reported sales of more than $1bn, up from $200m in the prior year. And analysts expected sales to top $3bn last year. But since Altria's purchase of a stake in Juul, there has been a public backlash against e-cigarettes, fuelled in part by a reported rise in teen vaping. US announces countrywide ban on flavoured e-cigs Juul faces mounting state lawsuits in US How many people vape? This month, the US health regulator announced it would ban fruit-flavoured pods, which had been among Juul's most popular products. The move followed similar measures in many US states. Other countries have also tightened rules. Juul also faces criminal investigations in the US over its marketing practices. In September, its chief executive stepped down, and was replaced by a former Altria executive. Altria, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, said it had re-worked its agreement with Juul and will stop providing services including logistics, distribution and access to retail shelf space to Juul. It will continue to help Juul with regulatory services including the submission of its products, which contain nicotine, for approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Altria also said it does not expect to receive earnings contributions from Juul over the next three years. The firm's shares sank by more than 6%, after the write-down pushed the firm to a fourth quarter loss of $1.81bn, compared to a profit $1.25bn a year earlier.

"Car manufacturers are worried The UK's biggest manufacturing lobby groups are calling for more clarity as efforts to establish a new post-Brexit trading relationship gather pace. Yesterday, ahead of Britain's departure from the EU on Friday, representatives of business organisations met the senior cabinet minister Michael Gove to express their concerns. ""It's clear that government are serious about engaging with industry,"" said the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, Ian Wright. ""It was constructive and encouraging,"" said another participant in the meeting, ""but the detail is still being established."" So what has the government said it wants? ""We want to have as close as possible a relationship with the EU - and the approach we want to take is built on the relationship that they have with Canada,"" Mr Gove told the BBC. And Boris Johnson has talked repeatedly about getting a ""zero tariff, zero quota"" trade deal agreed before the end of the year, when the post-Brexit transition period runs out. That is certainly possible, but it's a very tight schedule. ""I don't know if it's doable, but we're up for it,"" said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which lobbies for the car industry. ""We need to be up for it, we can't afford to get to the end of this year and not have a trade deal,"" he insisted. ""That would be a major threat to our future here in the UK."" Manufacturing may not be the economic force it once was across the UK, but it still employs several million people. Now the UK's seamless trading relationship with the rest of the Europe is about to change, and that's why many industry leaders are a little nervous. While a ""zero tariff, zero quota"" deal sounds good, it is the bare minimum many manufacturers require. Will the prime minister secure a good deal for food manufacturers? ""What we have now is exclusion from a whole range of checks,"" said Mr Wright, ""on animal health, on customs, checks on lorry drivers and so on. ""Behind a basic 'zero tariff, zero quota' deal would be a whole load of new friction that would add cost, delay and difficulty in doing business."" There are several issues to consider. The EU is insisting that the UK sign up to strict rules on fair competition to prevent its companies undercutting their European rivals. UK companies see post-election boost Tumble in UK car output 'a grave concern' What is a level playing field? ""Without a level playing field on environment, labour, taxation and state aid,"" said the European Commission President, Ursula Von Der Leyen, in a recent speech in London, ""you cannot have the highest quality access to the world's largest single market."" Participants in the meeting with Michael Gove also raised concerns about what's known as ""rules of origin"". It means companies have to prove that the components or ingredients in their product - flour in a loaf of bread for example - actually come from the customs territory that is doing the exporting. ""There's a whole world of pain for the exporter and the retailer,"" said Mr Wright, ""if those matters are not resolved, and resolved as close as possible to the current arrangements."" Finally there's the question of what might happen to the baffling array of rules and regulations that protect product standards. ""There's the equivalent of about five phone books worth of rules that determine how you make a car,"" Mike Hawes explained. ""If you start changing those rules you have to make that car to a different recipe."" That adds cost, which feeds through into price and makes products less competitive. So, which rules will the UK choose to maintain, and which ones might it seek to change? It is a key question. The government says the UK will not be a rule-taker, and there will be no wholesale alignment with the EU. On the other hand, the UK will not diverge from EU rules just for the sake of it. Industry has been told it will need to adjust to a new reality. ""At the moment,"" said Nicole Sykes, who covers EU negotiations for the Confederation of British Industry, ""businesses have one set of rules to follow, one set of tests, and one set of enforcers of the rules to deal with, when they trade with the EU."" If they are suddenly faced with two sets of rules and tests, that creates a problem. ""I spoke to one firm that said if they have to deal with the same kind of structure that Canada does, they are thinking about Â£1,500 on every machine they sell,"" Ms Sykes added. ""That's about 10% of what they sell the machine for."" ""Those are huge costs that will affect how they will be able to grow in the future."" The arrival of a government with a clear majority, after years of dither, has certainly given business a lift. And they're hoping that a big dollop of prime ministerial optimism will get trade talks off to a good start. Boris Johnson will make a speech on the UK's new trade priorities on Monday. But alongside optimism, the government needs to make some tough choices, and industry is impatient to find out what those choices are going to be.

"What will change? Well, everything and nothing. Today, the UK is embarking on a totally different course. We are unplugging from the legal and political infrastructure that we have been part of for four decades. Do not underestimate how big a step it is. The general election result confirmed the decision that the UK made in 2016 narrowly, to leave the European Union. That creates opportunity and extra freedoms. Laws decided in our Parliament will be supreme. One of the fundamental concepts of the EU - citizens being able to travel, to work and live anywhere in the bloc without restrictions - won't apply any more, meaning that the UK will set the terms for people who want to come from all over the world to live here. We will no longer be part of a club that might squabble amongst itself about big decisions, but is legally committed to sticking together, more at liberty to go our own way. Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't Our departure makes for added risk too. We are taking a huge step without clarity about exactly what is next. Without doubt, leaving creates disruption for much of the economy, and the consensus among number crunchers is that the country's wealth will grow more slowly than if we were staying in. Of course, the government wants to prove that it will be worth it in time, that there will be more winners than losers. That won't be straightforward, and politicians will argue about it for decades. Nor is it easy to see precisely how the UK's place in the world will evolve. We won't have a seat at the EU table any more, but are still one of the world's biggest economies, with a big diplomatic presence, a seat at the table. One voice is easier to ignore than 27. But if that voice is credible, nimble and persuasive, it could have a no doubt different, but significant force. At one minute past 11 on Friday though, in practical ways we can easily feel, not very much will be different. Red, white and blue lights will dance over Whitehall. The Tories' Brexit countdown clock will finally reach zero. One of those who campaigned most fervently to leave the EU told me he was planning to stay up through the night to watch the dawn -  ""It will only happen once,"" they said. But while we will be technically out of the European Union in pragmatic ways, we'll be in the departure lounge, rather than en route to a clearly different future. Until the end of the year UK businesses, and the government, will have to abide by the EU's rules, and will we continue paying handsomely into the budget. The immediate difference in that regard, is that we won't be part of making the decisions. A white-knuckle ride of negotiations and deal making over trade, security, and countless other issues lies ahead. Brexit: Johnson to hail 'dawn of a new era' Lib Dems plea to unite in fight for soft Brexit But after the drama and the hyperspeed of events in the last few years, our political landscape has already changed dramatically. The fundamental question of whether we stay, or leave, has been settled. Westminster's agonies over that dilemma were a big part of securing a thumping Conservative majority. And as a result, gone are the days, for now, when it wasn't clear if the government was going to get its way in the House of Commons. That is not the same as winning arguments. But winning votes is what being in power is all about. And for the foreseeable future we have a government that will be able to do that without worrying too much. The status quo will persist in some senses during the transition period, but the big question has been settled, the decision to change won't be unpicked, even though what it will bring precisely can't yet be clear. And that's already changed Westminster so much. The Tory Party needs something new to argue about. The 40 year internal war that spilled out into a vote that will change all of our lives is over, for now. The political dynamic has already changed, and will change perhaps faster than we imagine. Michael Govetold us this weekthat ""I can't blame Europe,"" as a politician, there would be no more 'hiding from the voters.' For the Tories in particular, there will be no convenient bogeyman. Will this mean that UK politicians change? I wonder if they, and we, have really begun yet to understand the extent of the change that might unfold. When I started working in and around Westminster nearly 20 years ago, the question of Europe was important, but one for political hobbyists. There were those who cared, cared very much, but it was low on the list for many MPs, let alone members of the public. In the early 2000s, anyone predicting that our membership of the EU would have been the defining issue of politics for four years might have been dismissed as a crackpot. Even in 2015, a senior member of the then government told me without any remote hesitation, the chances of us voting to leave the EU were no higher than one in five. Buildings on the Grand Place in Brussels are illuminated with the colours of the British flag in an event marking the UK's departure from the EU And yet here we are, on the edge of a moment that will without question, affect all of our lives, and the generations that will come next. The roots, risks and opportunities of Brexit, we've discussed on these pages many times are of course still hotly disputed. And of course, we won't have a parallel universe to compare. In the coming years, I have no doubt, there will be plenty of 'what if', lots of 'if onlys'. It's perfectly likely that in decades and decades, historians will still argue over whether, as a country, we did the right thing. But Brexit, with all its possibilities, and potential pitfalls, is now here. And if anything, perhaps this is a moment to remember that for good, or for ill, the crosses we make in the box, the decisions we make in the privacy of the polling booth, can and do change the course of our country.

"Now that the UK has formally left the European Union, it immediately enters an 11-month transition period. During the transition the UK will continue to obey EU rules and pay money to the EU. Most things will stay the same but there will be some changes: The Brexit Party won the most UK seats in the May 2019 European elections Familiar faces such as Nigel Farage and Ann Widdecombe are among the UK's 73 MEPs who will automatically lose their seats in the European Parliament. That's because, at the moment of Brexit, the UK will leave all of the EU's political institutions and agencies. However, in addition to the UK following EU rules during the transition period, the European Court of Justice will continue to have the final say over legal disputes. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will have to be specially invited if he wants to join other leaders at EU Council summits in the future. British ministers will also no longer attend regular EU meetings that decide things such as fishing limits. The UK will be able to start talking to countries around the world about setting new rules for buying and selling goods and services. It has not been allowed to hold formal trade negotiations with countries like the US and Australia while it remained an EU member. Brexit supporters argue that having the freedom to set its own trade policy will boost the UK's economy. There's also a lot to be discussed with the EU. Agreeing a UK-EU trade deal is a top priority, so extra charges on goods and other trade barriers aren't needed when the transition ends. If any trade deals are reached, they won't be able to start until the transition period ends. Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Blue passports were replaced in 1988 with the burgundy design Blue passports will be making a return, more than 30 years after they were replaced by the current burgundy design. Announcing the change in 2017, then Immigration Minister, Brandon Lewis, praised thereturn to the ""iconic"" blue-and-gold design, first used in 1921. The new colour will be phased in over a number of months, with all new passports issued in blue by the middle of the year. Existing burgundy passports will continueto be valid. The coins had to be re-made after Brexit was delayed About three million commemorative 50p Brexit coins bearing the date ""31 January"" and the inscription: ""Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"", will enter circulation on Friday. Thecoin has received a mixed reaction,with some Remain supporters saying they will refuse to accept it. The government had planned to introduce a similar coin on 31 October, the date Brexit was previously meant to happen. However, those coins had to be melted down and recycled after the deadline was extended. The team that handled the UK-EU negotiations andno-deal preparationswill disband on Brexit day. The Department for Exiting the European Union was set up by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2016. For the upcoming talks, the UK's negotiating team will be based in Downing Street. It won't be possible for some suspected criminals to be brought back to the UK if they flee to Germany. Germany's constitution does not allow its citizens to be extradited, unless it's to another EU country. ""This exception cannot apply any more after the UK has left EU,"" a spokesman from the German Federal Ministry of Justice told BBC News. It's unclear if the same restrictions will apply to other countries. Slovenia, for example, says the situation is complicated, while the European Commission was unable to provide comment. The UK Home Office says the European Arrest Warrant will continue to apply during the transition period. (That means Germany will be able to extradite non-German citizens.) However, it adds that if a country's laws prevent extradition to the UK it ""will be expected to take over the trial or sentence of the person concerned"". A really simple guide to Brexit What is the transition period? Because thetransition periodbegins immediately after Brexit, the vast majority of other things remain the same - at least until 31 December 2020 including: UK nationals will still be treated the same as EU nationals during the transition Flights, boats and trains will operate as usual. When it comes to passport control, during the transition period, UK nationals will still be allowed to queue in the areas reserved for EU arrivals only. As long as they are valid, these will continue to be accepted. Driving after Brexit: What you need to know EHICs will still be valid during the transition These are the cards that provide UK nationals with state-provided medical treatment in case of illness or accident. They can be used in any EU country (as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and will continue to be valid during the transition period. Will the EHIC still be valid after Brexit? Freedom of movement will continue to apply during the transition, so UK nationals will still be able to live and work in the EU as they currently do. The same applies for EU nationals wanting to live and work in the UK. UK nationals living in the EU will continue to receive their state pension and will also receive the annual increase. How will Brexit affect UK pensioners in Europe? The UK will continue to pay into the EU budget during the transition. This means existing schemes, paid for by EU grants, will continue to be funded. UK-EU trade will continue without any extra charges or checks being introduced.
