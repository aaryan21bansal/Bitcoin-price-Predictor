"This video can not be played Sir David told Prince William it was ""difficult to overstate"" the threat of climate change Sir David Attenborough has told Prince William that people have never been more ""out of touch"" with the natural world than they are today. In an interview with the prince at the World Economic Forum, the naturalist warned: ""We can wreck it with ease, we can wreck it without even noticing."" Sir David said people must care, respect and revere the natural world. Heeding his words, the prince said: ""Work to save the planet is probably going to largely happen on our watch"". Sir David, 92, said: ""When I started 60 years ago in the mid-50s, to be truthful, I don't think there was anybody who thought that there was a danger that we might annihilate part of the natural world."" In his early career, he said, simply showing people a new animal on television would astound them. Even then, he added: ""Television in Britain in the 50s was only seen by a few million people in southern England."" Climate change 'greatest threat', Attenborough says Attenborough takes seat at climate talks Full coverage of Davos 2019,external Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, the Blue Planet and Dynasties narrator said: ""Now we can go everywhere, we can go into the bottom of the sea, we can go into space, we can use drones, we can use helicopters, we can use macroworlds, we can speed things up, we can slow things down, we can film in the darkness - and so the natural world has never been exposed to this degree before."" His new series, Our Planet, due to air on Netflix, could reach 150 million people immediately, he said, ""and go on being seen - by word of mouth"". Despite this, he said, with more people than ever living in towns, ""the paradox (is) that there has never been a time when more people are out of touch with the natural world than there's now"". He warned: ""It's not just a question of beauty or interest or wonder, it's the essential ingredient, essential part of human life is a healthy planet. ""We are in the danger of wrecking that"". He said that for a very long time people have viewed the natural world in opposition to the urban world. ""It is not, we are all one world,"" he said, adding that global leaders are beginning to see that everything we do has implications. He said: ""That fundamental, beautiful fact is now being recognised."" Sir David was given a Crystal Award at the forum on Monday for his leadership in environmental stewardship In his interview with the Duke of Cambridge, Sir David said it was ""difficult to overstate"" the climate change crisis. He added: ""We are now so numerous, so powerful, so all pervasive, the mechanisms we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening that we can exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it. ""We have now to be really aware of the dangers that we are doing. ""And we already know that of course the plastics problem in the seas is wreaking appalling damage on marine life - the extent of which we don't yet fully know."" Last year, Sir David said he was ""astonished"" by the response toBlue Planet II, which raised the issue of single-use plastics and the damage they were doing to the world's oceans. Sir David was given a Crystal Award at the forum on Monday for his leadership in environmental stewardship. Accepting the award, the veteran broadcaster urged leaders to come up with ""practical solutions"". He told the prince: ""The point is that we have this option ahead of us - we have to take the option to protect the natural worldâ¦ that's where the future lies. ""There's a source of great optimism there, we have the knowledge, we have the power, to live in harmony with that natural world"". Prince William has previously described Sir David as having ""the single most important impact in my conservation thinking"". Introducing Sir David, he said it was a ""personal treat"" to interview the broadcaster. In a BBC tribute programme marking Sir David's 90th birthday in 2016, the duke called him a ""national treasure"". He added: ""I used to love, and I still do, but when I was a young boy, used to love turning on the television and watching David's programmes and really feeling like I was back out in Africa or I was learning about something magical and almost out of this planet."" The duke said: ""There is something very reassuring about seeing David Attenborough on BBC One doing his documentaries. It is part of the national psyche now."" The Queen and Sir David came together last year for an ITV documentary Sir David turned 90 in the same year as the Queen, andpaid his own tributeat her official birthday celebrations at St Paul's Cathedral. They also took part in an ITV documentary last year which looked at the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy project. Sir David and the Queen, who were born just weeks apart, chuckled over a forlorn-looking tree in the Buckingham Palace grounds which the Queen suggested had been ""sat on"" at a garden party. Attenborough 'astonished' by Blue Planet impact Climate change: explained in 90 seconds When Sir David suggested climate change might lead to ""all kinds of different trees growing here in another 50 years"", the Queen quipped: ""It might easily be, yes. I won't be here though."" Prince William, who is patron of the Tusk conservation charity, has in the past warned over the impact of the ivory trade and wildlife trafficking. In 2016, he urged the UK government to push ahead with atotal ban on the ivory trade in a bid to protect elephants. He also voiced concerns that the African elephant may have disappeared from the wild by the time his daughter Princess Charlotte is 25.

"Wayne Bass says his life was ruined after contracting the disease At least 90 British military personnel have been diagnosed with Q fever after serving in Helmand, Afghanistan, a court has heard. A former soldier is suing the Ministry of Defence (MoD)after catching the disease while serving there in 2011/12. Wayne Bass says the Army should have provided antibiotics to protect him from the disease. The MoD denies that any action could have been taken to avoid him contracting Q fever. Mr Bass, formerly a private serving with 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment, says his life was ruined after contracting the disease, which left him suffering nerve pain and unable to work. The five-day trial is the first to test the MoD's duty to protect against Q fever, his lawyers say. Wayne Bass, as a young soldier and more recently Humans can catch Q fever by breathing in dust from the faeces of infected farm animals. During his tour, lawyers for Mr Bass said he was in contact with goats and sheep and ""was often required to take cover and jump through ditches and crawl along the ground - coming into contact with animal products and excrement"". Lt Col Mark Bailey, a consultant in infectious diseases and tropical medicine and a national expert in Q fever, told the trial on Tuesday that 90 military and 10 civilian cases of the disease had been referred to him. He confirmed the military cases had all served in Helmand and had ""built up from 2008"". Col Bailey said there had been no new cases from Afghanistan since 2014, although there were occasionally military cases from other locations, including Cyprus. He said there had been no UK deaths in his group, although one British soldier ""very, very nearly died"" as a result of the disease and subsequent complications. Wayne Bass served in Helmand in 2011 Mr Bass, 34, was medically discharged from the Army in 2014 because of his Q fever and chronic fatigue symptoms. His case is that the MoD should have considered using doxycycline, an antibiotic used to treat Q fever, as an anti-malarial drug. But the MoD says it would not have been reasonable to use doxycycline due to its side-effects and because it would have compromised the effect of anti-malarial drugs given to troops. Gp Cpt Andrew Green, director of infection prevention and control at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, told the court that among International Security Assistance Force troops there were 46 confirmed cases of malaria in 2010, but none among British personnel. Gp Capt Green said most were US personnel who were taking doxycycline, showing the drug was ""failing to prevent malaria"". He said drugs are no longer advised for the prevention of malaria in Afghanistan and there is a ""bite avoidance"" approach"" for UK troops currently deployed there.

Full Oscars news and analysis Analysis by BBC Reality Check It's been a pretty good year for diversity in Oscar nominations by the standards of the last decade. In the four acting categories, there were five nominees from ethnic minorities (out of 20 possible nominations) - second only to the seven nominees in 2017. There are also two best director nominees from ethnic minorities in Spike Lee and Alfonso Cuaron, the first time that has happened since 2014. But still no sign of gender balance in the directing category - all five nominees this year are men. There have only been two female nominees for best director in the last decade: Greta Gerwig, for Lady Bird last year, and Kathryn Bigelow, who won the Oscar for the Hurt Locker in 2010.

"Cafe chain Patisserie Valerie has collapsed into administration after the failure of rescue talks with banks. Administrators KPMG will close 70 outlets immediately, while the remaining 121 will continue trading in the hope of finding a buyer. KPMG said there would be ""significant"" redundancies. The BBC understands up to 900 of the 3,000 staff may go. In October, Patisserie Valerie uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"". The company said in a statement,externalthat it did not have enough money to meet its debts. The biggest shareholder and chairman, entrepreneur Luke Johnson, had been in talks to extend a cash lifeline from HSBC and Barclays. Closure notices have already appeared in some outlets Mr Johnson has personally extended an unsecured, interest-free loan of Â£3m to help ensure that the January wages are paid to all staff working in the business. ""This loan will also assist the administrators in trading as many profitable stores as possible while a sale process is undertaken,""the company said in a separate statement,external. Patisserie Valerie seeks bank lifeline Scandal worse than thought Cafe chain's auditor faces probe In addition to Patisserie Valerie, the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. Finance director Chris Marsh was arrested after having been suspended by the company when the financial irregularities were uncovered. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton. The first cafe was opened on Frith Street in London's Soho district in 1926 In 1987 the Scalzo family bought the Old Compton Street store and ran the business In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners bought a majority stake when it had eight stores. Patisserie Valerie was floated on the AIM stock market, for smaller companies, in 2014 KPMG's administrators Blair Nimmo and David Costley-Wood said about 121 stores would continue to trade while a buyer is sought. They said: ""Our intention is to continue trading across the profitable stores, as collectively, the brands have a strong presence on the high street and have proven very popular with consumers. At the same time, we will be seeking a buyer for the business and are hopeful of a good level of interest. ""Unfortunately, however, we have had to take the difficult decision to close 70 stores resulting in a significant number of redundancies. We will be working with those affected employees, providing all support and assistance they need."" Within hours of the administration announcement, closure notices began appearing in some outlets. Last week, Patisserie Valerie confirmed it had found ""extensive"" misstatement of its accounts and ""very significant manipulation of the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts"". This includes thousands of false entries in its ledgers,the company said in a statement,external. Profits and cash flow had been overstated and were ""materially below"" figures announced in October. Business Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves says it ""raises grave corporate governance concerns"" Patisserie Valerie almost ceased trading last year after the discovery of the black hole in the accounts. However, a rescue plan was passed by shareholders in November, resulting in the issue of Â£15m worth of new shares. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the administration was bad news for shareholders. ""Any dim hope investors had of recovering any value from shares they bought in good faith has now been extinguished,"" he said. ""It's one thing to see a company's shares wiped out by poor trading conditions, or even bad management decisions, it's quite another to see your investment disappear as a result of fraudulent activity,"" he added. MP Rachel Reeves, chairwoman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said the administration ""raises grave corporate governance concerns"". After previous corporate collapses, her committee began looking into the future of auditing in the UK. She said the Patisserie Valerie affair would form part of the inquiries.

""I cannot express how disgusted and upset I am that this so-called film has been made and now nominated for an Oscar,"" Denise Fergus tweeted.

Speaking to BBC News before James's family made their views known, Lambe said: ""I wouldn't expect them to be comfortable with a film which humanises the boys but I do hope they understand the reason it was made, and it certainly wasn't to bring any more grief to them. ""The reason the film was made was to try and offer more of an understanding as to how these two 10-year-old boys could have committed such a horrific crime because I think if we don't understand the cause of it, it's likely that something similar will happen again in the future."" In a statement released after Mrs Fergus first spoke out, Lambe said: ""I have enormous sympathy for the Bulger family and I am extremely sorry for any upset the film may have caused them. With hindsight, I am sorry I didn't make Mrs Fergus aware of the film."" He added: ""The film was not made for financial gain and nobody involved in the making of the film intends to profit from it.""

He used his speech to pay tribute to the BBC, saying he had ""been a fan of it all my life"". ""It's one of the greatest institutions in the world and the existence of the BBC is vital for our national life,"" he went on. ""However much it is threatened by Netflix and other channels, it still holds a place in the heart of the British people."" The cast of Emmerdale celebrate their serial drama award win The battle of the soaps is always a big one at the NTAs and this year was no different. James Moore provided a touching moment in the show as he accepted his award for best newcomer for his role as Ryan Stocks in Emmerdale. The actor, who has ataxic cerebral palsy, told the audience that winning his award ""shows the progression that we needed in this day and age"". ""If you would have told me a year ago that I'd be here now, I'd have never believed it,"" he went on. Danny Dyer took home the award for serial drama performance, while Emmerdale won the coveted serial drama prize for the third year in a row. 2018 was a big year for the Dales asKim Tate made her returnafter nearly 20 years off the screen, causing more drama as she reclaimed her crown as ultimate soap baddie. Appearing on stage, Emmerdale's Isabel Hodgins said: ""Emmerdale is an amazing place to work and is full of such hardworking people. ""Thank you so much to the audience... your support is incredible. It is an amazing way to start 2019.""

"This video can not be played Jeane Freeman: ""I know I speak for the whole chamber when I say for both families our thoughts and sympathies go to them."" An infection linked to pigeon droppings was a ""contributing factor"" in the death of a child at a Glasgow hospital, it has been confirmed. Scotland's health secretary ordered a review of the design of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital after the deaths of two patients. The hospital has put infection control measures in place, and officials insist it is safe for patients and visitors. Jeane Freeman said there was an ""absolute focus on patient safety"". At the weekend, it emerged thattwo patients who had died at the hospital had contracted a cryptococcal fungal infectionwhich is linked to pigeon droppings. Ms Freeman said one of the patients was elderly and had died from an unrelated cause, but that the infection had been a ""contributing factor"" in the death of a child. The likely source of the infection has been traced to a 12th floor room containing machinery, which is not open to the public. Ms Freeman said traces of excrement had been found in the room, where there was a small break in the wall which was ""invisible to the naked eye"". The health risks of pigeon droppings The troubled past of the QEUH Look back on Jeane Freeman's Holyrood appearance The health secretary spoke to the chief executive of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and senior clinical staff to seek reassurance for patients at the hospital. She told MSPs: ""In November, the bacteria cryptococcus was identified in one patient. That patient was discharged for palliative care and sadly subsequently died in late December - but cryptococcus was not a contributing factor in their death. ""In December, a post mortem of a child who had passed away confirmed that cryptococcus was both present and contributing factor in their death. ""I know I speak for the whole chamber when I say to both families that our thoughts and sympathies go to them."" Ms Freeman also revealed in her Holyrood statement that the hospital was also investigating a separate, ""totally unconnected"" infection, after two patients tested positive for a different fungal organism. A water leak has been identified as the ""likely source"", but the health board said ""other investigations continue"". NHSGGC said an investigation is under way and a control measures have been put in place The identification of two cases acted as the trigger for additional infection control measures at the hospital, including antifungal treatment for potentially vulnerable patients. The health secretary said NHSGGC had kept patients and their families updated on an ongoing basis and would ensure they had the opportunity to discuss concerns with the senior clinical team. Portable HEPA air filter units have been installed in specific areas as an additional precaution. There have been no further cases reported. Ms Freeman said a review of the hospital's design and construction would take into account ""a number of issues"" from recent years. She said: ""There are two strands to this. The first is to deal with the current infection, which the board has done thoroughly, they've taken all the measures they should take. ""The other is the building itself. We need to be absolutely sure about the current state of this infrastructure - what do we need to fix, how has that arisen, and what are the lessons for our build elsewhere in the health service. ""That may be in aspects of the design that we weren't aware of at the time, it might be in aspects of the commissioning, it might be maintenance, or maybe a combination of all of those. ""That work has already been scoped out, and towards the end of this week I will agree with the board what external independent advice they will bring in to ensure that work is taken forward and that I'm assured that we do that as thoroughly and quickly as we possibly can."" Multiplex, the building firm which worked on the design and construction of the hospital, said it had not been contacted about the review but ""will of course assist with the Queen Elizabeth project team if we are requested to do so"". Jason Leitch from NHS Scotland insisted that ""this hospital is safe"" Prof Jason Leitch, NHS Scotland's national clinical director for healthcare quality and strategy, said he was ""assured that this hospital is safe today"". He said: ""That doesn't mean there aren't issues around the building that need reviewed and looked into, both for this building and to learn for Scotland. ""But I can assure the families who are coming in tomorrow for chemotherapy or coming in this week for bone marrow transplants, that this hospital is safe."" Scottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells, who represents Glasgow, said this was ""simply not the kind of scenario that should be unfolding in Scotland in the 21st century, and absolutely not at such an expensive and newly-built facility"". And Labour's Monica Lennon said there had been a ""laundry list of problem which should have set alarm bells ringing at any hospital, never mind Scotland's flagship hospital"". On Sunday, former health secretaryAlex Neil called for an inquiry into the deathsas it emerged concerns were raised in December. Mr Neil told BBC Scotland: ""I think there has to be an outside inquiry by experts to find why this happened in the first place, secondly how it has been handled by the health board and, thirdly, what precautions need to be taken for the future.""

"The singer has several previous convictions for violence US singer Chris Brown has been released without charge in Paris after being questioned on suspicion of rape, French police say. An investigation into the alleged incident is continuing, the Paris prosecutor's office said. The star and two other men were arrested on Monday after a 24-year-old woman alleged she was assaulted in a hotel in the city earlier this month. After his release, Brown took to social media to deny any wrongdoing. Snapchat pulls 'awful' Chris Brown advert ""I want to make it perfectly clear, this is false,"" he wrote on Instagram, alongside a picture that said: ""This bitch lyin'."" He added in all-capitals: ""I wanna make it perfectly clear...this is false,"" before going on to say it was ""against my character and morals"". Brown's lawyer, Raphael Chiche, said the R&B singer ""energetically"" professed his innocence and intended to sue for defamation. The two men arrested with Brown, identified by French media as a bodyguard and a friend, have also reportedly been released. The alleged incident is said to have occurred at the luxury Mandarin Oriental hotel on 15 January. This isn't the singer's first encounter with the law - he has a number of previous, high-profile convictions for violence. He received five years probation and a community service order for assaulting his ex-girlfriend, Rihanna, in his car in 2009. In 2016,he was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weaponafter a woman told police he had threatened her with a gun. He was later freed, and his lawyer said the accusations against Brown were ""demonstrably false"".

"Dyson makes a range of household appliances Dyson has announced that it is moving its headquarters to Singapore, from Malmesbury in Wiltshire. The move by the appliance maker means two executives will relocate - chief financial officer Jorn Jensen and chief legal officer Martin Bowen. Other work at Malmesbury will not be affected and no jobs will be lost. Chief executive Jim Rowan said it was not to do with Brexit or tax but added: ""It's to make us future-proof for where we see the biggest opportunities."" He added: ""We have seen an acceleration of opportunities to grow the company from a revenue perspective in Asia. We have always had a revenue stream there and will be putting up our best efforts as well as keeping an eye on investments. ""We would describe ourselves as a global technology company and in fact we have been a global company for some time. Most successful companies these days are global."" Dyson already has a presence in Singapore and in Octoberannounced plans to build its new electric car in its new factory there. Most of its products are designed in the UK, but manufactured in Asia. Sir James Dyson: From barrows to billions Dyson wins ruling over vacuum cleaner tests Dyson gears up for electric car testing The company was keen to stress that it will still be investing money in its British bases. Mr Rowan said it would be spending Â£200m in new buildings and testing facilities in Hullavington, and Â£44m in refreshing office space and adding new laboratories in Malmesbury as well as investing Â£31m for the young undergraduates at its university on the same site. ""Malmesbury has been the epicentre for us and we will continue to invest all over the UK,"" he added. ""The tax difference is negligible for us,"" added Mr Rowan, who confirmed that the company would be registered in Singapore, rather than in the UK. ""We are taxed all over the world and we will continue to pay tax in the UK."" Theo Leggett, business correspondent Dyson's chief executive Jim Rowan said today he would describe the business as a global technology company. However, because its roots are in Britain and its founder Sir James Dyson has been a vocal supporter of Brexit, the decision to move its headquarters to Singapore is likely to make political waves. In practical terms, the change is a minor one. Two senior executives will be transferred to the Singapore office, where the company itself will now be registered. There will be no impact on its 4,000 workers in Britain, and according to Mr Rowan, little impact on its tax affairs either. In 2017, it paid Â£95 million to the Exchequer. It will continue to invest in its UK research and engineering sites in Malmesbury, London and Bristol, as well as a new centre in Hullavington, where it plans to develop a groundbreaking electric car. But the change is still highly symbolic. Dyson has made it clear its centre of gravity now lies in Asia, where it sees the biggest opportunities for growth. There may be business logic in the move - but as the UK struggles to define a coherent vision for its own future, it is unlikely to be applauded here. Company founder Sir James Dyson has been in favour of Brexit, but Mr Rowan confirmed that Britain's departure from the EU would have little impact on the firm and that they had not made any contingency plans. ""Only 2-3% of our supply chain is in Europe and that goes east and not west. We do look for disruptions in the supply chain, but at this point in time, we don't foresee any issues with the movement of goods."" Dyson also revealed its full-year results for 2018, announcing that its profits had topped Â£1bn for the first time, up by 33%, while turnover jumped 28% to Â£4.4bn.

"The six men and one woman are charged with conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm over the incident in Home Bargains A father locked in a custody row plotted an acid attack on his three-year-old son to try to paint the boy's mother as ""unfit"", a court has heard. The boy's face and arm were burned when he was squirted with sulphuric acid at a Home Bargains store in Worcester. Prosecutors said his father, 40, enlisted others in a bid to ""manufacture"" evidence to discredit his estranged wife. He and six others deny conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm. All seven are on trial at Worcester Crown Court accused of plotting to throw acid with the intent to burn, maim, disfigure, or disable. Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting, said the father, who cannot be named, was the ""driving force"" behind the attack in the Tallow Hill area on 21 July. He said the case concerned a ""cowardly attack on a defenceless three-year-old in which he was squirted with a solution of sulphuric acid."" ""It was over almost in the blink of the eye and may have gone undetected were it not for the fact it was captured on the shop's internal CCTV system,"" he said. ""Thankfully, due to the quick actions of a member of staff, the seriousness of the injuries was limited... although it is too early to say whether or not there will be any residual marking,"" Mr Rees said. The court heard the defendant ""took the separation badly"" when his wife left him and issued divorce proceedings in 2016. Mr Rees said the defendant was seeking greater access of the couple's three children, but his wife opposed the application. Mr Rees said: ""In an effort to ensure his application was successful he was willing to manufacture evidence of injuries to his children in an attempt to show that his wife was unable properly to care for them, in other words she was an unfit mother. ""We suggest that his desire to show his wife in a bad light may have provided at least some of the motivation for him organising this attack on his son. ""It would enable him to say to the court that the child had sustained nasty injuries while he was in the care of his mother."" The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons is accused alongside Adam Cech, 27, of Farnham Road, Jan Dudi, 25, of Cranbrook Road and Martina Badiova, 22, of Newcombe Road, Handsworth all of Birmingham; Norbert Pulko, 22, of Sutherland Road and Saied Hussini, 41, of Wrottesley Road, both in London and Jabar Paktia, 41, of Newhampton Road, Wolverhampton. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Mr Rees said Mr Cech carried out the 21 July assault, accompanied by co-accused Jan Dudi and Norbert Pulko. Mr Pulko, Saied Hussini and Martina Badiova, were involved in an earlier incident on 13 July, he added, saying they spent hours ""loitering"" outside the boy's school, although no attack was carried out.

"Usain Bolt played on trial at Australian side Central Coast Mariners, scoring on his first start for the club Eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt has declared his ""sports life over"", frustrated in his bid to begin a post-athletics career in football. The Jamaican, 32, spent two months training with Australian side Central Coast Mariners, but left in November after the clubfailed to find financial backingfor a professional deal. ""It was fun while it lasted,"" said the 100m and 200m world record holder. ""I don't want to say it wasn't dealt with properly, but I think we went about it not the way we should."" But he added: ""You live and you learn. It was a good experience - I really enjoyed just being in a team."" In October 2018, Boltscored two goalson his first start for the Mariners in a friendly against Macarthur South West, celebrating with his trademark lightning bolt pose. The A-League side were not the only team interested in signing Bolt - he turned down an offer from Maltese club Valletta, reportedly because the club could not meet his wage demands. He had also spent time training with Norwegian team Stromsgodset and German giants Borussia Dortmund. Bolt, who retired from athletics in 2017, has said his focus now lies with his various commercial endeavours.

"An enduring conspiracy theory that the Nazi war criminal, Rudolf Hess, had been replaced by a double in jail has finally been put to rest. A DNA test carried out by Austrian scientists has shown that the man imprisoned in Berlin's Spandau Prison had indeed been Hitler's deputy. Hess was captured after flying to Scotland in 1941 and sentenced to life in prison at the Nuremberg trials. He was found hanged in the Berlin jail in 1987 at the age of 93. Hess was Spandau Prison's last inmate Researchers at the University of Salzburg in Austria tracked down a distant male relative of Hess's and obtained a DNA sample,external, the FSI Genetics journal says. That was compared with tests of a blood sample taken from the man known as Spandau prisoner No 7, the prison's last inmate, in 1982. The results showed a match of almost 100%. One of the main proponents of the impostor theory was Hess's prison doctor, W Hugh Thomas. His theory was based, among other elements, on the fact that the man in Spandau bore physical differences with Hess and that he had refused to see his family for many years - not helped by the fact that he also seemed to suffer from apparent amnesia. This video can not be played Former governor of Spandau prison, Tony Le Tissier, says Nazi Rudolf Hess deserved to die in prison Hess was one of Hitler's closest aides. But in 1941 he made a solo flight to Scotland, where his plane crash-landed, in an apparently unauthorised peace mission which was denounced by the FÃ¼hrer. He was imprisoned by the British for the duration of the war. At the Nuremberg trials in 1946, Hess was cleared of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but convicted of crimes against peace and jailed for life. He spent the next 40 years in Spandau Prison in Berlin, before being found hanged in an apparent suicide.

"Huawei chairman Liang Hua The chairman of Chinese tech giant Huawei has warned that his company could shift away from Western countries if it continues to face restrictions. Huawei has been under scrutiny by Western governments, which fear its products could be used for spying. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Mr Liang Hua said his firm might transfer technology to countries ""where we are welcomed"". He also stressed that Huawei follows regulations wherever it operates. US to 'seek Huawei executive extradition' Full coverage of Davos 2019,external Huawei makes smartphones but is also a world leader in telecoms infrastructure, in particular the next generation of mobile phone networks, known as 5G. But concern about the security of its technology has been growing, particularly in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Germany. The company is banned from bidding for government contracts in the US, where intelligence services have raised questions about Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei's links to China's ruling Communist Party. Last month, BT confirmed that it was removing Huawei's equipment from the EE core network that it owns. The network provides a communication system being developed for the UK's emergency services. Meanwhile, Germany is considering blocking the firm from its next generation mobile phone network. Huawei has always maintained that it is a private company, owned by its employees, with no ties to the Chinese government. The company says it remains committed to its Â£3bn investment in Britain. The company's top executives rarely give interviews, but a number of journalists were invited to ask questions of Mr Liang on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. BT bars Huawei kit from 5G network Germany might block Huawei from 5G Mr Liang told them that if the company faced further hurdles to doing business in some countries, ""we would transfer the technology partnership to countries where we are welcomed and where we can have collaboration with"". While he would not be drawn on whether Huawei could leave the UK, Mr Liang stressed that it would be up to British consumers to decide if they wanted to use the company's technology, before adding, that the ""UK is the market that advocates openness and also free trade"". Mr Liang said anyone concerned would be ""welcome"" to inspect the firm's laboratories in China. Even as the the storm surrounding Huawei continues to rage, Mr Liang's message was simple - the company's products would speak for themselves. ""We will focus on providing value by offering the high bandwidth ultra low latency and high connectivity [products] to our customers,"" he said. In December, Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the founder of Huawei, was arrested in Canada and faces extradition to the United States over accusations the company flouted US sanctions against Iran. Mr Liang called for a ""quick conclusion"" to the case, so that Ms Meng could regain ""her personal freedom"". He also reiterated the company's claim that the detention of two Canadian nationals in China, seen by many as retaliation for the arrest of Ms Meng, ""has no relation with Huawei"".

"Dyson makes a range of household appliances Dyson has announced that it is moving its headquarters to Singapore, from Malmesbury in Wiltshire. The move by the appliance maker means two executives will relocate - chief financial officer Jorn Jensen and chief legal officer Martin Bowen. Other work at Malmesbury will not be affected and no jobs will be lost. Chief executive Jim Rowan said it was not to do with Brexit or tax but added: ""It's to make us future-proof for where we see the biggest opportunities."" He added: ""We have seen an acceleration of opportunities to grow the company from a revenue perspective in Asia. We have always had a revenue stream there and will be putting up our best efforts as well as keeping an eye on investments. ""We would describe ourselves as a global technology company and in fact we have been a global company for some time. Most successful companies these days are global."" Dyson already has a presence in Singapore and in Octoberannounced plans to build its new electric car in its new factory there. Most of its products are designed in the UK, but manufactured in Asia. Sir James Dyson: From barrows to billions Dyson wins ruling over vacuum cleaner tests Dyson gears up for electric car testing The company was keen to stress that it will still be investing money in its British bases. Mr Rowan said it would be spending Â£200m in new buildings and testing facilities in Hullavington, and Â£44m in refreshing office space and adding new laboratories in Malmesbury as well as investing Â£31m for the young undergraduates at its university on the same site. ""Malmesbury has been the epicentre for us and we will continue to invest all over the UK,"" he added. ""The tax difference is negligible for us,"" added Mr Rowan, who confirmed that the company would be registered in Singapore, rather than in the UK. ""We are taxed all over the world and we will continue to pay tax in the UK."" Theo Leggett, business correspondent Dyson's chief executive Jim Rowan said today he would describe the business as a global technology company. However, because its roots are in Britain and its founder Sir James Dyson has been a vocal supporter of Brexit, the decision to move its headquarters to Singapore is likely to make political waves. In practical terms, the change is a minor one. Two senior executives will be transferred to the Singapore office, where the company itself will now be registered. There will be no impact on its 4,000 workers in Britain, and according to Mr Rowan, little impact on its tax affairs either. In 2017, it paid Â£95 million to the Exchequer. It will continue to invest in its UK research and engineering sites in Malmesbury, London and Bristol, as well as a new centre in Hullavington, where it plans to develop a groundbreaking electric car. But the change is still highly symbolic. Dyson has made it clear its centre of gravity now lies in Asia, where it sees the biggest opportunities for growth. There may be business logic in the move - but as the UK struggles to define a coherent vision for its own future, it is unlikely to be applauded here. Company founder Sir James Dyson has been in favour of Brexit, but Mr Rowan confirmed that Britain's departure from the EU would have little impact on the firm and that they had not made any contingency plans. ""Only 2-3% of our supply chain is in Europe and that goes east and not west. We do look for disruptions in the supply chain, but at this point in time, we don't foresee any issues with the movement of goods."" Dyson also revealed its full-year results for 2018, announcing that its profits had topped Â£1bn for the first time, up by 33%, while turnover jumped 28% to Â£4.4bn.

"The singer has several previous convictions for violence US singer Chris Brown has been released without charge in Paris after being questioned on suspicion of rape, French police say. An investigation into the alleged incident is continuing, the Paris prosecutor's office said. The star and two other men were arrested on Monday after a 24-year-old woman alleged she was assaulted in a hotel in the city earlier this month. After his release, Brown took to social media to deny any wrongdoing. Snapchat pulls 'awful' Chris Brown advert ""I want to make it perfectly clear, this is false,"" he wrote on Instagram, alongside a picture that said: ""This bitch lyin'."" He added in all-capitals: ""I wanna make it perfectly clear...this is false,"" before going on to say it was ""against my character and morals"". Brown's lawyer, Raphael Chiche, said the R&B singer ""energetically"" professed his innocence and intended to sue for defamation. The two men arrested with Brown, identified by French media as a bodyguard and a friend, have also reportedly been released. The alleged incident is said to have occurred at the luxury Mandarin Oriental hotel on 15 January. This isn't the singer's first encounter with the law - he has a number of previous, high-profile convictions for violence. He received five years probation and a community service order for assaulting his ex-girlfriend, Rihanna, in his car in 2009. In 2016,he was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weaponafter a woman told police he had threatened her with a gun. He was later freed, and his lawyer said the accusations against Brown were ""demonstrably false"".

"Leah Cambridge flew to Turkey with her mother on 26 August and died the following day A beautician who travelled to Turkey to have ""Brazilian butt lift"" (BBL) surgery died from a fat clot caused by the procedure, an inquest has heard. Leah Cambridge, 29, from Leeds, died shortly after the surgery at a private hospital in Izmir in August 2018. Wakefield Coroner's Court heard Ms Cambridge's mother, who had accompanied her to Turkey, was told there had been ""complications"" during the operation. A provisional post-mortem examination found she died from a fat embolism. Assistant Coroner James Hargan told the hearing: ""Ms Cambridge was a 29-year-old single lady who lived with her partner in this country. ""Arrangements were made for her to have cosmetic surgery at a private hospital in Izmir, Turkey. Mr Hargan said Ms Cambridge and her mother were picked up from an airport on 26 August and taken to the hospital, where the operation took place the next morning. ""At round about half-past one in the afternoon of that day, the deceased's mother was informed by hospital staff that there had been complications during the surgery and, sadly, Ms Cambridge had died,"" Mr Hargan added. Is 'Brazilian butt lift' surgery a risk worth taking? BBL is a cosmetic procedure in which fat is taken from one part of the body and then injected into the buttocks. After Ms Cambridge's death, it was reported she underwent the Â£3,000 procedure at the Izmir Private Can Hospital, which boasts celebrity clientele. The mother-of-three was said to have opted to go under the knife after growing paranoid about excess stomach weight from having children. Her inquest was adjourned to allow further inquiries to take place.

"People protest President Trump's announcement of plans to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving The United States Supreme Court has allowed President Donald Trump to enforce his policy of banning certain transgender people from the military. The court voted 5-4 to grant a Trump administration request to lift injunctions blocking the policy while challenges continue in lower courts. The four liberal judges on the court opposed the ruling. The policy prohibits ""transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition"" from serving. The top court's ruling is not a mandate, but it has opened up the option for the military to enforce the ban. The Trump administration had also appealed for an expedited ruling on the case, which the Supreme Court declined to take up. The president announced on Twitter in 2017 that the country would no longer ""accept or allow"" transgender Americans to serve in the military, citing ""tremendous medical costs and disruption"". The secret life of a transgender airman Reality Check: 15,000 trans people in US military The then defence secretary Jim Mattis refined the policy to limit it to individuals with a history of gender dysphoria, or when a person's biological sex and identity does not match. He said the new policy would make exceptions for several hundred transgender people already serving openly or willing to serve ""in their biological sex"". There are currently some 8,980 active duty transgender troops,according to Department of Defence data analysed by the Palm Center,external, a public policy nonprofit. Gen Mattis in his memo argued that ""by its very nature, military service requires sacrifice,"" and that those who serve ""voluntarily accept limitations on their personal liberties"". The move is a reversal of an Obama administration policy that ruled transgender Americans could serve openly in the military as well as obtain funding for gender re-assignment surgery. Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, told the BBC: ""We had an inclusive policy for almost three years. What today's ruling enables is the whipsawing of policy, back and forth."" This video can not be played Riley Dosh explains why she wants to defend her country This is just one Supreme Court action - and it's a procedural move, not a formal court opinion - but it may be a sign that a conservative majority sympathetic to presidential powers and prerogatives is flexing its muscles. The Trump administration, frustrated that lower-court judges had again blocked implementation of one of its policy decisions, asked the justices to step in and clear the path. The White House wanted a quick ruling because, it said, allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military presented ""too great a risk to military effectiveness"". By a bare majority, the court complied. Although the justices did not entirely bypass the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which the president has tried to paint as a bastion of liberal judges, they did the next best thing for the president. They permitted the transgender ban to go into effect while the legal fight, which could last years, grinds on. For the past two years, the president's opponents - locked out of national power until recently - have looked to the judicial system as a last line of defence. As Tuesday clearly showed, however, those defences are only as strong as a majority of the Supreme Court says they are. This video can not be played Being transgender in the US military Several trial judges around the country had issued injunctions blocking the ban. One injunction was reversed in a federal appeals court earlier this month, with a three-judge panel ruling the policy was not a ""blanket ban"" on transgender troops, and so the courts should defer to the executive branch's military decisions. While Mr Trump's rationale for banning transgender troops was financial, according to estimates by the RAND Corporation, a policy think tank working with the US Armed Forces, transition-related healthcare costs are between $2.4m (Â£1.8m) and $8.4m per year. In 2017, defence data viewed by the Palm Center indicates that cost was in fact lower, at $2.2m. Solicitor General Noel Francisco had described the transgender ban in his fast-track appeal as""an issue of imperative public importance"",externalregarding the military's authority ""to determine who may serve"". Mr Belkin told the BBC:  ""This is not a financial issue, it's not a disruption issue - it's an issue of emotion, tolerance and politics."" The Supreme Court ""had no business weighing in"" at this point, he added. ""Not only is there no policy emergency, but there is not even a policy problem."" A group of New Yorkers gathered in 2017 at the Trump International Hotel to protest against LGBT-discrimination Pentagon spokeswoman Lt Col Carla Gleason said in a statement that the military treats ""all transgender persons with respect and dignity"" and the new policy was ""based on professional military judgement"". She said the ""proposed policy is NOT a ban on service by transgender persons.  It is critical that [the defence department] be permitted to implement personnel policies that it determines are necessary to ensure the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world."" Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the administration was ""pleased"" that the top court was ""clearing the way for the policy to go into effect"". ""Our military had been forced to maintain a prior policy that poses a risk to military effectiveness and lethality for over a year."" The top court's ruling has sparked outrage and frustration online. Charlotte Clymer, a transgender Army veteran, tweeted: ""This is a hateful and cowardly policy."" Allow Twitter content?

"MPs are putting forward plans to change the outcome of Brexit ahead of a vote next week on the PM's amended deal. Theresa May said on Monday she was focused on altering the backstop - the ""insurance policy"" designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister was in denial about the level of opposition to her deal. Among the MPs' eight amendments are plans to stop a no-deal Brexit and to extend the deadline for leaving the EU. But more amendments to change her next steps could be added in the coming days. MPs are due to vote on Mrs May's proposals for Brexit on 29 January. Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Kuenssberg: Back to the backstop On Monday, the PM vowed to seek changes from the EU to the Irish ""backstop"" -  the measures intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk. Mrs May also scrapped the Â£65 fee EU citizens were due to pay to secure the right to continue living in the UK after Brexit. However, she gave few details about how her deal would be changed before next Tuesday's vote. The European Commission's chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, welcomed the dropping of the fee for EU citizens, but said it ""does not provide the sort of clarification of intention that we are expecting as soon as possible on the broader picture"". He also said that if a no deal Brexit was to happen, it would be ""pretty obvious"" that there would be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - meaning checks on people and goods travelling between the two. But the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), Leo Varadkar, has said ""we will have a real dilemma"" if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He said there would have to be negotiations on customs and regulations that meant ""full alignment"", so there would be no hard border, saying: ""We already have that agreement. That is the backstop."" He said nobody else has come up with an alternative and said: ""We can't give that up for a promise that it will be all right on the night or will be sorted out over the next two years."" No-deal Brexit 'means hard border' Meanwhile, civil service chief executive John Manzoni has warned that a no-deal Brexit might be a ""bit bumpy"" and was unlikely to go ""swimmingly well"". An internal letter sent to staff at the National Crime Agency has warned of major disruption at ports, and possible transport blockages, fuel and food shortages and public disorder. Please upgrade your browser Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, who voted against Mrs May's deal, said the backstop was ""unworkable"", adding that he also had objections to the Â£39bn so-called divorce bill the UK was preparing to pay the EU. Conservative MP Damian Green, a close friend of Mrs May, voted for her deal, but told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that he accepted the government would have to put forward ""something different"". Roland Rudd, chairman of the People's Vote campaign for a fresh referendum said it was time for politicians to ""put country before party"". ""People had been hoping beyond hope that Theresa May would do that, and unfortunately she came up to speak yesterday and her 'Plan B' was just her 'Plan A' all over again, and it just looked like she was putting her party before country,"" he told the Today programme. An official Labour Party amendment says that MPs should be able to vote on options such as the party's preferred outcome of a closer relationship with Europe, with a permanent customs union. It also asks MPs to decide whether they should hold a further referendum on whatever Brexit plan is approved by the House of Commons. Mr Corbyn said the amendment allowed MPs ""to end this Brexit deadlock"" and prevent the ""chaos"" of leaving the EU without a deal. But Mrs May warned that another EU referendum could threaten the UK's ""social cohesion"". Why are MPs putting forward amendments? Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the issue of another referendum was ""divisive"" for both Labour and the Conservatives. She would not be drawn on whether her party would back a further public vote, but said the option should be on the table for Parliament to discuss. Rebecca Long-Bailey said another referendum was ""one option of many"" Ms Long-Bailey added: ""Our job is to bring as many people together as we possibly can and that really is one option of many. ""Our priority always has been to secure a deal that really provides a consensus within Parliament and I think that deal can be found if we are actually given the opportunity to debate various options."" Among the other plans being put forward by MPs are: An amendment by Labour MP Rachel Reeves aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit by requiring the prime minister to seek an extension to the Article 50 deadline A bill from Labour's Yvette Cooper, with the backing of Remainer Tory MPs, which also directs the prime minister to seek a deadline extension if a Brexit deal is not agreed by 26 February An amendment by Labour MP Hilary Benn which asks MPs to take a non-binding vote on four options: reconsidering Mrs May's deal, leaving the EU with no deal, seeking to renegotiate the deal or holding another referendum Mr Duncan Smith said that plans to allow backbenchers to create legislation would create ""mayhem"" in the Commons and that anybody who believed the House could act as a government negotiating a trade deal was ""living in cloud cuckoo land"". A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Some ministers are reportedly backing the proposals to block a no-deal Brexit, withthe i newspaper,externalandthe Times,externalsaying that dozens could quit unless they are allowed a free vote on the issue. The papers said that Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has warned Mrs May that up to 40 ministers could resign. Speaking to reporters on her way into No 10 for Tuesday's cabinet meeting, Energy Minister Claire Perry said she didn't think there needed to be resignations and that MPs were ""coming together"" to support Mrs May's deal. ""Anyone in that House that wants to avoid no deal as passionately as I do, wants to deliver Brexit as much as I do and wants to avoid a people's referendum - which I think would be another extension of all of these really tough conversations - needs to come together and support the deal."" Nick Watt: May boxed into her comfort zone Cameron warned over 'stupid' Brexit vote About 10,000 customers of Brittany Ferrieshave had their bookings amendedto accommodate extra sailings in case of a no-deal Brexit. The ferry company said timetables from Portsmouth, Poole and Plymouth were being modified to ensure ""critical goods"" could still be transported. Another ferry company, P&O, has said it will re-register its six UK ships under the Cyprus flag ahead of Brexit so the firm can continue to benefit from the tax arrangements of EU states. ""The Cyprus flag is on the 'white list' of both the Paris and Tokyo Memoranda of Understanding, resulting in fewer inspections and delays, and will result in significantly more favourable tonnage tax arrangements as the ships will be flagged in an EU member state,"" a spokesman said. And Dyson - whose founder Sir James Dyson has been in favour of Brexit -has announced that it is moving its headquarters to Singapore, from Malmesbury in Wiltshire. However, chief executive Jim Rowan has said it is not to do with Brexit or tax, saying: ""It's to make us future-proof for where we see the biggest opportunities."" Mr Rowan confirmed that Britain's departure from the EU would have little impact on the firm and that they had not made any contingency plans. Last week MPs rejected the deal negotiated between the UK and EU on the terms of the UK's departure from the bloc by 432 votes to 202 - a majority of 230. Outlining her proposed way forward on Monday, Mrs May refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit and insisted there was no majority in the House of Commons for another referendum. But she promised Parliament a ""proper say"" in the next stage of negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and EU. She also said she would conduct further talks on the Irish backstop plan, which is designed to prevent the need for a visible border and customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics It means Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market and effectively keeps the UK in the customs union until the UK and EU reach a lasting trade agreement. The backstop is opposed by many Conservative MPs andthe Democratic Unionist Partybecause they fear it could become permanent and because it means different rules for different parts of the UK.

"This video can not be played 'In a no-deal, you will have a hard border' It is ""obvious"" there will be a hard border in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the European Commission's chief spokesman has said. Margaritis Schinas made the comments atthe commission's daily media briefing,external. If he was pushed to speculate what might happen in a no-deal scenario, he said, it was ""pretty obvious you will have a hard border"". However, the Irish government has repeated its stance that it will ""not accept a hard border on this island"". Brexit: Back to the backstop Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop What would no-deal mean for NI economy? No-deal Brexit could 'break up the UK' In a statement, the office of Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said: ""Regardless of Brexit, the British government will always have responsibilities as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement to ensure that, even in a no deal, there will not be a return to a border."" In June 2016 the UK voted to leave the EU and negotiations have been taking place since then on the terms of the UK's withdrawal. Unless the EU and UK strike a deal that is accepted by the British parliament, the default position will be for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March. Mr Varadkar's statement added that avoiding a hard border would be ""more difficult to achieve without the withdrawal agreement and would require very difficult discussions with our EU partners"". ""Working out suitable customs and trade arrangements compatible with our EU membership will require detailed discussion with the commission, while the UK will also need to live up to its responsibilities. ""We are under no illusions about how challenging that would be,"" Mr Varadkar's office added, but it also reiterated its position that the Irish government is ""not planning"" for a hard border. Speaking later in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) Mr Varadkar said the Irish government would have ""a real dilemma"" if the UK leaves without a deal: ""We would have to negotiate an agreement on customs and regulations that meant full alignment so there would be no hard border. ""We already have that agreement, and that is the backstop,"" he said. He also said that in a no-deal scenario Ireland would have obligations to protect the single market, the United Kingdom would have obligations to protect World Trade Organisation rules and both states would have an obligation to honour the Good Friday Agreement, protect the peace process and honour their commitments to the people of Northern Ireland that there will not be a hard border. Last week, the UK prime minister said the EU had made it ""clear there will be no flexibility on border checks in no deal"". ""The Irish government will be expected to apply EU checks in full,"" added Theresa May. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Schinas told reporters at Tuesday's briefing: ""If you'd like to push me and speculate on what might happen in a no-deal scenario in Ireland, I think it's pretty obvious - you will have a hard border. ""And our commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and everything that we have been doing for years with our tools, instruments and programmes will have to take, inevitably, into account this fact. ""So, of course we are for peace; of course we stand behind the Good Friday Agreement but that's what a withdrawal... that's a no-deal scenario, that's what it [would] entail. ""So I will not now speculate on this plan B because, as I said seconds ago, we are for plan A, which is set by the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration as a package."" Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has described Mr Schinas's comments as ""a lot of bluff"". The party's Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said he believed the EU was trying to ""up the ante"" as the Brexit deadlock continues. He said his party would not be scared into voting for the deal that includes the current Irish ""backstop"" - the controversial insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border if the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The DUP MP acknowledged there would be pressure on the Irish government now, but he urged the British government not to listen to what the EU has said about a hard border. ""Good luck to them (the EU) if they think they can put a hard border up,"" Mr Wilson added. ""We'll see it for bluff come 1 April, if there is no deal."" It is written into law that the UK will be leaving  the EU on March 29, but the deadline could be extended Last week,the withdrawal agreement was overwhelmingly rejected by Westminster,, with MPs voting against Mrs May's preferred deal by 432 votes to 202. It was the largest defeat for a sitting British government in history. Mrs May was asked to come up with an alternative option and MPs are now due to vote on an amended version of her deal on 29 January. On Monday, the prime minister told the House of Commons she will go back to EU leaders in a bid to secure changes to the Irish backstop. However, there is little consensus in the Commons for any one solution to Brexit, and soMPs are currently putting forward a range of other options ahead of the 29 January vote. Among the amendments suggested so far are plans to prevent a no-deal Brexit and to extend the deadline for leaving the EU. Northern Ireland Affairs Committee chairman Andrew Murrison has submitted an amendment which seeks to time-limit the backstop.

"This video can not be played Insurgents bombed the military intelligence base in Wardak province Dozens of Afghan security staff were killed by Taliban militants who overran a military intelligence base near Kabul, officials have confirmed. At least 43 people were killed and 54 injured in Monday's attack, the NDS intelligence service told the BBC. Insurgents blew their way into the base using a car bomb before opening fire. Some reports put the toll at over 100. It is one of the deadliest attacks on the secret service and follows a string of battlefield setbacks for the army. The attack on the National Directorate for Security (NDS) base in central Wardak province came hours before the Taliban held another round of peace talks with US diplomats in Qatar. Reports say the base in Maidan Shahr, about 30km (19 miles) south-west of Kabul, is a training centre for pro-government militia members. The militants smashed their way in by detonating a captured Humvee packed with explosives. At least two gunmen then opened fire in the compound. A second car bombing attempt was foiled by the Afghan security forces and three would-be suicide attackers were killed, the NDS told the BBC. 'The bed that saved me from the Taliban' Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever BBC reporter's terrifying days amid Taliban assault on Ghazni Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? The Taliban said on Monday they had attacked an Afghan special forces unit and 190 people had been killed. The group often inflates casualty figures from their attacks. Much of the building's roof collapsed, causing most of the casualties Officials initially acknowledged about 20 deaths but the latest unconfirmed reports say some 70 bodies have so far been pulled from the rubble. Most casualties were caused by the partial collapse of the building's roof when it was hit by the force of the Humvee blast. The Taliban, who emerged in the early 1990s, ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, but were driven from power by US-led troops following the 9/11 attacks. Taliban threaten 70% of Afghanistan, BBC finds Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan How does the Taliban make money? They remained a powerful insurgent force, and their power and reach surged after foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. US-led combat operations against them officially ended in that year, but some foreign troops remain in the country to provide training and assistance to Afghan forces, who do most of the fighting. However, the US has been carrying out a sustained air bombing campaign since President Trump announced a new strategy in 2017. It emerged late last year he is planning to withdraw thousands of troops within months. This video can not be played The BBC is given rare access to see life under the Taliban US officials and Taliban representatives have met several times since last summer. President Ashraf Ghani's administration says it must be part of talks too, but the Taliban dismiss his government as puppets of the US. The Taliban frequently carry out deadly attacks targeting military bases, soldiers and police,externaland in recent years US and Afghan officials have withheld detailed casualty figures as they are deemed too sensitive. Late last year, President Ghani said more than 28,000 Afghan police and soldiers had been killed since 2015 - an average of about 20 a day. Civilians, however, continue to bear the brunt of the conflict,external. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama) says civilian deaths for the first nine months of 2018 were higher than at any point during the same period since 2014. Nearly half of all civilian casualties were caused by militant bombings, the UN said, followed by fighting on the ground and targeted killings.

"Cafe chain Patisserie Valerie has collapsed into administration after the failure of rescue talks with banks. Administrators KPMG will close 70 outlets immediately, while the remaining 121 will continue trading in the hope of finding a buyer. KPMG said there would be ""significant"" redundancies. The BBC understands up to 900 of the 3,000 staff may go. In October, Patisserie Valerie uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"". The company said in a statement,externalthat it did not have enough money to meet its debts. The biggest shareholder and chairman, entrepreneur Luke Johnson, had been in talks to extend a cash lifeline from HSBC and Barclays. Closure notices have already appeared in some outlets Mr Johnson has personally extended an unsecured, interest-free loan of Â£3m to help ensure that the January wages are paid to all staff working in the business. ""This loan will also assist the administrators in trading as many profitable stores as possible while a sale process is undertaken,""the company said in a separate statement,external. Patisserie Valerie seeks bank lifeline Scandal worse than thought Cafe chain's auditor faces probe In addition to Patisserie Valerie, the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. Finance director Chris Marsh was arrested after having been suspended by the company when the financial irregularities were uncovered. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton. The first cafe was opened on Frith Street in London's Soho district in 1926 In 1987 the Scalzo family bought the Old Compton Street store and ran the business In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners bought a majority stake when it had eight stores. Patisserie Valerie was floated on the AIM stock market, for smaller companies, in 2014 KPMG's administrators Blair Nimmo and David Costley-Wood said about 121 stores would continue to trade while a buyer is sought. They said: ""Our intention is to continue trading across the profitable stores, as collectively, the brands have a strong presence on the high street and have proven very popular with consumers. At the same time, we will be seeking a buyer for the business and are hopeful of a good level of interest. ""Unfortunately, however, we have had to take the difficult decision to close 70 stores resulting in a significant number of redundancies. We will be working with those affected employees, providing all support and assistance they need."" Within hours of the administration announcement, closure notices began appearing in some outlets. Last week, Patisserie Valerie confirmed it had found ""extensive"" misstatement of its accounts and ""very significant manipulation of the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts"". This includes thousands of false entries in its ledgers,the company said in a statement,external. Profits and cash flow had been overstated and were ""materially below"" figures announced in October. Business Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves says it ""raises grave corporate governance concerns"" Patisserie Valerie almost ceased trading last year after the discovery of the black hole in the accounts. However, a rescue plan was passed by shareholders in November, resulting in the issue of Â£15m worth of new shares. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the administration was bad news for shareholders. ""Any dim hope investors had of recovering any value from shares they bought in good faith has now been extinguished,"" he said. ""It's one thing to see a company's shares wiped out by poor trading conditions, or even bad management decisions, it's quite another to see your investment disappear as a result of fraudulent activity,"" he added. MP Rachel Reeves, chairwoman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said the administration ""raises grave corporate governance concerns"". After previous corporate collapses, her committee began looking into the future of auditing in the UK. She said the Patisserie Valerie affair would form part of the inquiries.

"The number of people in work in the UK has reached a record high of 32.54 million,latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show.,external Unemployment was flat, with a small increase of 8,000 between September and November for a total of 1.37 million. Average earnings excluding bonuses increased by 3.3% in the year to November, as wage rises continued to outpace inflation. The number of job vacancies rose by 10,000 to a record high of 853,000. ONS head of labour market David Freeman said: ""The number of people working grew again, with the share of the population in work now the highest on record. ""Meanwhile, the share of the workforce looking for work and unable to find it remains at its lowest for over 40 years, helped by a record number of job vacancies. ""Wage growth continues to outpace inflation, which fell back slightly in the latest month."" The unemployment total is 68,000 lower than a year ago, with the jobless rate 0.2% down on this time in 2018. The number of job vacancies rose by 10,000 to a record high of 853,000. The increase in both unemployment and employment is explained by the UK's rising population and fewer people being classed as economically inactive, which includes those on long-term sick leave, students, and people who have given up looking for a job. The number of economically inactive people fell by 100,000 to 8.6 million, a rate of 21%, which is the lowest on record. Reality Check: Has immigration held down wages? Inflation falls to lowest level in nearly two years Reality Check: Can you be 'employed' for one hour's work? Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""Our pro-business policies have helped boost private sector employment by 3.8 million since 2010, and as the Resolution Foundation's latest report shows, the 'jobs-boom has helped some of the most disadvantaged groups find employment', providing opportunities across society."" Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures were ""reassuring, showing no sign of any hit to firms' hiring ambitions due to Brexit"". However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned that the pace of wage increases may begin to ease. ""We doubt that wage growth will be sustained over the next six months at November's strong rate,"" he said, ""Pay settlements likely will weaken this year, as the previous year's inflation rate usually is the starting point for negotiations. ""Nonetheless, the labour market now looks tight enough to ensure that wage growth does not slip below the 3% mark."" By Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent At first blush the most surprising thing about the jobs market as portrayed by the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics is how robust it is. All this talk of Brexit uncertainty and yet employers continued to take people on. The number in work and the proportion in work continued to hit a new record - as it has done now, more or less continuously, for years. And the bulk of the new jobs were full-time; there are now a record 24 million full-time jobs in the UK. Is the jobs market simply ignoring all the Brexit-induced political chaos? Does this confirm suspicions that warnings of slower growth owing to the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was merely Project Fear? The answer to the latter question is ""no"", and to the former ""we don't know yet"". The key is that jobs figures trail the rest of the economy. Firms that took people on in the September to November period will have decided to do so in the summer, when confidence was higher and the politics less fraught. So we will still have to wait a few months to know if Brexit uncertainty has hit the jobs market or not. Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said the employment figures may not be a marker for any possible interest rate rises. ""The Bank of England will be little moved by today's data. While the momentum behind wage growth may build support for interest rate hikes, Brexit remains the spanner in the works for the monetary policy committee,"" he said. Separate figures from the ONS showed thatgovernment borrowing rose last month.,external Public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, was Â£3bn in December, which was higher than expected and up Â£300m from the same month a year earlier. Borrowing in the current financial year-to-date was has now reached Â£35.9bn, Â£13.1bn less than in the same period in 2017 and the lowest year-to-date figure for 16 years. However, analysts said that on current trends, borrowing was set to exceed the Â£25.5bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the 2018-19 financial year as a whole. ""Much will depend on whether an expected marked pick-up in corporation tax receipts materialises and how well the economy holds up over the first quarter of 2019, particularly given the current heightened Brexit uncertainties,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club Reality Check: Has immigration held down wages?

"Huawei chairman Liang Hua The chairman of Chinese tech giant Huawei has warned that his company could shift away from Western countries if it continues to face restrictions. Huawei has been under scrutiny by Western governments, which fear its products could be used for spying. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Mr Liang Hua said his firm might transfer technology to countries ""where we are welcomed"". He also stressed that Huawei follows regulations wherever it operates. US to 'seek Huawei executive extradition' Full coverage of Davos 2019,external Huawei makes smartphones but is also a world leader in telecoms infrastructure, in particular the next generation of mobile phone networks, known as 5G. But concern about the security of its technology has been growing, particularly in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Germany. The company is banned from bidding for government contracts in the US, where intelligence services have raised questions about Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei's links to China's ruling Communist Party. Last month, BT confirmed that it was removing Huawei's equipment from the EE core network that it owns. The network provides a communication system being developed for the UK's emergency services. Meanwhile, Germany is considering blocking the firm from its next generation mobile phone network. Huawei has always maintained that it is a private company, owned by its employees, with no ties to the Chinese government. The company says it remains committed to its Â£3bn investment in Britain. The company's top executives rarely give interviews, but a number of journalists were invited to ask questions of Mr Liang on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. BT bars Huawei kit from 5G network Germany might block Huawei from 5G Mr Liang told them that if the company faced further hurdles to doing business in some countries, ""we would transfer the technology partnership to countries where we are welcomed and where we can have collaboration with"". While he would not be drawn on whether Huawei could leave the UK, Mr Liang stressed that it would be up to British consumers to decide if they wanted to use the company's technology, before adding, that the ""UK is the market that advocates openness and also free trade"". Mr Liang said anyone concerned would be ""welcome"" to inspect the firm's laboratories in China. Even as the the storm surrounding Huawei continues to rage, Mr Liang's message was simple - the company's products would speak for themselves. ""We will focus on providing value by offering the high bandwidth ultra low latency and high connectivity [products] to our customers,"" he said. In December, Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the founder of Huawei, was arrested in Canada and faces extradition to the United States over accusations the company flouted US sanctions against Iran. Mr Liang called for a ""quick conclusion"" to the case, so that Ms Meng could regain ""her personal freedom"". He also reiterated the company's claim that the detention of two Canadian nationals in China, seen by many as retaliation for the arrest of Ms Meng, ""has no relation with Huawei"".

"This video can not be played Pilot for new parent MPs to vote by proxy MPs on parental leave will be able to nominate another MP to vote on their behalf if new plans announced by the government are agreed. Proxy voting in Parliament has long been discussed for pregnant MPs and new parents, but despite widespread agreement, it has not come into force. Andrea Leadsom said if the House voted in favour of the scheme next Monday, a year-long pilot would take place. It comes after an article accused the Tory chief whip of blocking the change. ""Multiple sources"" told the Times,externalthat Julian Smith had been trying to stop it from being allowed while trying to get the Theresa May's Brexit deal through Parliament. The article led to Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson asking an urgent question in the House of Commons about the progress of enabling proxy voting. She previously accused the Tories of breaking a ""pairing"" agreement with her when she was on maternity leave. The pairing system should have seen one MP not voting to cancel out Ms Swinson's absence, but the MP she was paired with - Tory chairman Brandon Lewis - still voted. He has since apologised for an ""honest mistake"" by whips. The issue of proxy voting was raised again during last week's crunch Brexit votes on Mrs May's deal as a heavily pregnant Labour MP, Tulip Siddiq, chose to delay her Caesarean by two days and was pushed through the voting lobby in a wheelchair as proxy voting was not available. She said she did not trust the pairing system after Ms Swinson's experience. Labour MP delays birth to vote on Brexit Pregnant MP reignites proxy voting debate Sick MP's anger after 'undignified' vote Ms Swinson welcomed the government announcement but said it ""gives a whole new meaning to being overdue"". ""Some have been dragged kicking and screaming to this position,"" she said. ""We have waited long enough for this change. Modernising the House of Commons is a slow and laborious process and often quite like childbirth. Let's get on with it."" When a vote is held in the House of Commons, the speaker asks MPs to call out whether they are for or against the bill. If there is not a clear winner, he calls a vote, known as a division. MPs then go into one of the two rooms at the end of the Commons chamber - the division lobbies - and have to walk through to cast their vote. Pairing:If members cannot get to Parliament to vote, they can enter an informal agreement known as ""pairing"". This means an MP from the opposing side of the absent politician agrees not to vote so the numbers are cancelled out. Nodding through:Another method is known as ""nodding through"". This means someone's vote can be counted even if they cannot pass through one of the lobbies - as long as they are somewhere on the parliamentary estate. It is traditionally used for people who are too unwell to walk - in the past MPs have voted by being in the back of an ambulance  which was driven in and out of the gates. But it has been used on a small number of occasions in recent years for people with childcare commitments as a result of Lib Dem Jenny Willott negotiating the right in 2011 after the birth of her son Toby. Proxy voting:This will allow MPs who are heavily pregnant or are on parental leave to nominate another MP to cast their votes. Recommendations from the procedure committee say that the name of the MP nominated to act as the proxy should be published and any changes to the arrangement would require a notice period. Mrs Leadsom thanked the Lib Dem MP for her campaigning over the issue and agreed that she wanted to make Parliament ""a more modern workplace"". She said the pilot would follow plans set out by the cross-party procedure committee, who recommended last year that new parents should be allowed to notify the House of Commons about a specified period of absence - up to six months for mothers and two weeks for fathers - and nominate a member to cast votes on their behalf for that period. After the pilot year, the scheme would then be reviewed. ""This is a perfect example of how parliament can work collaboratively to bring about important change,"" Mrs Leadsom added.

The issue of proxy voting and parental leave has been debated twice in Parliament, but a system to allow it to happen has yet to be formally agreed. The speaker, John Bercow, said if it was agreed next Monday, he would ""have a scheme ready"" so members can instantly apply for a proxy - meaning MPs on parental leave would still be able to have their say on the next set of key Brexit votes  on 29 January.

"This video can not be played Football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was all smiles as he arrived at court Football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has cut a deal with a court in Madrid over tax evasion charges, accepting an â¬18.8m (Â£16.6m) fine. A huge media presence met the player outside the court, after a judge refused his request to appear by video or to enter the building by car to avoid the spotlight. The deal, agreed in advance, includes a 23-month jail sentence. But in Spain, convicts do not usually do time for sentences under two years. The non-violent nature of Ronaldo's offence means he is unlikely to spend any time at all in jail, serving it on probation instead. The court appearance lasted mere minutes as Ronaldo accepted the deal offered by prosecutors. The current Juventus player, who played for the club in Italy the night before, arrived at the provincial court with his fiancee Georgina Rodriguez. Smiling and giving a thumbs-up, he was apparently unfazed by the media presence. His lawyers had argued that given his fame, avoiding the main entrance was needed for the player's security. Ronaldo, five-time winner of Europe's Ballon d'Or and often titled one of the world's best players, was accused of avoiding paying tax in Spain between 2010 and 2014, when he was playing for Real Madrid and based in the Spanish capital. Forbes lists the 33-year-old as the third-wealthiest athlete in the world,external, with estimated earnings of $108m (â¬95m) a year. The case centres around lucrative image rights deals. Prosecutors say the proceeds were funnelled through low-tax companies in foreign nations to avoid paying the required tax. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? How to hide your cash In court, as part of his deal, Ronaldo acknowledged four incidents amounting to â¬5.7m owed, according to Spanish-language news agency EFE. In 2017, when the allegations first emerged, prosecutors said it was a ""voluntary and conscious breach of his fiscal obligations in Spain"". But Ronaldo's lawyers said it is all down to a misunderstanding over what was and was not required under Spanish law, and deny any deliberate attempt to evade tax. The deal, struck in June last year, had to be agreed with Spain's tax authorities. Ronaldo is not the only high-profile player to face the wrath of Spain's tax system. His former Real Madrid team-mate Xabi Alonso also appeared in court on Tuesday in connection with similar offences amounting to about â¬2m. Alonso was appearing before the court for the first time, facing a potential sentence of up to five years. Unlike Ronaldo, he has not yet struck any deal with authorities and has maintained his innocence. Shortly after Alonso's trial began, the court suspended proceedings to consider whether it was competent to hear the case, or if it should be referred to another criminal court, EFE reports. The longer sentence prosecutors are seeking means that Alonso could, unlike Ronaldo, face jail time. There are several other examples of footballers facing Spain's courts in recent years: Barcelona starLionel Messi avoided a jail sentence for a similar schemeinvolving image rights, paying several million in a ""corrective payment"" in back taxes and fines Neymar da Silva Santos JÃºniorwas at the centre of a row whenBarcelona was fined millions after being charged with tax fraud over Neymar's signing- but avoided admitting the offence Real Madrid'sMarcelo Vieiraadmitted totax fraud and accepted a four-month suspended jail sentenceover his use of foreign firms to handle almost half a million euros in earnings The recent crackdown on high-profile footballers follows the removal of a tax exemption in 2010.

"This video can not be played Travelodge Liverpool: Digger driver wrecks hotel reception A furious builder ploughed a digger through the doors of a new Travelodge hotel and repeatedly smashed into the building amid a pay dispute. The driver mounted the steps of the Liverpool hotel and went on to crash through the reception desk and windows inside as he ignored pleas to stop. Merseyside Police said a man had been located and would be interviewed as part of the investigation. Building firm Triton Construction said there had been no structural damage. The machine left a mass of broken glass and twisted metal in its wake Police arrived at the Liverpool Innovation Park hotel at about 15:00 GMT on Monday. The force spokesman said paramedics treated a man for eye irritation caused by exposure to diesel. Ceiling fixer Samuel White, 24, witnessed what happened and described the man, who had claimed to be owed about Â£600, as ""some idiot in a mini digger"" who ""decided to drive through the middle of the building"". He said the destruction went on for ""a good 20 or 30 minutes"" and had left workers ""gobsmacked"". ""The site manager was running around like a headless chicken,"" he added. Triton Construction said the man had been employed by a sub-contractor, MF Construction.

"The singer has several previous convictions for violence US singer Chris Brown has been released without charge in Paris after being questioned on suspicion of rape, French police say. An investigation into the alleged incident is continuing, the Paris prosecutor's office said. The star and two other men were arrested on Monday after a 24-year-old woman alleged she was assaulted in a hotel in the city earlier this month. After his release, Brown took to social media to deny any wrongdoing. Snapchat pulls 'awful' Chris Brown advert ""I want to make it perfectly clear, this is false,"" he wrote on Instagram, alongside a picture that said: ""This bitch lyin'."" He added in all-capitals: ""I wanna make it perfectly clear...this is false,"" before going on to say it was ""against my character and morals"". Brown's lawyer, Raphael Chiche, said the R&B singer ""energetically"" professed his innocence and intended to sue for defamation. The two men arrested with Brown, identified by French media as a bodyguard and a friend, have also reportedly been released. The alleged incident is said to have occurred at the luxury Mandarin Oriental hotel on 15 January. This isn't the singer's first encounter with the law - he has a number of previous, high-profile convictions for violence. He received five years probation and a community service order for assaulting his ex-girlfriend, Rihanna, in his car in 2009. In 2016,he was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weaponafter a woman told police he had threatened her with a gun. He was later freed, and his lawyer said the accusations against Brown were ""demonstrably false"".

"The south of Greenland viewed from the International Space Station Greenland has gone through an ""unprecedented"" period of ice loss within the last two decades. The Grace satellites revealed a four-fold increase in mass being lost from Greenland's ice sheet from 2003-2013. The study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,externalshows that ice loss subsequently stalled for 12-18 months. The research reveals how different areas of Greenland might contribute to sea-level rise in future. Scientists concerned about sea levels have long focused on Greenland's south-east and north-west regions, where glaciers continually force large chunks of ice into the Atlantic Ocean. But the largest sustained acceleration in ice loss from early 2003 to mid-2013 occurred in south-west Greenland, which is largely devoid of these large glaciers. ""Whatever this was, it couldn't be explained by glaciers, because there aren't many there,"" said the study's lead author Michael Bevis, from The Ohio State University. ""It had to be the surface mass - the ice was melting inland from the coastline."" The ice melt accelerations in this region tracked a weather phenomenon known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). When in a particular (""negative"") phase, the NAO enhances summertime warming and the solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface, while reducing snowfall - especially in western Greenland. The researchers believe the melting in south-west Greenland is a combination of climate change and conditions brought on by the NAO. ""These oscillations have been happening forever... so why only now are they causing this massive melt? It's because the atmosphere is, at its baseline, warmer. The transient warming driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation was riding on top of more sustained global warming,"" said Prof Bevis. Melting from Greenland is expected to contribute to future sea level rise The consequence of this finding is that south-west Greenland, which had not been considered a serious threat, now looks as if it will become a major future contributor to sea-level rise. ""We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers,"" said Prof Bevis. ""But now we recognise a second serious problem: Increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea."" GPS systems in place now monitor Greenland's ice around most of its margin, but the network is sparse in the south-west. Because the Grace satellites stopped taking data in 2016, it remains unclear whether the pause in melting - which began in 2013 - has now stopped or is still ongoing. Andrew Shepherd, professor of Earth observation at the University of Leeds, UK, who was not involved with the latest study, told BBC News: ""This study goes a long way towards explaining why Greenland's ice sheet stopped melting in 2013, but unfortunately the Grace satellite died in 2016 just when things started to get interesting. ""So I think we will have to look elsewhere to understand whether the pause has ended and whether it affected the ice flow."" The paper in PNAS also suggests the pause is linked to a change in the phase of the NAO - from negative to positive. Grace (the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) consisted of two Earth-orbiting satellites which took detailed measurements of gravity-field anomalies. A joint mission between Nasa and the German Aerospace Center, they were launched in March 2002. A replacement pair were put up last year, but have yet to be brought fully online. Last month, researchers reported that the Greenland melt was unprecedented in 350 years. A US research team examined ice cores,externalfrom western Greenland that record the behaviour of the ice sheet dating back to 1650. The group's analysis indicated that an uptick in melting began soon after the onset of industrial-era Arctic warming in the mid-1800s, and that the decade 2004-2013 experienced more sustained and intense melting than any other 10-year period in the 350-year record.

"This video can not be played Roads were barricaded by protesters last week Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa has broken off a trip to Europe after violent protests in his home country. Mr Mnangagwa had been due to attend the Davos economic summit where he was expected to seek investment for Zimbabwe. Ministers say the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is using sharp fuel price increases as a pretext for violence. But the MDC accuses the authorities of a brutal crackdown. Mr Mnangagwa announced a steep increase in the fuel price earlier this month. The price rises were meant to tackle fuel shortages, but mean that Zimbabwe now has the most expensive fuel in the world, according toGlobalPetrolPrices.com,external. Many Zimbabweans, worn down by years of economic hardship, have suddenly found they cannot even afford the bus fare to work. When you wait seven hours and still get no fuel The most expensive fuel in the world? 10 numbers that tell the story of Zimbabwe This has led to angry protests in the capital, Harare, and the south-western city of Bulawayo. The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO forum says at least 12 people were killed and 78 treated for gunshot injuries. The rights group also says that over 240 people have been treated after being assaulted or tortured, while the opposition says government forces have attacked people in their homes. The UN has called on the government to halt the ""excessive use of force"" by security forces, amid reports of door-to-door searches and the use of live ammunition. The government blocked Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp messaging apps last week, until a high court ordered it to restore access. Mr Mnangagwa, who arrived back in Harare late on Monday night, condemned the demonstrations, saying ""everyone has the right to protest, but this was not a peaceful protest"". He accused protesters of ""wanton violence and cynical destruction"" and ""looting police stations, stealing guns and uniforms"". It accuses the opposition MDC party of using the protests for political means. Presidential spokesman George Charamba said on Sunday: ""The MDC leadership has been consistently pushing out the message that they will use violent street action to overturn the results of [last year's] ballot."" The opposition rejected a court ruling in August 2018 that confirmed that President Mnangagwa had defeated MDC leader Nelson Chamisa. Mr Charamba warned on Sunday that the security forces' actions were just ""a foretaste of things to come"". However, Mr Mnangagwa struck a different tone on Tuesday, saying that any violence from the security forces will be investigated and punished. Allow Twitter content?

Some observers fear that the violence is a sign that the country could be returning to autocratic rule. Mr Chamisa said many of the party's members had been detained including four MPs. The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, the umbrella group that called the protests, says its leader Japhet Moyo has also been arrested. Mr Chamisa told the BBC that there was ""no justification whatsoever of having soldiers with live ammunition, with guns, machine guns, AK47 on the streets, beating up citizens"". ""People are being approached in their homes, they are being taken out of their homes with their families even if they are sleeping... a lot of people have been arrested for no apparent reason,"" he said.

MDC national chairperson Thabitha Khumalo said that she had gone into hiding after the police and military turned up at her home at night. Higher fuel prices have hit many Zimbabweans hard President Mnangagwa has defended the price rise, saying ""I was aware that these measures may not be popular... but it was the right thing to do."" The price rise was aimed at tackling shortages caused by an increase in fuel use and ""rampant"" illegal trading, he said. Mr Mnangagwa has been struggling to revive the economy, which is experiencing high inflation while wages have stagnated. It emerged on Monday that South Africa had rejected a request from Zimbabwe for an emergency loan of $1.2bn (Â£932m) in December. The government had hoped the cash would help stabilise the economy and resolve fuel shortages in the country. The most expensive fuel in the world?

"Andrew Fairlie was first diagnosed in 2005 Renowned Scottish chef Andrew Fairlie has died aged 55 following a long illness. Mr Fairlie, whose Gleneagles restaurant is the only one in Scotland to have two Michelin stars,revealed last Novemberthat he had a terminal brain tumour. His father Jim Fairlie wrote on Twitter that his son's ""many achievements and memory will live on"". He said: ""It is with enormous sadness and grief that Kay and I announce the death of our beloved son Andrew."" Mr Fairlie said his son had ""slipped away quietly this morning"" and that the chef's wife, Kate, and his family had kept vigil for him ""for some weeks"". Kate Fairlie and his daughters, Ilona and Leah, on behalf of the family, said: ""We are utterly heartbroken that Andrew has gone but are so thankful we had this extraordinary man in our lives. ""He was a beautifully kind, generous, loving son, father, husband, brother and friend, and enriched the lives of anybody lucky enough to meet him."" This video can not be played Gleneagles chef Andrew Fairlie dies Fellow Michelin star chefs Tom Kitchin and Nick Nairn paid to tribute to Mr Fairlie's impact on Scottish cooking. Mr Kitchin told BBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie Programme: ""He was the most humble, humble man, but he was a real thinker. ""What he has done for the Scottish culinary side of things is just unbelievable. ""He's taken this country to levels we never even knew existed. It's just a really, really sad day."" Nick Nairn added: ""I think it is almost impossible to overstate the loss to Scottish cooking. Andrew's legacy is going to be enormous. ""I can't imagine a world without Andrew Fairlie. I really can't."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Fairlie's legacy ""will inspire the next generation of world class chefs."" Mr Fairlie's restaurant received its first Michelin star after only eight months Mr Fairlie, who was first diagnosed in 2005, stepped down from his restaurant in November. He made the decision after doctors told him in June that no further treatment was available. Mr Fairlie was the first winner of the Roux Scholarship in 1984, aged 20, and went on to judge the competition. He opened his own restaurant within the Gleneagles Hotel in 2001. It received its first Michelin star eight months later. The restaurant was awarded a fourth AA rosette in 2004, followed by its second Michelin star in 2006. The same year Mr Fairlie was named AA Chef's Chef of the Year. Mr Fairlie was named a Relais & Chateaux Grand Chef, one of only seven in the UK, in November 2011.

"This video can not be played 'Derry is open for business', says senior police officer A series of security alerts in Londonderry on Monday were designed to ""frustrate"" an investigation into a bomb that exploded in the city centre, police have said. Three alerts - triggered when two vehicles were hijacked by masked men and a delivery van abandoned - ended in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Police said residents have returned to their homes and the alerts were hoaxes. The disruption came less than 48 hours after a bomb exploded on Saturday. Grandfather's shock over Derry bomb Timeline of Irish dissident activity Bomb was 'pointless act of terror' The bombing happened outside the Bishop Street Courthouse. The courthouse has since reopened. Police have released five men held over Saturday's bombing. A 50-year-old man arrested on Monday was released unconditionally on Tuesday afternoon. Police have said the bomb may have been carried out by dissident republican group the New IRA. A forensic officer examines the remains of the vehicle following Saturday night's explosion PSNI Supt Gordon McCalmont also said it is his understanding that the New IRA may have been behind the three security alerts on Monday. At a press conference on Monday, Mr McCalmont reiterated that police do not believe the bomb attack on Saturday was related to Brexit. In addition to the three security alerts in Derry, a controlled explosion was carried out on a suspicious object in north Belfast on Monday night. Allow Twitter content?

Supt McCalmont told BBC Radio Foyle it was his understanding that the those behind the hoax alerts in Derry ""were trying to frustrate our investigation into the initial bombing incident on Saturday"". He added that the alerts were meant to ""cause maximum disruption to the community"". This video can not be played The moment the bomb exploded on Saturday Army bomb disposal officers carried out a controlled explosion in Creggan's Circular Road after a vehicle was hijacked by three masked men at 11:30 GMT on Monday. The second alert on Southway, also in Creggan, followed reports of a vehicle being hijacked by four masked men at 13:45. In a third incident, police responded to a report of an abandoned lorry on the Northland Road close to the Glenbank Road junction and St Mary's College. A number of residents were moved from their homes as police deal with an abandoned vehicle on the Northland Road ""Three controlled explosions were carried out in total on Monday,"" Supt McCalmont said. ""There was certainly a mention of guns being shown by masked men to these people in two of the hijacking incidents. ""Only those responsible can explain why they are inflicting fear on our community."" Supt McCalmont also said no devices were found in any of the three vehicles. ""I have full organisational support and our focus is on keeping people safe. We will have proportionate operations in place. ""As a district commander, I am extremely proud of my colleagues over the past couple of days. ""We dealt with Bishop Street, we responded to 200 calls for burglaries, domestic abuse and vulnerable people. ""Although we were stretched and under pressure, we managed and delivered a service to the community."" The vehicle was engulfed with flames after Saturday's explosion Members of the DUP met Northern Ireland's chief constable on Tuesday morning to discuss recent incidents in the city and the ongoing dissident republican threat. The party's Foyle MLA Gary Middleton said the local community was suffering from continued ""disruption to basic services"" as a result of the bombing and subsequent security alerts. ""The message to the people who carried out these attacks is that you are hurting your very own people,"" he said. A DUP delegation met Northern Ireland's chief constable on Tuesday The newly reconstituted Northern Ireland Policing Board is set to meet on Thursday, the first time the oversight body will have met in two years. DUP MLA Mervyn Storey, who will sit along with Mr Middleton on the new board, said that it provided an opportunity to ""give leadership"". In Derry, St Mary's College, where the van was abandoned on the Northland Road, opened as normal on Tuesday morning. Its principal, Marie Lindsay, told BBC Radio Foyle that additional support will be provided for students who may have been affected by the security alert. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Housing Executive said one of their vans was hijacked and that a contractor they work with has withdrawn services in the Bishop Street, Brandywell, Creggan, Rosemount and Rossville areas until further notice.

"Predicting the result of the Oscars can be a tricky business. Especially as the Academy's membership, which votes for the awards, is changing year by year. Efforts to make it less old and less white have resulted in a significant influx of younger voters, people from ethnic minorities and a wider spread of international members. With multiple nominations in each category, perhaps the most visible effect of the changing nature of the Academy will be seen in who wins, rather than who is nominated. But Tuesday may still potentially tell us a lot, and might also provide a distraction from the fact that with the ceremony just weeks away,the Academy has yet to announce a new host. Here are seven things to look out for: The Hollywood remake of a remake of a remake, A Star Is Born looks likely to grab the most nominations, with The Favourite, Roma and maybe First Man not far behind. However, the film with the most nominations isn't automatically the favourite to win best film. In recent years, Gravity, The Revenant and La La Land have topped the list but then gone on to lose best picture. Black Panther would be a popular choice for cinemagoers If the Marvel film gets a best picture nomination, it will make history as the first comic book superhero movie to be recognised in this way. It will also delight the people behind the Oscars who are keen to make the ceremony more relevant to audiences - Black Panther was the biggest film of 2018 at the US box office. If, as seems inevitable, Roma gets a best picture nomination, it will be the first Netflix film to be up for best film. With much of Hollywood split over whether the streaming service represents a huge threat or a huge boost to the future of cinema, in awards terms this reflects the ability of the streaming service and its huge financial coffers to attract some of the cinema's best film makers. The director of Roma is widely expected to get a best director nomination. But he also looks likely to be recognised for producing, writing, editing and cinematography. If you throw in an inevitable best foreign language film nomination (strictly the country is the official nominee, but the director picks up the award and their name goes on the statuette), then he'll be widely regarded as becoming only the second person ever to get nominated in six different categories in one year. (The first was Walt Disney.) Olivia Colman and Lady Gaga could go head-to-head for best actress It would be a big surprise if there weren't British performers in all four acting categories. Christian Bale and Olivia Colman are considered dead certs in the leading categories, as is Richard E Grant for supporting actor. While either Rachel Weisz or Claire Foy, or perhaps both, should land supporting actress nominations. As is customary, a wide array of UK talent should be evident behind the camera, ranging from Jim Beach and Graham King who produced Bohemian Rhapsody to Deborah Davis and Sandy Powell, for screenwriting and costume design (The Favourite). First Man's production designer Nathan Crowley and music super-producer Mark Ronson, who co-wrote Shallow for A Star Is Born, could also make the cut. Ah yes, the Corboulds! If Paul Corbould is nominated for his visual effects work on Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, it will mean that for seven years in a row a Corbould sibling has landed an Oscar nomination, underlining their status as one of the Oscars' most ubiquitous families. His brothers Chris and Neil have gone on to win Oscars in the past. Paul has been nominated twice but never won.

"Katie Price with her son Harvey, who was trolled online because of his disabilities People with disabilities have shared accounts of the online abuse they face, after MPs backed a petition by model Katie Price calling for new laws. More than 220,000 people signed reality TV star Ms Price's petition to make online abuse a criminal offence. Actress Samantha Renke, who has brittle bone disease, said she received social media messages calling her ""vile"" and saying ""real humans walk on two legs"". ""It's most certainly affected my mental health,"" she told the BBC. Ms Price - who used to be known as Jordan - created the petition after raising awareness of the trolling that her son Harvey, who has disabilities, received. Now MPs on the Petitions Committee want to give disabled people protection under hate crime laws. The politicians said self-regulation of social media ""has failed disabled people"" and internet giants must also ""accept responsibility"" over abuse. C4 adverts to feature online abuse Javid threatens tech giants over child abuse Internet laws pledged as firms snub talks When having fun on Twitter went awry for Brent ""Harvey's experience is not unique,"" said Labour MP Helen Jones, who chairs the committee. ""Social media is rife with horrendous, degrading and dehumanising comments about people with disabilities. ""The law on online abuse is not fit for purpose and it is truly shameful that disabled people have been forced off social media while their abusers face no consequences."" Ms Renke, who is also a disability campaigner, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When I did a well-known commercial I had this influx of abuse online mostly on platforms such as Twitter. Samantha Renke said she used to be a teacher and saw how online bullying can affect her students ""It came as a real shock to me as I never experienced that in real life. And all of a sudden I was being targeted not because people didn't like my personality but specifically because of my disability. ""They are saying 'oh my goodness what is that. She is vile. She makes me feel sick. Real humans walk on two legs'. They're the kind of more milder ones. ""I do honestly believe this comes from a fear of not knowing what disability means. In the UK we still feel very awkward around disability."" She added: ""For those who say just ignore it, sticks and stones, words don't hurt you. Actually words can affect your mental health, it's most certainly affected my mental health. Kevin Healey, who has autism, received disability abuse on social media and quit Twitter for a while to avoid it. ""They [abusers] were cloning my Twitter account and pretending to be me and impersonating me,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show. ""I did quit Twitter a few years back but I'm now back on Twitter because it's my voice, it's part of me communicating to the outside world."" Amy Clarke, a digital assistant at the learning disability charity Mencap, said she joined a group on Facebook and was called the R-word. This video can not be played Katie Price: âHe canât speak to defend himself, I canâ Ms Price, a mother-of-five, told the MPs in evidence that ""the most horrific things"" had been said about 16-year-old Harvey, who is partially blind, autistic and has the genetic disorder Prader-Willi syndrome. ""They know he hasn't got a voice back and they mock him more... they find him an easy target,"" she said in February last year. On Tuesday, she tweeted that she was pleased MPs had backed her campaign. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Unlike race and religion,there are no,externalspecific disability-related criminal offences. Instead, if the offence was motivated by disability, the sentence for the crime can be increased. The committee of an MPs launched an inquiry in response to the petition, which was closed early due to the 2017 general election. After hearing from disabled people how online abuse could destroy careers, social lives and cause lasting damage to people's health, the MPs made a string of recommendations in a report published on Tuesday. They included giving disabled people the same protections under hate crime laws as those who suffered abuse due to race or religion and a review of the law on ""mate crime"" - exploitation within friendships or relationships. The MPs said a similar check to that used for child sex offenders should also make it possible to see whether someone had been convicted of a hate crime on the grounds of disability before employing them. Other recommendations included: the government and social media companies directly consult disabled people on digital strategy and hate crime law a review of the experience of disabled people in reporting crimes and giving evidence, because ""too many disabled people have not been treated seriously because front-line officers and staff do not understand disability"" social media companies accept their responsibility for allowing toxic environments to exist unchallenged to require proportionate representation of disabled people in government advertising Ms Price's petition had called on the government to ""make online abuse a specific criminal offence and create a register of offenders"", noting that it affected people ""from every walk of life"" and included ""racism, homophobia, body shaming and a whole range of other hate speech"". However, the committee focused on comments aimed at people with disabilities, to avoid duplicating the work of MPs elsewhere. Last year, the then Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not have enough power to police social media companies, after admitting only four of 14 invited to talks had showed up. He told the BBC it had given him ""a big impetus"" to introduce new laws to tackle what he has called the internet's ""Wild West"" culture.

"Shepherd let Charlotte Brown drive his speedboat for a ""thrill"", the Old Bailey heard A man who killed a woman in a speedboat crash on the River Thames has been in Georgia since March, the BBC has learned. Jack Shepherd went on the run before he was convicted last July forthe manslaughter of Charlotte Brown. The BBC has been told ""there are records"" of Shepherd being in the Georgian capital Tbilisi and ""no sign"" he had left the former Soviet state. The Met Police and the Home Office declined to comment on his whereabouts. Miss Brown's family are due to meet Home Secretary Sajid Javid later to discuss what has been done since Shepherd was convicted. He first appeared at the Old Bailey on 26 January, where he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. Charlotte Brown, known as Charli, was a business development consultant from London Judge Richard Marks QC released the 31-year-old on unconditional bail. However, Shepherd failed to show up for his three-week trial at the Old Bailey. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Can a fugitive remain on the run forever? Charlotte Brown's family want Prime Minister's help What do we know about the case? He was found guilty of the manslaughter by gross negligence of 24-year-old Miss Brown by a majority of 11-1 and sentenced to six years in his absence. Following his conviction an international arrest warrant was issued, meaning other law enforcement agencies across the world have been alerted. This video can not be played Charlotte Brown's sister Katie (middle) appealed for Shepherd to ""take responsibility for the devastation he has caused our family"" After meeting on the dating website OkCupid, Shepherd took Miss Brown on a date on 8 December 2015.

"This video can not be played Sir David told Prince William it was ""difficult to overstate"" the threat of climate change Sir David Attenborough has told Prince William that people have never been more ""out of touch"" with the natural world than they are today. In an interview with the prince at the World Economic Forum, the naturalist warned: ""We can wreck it with ease, we can wreck it without even noticing."" Sir David said people must care, respect and revere the natural world. Heeding his words, the prince said: ""Work to save the planet is probably going to largely happen on our watch"". Sir David, 92, said: ""When I started 60 years ago in the mid-50s, to be truthful, I don't think there was anybody who thought that there was a danger that we might annihilate part of the natural world."" In his early career, he said, simply showing people a new animal on television would astound them. Even then, he added: ""Television in Britain in the 50s was only seen by a few million people in southern England."" Climate change 'greatest threat', Attenborough says Attenborough takes seat at climate talks Full coverage of Davos 2019,external Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, the Blue Planet and Dynasties narrator said: ""Now we can go everywhere, we can go into the bottom of the sea, we can go into space, we can use drones, we can use helicopters, we can use macroworlds, we can speed things up, we can slow things down, we can film in the darkness - and so the natural world has never been exposed to this degree before."" His new series, Our Planet, due to air on Netflix, could reach 150 million people immediately, he said, ""and go on being seen - by word of mouth"". Despite this, he said, with more people than ever living in towns, ""the paradox (is) that there has never been a time when more people are out of touch with the natural world than there's now"". He warned: ""It's not just a question of beauty or interest or wonder, it's the essential ingredient, essential part of human life is a healthy planet. ""We are in the danger of wrecking that"". He said that for a very long time people have viewed the natural world in opposition to the urban world. ""It is not, we are all one world,"" he said, adding that global leaders are beginning to see that everything we do has implications. He said: ""That fundamental, beautiful fact is now being recognised."" Sir David was given a Crystal Award at the forum on Monday for his leadership in environmental stewardship In his interview with the Duke of Cambridge, Sir David said it was ""difficult to overstate"" the climate change crisis. He added: ""We are now so numerous, so powerful, so all pervasive, the mechanisms we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening that we can exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it. ""We have now to be really aware of the dangers that we are doing. ""And we already know that of course the plastics problem in the seas is wreaking appalling damage on marine life - the extent of which we don't yet fully know."" Last year, Sir David said he was ""astonished"" by the response toBlue Planet II, which raised the issue of single-use plastics and the damage they were doing to the world's oceans. Sir David was given a Crystal Award at the forum on Monday for his leadership in environmental stewardship. Accepting the award, the veteran broadcaster urged leaders to come up with ""practical solutions"". He told the prince: ""The point is that we have this option ahead of us - we have to take the option to protect the natural worldâ¦ that's where the future lies. ""There's a source of great optimism there, we have the knowledge, we have the power, to live in harmony with that natural world"". Prince William has previously described Sir David as having ""the single most important impact in my conservation thinking"". Introducing Sir David, he said it was a ""personal treat"" to interview the broadcaster. In a BBC tribute programme marking Sir David's 90th birthday in 2016, the duke called him a ""national treasure"". He added: ""I used to love, and I still do, but when I was a young boy, used to love turning on the television and watching David's programmes and really feeling like I was back out in Africa or I was learning about something magical and almost out of this planet."" The duke said: ""There is something very reassuring about seeing David Attenborough on BBC One doing his documentaries. It is part of the national psyche now."" The Queen and Sir David came together last year for an ITV documentary Sir David turned 90 in the same year as the Queen, andpaid his own tributeat her official birthday celebrations at St Paul's Cathedral. They also took part in an ITV documentary last year which looked at the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy project. Sir David and the Queen, who were born just weeks apart, chuckled over a forlorn-looking tree in the Buckingham Palace grounds which the Queen suggested had been ""sat on"" at a garden party. Attenborough 'astonished' by Blue Planet impact Climate change: explained in 90 seconds When Sir David suggested climate change might lead to ""all kinds of different trees growing here in another 50 years"", the Queen quipped: ""It might easily be, yes. I won't be here though."" Prince William, who is patron of the Tusk conservation charity, has in the past warned over the impact of the ivory trade and wildlife trafficking. In 2016, he urged the UK government to push ahead with atotal ban on the ivory trade in a bid to protect elephants. He also voiced concerns that the African elephant may have disappeared from the wild by the time his daughter Princess Charlotte is 25.

The plane left Nantes in north west France at 19:15 and had been flying at 5,000ft when it contacted Jersey air traffic control requesting descent, Guernsey Police said.

Police said on Tuesday more than 1,150sq miles had been searched by five aircraft and two lifeboats. The search had resumed after being called off overnight ""due to strengthening winds, worsening sea conditions and reducing visibility"". Cardiff Airport confirmed the aircraft was due to arrive from Nantes at 20:45 but ""did not arrive as planned.

The driver mounted the steps of the Liverpool hotel and went on to crash through the reception desk and windows inside as he ignored pleas to stop. Merseyside Police said a man had been located and would be interviewed as part of the investigation. Building firm Triton Construction said there had been no structural damage. The machine left a mass of broken glass and twisted metal in its wake Police arrived at the Liverpool Innovation Park hotel at about 15:00 GMT on Monday. The force spokesman said paramedics treated a man for eye irritation caused by exposure to diesel. Ceiling fixer Samuel White, 24, witnessed what happened and described the man, who had claimed to be owed about Â£600, as ""some idiot in a mini digger"" who ""decided to drive through the middle of the building"". He said the destruction went on for ""a good 20 or 30 minutes"" and had left workers ""gobsmacked"". ""The site manager was running around like a headless chicken,"" he added. Triton Construction said the man had been employed by a sub-contractor, MF Construction.

"Police found the three bodies in a house in Arthur Street, Little Lever A mother in her 20s and her two young daughters have been found dead at a house in Bolton. Police found the bodies of Tiffany Stevens and Casey, aged three, and one-year-old Darcey, at Arthur Street in Little Lever at 15:50 GMT on Monday. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was an ""incredibly tragic incident"", but it was not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Neighbour Annmarie Crossland, 36, said Ms Stevens was a ""brilliant mum"". She added: ""They were gorgeous little kids. Great, really nice. She would take them to the park and into Bolton. They were very friendly."" Ms Crossland said she was first alerted something was wrong when Ms Stevens's brother and ex-boyfriend were heard ""screaming and shouting"" in the alleyway at the back of the house before another neighbour rang 999 on Monday afternoon. She said: ""Paramedics arrived first and shot off down the back, then another came and then just all police covered the whole street."" Police said they had been responding to reports of concern for the welfare of a woman Paul Nash, who lives on the same street, said neighbours were in shock. ""You can't believe what's happened,"" he said. Betty Bray added: ""It's awful. They'd only just started growing up so it does upset you."" What is thought to have been a gas engineer was seen at the mid-terrace house earlier, but police told the BBC there is no evidence of carbon monoxide at the house.

"Luigi di Maio accused France of fuelling migration by damaging the economies of African states France has summoned Italy's ambassador after the Italian deputy prime minister accused the French of exploiting Africa and fuelling migration. On Sunday, Luigi di Maio called on the European Union to impose sanctions on France for its policies in Africa. He said France had ""never stopped colonising tens of African states"". Italy's populist leadership has repeatedly clashed with France in recent months, on issues such as migration, protests and culture. As Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte tried to soothe the row on Tuesday, highlighting the two countries' ""solid friendship"", right-wing Interior Minister Matteo Salvini appeared to intensify it, condemning France's Emmanuel Macron as a ""terrible president"". Ever since Italy's Five Star and League parties came to power in June 2018 relations have been tense. Much of the tension has been about migration. The two countries have argued over France sending back migrants across Italy's northern border. WhenFrance criticised Italy for not allowing rescue boats carrying migrants in the Mediterranean to dock, Italy responded by accusing France itself of refusing to accept migrants. Who is responsible for migrants at sea? Migration to Europe in charts But the rows have spilled into other areas. Right-wing Interior Minister Matteo Salvini accused France last week of harbouring 14 ""terrorists"" wanted by Italy, after a fugitive ex-militant was extradited from Bolivia. He said they should be sent back to Italy to end up in jail, rather than ""quaffing champagne under the Eiffel Tower"". Coalition colleague Mr Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S) has found common cause with France's ""gilets jaunes"" protesters, urging them not to give up and offering them ""the support you need"". He made his latest comments during a visit to central Italy at the weekend. It came as the UN said about170 migrants were feared drownedin two separate Mediterranean shipwrecks. ""The EU should impose sanctions on France and all countries like France that impoverish Africa and make these people leave, because Africans should be in Africa, not at the bottom of the Mediterranean,"" he said. ""If people are leaving today it's because European countries, France above all, have never stopped colonising dozens of African countries."" He said if it wasn't for Africa, France would rank 15th among world economies, not in the top six. The Italian ambassador to France, Teresa Castaldo, was summoned to the foreign ministry in Paris on Monday. French diplomatic sources quoted by Italian news agency Ansa called Mr Di Maio's remarks ""hostile and without cause given the partnership between France and Italy in the European Union"". More than 4,200 migrants are reported to have crossed to Europe in the first 16 days of 2019 Mr Di Maio, who is also labour and economy minister, was unrepentant. He accused France of manipulating the economies of African countries that use the CFA franc, a colonial-era currency backed by the French treasury. ""France is one of those countries that by printing money for 14 African states prevents their economic development and contributes to the fact that the refugees leave and then die in the sea or arrive on our coasts,"" he said. ""If Europe wants to be brave, it must have the courage to confront the issue of decolonisation in Africa."" Mr Salvini agreed, labelling France as ""one of those countries"" that take Africa's wealth away. Can 'voluntary colonialism' stop migration from Africa to Europe? Mediterranean migrant crossings 'deadlier than ever' Sharp fall in illegal migration to EU France says the CFA franc is a guarantee of financial stability but others have attacked it as a colonial relic and opposition to it has grown in recent years. The CFA franc is split into two zones, in eight countries that make up the West African Economic and Monetary Union and a further six in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community. Dating back to December 1945, when it was tied to the French franc,the CFA franc has since 1999 been pegged to the euro,external. Currently a euro is worth 656 CFA francs. While the French central bank guarantees the currency, the 14 countries that use it have to deposit half their foreign exchange reserves in a French treasury account. Supporters point to the currency's stability and credibility. Critics say many of the 14 countries that use the CFA franc are impoverished and complain that it holds back economic and political development. In 2017, controversial Franco-Beninese activist KÃ©mi SÃ©ba was thrown out of Senegal after he burned a 5,000 CFA note.

"This video can not be played Sir David told Prince William it was ""difficult to overstate"" the threat of climate change Sir David Attenborough has told Prince William that people have never been more ""out of touch"" with the natural world than they are today. In an interview with the prince at the World Economic Forum, the naturalist warned: ""We can wreck it with ease, we can wreck it without even noticing."" Sir David said people must care, respect and revere the natural world. Heeding his words, the prince said: ""Work to save the planet is probably going to largely happen on our watch"". Sir David, 92, said: ""When I started 60 years ago in the mid-50s, to be truthful, I don't think there was anybody who thought that there was a danger that we might annihilate part of the natural world."" In his early career, he said, simply showing people a new animal on television would astound them. Even then, he added: ""Television in Britain in the 50s was only seen by a few million people in southern England."" Climate change 'greatest threat', Attenborough says Attenborough takes seat at climate talks Full coverage of Davos 2019,external Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, the Blue Planet and Dynasties narrator said: ""Now we can go everywhere, we can go into the bottom of the sea, we can go into space, we can use drones, we can use helicopters, we can use macroworlds, we can speed things up, we can slow things down, we can film in the darkness - and so the natural world has never been exposed to this degree before."" His new series, Our Planet, due to air on Netflix, could reach 150 million people immediately, he said, ""and go on being seen - by word of mouth"". Despite this, he said, with more people than ever living in towns, ""the paradox (is) that there has never been a time when more people are out of touch with the natural world than there's now"". He warned: ""It's not just a question of beauty or interest or wonder, it's the essential ingredient, essential part of human life is a healthy planet. ""We are in the danger of wrecking that"". He said that for a very long time people have viewed the natural world in opposition to the urban world. ""It is not, we are all one world,"" he said, adding that global leaders are beginning to see that everything we do has implications. He said: ""That fundamental, beautiful fact is now being recognised."" Sir David was given a Crystal Award at the forum on Monday for his leadership in environmental stewardship In his interview with the Duke of Cambridge, Sir David said it was ""difficult to overstate"" the climate change crisis. He added: ""We are now so numerous, so powerful, so all pervasive, the mechanisms we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening that we can exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it. ""We have now to be really aware of the dangers that we are doing. ""And we already know that of course the plastics problem in the seas is wreaking appalling damage on marine life - the extent of which we don't yet fully know."" Last year, Sir David said he was ""astonished"" by the response toBlue Planet II, which raised the issue of single-use plastics and the damage they were doing to the world's oceans. Sir David was given a Crystal Award at the forum on Monday for his leadership in environmental stewardship. Accepting the award, the veteran broadcaster urged leaders to come up with ""practical solutions"". He told the prince: ""The point is that we have this option ahead of us - we have to take the option to protect the natural worldâ¦ that's where the future lies. ""There's a source of great optimism there, we have the knowledge, we have the power, to live in harmony with that natural world"". Prince William has previously described Sir David as having ""the single most important impact in my conservation thinking"". Introducing Sir David, he said it was a ""personal treat"" to interview the broadcaster. In a BBC tribute programme marking Sir David's 90th birthday in 2016, the duke called him a ""national treasure"". He added: ""I used to love, and I still do, but when I was a young boy, used to love turning on the television and watching David's programmes and really feeling like I was back out in Africa or I was learning about something magical and almost out of this planet."" The duke said: ""There is something very reassuring about seeing David Attenborough on BBC One doing his documentaries. It is part of the national psyche now."" The Queen and Sir David came together last year for an ITV documentary Sir David turned 90 in the same year as the Queen, andpaid his own tributeat her official birthday celebrations at St Paul's Cathedral. They also took part in an ITV documentary last year which looked at the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy project. Sir David and the Queen, who were born just weeks apart, chuckled over a forlorn-looking tree in the Buckingham Palace grounds which the Queen suggested had been ""sat on"" at a garden party. Attenborough 'astonished' by Blue Planet impact Climate change: explained in 90 seconds When Sir David suggested climate change might lead to ""all kinds of different trees growing here in another 50 years"", the Queen quipped: ""It might easily be, yes. I won't be here though."" Prince William, who is patron of the Tusk conservation charity, has in the past warned over the impact of the ivory trade and wildlife trafficking. In 2016, he urged the UK government to push ahead with atotal ban on the ivory trade in a bid to protect elephants. He also voiced concerns that the African elephant may have disappeared from the wild by the time his daughter Princess Charlotte is 25.

"The drone sightings led to many people being stranded at Gatwick EasyJet has said last month's drone disruption at Gatwick was a ""wake-up call"" for airports. The drones caused blanket cancellations over a number of days in December and mass passenger disruption as a result. The airline said the drones cost it Â£15m in passenger compensation,externaland lost revenues, and hit 82,000 customers. EasyJet's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said he was ""disappointed"" the airport took so long to resolve the situation and reopen the runways. He acknowledged it was a ""criminal act"" and difficult to guard against. More than 400 EasyJet flights were cancelled due to the drone sightings. Altogether, more than 1,000 flights were grounded and around 140,000 passengers affected. EasyJet paid out Â£10m in ""customer welfare costs"" and said it had lost Â£5m of revenue due to flight cancellations. However, the carrier said it had made a good start to the financial year and was ""well prepared"" for Brexit. Passenger numbers rose by 15% to 21.6 million for the last three months of 2018. Last week,rival carrier Ryanair cut its profit forecast blaming lower-than-expected air fares. In contrast, Easyjet said that it had seen ""robust"" demand from customers. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""For the first half of 2019, booking levels currently remain encouraging despite the lack of certainty around Brexit for our customers. ""Second half bookings continue to be ahead of last year and our expectations for the full year headline profit before tax are broadly in line with current market expectations."" He also said he was ""proud"" of the way staff worked around the clock to look after customers affected by the drone incident. Easyjet's Brexit planning includes registering 130 aircraft in Austria and building up a pool of spare parts in the EU. It added that both the EU and the UK have committed to ensure that flights between the UK and EU will continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The drone disruption at Gatwick in December means these results aren't quite what EasyJet was hoping for at the start of the year, but it hasn't blown things too far off course. ""New planes have driven substantial increases in passengers and revenues, and the group's also getting better at selling passengers additional services - think extra leg room, priority boarding and microwaved paninis.""

The drones caused blanket cancellations over a number of days in December and mass passenger disruption as a result. The airline said the drones cost it Â£15m in passenger compensation,externaland lost revenues, and hit 82,000 customers. EasyJet's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said he was ""disappointed"" the airport took so long to resolve the situation and reopen the runways. He acknowledged it was a ""criminal act"" and difficult to guard against. More than 400 EasyJet flights were cancelled due to the drone sightings. Altogether, more than 1,000 flights were grounded and around 140,000 passengers affected. EasyJet paid out Â£10m in ""customer welfare costs"" and said it had lost Â£5m of revenue due to flight cancellations. However, the carrier said it had made a good start to the financial year and was ""well prepared"" for Brexit. Passenger numbers rose by 15% to 21.6 million for the last three months of 2018. Last week,rival carrier Ryanair cut its profit forecast blaming lower-than-expected air fares. In contrast, Easyjet said that it had seen ""robust"" demand from customers. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""For the first half of 2019, booking levels currently remain encouraging despite the lack of certainty around Brexit for our customers. ""Second half bookings continue to be ahead of last year and our expectations for the full year headline profit before tax are broadly in line with current market expectations."" He also said he was ""proud"" of the way staff worked around the clock to look after customers affected by the drone incident. Easyjet's Brexit planning includes registering 130 aircraft in Austria and building up a pool of spare parts in the EU. It added that both the EU and the UK have committed to ensure that flights between the UK and EU will continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The drone disruption at Gatwick in December means these results aren't quite what EasyJet was hoping for at the start of the year, but it hasn't blown things too far off course. ""New planes have driven substantial increases in passengers and revenues, and the group's also getting better at selling passengers additional services - think extra leg room, priority boarding and microwaved paninis.""

"Police found the three bodies in a house in Arthur Street, Little Lever A mother in her 20s and her two young daughters have been found dead at a house in Bolton. Police found the bodies of Tiffany Stevens and Casey, aged three, and one-year-old Darcey, at Arthur Street in Little Lever at 15:50 GMT on Monday. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was an ""incredibly tragic incident"", but it was not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Neighbour Annmarie Crossland, 36, said Ms Stevens was a ""brilliant mum"". She added: ""They were gorgeous little kids. Great, really nice. She would take them to the park and into Bolton. They were very friendly."" Ms Crossland said she was first alerted something was wrong when Ms Stevens's brother and ex-boyfriend were heard ""screaming and shouting"" in the alleyway at the back of the house before another neighbour rang 999 on Monday afternoon. She said: ""Paramedics arrived first and shot off down the back, then another came and then just all police covered the whole street."" Police said they had been responding to reports of concern for the welfare of a woman Paul Nash, who lives on the same street, said neighbours were in shock. ""You can't believe what's happened,"" he said. Betty Bray added: ""It's awful. They'd only just started growing up so it does upset you."" What is thought to have been a gas engineer was seen at the mid-terrace house earlier, but police told the BBC there is no evidence of carbon monoxide at the house. Supt Rick Jackson said: ""This is an incredibly tragic incident and we have specialist officers supporting the family at this unimaginably difficult time.

"The bikini shots from her successful summits had gained her many followers A Taiwanese hiker known for posting bikini clad photos from mountain summits has died after falling into a ravine during a solo trek. Gigi Wu managed to contact emergency services but bad weather delayed rescue operations, local media reports say. The 36-year-old is thought to have died of hypothermia. She was a popular figure on social media and messages on her Facebook pages pay tribute to her as an inspirational hiker. Ms Wu was alone on a multi-day tour in Yushan National Park, home to Taiwan's highest peaks which reach almost 4,000 metres (13,000 ft), the reports say. While she was famous for posting pictures of herself in bikinis from summits, she was an experienced hiker, appearing to use proper equipment and precautions during her expeditions. Gigi Wu was a long-time experienced hiker According to Taiwan News, bad weather had prevented a rescue helicopter from reaching her three times. A rescue mission was eventually sent out on foot. Her body was found on Monday after temperatures had been around freezing point during the previous night, the Liberty Times cited rescue operators as saying. On 24 December, she had already posted a picture of her legs badly bruised writing in the comment that she slipped from the path and easily could have fallen further. In a 2018 interview cited in Focus Taiwan,external, she said she first had the idea of posting bikini photos after losing a bet with a friend. Student dies in 500ft Ben Nevis fall Blind Brit climbs Europe's highest mountain Her last Facebook post to her more than 18,000 followers is dated 18 January and shows the view from a mountain above the clouds. More than 1,000 people have since commented. Many posts were following the dramatic rescue operation, when it was not clear whether she was still alive. Later comments express their condolences, applauding her for having been an inspiration to the hiking community. One fan, Michelle Tang, wrote on Facebook: ""Beautiful and brave little Gâ¦ thank you for letting everyone see your beautiful scenic photos."" Another, Senzhong Shaoxian, wrote: ""Gigi, thank you for filling us all with happiness - I wish you happy travels.""

"Suspected trafficking or modern slavery victims are being put at risk by delays in the system designed to protect them, a BBC investigation has found. Government documents obtained by Radio 4's File on 4 show 2,200 people waiting more than a year for a decision on their status in the UK. Memos reveal officials were concerned the system left people ""in limbo"". The Home Office says it is committed to reforms and has more than doubled its case workers to reduce the backlog. The documents seen by BBC relate to the situation as of November 2018. They also reveal more than 1,000 people had been awaiting a decision for over 18 months at that point, while 100 had been waiting about three years. Internal memos dated September 2017 reveal government officials were concerned about ""an antiquated system"" that made intelligence ""difficult to analyse"", and ""substantial delays"" that left suspected victims ""in limbo"". Modern slavery review as gangs 'evolve' Human trafficking: The trade in lives TheNational Referral Mechanism,external, or NRM, is the government system designed to identify and support victims, while making the prosecution of traffickers easier. Suspected victims are given 45 days to recover while the Home Office investigates their case. A decision on whether their claim is genuine should be made ""as soon as possible"" after this. A positive decision could affect their immigration status and the likelihood of them facing criminal charges. But charities say that in practice long delays can cause unnecessary suffering, stop people  moving on with their lives and expose them to the risk of being trafficked again. The story of Peter, not his real name, began in Nigeria where he was raised by a guardian. When he reached his teens, an exciting opportunity arose - football scouts arrived in town. There were to be trials and the best players would be awarded contracts in Europe. Peter's talents were quickly spotted. ""It was the best news of my life,"" he says, ""a dream come true."" But there was a sinister purpose to the trials - the scouts were looking for the most suitable victims for child trafficking. When Peter arrived at Heathrow, he was whisked off to a house, locked in a room and abused by a succession of men. It was only when his trafficker came home drunk one evening and left a key out that Peter was able to escape. After a period of homelessness, he eventually made contact with children's charity Every Child Protected Against Trafficking (ECPAT) and was placed on the NRM. Peter was hoping for a decision about his future within a few weeks but it never came. A year passed, then two, then three. All the time, he was worried about deportation. ""It's horrible. You can't go forwards, you can't go backwards,"" he says, ""Sometimes you just feel like taking your own life."" Kate Roberts, from the Human Trafficking Foundation, said such an experience was ""hugely damaging"". ""We are talking about people who have left a situation of control and then they've entered another system where they have no time frame, no control,"" she said. It is during that period, of delays and uncertainty, that alleged victims are most vulnerable to being re-trafficked. Vinh was trafficked and made to work on a cannabis farm Vinh, again not his real name, was first picked up in a police raid on a cannabis farm. He was a teenager, locked inside, no papers, no English - but the warning signs were not spotted. He was jailed for 12 months.  It was only towards the end of his sentence that an official recognised that he was a victim rather than a perpetrator and referred him to the NRM. However, Vinh owed money to his traffickers and the NRM does not allow alleged victims to work. So he ran away and ended up back on a cannabis farm. Det Supt Phil Brewer, head of the Anti-Trafficking Unit at the Metropolitan Police, told the BBC delays could ""impact massively"" on its ability to prosecute. ""But this isn't just about prosecutionâ¦ success also needs to be judged on the fact we have removed someone from an exploitative situation and given them a second chance."" In a statement the Home Office said as well as tackling delays by doubling the amount of case workers on the NRM, it was making the system fairer by placing decision-making under a single unit. For Peter, the footballer, receiving a positive decision, even after three years, was ""amazing"". ""That day,"" he says, ""a lot of people said, 'Your face is bright, you are happy,' it was just a huge relief.""

The search had resumed after being called off overnight ""due to strengthening winds, worsening sea conditions and reducing visibility"". Cardiff Airport confirmed the aircraft was due to arrive from Nantes at 20:45 but ""did not arrive as planned.

Police said residents have been allowed to return to their homes following the alerts, which were confirmed as hoaxes. An alert in north Belfast on Monday night has also been confirmed as a hoax. The disruption in Derry came 48 hours after a bomb exploded in the city. The area around the courthouse in Bishop Street, where the bomb exploded in a car on Saturday, has reopened. Grandfather's shock over Derry bomb The PSNI have said Saturday's bomb attack may have been carried out by dissident republican group the New IRA. Four out of five men held over the bombing have been released. A 50-year-old man arrested on Monday remains in police custody. Members of the DUP are to meet Northern Ireland's chief constable on Tuesday morning to discuss recent incidents in the city and the ongoing dissident republican threat. A number of residents were moved from their homes as police deal with an abandoned vehicle on the Northland Road Police said that while the alerts were hoaxes ""we cannot underestimate the impact these incidents have had on our community"". ""The occupants of the hijacked vehicles did not believe when they set out for work this morning that they would be threatened by masked men,"" said Supt Gordon McCalmont. ""The residents in Circular Road, Southway and Northland Road did not wake up today expecting to be asked to leave their homes for their own safety.

Timeline of Irish dissident activity Four arrests over 'reckless' attack Bomb explodes in car at courthouse Bomb was 'pointless act of terror' On Monday, the Army was called to two security alerts in the city involving reported hijackings. Army bomb disposal officers carried out a controlled explosion in Creggan's Circular Road after a vehicle was hijacked by three masked men at 11:30 GMT on Monday. The second alert on Southway, also in Creggan, followed reports of a vehicle being hijacked by four masked men at 13:45 GMT. In a third incident, police responded to a report of an abandoned lorry on the Northland Road close to the Glenbank Road junction and St Mary's College. In north Belfast, a controlled explosion was carried out on a suspicious object in the area of Springfield Road and Lanark Way. Residents returned to their home shortly after midnight.

The school principal Marie Lindsay told BBC Radio Foyle that additional support will be provided for students who may have been affected by the security alert. A number of residents were moved from their homes. A nearby community centre was opened to people who were affected. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Housing Executive said one of their vans was hijacked and that a contractor they work with has withdrawn services in the Bishop Street, Brandywell, Creggan, Rosemount and Rossville areas until further notice. SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said the area was largely populated by older people. ""When you see frail pensioners in their late 80s and 90s being forced to leave their homes in their dressing gowns, it really is despicable.

Supt McCalmont also said the pizza delivery driver whose vehicle was hijacked and used in Saturday's bombing ""had to go through the drama of having a firearm put to his head"".

"Claim:Labour is proposing a new permanent customs union with the European Union (EU) after Brexit which would allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Reality Check Verdict:EU law currently does not allow non-EU members to have a formal say or veto in its trade talks. Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past and its proposal cannot be ruled out until the party has had a chance to negotiate formally. There's renewed focus on Labour's Brexit policy as Theresa May holds discussions with opposition MPs, in the wake of the historic defeat of her Brexit deal. One area under the spotlight is Labour's plan for the UK to have a new permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit and the power to have a say in future EU trade talks. The idea that the UK would be allowed such a say has been dismissed by Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary. He's declared Labour's position ""an unprecedented legal and political novelty of the kind that is rightly called a unicorn"". So how realistic is Labour's plan? The purpose of a customs union is to make trade easier. Countries in a customs union agree not to impose charges - known as tariffs - or custom checks on each other's goods. The rules also mean that any goods coming in from the rest of the world pay the same tariff - irrespective of where in the customs union those goods first enter. This is known as a common tariff. For example, a car from the US entering the EU customs union currently attracts a tariff of 10% of the car's value. It doesn't matter if the car arrives in France, Spain or anywhere else - the same one-off 10% charge is applied. That car can then move between all the customs union countries without incurring extra costs or custom checks. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The EU customs union includes the 28 EU member states as well as Monaco. The EU also has customs union arrangements with non-EU members: Turkey, Andorra and San Marino. But under (the EU's) customs union rules, members cannot negotiate their own independent trade deals with countries from the rest of the world. Instead, free trade deals (ie agreements that reduce or eliminate tariffs between countries) can only be negotiated by the EU as a whole. As a result, Theresa May's government has ruled out remaining in the customs union after Brexit, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past At the moment, the EU is negotiating trade agreements with21 countries,external. So what are the chances of Labour's proposal of leaving ""the"" EU customs union and replacing it with ""a"" customs union arrangement where the UK could have a say in those talks? It somewhat depends on what Labour means by a ""say"". Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary,told the Commons,externalthat he favoured: ""A new customs union in which the UK would be able to reject any agreement it believed was concluded to its disadvantage."" He told MPs that this position should have been adopted at the start of the Brexit talks. But allowing the UK a formal role in EU trade talks after Brexit, would not be allowed under current EU rules: ""Trade outside the EU is an exclusive responsibility of the EU.... this means the EU institutions make laws on trade matters, negotiate and conclude international trade agreements,external,"" says the European Commission. Brexit: Are we running out of time? Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? Reality Check: What does Brexit withdrawal agreement mean? Holger Hestermeyer, an expert in international dispute resolution at the British Academy, agrees it would be very difficult: ""To give the UK a say in the EU's talks, the procedure, as set out in EU treaties, would need to be changed. ""A treaty change in that respect will not happen and to give the UK a say without such a change is legally doubtful and politically impossible,"" he says. Labour wants a customs union arrangement that allows the UK to influence any future EU trade deals Labour points out that the EU is already in favour of the UK remaining in a customs union after Brexit. Therefore it believes the EU may well be receptive to the idea of the UK also having a say in future trade deals. Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC that ""the EU is well-known for its ability to be flexible"". If a ""say"" means something less formal, it may be more achievable. But even then it would still be unique - the EU currently has no relationship with any country like the one Labour is asking for. A Labour source told Reality Check that determining exactly how the arrangement could work would be subject to any future negotiation with the EU. Turkey has often been held up as example of a non-EU country entering into a customs union arrangement with the EU. It's had a customs union deal with the EU since 1995, although it's not as comprehensive as the one Labour is seeking. That's because Turkey's customs arrangementonly applies to industrial products,external. This means Turkey has some limited freedom to strike its own trade deals, but only in the areas not covered by its customs union arrangement - such as agriculture. Turkey can also strike deals around the world on services - as this is not a customs union issue. It has a number of trade deals with nearby countries, such as Georgia and Lebanon as well countries as far afield as Chile. However, Turkey is also obliged to apply common external tariffs on industrial products arriving from outside the EU customs union. Turkey has been in an EU customs union arrangement since 1995 This is a very strict rule, according to Catherine Barnard an EU law professor at Cambridge University. ""Under no circumstances may Turkey be authorised to apply a customs tariff which is lower than the common external tariff for any product,external,"" she says. ""The arrangement has boosted trade between the two sides,"" says Alex Stojanovic from the Institute for Government. However, Mr Stojanovic adds that neither the EU nor Turkey is entirely happy with the current arrangement: ""The EU Parliament has released reports criticising the governance of resolving disputes. From Turkey's point of view, it argues it has little input or say in EU trade policy."" Labour says it has ruled-out a Turkey-style arrangement on the grounds it is ""asymmetrical"" and only covers certain goods. However, it remains to be seen whether the EU would accept the type of customs union arrangement the Labour is pursuing instead.

"Katie Price with her son Harvey, who was trolled online because of his disabilities People with disabilities have shared accounts of the online abuse they face, after MPs backed a petition by model Katie Price calling for new laws. More than 220,000 people signed reality TV star Ms Price's petition to make online abuse a criminal offence. Actress Samantha Renke, who has brittle bone disease, said she received social media messages calling her ""vile"" and saying ""real humans walk on two legs"". ""It's most certainly affected my mental health,"" she told the BBC. Ms Price - who used to be known as Jordan - created the petition after raising awareness of the trolling that her son Harvey, who has disabilities, received. Now MPs on the Petitions Committee want to give disabled people protection under hate crime laws. The politicians said self-regulation of social media ""has failed disabled people"" and internet giants must also ""accept responsibility"" over abuse. C4 adverts to feature online abuse Javid threatens tech giants over child abuse Internet laws pledged as firms snub talks When having fun on Twitter went awry for Brent ""Harvey's experience is not unique,"" said Labour MP Helen Jones, who chairs the committee. ""Social media is rife with horrendous, degrading and dehumanising comments about people with disabilities. ""The law on online abuse is not fit for purpose and it is truly shameful that disabled people have been forced off social media while their abusers face no consequences."" Ms Renke, who is also a disability campaigner, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When I did a well-known commercial I had this influx of abuse online mostly on platforms such as Twitter. Samantha Renke said she used to be a teacher and saw how online bullying can affect her students ""It came as a real shock to me as I never experienced that in real life. And all of a sudden I was being targeted not because people didn't like my personality but specifically because of my disability. ""They are saying 'oh my goodness what is that. She is vile. She makes me feel sick. Real humans walk on two legs'. They're the kind of more milder ones. ""I do honestly believe this comes from a fear of not knowing what disability means. In the UK we still feel very awkward around disability."" She added: ""For those who say just ignore it, sticks and stones, words don't hurt you. Actually words can affect your mental health, it's most certainly affected my mental health. Kevin Healey, who has autism, received disability abuse on social media and quit Twitter for a while to avoid it. ""They [abusers] were cloning my Twitter account and pretending to be me and impersonating me,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show. ""I did quit Twitter a few years back but I'm now back on Twitter because it's my voice, it's part of me communicating to the outside world."" Amy Clarke, a digital assistant at the learning disability charity Mencap, said she joined a group on Facebook and was called the R-word. This video can not be played Katie Price: âHe canât speak to defend himself, I canâ Ms Price, a mother-of-five, told the MPs in evidence that ""the most horrific things"" had been said about 16-year-old Harvey, who is partially blind, autistic and has the genetic disorder Prader-Willi syndrome. ""They know he hasn't got a voice back and they mock him more... they find him an easy target,"" she said in February last year. On Tuesday, she tweeted that she was pleased MPs had backed her campaign. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Unlike race and religion,there are no,externalspecific disability-related criminal offences. Instead, if the offence was motivated by disability, the sentence for the crime can be increased. The committee of an MPs launched an inquiry in response to the petition, which was closed early due to the 2017 general election. After hearing from disabled people how online abuse could destroy careers, social lives and cause lasting damage to people's health, the MPs made a string of recommendations in a report published on Tuesday. They included giving disabled people the same protections under hate crime laws as those who suffered abuse due to race or religion and a review of the law on ""mate crime"" - exploitation within friendships or relationships. The MPs said a similar check to that used for child sex offenders should also make it possible to see whether someone had been convicted of a hate crime on the grounds of disability before employing them. Other recommendations included: the government and social media companies directly consult disabled people on digital strategy and hate crime law a review of the experience of disabled people in reporting crimes and giving evidence, because ""too many disabled people have not been treated seriously because front-line officers and staff do not understand disability"" social media companies accept their responsibility for allowing toxic environments to exist unchallenged to require proportionate representation of disabled people in government advertising Ms Price's petition had called on the government to ""make online abuse a specific criminal offence and create a register of offenders"", noting that it affected people ""from every walk of life"" and included ""racism, homophobia, body shaming and a whole range of other hate speech"". However, the committee focused on comments aimed at people with disabilities, to avoid duplicating the work of MPs elsewhere. Last year, the then Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not have enough power to police social media companies, after admitting only four of 14 invited to talks had showed up. He told the BBC it had given him ""a big impetus"" to introduce new laws to tackle what he has called the internet's ""Wild West"" culture.

"This video can not be played Theresa May says fees axed for EU citizens wanting to stay in UK Theresa May has scrapped the Â£65 fee millions of EU citizens were going to have to pay to secure the right to continue living in the UK after Brexit. She also vowed to seek changes to the Irish backstop from the EU. But she again rejected calls to rule out a ""no-deal"" Brexit - and warned another EU referendum could threaten the UK's ""social cohesion"". Conservative rebels and Labour accused her of being in denial about the scale of opposition to her Brexit deal. Mrs May had been forced to make the statement setting out her plan for how to proceed after MPs rejected her Brexit deal with the EU by 230 votes last week - her ""plan B"". MPs are due to vote on a modified version of the deal next Tuesday, although she gave few details about how it would be changed. Between now and then, MPs will table a series of amendments - proposed changes to the PM's deal - in an attempt to force through alternatives to her Brexit deal. The Commons Speaker John Bercow will choose which amendments are put to a vote. Brexit Live: May makes Brexit statement to MPs Nick Watt: May boxed into her comfort zone Kuenssberg: Should May stick with her plan? Cameron warned over 'stupid' Brexit vote Mrs May promised to seek the views of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - who keep her minority government in power - and others on the proposed Irish backstop. She said she would then ""take the conclusions of these discussions back to the EU"". She said she was exploring potential ""movement"" on the backstop that could secure the backing of a majority of MPs, with the aim of addressing concerns that it could become permanent and threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk. This video can not be played Brexit: Theresa May on âsix key issuesâ in EU talks The prime minister attacked the Labour leader for refusing to take part in talks with her on the way forward. She promised to take a more ""flexible, open and inclusive"" approach to involving MPs and the Scottish and Welsh governments, in negotiating a future relationship with the EU - once her Brexit deal has been approved. But Labour's Yvette Cooper asked why MPs could not be given a greater say now. ""Why not put to Parliament some votes on her red lines, including a customs union, otherwise how can any of us believe a word she says?"" Conservative rebel Sarah Wollaston, who backs another referendum, tweeted that it was ""like last week's vote never happened"". Allow Twitter content?

""And I also believe that there has not yet been enough recognition of the way that a second referendum could damage social cohesion by undermining faith in our democracy."" Earlier, MPs who back a second referendum said they had a ""constructive"" meeting with the prime minister's de facto second-in-command David Lidington. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says PM's talk offer was a ""PR sham"" The Labour leader accused Mrs May of being in ""deep denial"" about the scale of opposition to her ""undeliverable"" deal, which was rejected by 230 votes in a Commons vote last week. He said Labour would back an amendment next week that would rule out the ""disaster"" of a no-deal Brexit - and he challenged her to confirm that she would do that if MPs voted for it. He rejected her ""phoney"" offer of cross-party talks to find a way forward. Mr Corbyn wants to force a general election and, having won it, negotiate a deal with Brussels that would see the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU, with strong ties to the single market and guaranteed protections for workers' rights and environmental standards. If he can't secure a general election he has not ruled out getting behind calls for another referendum. The official Labour amendment, put down on Monday evening, says MPs should be able to vote on the option of a closer relationship with Europe - with a permanent customs union - and also keep the option of a second referendum on the table. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was about ""wrestling control of this process away from the prime minister into the hands of Parliament"". Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit Select Committee, has tabled another amendment, calling for the Commons to hold a series of indicative votes on a way forward. Allow Twitter content?

Private Members' Bills - laws proposed by MPs who are not in the government - can be passed but there's normally only very limited time to debate them. The government usually controls the agenda - what gets debated in Parliament. Some MPs now want to suspend the normal rules to allow time to debate and vote on a bill that would rule out a no-deal Brexit. That might not be enough though. If the bill will involve spending money it also needs a ""money resolution"". That has to be proposed by the government. So MPs face another obstacle if they want to take control of the Brexit process. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Under Mrs May's deal, if there is not a trade deal or other agreement between the UK and the EU when the transition period ends, the backstop kicks in. It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single custom territory - effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - unless both the EU and UK agree it is no longer necessary. But this has been a huge issue for many Conservative MPs and theDUP, who have supported Mrs May's government since the 2017 election. Removing or amending the backstop could provide Mrs May with enough backing from Brexiteer Tory MPs and the DUP to get her deal passed by Parliament. Mrs May's plan would mean millions of EU citizens living in the UK would have to apply for ""settled status"" to remain after Brexit. Applicants must have lived in the UK for five years and had been expected to pay a fee of Â£65 each. ""Settled status"" would give EU citizens the same access to healthcare and education after Britain leaves the EU as they have now. Mrs May told MPs she had listened to the concerns of EU citizens - through campaign group the 3million - about the fees, which would be waived when the scheme was launched on 30 March. The government launched a pilot scheme this week for people to apply for leave to remain through a smartphone app. Mrs May said anyone applying during the pilot phase will have their fee reimbursed, with further details to be announced shortly. In her statement, Mrs May said: Parliament will have ""a proper say"" in the next stage of negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU the government plans to hold confidential committee sessions to ensure Parliament has the most up-to-date information there will be ""regular updates"" in the House of Commons, in particular before the six monthly review points with the EU she would engage ""more deeply"" with businesses, civil society and trade unions she will ensure that Parliament is provided with a guarantee that protections for workers' rights and the environment will not be ""eroded"" Please upgrade your browser Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"This video can not be played The moment the bomb exploded on Saturday Three security alerts in Londonderry - triggered when two vehicles were hijacked by masked men and a delivery van was abandoned - have ended. Police said residents have been allowed to return to their homes following the alerts, which were confirmed as hoaxes. An alert in north Belfast on Monday night has also been confirmed as a hoax. The disruption in Derry came 48 hours after a bomb exploded in the city. The area around the courthouse in Bishop Street, where the bomb exploded in a car on Saturday, has reopened. Grandfather's shock over Derry bomb The PSNI have said Saturday's bomb attack may have been carried out by dissident republican group the New IRA. Four out of five men held over the bombing have been released. A 50-year-old man arrested on Monday remains in police custody. Members of the DUP are to meet Northern Ireland's chief constable on Tuesday morning to discuss recent incidents in the city and the ongoing dissident republican threat. A number of residents were moved from their homes as police deal with an abandoned vehicle on the Northland Road Police said that while the alerts were hoaxes ""we cannot underestimate the impact these incidents have had on our community"". ""The occupants of the hijacked vehicles did not believe when they set out for work this morning that they would be threatened by masked men,"" said Supt Gordon McCalmont. ""The residents in Circular Road, Southway and Northland Road did not wake up today expecting to be asked to leave their homes for their own safety. ""Too many people were affected because of the deliberate and anti-community actions of a few."" Timeline of Irish dissident activity Four arrests over 'reckless' attack Bomb explodes in car at courthouse Bomb was 'pointless act of terror' On Monday, the Army was called to two security alerts in the city involving reported hijackings. Army bomb disposal officers carried out a controlled explosion in Creggan's Circular Road after a vehicle was hijacked by three masked men at 11:30 GMT on Monday. The second alert on Southway, also in Creggan, followed reports of a vehicle being hijacked by four masked men at 13:45 GMT. In a third incident, police responded to a report of an abandoned lorry on the Northland Road close to the Glenbank Road junction and St Mary's College. In north Belfast, a controlled explosion was carried out on a suspicious object in the area of Springfield Road and Lanark Way. Residents returned to their home shortly after midnight. This video can not be played 'This House stands with Northern Ireland' St Mary's College in Derry will be open to staff and pupils on Tuesday morning. The school principal Marie Lindsay told BBC Radio Foyle that additional support will be provided for students who may have been affected by the security alert. A number of residents were moved from their homes. A nearby community centre was opened to people who were affected. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Housing Executive said one of their vans was hijacked and that a contractor they work with has withdrawn services in the Bishop Street, Brandywell, Creggan, Rosemount and Rossville areas until further notice. SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said the area was largely populated by older people. ""When you see frail pensioners in their late 80s and 90s being forced to leave their homes in their dressing gowns, it really is despicable.

The driver mounted the steps of the Liverpool hotel and went on to crash through the reception desk and windows inside as he ignored pleas to stop. Merseyside Police said a man had been located and would be interviewed as part of the investigation. Building firm Triton Construction said there had been no structural damage. The machine left a mass of broken glass and twisted metal in its wake Police arrived at the Liverpool Innovation Park hotel at about 15:00 GMT on Monday. The force spokesman said paramedics treated a man for eye irritation caused by exposure to diesel. Ceiling fixer Samuel White, 24, witnessed what happened and described the man, who had claimed to be owed about Â£600, as ""some idiot in a mini digger"" who ""decided to drive through the middle of the building"". He said the destruction went on for ""a good 20 or 30 minutes"" and had left workers ""gobsmacked"". ""The site manager was running around like a headless chicken,"" he added. Triton Construction said the man had been employed by a sub-contractor, MF Construction. ""It is alleged that the labourer couldn't track down the owner of MF Construction and he became increasingly frustrated [so] took it upon himself to drive a small mini excavator through the front entrance screen of the hotel,"" the Triton Construction spokesman added.
