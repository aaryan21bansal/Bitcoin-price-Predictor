"Three mysterious deaths and dozens of violent attacks on butch lesbians, orcamionas, have put lesbians in Chile's Fifth region on red alert. Nicole Saavedra Bahamondes' family knew she was not a morning person. Especially at weekends, the 23-year-old did not leave her bedroom early - and she knew her mother wouldn't disturb her in her cosy bed, still laden with the cuddly toys from her childhood. At about 11:00 on a Saturday, Nicole would usually emerge and walk slowly to the kitchen in search of coffee. She would blearily exchange words with her mother, Olga Bahamondes, giving monosyllabic answers to any questions about the night before. Around 11:30, Nicole would WhatsApp her cousin, MarÃ­a Bahamondes, who lived five minutes away with her husband and two young daughters. Often they would agree to meet at the farmers' market in their sleepy mining town - El MelÃ³n, in Chile's mountainous Fifth region - then go back to MarÃ­a's house for lunch with her two young children. But this Saturday morning, 18 June 2016, was different. Nicole had messaged her mother the evening before to say she would be staying overnight at a party with friends in Quillota, a town some 30 minutes by bus from their home. Then at 07:00 she sent a voice-note to say she was on her way back. When Olga woke and listened to the voice-note she assumed Nicole was already home and resting in bed. But when she hadn't emerged by midday, Olga popped her head into her daughter's room. It was empty, and the bed had not been slept in. Olga called Nicole immediately, but there was no ringing tone. This was unusual. Nicole's phone was rarely off. Olga began to worry. Nicole's Instagram showed that she and her friends had been in high spirits just hours earlier. She'd uploaded five videos of the group laughing, sitting on mattresses on the floor, surrounded by cushions, empty Coca-Cola bottles and cigarette lighters. In the last 15-second Instagram video posted just after midnight, a young woman with long dark hair and her hoodie up is seen scrolling through her smartphone. The camera then pans to a man in his early 20s, who sings an off-key version of Lana Del Ray's Video Games. Nicole, who is out of shot and filming the video, can be heard giggling. Then there is social media silence. MarÃ­a and Nicole had been especially close. Growing up, the cousins and their mothers had lived together in one house. ""Nicole and I always had a special bond. We were raised by single mothers who were sisters. We were more sisters than cousins,"" says MarÃ­a. ""We saw each other every day, and after I got married and moved out, every few days."" MarÃ­a was protective of her younger cousin. ""I have always said that she lived in another world,"" says MarÃ­a. ""Because she didn't see the bad side in people. I think that is what played against her."" MarÃ­a Bahamondes: A man attacked Nicole a year before her death Nicole was vulnerable, MarÃ­a felt, because she openly identified as a lesbian - and not just as a lesbian, but as a camiona, Chilean slang for a butch lesbian. Nicole was proud to be a camiona, it was the core of her identity. But this made her visible in their small, conservative community, and she had been beaten up because of it. ""She was always being insulted. She was 14 years old when she had her first girlfriend. Men sometimes chased her and said they were going to correct her, to 'make her a woman',"" MarÃ­a says. In 2015, a neo-Nazi gang member brutally attacked her, yelling lesbophobic abuse. ""If her friend hadn't arrived, Nicole probably would have died. He had put his boot on her neck and was beating her and beating and beating her."" After that, MarÃ­a felt uneasy whenever Nicole left the house alone. So that Saturday morning, when Nicole couldn't be reached, she had a deep sense of foreboding. When there had still been no word from Nicole 24 hours later, the family notified the police and MarÃ­a organised relatives into search parties, to retrace Nicole's last known movements. The first point of call was the house in Quillota where Nicole had spent the night with friends. The friends had already explained that Nicole had set off for the bus stop at 07:00 and that they had heard nothing from her after that. On Sunday they still had no news. ""We searched and searched for her,"" MarÃ­a says. They walked the streets of the town. They marched through the farms and avocado plantations that surround it. Nothing. The search continued, but on Friday 24 June, almost a week after Nicole's disappearance, a sickening feeling washed over MarÃ­a. ""My heart told me that things were wrong,"" she says. She returned to her house and kneeled. ""I prayed to God asking Him to help us find her body, because now I felt that Nicole was dead. That day I felt that Nicole wasn't coming back."" The following day, police found her body dumped by a farm track not far from Limache Reservoir, 15 minutes away from the bus stop where she was last seen. Espino trees near the spot where Nicole's body was dumped As we approach the spot on a hill pierced with pylons, MarÃ­a walks a little ahead. Occasionally she points out piles of horse manure to avoid on the brown earth. ""It's strange,"" she says quietly. ""There used to be more shrubs around here. Someone must have cut them down."" Then she stops walking. ""Here,"" she says softly, nodding slightly with her head, to a patch of earth, surrounded by leafless bushes and horse manure. She looks away. The police files say that Nicole was killed by repeated blows to the back of her head. Her body had numerous open wounds and bruising. Her hands had been tied behind her back. Her wallet, money intact, was still in the pocket of her trousers. Nicole's killer had not wanted to rob her. MarÃ­a pauses. ""It was really shocking. Really shocking. We never expected this - that she would have been tortured and beaten like this. You don't think that someone you love is going to die in circumstances like that."" The police said they had no leads that might help them identify the killer. But MarÃ­a felt sure she knew the motive. Nicole had her own look. The dozens of distinctive, artfully cropped selfies on her Instagram page displayed it boldly. Her short, inky-dark hair, shaved close on the sides and a few inches long at the top, either flopped over her eyes or was pulled under a baseball cap. She mostly wore baggy jeans and hoodies. She wore plugs known as flesh tunnels"" in large ear piercings, which elongated her earlobes and left large holes when she removed them. She had a signature pose too - squinting into the lens broodingly, barely smiling. At first glance, Nicole's profile could have been that of a teenage skater boy. That was intentional - she didn't want to look feminine. The word ""camiona"" derives from the Spanishcamionera- which means female lorry driver. It was once used as an insult towards butch lesbians in the Spanish-speaking world, but young lesbians have now reclaimed it. It's a distinct lesbian identity in Chile, says Karen Vergara, a lesbian activist in Quillota, the town where Nicole went missing. Camionas, she says, crop their hair short and wear ""masculine"" clothes - low-slung baggy jeans, checked shirts and baseball caps. ""Camionas do not want to identify with typically feminine styles imposed on women through a male gaze,"" says Karen. ""The clothing is a big part of that. It's a way to recognise each other in the street. In the lesbian community, camionas are our courageous sisters who, despite lesbophobia, dare to show their lesbianism."" It was this identity, Nicole's cousin believes, that sealed her fate. ""I think Nicole was murdered for being a lesbian, for her way of dressing,"" says MarÃ­a. ""Because she dressed in a more masculine way."" Lesbians in Chile call the Fifth region - the region where Nicole lived - the Red Zone, because of its history of anti-lesbian violence. ""How to describe the Fifth region to people who have never been here?"" Karen Vergara asks. ""I would start by saying that we are on high alert here, because of lesbophobia."" Chile is made up of 16 administrative regions. The Fifth, about half way between the country's northern and southernmost tips, is these days officially called ValparaÃ­so region after the port city that is its capital. But much of the region is rural, dominated by the booming avocado industry. Feminist lawyer Silvana del Valle says the region has ""an air about it"" - including a machismo that leaves minorities feeling vulnerable, and some of the most active neo-Nazi gangs in the country. According to two people who attended the party in Quillota, the night before Nicole died, a neo-Nazi was also present for at least some of the time, and this made Nicole uncomfortable. ""ValparaÃ­so is strange,"" agrees Sebastian Ayala, a film director making a documentary about the history of lesbian attacks in Chile. ""When you talk to camionas and trans women in Chile, women who are outwardly more masculine-looking, they all know about ValparaÃ­so and they try not to go there. They know about the attacks."" The most recent took place on 17 March, in a square in ValparaÃ­so city, when a group of young men shouted lesbophobic expletives as they whipped a young camiona with chains, leaving her bloodied and badly shaken. ""Of course there's paranoia because of those attacks, but the feeling that the LGBT community were under attack, well that had been going on for decades,"" says Ayala. ""Since Divine, probably."" The secret language of lesbian love When lesbian activists stormed the BBC Stonewall: A riot that changed millions of lives Divine nightclub, a converted townhouse in ValparaÃ­so city, was the hangout for the Fifth region's LGBT community in the early 1990s. On 4 September 1993, the club opened after refurbishment to an excited group of about 60 people. There were new carpets on its floors and walls and fishermen's nets hanging from its roof - a cheeky nod to the port, and also to sailors, who had become a kitsch symbol of '90s gay culture. Chile had just beaten Poland in the penalty shootout to take third place in the Fifa Under-17 World Championship and the mood was high as drag queens, lesbians and bi and gay men danced to pop music. But within hours 16 people had died in a fire so severe that only two could be identified without dental records. It had been caused by the wires of the lighting system overheating, police said, but many survivors and relatives of those who died suspected foul play. It wasn't as if there was no motive. Divine, which was just a few years old, had not been a popular addition to the neighbourhood. The club and its staff had been receiving threats for months, and women complained of verbal abuse whenever they entered or left. A group of survivors formed a group called AcciÃ³n Gay (Gay Action), demanding another investigation into the fire. They are still active today. ""It became a simmering paranoia with that generation,"" says Sebastian Ayala, ""a question mark."" It's not clear whether Nicole knew about the fire at Divine, but she knew about the murder of MarÃ­a PÃ­a Castro. Nicole had a few things in common with MarÃ­a. Both were young women from the Fifth region. They were from single-parent, working-class households. They were camionas. The death of the 19-year-old footballer from the small town of OlmuÃ© sent shockwaves through Chile's lesbian community in 2008. She had faced abuse from local boys - she had been hit, yelled at, spat on - but hadn't stopped her from dressing the way she did, or telling her friends that she was a lesbian. ""But telling friends about your private life in a small community has consequences,"" says Karen Vergara. ""It doesn't stay a private conversation."" On 13 February 2008, she was found dead, her body so badly burnt that she could only be identified through DNA tests. A post-mortem examination showed that she had also experienced a severe blow to the back of her head. Her body had been dumped on a hill, just miles away from where Nicole's would be found eight years later. The case was closed in 2017, as no suspects had been identified. MarÃ­a, then Nicole. No killer identified in either case. Feminist and lesbian groups could not fail to be deeply troubled. Then, a year after Nicole's killing - on 7 March 2017 - the body of a third young camiona was found in the Fifth region. The news terrified women already on edge, confirming the region as a danger zone for young lesbians. But this murder was different. Twenty-three-year-old Susana Sanhueza was found in a rubbish bag inside the town hall in San Felipe, where the animal rights group she worked for rented office space. She had been dead a week. WhatsApp messages read out in court reveal that she had been meeting a friend, fellow activist Cristian MuÃ±oz, who later told police that he witnessed Susana having a seizure in the office and put her body in the rubbish bag, believing she was dead. He denies murder and his family say he has been admitted to a psychiatric ward while awaiting trail. Susana Sanhueza Susana's family believe that she was killed because Cristian was in love with her and was frustrated that he couldn't have a relationship with her. Some argue that Susana's death was not a result of homophobic prejudice, but Karen Vergara disagrees. ""We, the lesbian community in the region, still count Susana's death as lesbophobia,"" she says. ""Whether it was a murder or Susana did suffer from a seizure, Cristian was pursuing a woman who had told him that she would always be unavailable to him. His lack of acceptance that she was a lesbian, and then not alerting the police, speaks to a hatred of gay women. That is misogyny and homophobia combined. It's lesbophobia."" Susana's death caused a number of WhatsApp groups to spring up in the Fifth region, for lesbians to warn each other of potential dangers, or of verbal and physical attacks. Admins of three groups told the BBC that there are at least three or four alerts a week. ""We call the Fifth region Chile's red zone for lesbians because of MarÃ­a, Nicole and Susana,"" says Karen Vergara. ""There are many other attacks. Not as brutal or fatal as these but enough to land lesbians - especially camionas - in hospital. ""We as lesbians are always on red alert in this town [Quillota]. Day and night, 24 hours a day 365 days a year. We feel under threat. As soon as you step out of your home you are in danger. ""When other lesbians come to see us from Santiago, they feel our fear. This region is like that."" But in February this year, a violent attack on a camiona in Santiago, Chile's capital, showed that lesbophobic bloodshed could occur there too. In the early hours of Valentine's Day, 24-year-old Carolina Torres and her girlfriend, Estefania Opazo, were walking home with another friend from a lacklustre football match. Carolina's favourite football team, the University of Chile - also known as La U - had just drawn 0-0 with Melgar in the third phase of the Libertadores Cup. It had been a forgettable game. The trio made their way down a busy street in the Santiago suburb of Pudahuel, close to where Carolina lived with her mother and father. Carolina and Estefania chose not to hold hands to avoid offending anyone. Carolina Torres (right) and Estefania Opazo Suddenly, Carolina felt a force to the back of her head. Then darkness. She had fallen unconscious, and would remain in a coma for a week. She suffered a fractured skull, a broken nose, internal bleeding and permanent damage to her hearing. There were two male attackers. One had used a large wooden pole to hit her repeatedly on the back of her head, only stopping when Estefania threw herself on top of Carolina, using her body as a shield. This is significant, says Carolina's mother, Mariela. Because unlike Carolina, who identifies as a camiona and dresses accordingly, Estefania is femme - a more feminine lesbian identity. The attackers targeted Carolina and not Estefania, says Mariela, because she represented an ""unacceptable"" face of womanhood. It was not just her sexual orientation that prompted violence, it was her appearance as a camiona. ""I want to make it very clear they were trying to kill her,"" she adds. ""There is no other way of looking at it. The fact that she is here is a miracle."" Carolina knew one of her alleged attackers. ""Before this attack he threatened me. He said, 'I am going to kill you.' He said he was going to shoot me with a gun. He called me a lesbian and swore at me. He said, 'Why do you dress like a man?'"" Shortly after the BBC's interview with Carolina, two brothers, Miguel and Reinaldo CortÃ©s Arancibia, were arrested and charged with attempted murder. Lesbian activists tell the BBC that the arrest was unexpected, even though there was CCTV footage and the attackers were known to the victim. Generally, they say, lesbophobic violence goes unpunished. Carolina, who is taking more than 10 types of medication because of her injuries, says the attack has changed her forever. She suffers from nightmares and now feels unable to leave the home she shares with her parents. ""I liked to go out for walks. I like to do sports. And now I can't do anything,"" she says. ""I have to be shut inside all day long here in my house. And I don't like it because I talk differently now."" Her speech is slurred because of her injuries. The attack on Carolina, on a busy road in Chile's capital, was the first reported in the capital since the 1984 murder of self-identified camiona, MÃ³nica Briones. But just as in the Fifth region, feminist groups say other, less serious attacks on camionas take place without coming to the public's attention. Carolina's mother says her daughter's case represents the tip of an iceberg. ""If people don't pay attention to this and do something about it - it's going to get worse."" A drawing of Nicole Saavedra hangs on the wall of Lesbians Breaking the Silence. It's mounted on violet card, the universal colour of lesbian solidarity. Erika Montecinos looks at another poster she has up on her wall. It's of happier times, the first lesbian march at Santiago's Gay Pride, in 2001. Santiago does have an openly gay scene. It's most noticeable in the Bellavista neighbourhood, where the nightclubs and bars have rainbow flags on the windows and same-sex couples walk holding hands. Nicole Saavedra's friends say she enjoyed nights out the area, when visiting the capital. But outside this one neighbourhood the mood is very different, Erika says. She runs her organisation in a secret location behind barred windows. A large tree in the garden ensures that passers-by won't see the rainbow flag inside. The irony of an organisation with such a defiant name having to hide itself from the public is not lost on Erika. But other LGBT organisations have been subjected to intimidation and threats from hate groups, she says. While the Fifth region is a hotbed of lesbophobic violence, she says, the problem exists throughout the country. In a survey of 850 lesbian and bisexual women carried out by Lesbians Breaking the Silence last year, 75% said they had suffered street harassment. After the attack on Carolina Torres, Erika's organisation set up a WhatsApp number called the Linea Violeta (the Violet Line), which received more than 100 reports of violence or intimidation in a month. None were reported to police, she says, because the callers saw no point - they were convinced no action would be taken. To make prosecution in cases of femicide more likely, Chile's femicide law ensures that specialist investigating lawyers are assigned to victims' families, to help gather the necessary evidence. But the murder of a lesbian does not count as femicide. ""Femicide is the sex-based murder of a woman committed by a man,"" says Silvana del Valle, a law professor at the University Academy of Christian Humanism in Santiago. ""But to qualify as an act of femicide, the killer should have been in a current or former spousal or cohabitant relationship with the victim. ""Lesbian women will of course not be in a romantic relationship with a man, even if the murder is sex-based, even if the motivation is because she is a certain 'type' of woman, a lesbian."" Del Valle argues that prosecutors and the police are under little pressure to solve these murders because there is no national outcry and in most cases - including Nicole's, MarÃ­a's and Susana's - these women are from poorer backgrounds. It troubles Nicole Saavedra's family that her killer, or killers, remain uncaught. There's a silence surrounding the murder in the community, says her cousin, MarÃ­a Bahamondes; Nicole's friends seem to be scared of something and no longer speak to the family. And then there's the police. ""I feel that they have treated us badly,"" MarÃ­a says. ""I often felt like they were laughing at us. They would have meetings with us but they wouldn't even know Nicole's name. They would give us the same files that they had given us months before. We would go there and they would cancel the meeting with us. They didn't do anything."" In a statement to the BBC, the public prosecutor's office in the Fifth region rejected the accusation that police were inactive in the face of lesbophobic violence, or could be held to blame for it. ""All parts of society have failed when a crime is committed. Blaming only one factor, like the Public Prosecutor of the Fifth Region, undermines the problem, simplifies it and ultimately prevents a solution,"" the statement said. ""Only when every person understands the role they play in society's lack of acceptance of people with different sexual orientations, will we approach a solution to these crimes."" MarÃ­a Bahamondes, demanding justice for her cousin In the statement, the public prosecutor also insisted that police were committed to investigating Nicole's murder and said the Chilean Public Prosecutor's office was setting up a team to study the problem of violence against LGBT people. ""I wasn't aware that lesbians call it a 'red zone' but now that you mention it, that fits with the latest events in ValparaÃ­so,"" said Daniel Morales, the mayor of Limache, where the bodies of MarÃ­a PÃ­a Castro and Nicole were found. He added that his office was working with the police to install more CCTV cameras and was using surveillance drones to protect the public. But that's little consolation for MarÃ­a as she contemplates the unsolved murder of her cousin. ""I can't deal with it any more,"" she says, shaking slightly. ""This story has to come to its end. And we need to find out who did this. Otherwise there is no justice. If we don't find the people who are guilty of this, there is no justice for Nicole."" MarÃ­a Bahamondes, Karen Vergara and three other women were arrested on Saturday and held overnight for occupying the office of the public prosecutor in Quillota and locking themselves inside, after a demonstration marking the three-year anniversary of Nicole Saavedra's death. The women were demanding a meeting with the prosecutor in charge of the investigation, whom they accused of failing to make serious efforts to solve the case. Local media quoted the chief prosecutor of Quillota as saying the investigation into Nicole's death was ""proceeding normally"". They were released following pressure from the Chilean Human Rights Institute.

"A Â£100m fund has been established to help UK firms capitalise on the boom in offshore wind. With the UK so well suited to exploiting wind power, turbines have been erected in more than 30 locations from Brighton to the Moray Firth. But trade unions say the boom has not generated enough jobs for UK workers. The Offshore Wind Industry Council says its initiative will help hundreds of firms ""maximise opportunities"" in the offshore wind supply chain. ""The Offshore Wind Growth Partnership will provide practical help for UK companies so they can compete successfully for contracts in this thriving global market,"" said Benj Sykes, chairman of the OWIC and UK country manager for the Danish firm Orsted. The OWIC, which is a joint government and industry body, will invest the privately-raised funds over 10 years to support companies in the supply chain. Firms that manufacture parts, lay cables and maintain wind farms will receive support ranging from ""expert advice on manufacturing and commercialisation"" to funding for innovation. They will also be given support to export their products and services. Clean electricity overtaking fossil fuels First power from world's biggest wind farm UK clinches deal to boost offshore wind By 2030 the offshore wind power market is expected to be worth Â£30bn per year, with the UK expected to be generating a third of its electricity from wind. The OWIC hopes to raise the participation of UK businesses in the industry from 48% currently to 60%, under a sector deal agreed between industry and government. The new fund will bring ""investment, thousands of high-quality jobs and huge economic opportunities for communities across the UK"", energy and clean growth minister Chris Skidmore said. Last month GMB general secretary, Tim Roache said Britain's politicians needed ""to sharpen their elbows in the fight for jobs"" when it came to opportunities in the growing renewables sector. The union says up to 1,000 jobs could be created at two mothballed yards in Fife if EDF chose local firms to manufacture parts for a huge wind farm project there, rather thanas is expected the work being done in Indonesia, Belgium and Spain.

"The state's governor has tasked state troopers with finding the absentees Eleven Republican senators from the state of Oregon are in hiding. They walked out of Salem's Capitol building on Thursday and state police have been given authorisation to track them down. This bizarre series of events has unfolded amid a deep rift between the state's rival parties. Oregon's Democrats, who have a clear Senate majority, want to pass landmark climate change legislation. Local Republicans have fled to stop that happening. This weekend, the state capitol had to shut down altogether amid apparent security threats from militia groups. Oregon Democrats are trying to become the second US state to pass an ambitious ""cap and trade"" climate plan. House Bill 2020 would set overall limits on state carbon emissions, with permits or allowances auctioned off to polluting industries. The plan aims to encourage businesses to switch to green technology, with the goal of slashing emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Under it, petrol and diesel prices are expected to go up. Republicans say these changes will disproportionally affect rural Oregonians, like farm workers and loggers. They argue the plan should be referred to a state-wide ballot so ""every Oregonian has a voice"". Climate change: where we are in seven charts Final call to stop 'climate catastrophe' Democrats hold 18 of the 30 seats in the state senate, but 20 senators have to be present for a vote to take place. On Thursday, the 11 Republicans who currently hold seats failed to show up for floor proceedings after negotiations broke down, blocking the legislation's progress. Democratic Governor Kate Brown then authorised state police to try to locate them. ""It is absolutely unacceptable that the Senate Republicans would turn their back on their constituents who they are honour-bound to represent here in this building,"" she said in a statement. ""They need to return and do the jobs they were elected to do."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Republicans released a statement explaining their walkout. ""Oregonians deserve better. It's time for the majority party to consider all Oregonians - not just the ones in Portland,"" Senate Republican Leader Herman Baerschiger Jr said regarding the rural-city divide. This is the second time they have recently walked out - winning concessions on gun and vaccination laws after another incident last month. Other boycotts have also been known to happen elsewhere, including by Wisconsin Democrats in 2011. They are rumoured to have fled into neighbouring Idaho - where police are not authorised to look for them. The current legislative session is due to end on 30 June and the Republican whip has said they will ""run out the clock"" on it ""until this storm of false narratives and intimidation passes"". Before the walkout, Democrats had already said they would be willing to use police to try to force absent Republicans to come back. The row has crippled Oregon's Capitol One lawmaker, Brian Boquist, responded angrily. Speaking to a local news outlet on Wednesday, he said police should ""send bachelors and come heavily armed"" if they were to try to arrest him. ""I'm not going to be a political prisoner in the state of Oregon. It's just that simple,"" he said. His comments were condemned by Democrats who said ""threats like these are unacceptable"". The senators are being ordered to pay $500 (Â£390) each for every day they are absent. An online fundraiser to pay their fines has so far raised almost $38,000 (Â£30,000) as of Sunday. State Senate President Peter Courtney, a Democrat, said police had established a possible militia threat and recommended the closure of the Capitol on Saturday. Another Democratic lawmaker, Sara Gelser, tweeted that they had been notified ""we were physically in danger"". Self-described ""patriot"" groups had reportedly planned a two-day ""Rally to Take the Capitol"" event on Facebook,externalfor the weekend. Online comments by members of militia groups also pledged to provide armed security and escorts to the Republicans, US media report. It's not the first time that militias and libertarians in the state have made headlines. In 2016,a militia group was involved in a stand-off with federal agents for weeks at an Oregon wildlife refuge. In recent days, the @Oregon_GOP Twitter account has been mocking the militia claims and sharing content from protests and locals who support their walkout. But with the Republicans still in hiding, the rift shows no sign of ending any time soon.

"West Midlands Police announced 'Project Guardian' to tackle youth violence and knife crime A police force has revealed plans to spend Â£7m tackling youth violence after declaring knife crime a ""national emergency"". West Midlands Police said the majority of the ""Project Guardian"" funding would go towards preventing knife crime. The force will focus more resources on Birmingham's night-time economy and mediation services for young people. Critics said the funding was not enough and the plan relied too heavily on police officers working overtime. David Jamieson declared knife crime was a ""national emergency"" earlier this year The plans include recruiting 75 new police staff investigators for a year, spending Â£1.5m on diversion, mediation, support and mentoring projects, 15 police cars and newmetal detecting ""knife wands"". The force will also give Â£100,000 to young people to improve their communities ""via local initiatives"". West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) David Jamieson acknowledged the funding was ""short term"" but said the investment was ""to break the cycle of crime"". Latest news from the West Midlands ""Earlier this year I declared knife crime to be anational emergency,"" he said. ""Project Guardian is a vital part of West Midlands Police's response to that emergency."" Over the next year, the force has pledged to fund an extra 163,400 policing hours using existing officers working overtime. ""It's not an ideal solution, but it's what we've been reduced to,"" Richard Cooke, the West Midlands Police Federation Chair, told the BBC. He added that after a spate of violence in whichthree local teenagers were murdered in 12 days, the force relied again on officers working overtime. The three teenagers stabbed to death in 12 days: (l-r) Hazrat Umar, 18, Abdullah Muhammad and Sidali Mohamed, both 16 ""We're having to use overtime to plug the gaps when what we should have is a police force that's fit for purpose,"" he said. Lynne Baird's son Daniel 26, was stabbed to death in Birmingham in 2017. She has since campaigned forspecialist first aid kits, which have been installed in more than 50 bars and clubs in the cityto help reduce deaths from knife attacks. Widower ending 4,250 mile cancer walk 'People spat at you - they were horrible' Could we all be better off renting? Daniel Baird was stabbed outside The Forge Tavern in the Digbeth area of Birmingham Ms Baird said there were ""good parts"" to the plan, but had hoped to see more neighbourhood police officers on the streets. ""That is what you used to see,"" she said. ""They could sometimes spot a problem before it was going to happen. ""On the whole it looks quite promising. It is badly needed and I think the police and crime commissioner has tried his best to do what he can."" Joshua Ribera was stabbed near TC's nightclub in Selly Oak Alison Cope's son Joshua Ribera was stabbed through the heart near TC's nightclub in Selly Oak in 2014. She added: ""When you see more money being thrown at the situation, you want to make sure it is allocated correctly, regulated and audited correctly, so it doesn't go in a poof of smoke. ""I hope it goes in the right areas and the right places. ""For me, there needs to be a combination of things. Long term prevention which makes young people think enough to engage with positive activities, engagement, family support and extra police on streets, young people need to know there are consequences."" The renewed focus on mediation was welcomed by Kirk Dawes, a former police officer who ran a pioneering unit to combat serious gang violence. However, he raised concerns about the funding not being enough and the plans too short term. Kirk Dawes ran The Centre for Conflict Transformation (TCFCT) between 2004 and 2012 ""True investment would be a 10-year plan but that would cost more money than they've been given,"" he said. Until mediators can create peace, the situation would get worse with retaliation and revenge, Mr Dawes said. ""It's not nearly enough, but you can't blame the PCC for that.""

"Boris Johnson's claim that world trade rules could be used after Brexit to avoid tariffs ""isn't true"", cabinet minister Liam Fox has said. The international trade secretary, who is backing Jeremy Hunt for leader, said the EU will apply trade tariffs.

"Thousands of men, women and children and been displaced by the fall of IS Eight children, including six taken by their Australian parents to join the Islamic State (IS) group, have been evacuated from a Syrian refugee camp. The group includes three orphaned children of notorious Australian militant Khaled Sharrouf. The government was able to evacuate the children in secret in conjunction with aid groups, Australian media say. Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed they had been freed from a ""bleak and complicated'' situation. ""The fact that parents put their children into harm's way by taking them into a war zone was a despicable act,"" Mr Morrison said. ""However, children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents."" He added that the decision had not been made ""lightly"". ""Australia's national security and the safety of our people and personnel have always been our most important considerations in this matter,"" he said. Earlier this year he insisted he would not endanger lives to extract Australians from camps. Five children of Sharrouf were taken to Syria in 2014 by their mother, Tara Nettleton. She had followed her husband who had left months before on his brother's passport. Sharrouf became notorious for graphic photographs he shared online from the warzone - including of his young children with weapons and one holding a severed head. Save the Children said it found more than 2,500 foreign children in Syrian camps Two of them reportedly died alongside their father in an airstrike near Raqqa in 2017.Nettleton died from health complications from appendicitis in 2015.

The debate over how international governments should handle repatriation of IS fighters and their children has come to the fore this year with the collapse of the group.

"A Â£100m fund has been established to help UK firms capitalise on the boom in offshore wind. With the UK so well suited to exploiting wind power, turbines have been erected in more than 30 locations from Brighton to the Moray Firth. But trade unions say the boom has not generated enough jobs for UK workers. The Offshore Wind Industry Council says its initiative will help hundreds of firms ""maximise opportunities"" in the offshore wind supply chain. ""The Offshore Wind Growth Partnership will provide practical help for UK companies so they can compete successfully for contracts in this thriving global market,"" said Benj Sykes, chairman of the OWIC and UK country manager for the Danish firm Orsted. The OWIC, which is a joint government and industry body, will invest the privately-raised funds over 10 years to support companies in the supply chain. Firms that manufacture parts, lay cables and maintain wind farms will receive support ranging from ""expert advice on manufacturing and commercialisation"" to funding for innovation. They will also be given support to export their products and services. Clean electricity overtaking fossil fuels First power from world's biggest wind farm UK clinches deal to boost offshore wind By 2030 the offshore wind power market is expected to be worth Â£30bn per year, with the UK expected to be generating a third of its electricity from wind. The OWIC hopes to raise the participation of UK businesses in the industry from 48% currently to 60%, under a sector deal agreed between industry and government. The new fund will bring ""investment, thousands of high-quality jobs and huge economic opportunities for communities across the UK"", energy and clean growth minister Chris Skidmore said. Last month GMB general secretary, Tim Roache said Britain's politicians needed ""to sharpen their elbows in the fight for jobs"" when it came to opportunities in the growing renewables sector. The union says up to 1,000 jobs could be created at two mothballed yards in Fife if EDF chose local firms to manufacture parts for a huge wind farm project there, rather thanas is expected the work being done in Indonesia, Belgium and Spain.

"Five people have been arrested and questioned over alleged accounting fraud at the Patisserie Valerie chain, the Serious Fraud Office has said. The arrests took place last Tuesday, 18 June, in a joint operation with police, the SFO said. The move comes eight months afterthe firm's former finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrestedand freed on bail. Patisserie Valerie went into administration in January and was bought for Â£5m by Causeway Capital. The collapse followed the discovery of a huge black hole in the firm's accounts, eventually valued at Â£94m. After it went into administration, the cafe chain was found to have overstated its cash position by Â£30m and failed to disclose overdrafts of nearly Â£10m. Patisserie Valerie puts butter back in cakes Ex-Patisserie Valerie boss 'felt like emigrating' Patisserie Valerie says finance chief arrested Patisserie Valerie black hole grows to Â£94m Patisserie Valerie's former chairman, Luke Johnson, who was also its biggest shareholder, wrote earlier this month inhis column for the Sunday Times,externalthat that he had considered fleeing the UK after the scandal broke and feared becoming ""a pariah in the business world"". The Sunday Times reported that Mr Johnson was not among those arrested by the SFO. ""On Tuesday 18 June, as part of a joint operation with the Hertfordshire, Leicestershire and Metropolitan Police Services, the SFO arrested and questioned five people in connection with the ongoing investigation into individuals associated with Patisserie Holdings,"" the SFO statement said. The cafe chain had 206 outlets and 3,000 staff when it collapsed. It now has 96 shops still in operation. Causeway Capital, an Irish private equity firm, said as far as they were aware the arrests did ""not relate to any current employees of Patisserie Valerie"". Matt Scaife a partner at Causeway Capital said the new owner aimed to restore the business to growth by ""focusing on three simple values: quality, creativity and crucially integrity"". It plans to revamp the menu, provide new uniforms for staff and boost online sales. Last week, Causeway revealed that Patisserie Valerie was in such dire straits thatmanagers had ordered puff pastry be made from margarine rather than butteras a cost-cutting measure. This is now being reversed. ""We will take every single recipe apart and put it back together,"" said .

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt accuses Boris Johnson of ""ducking very important questions"" Jeremy Hunt has accused Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson of ""ducking"" scrutiny, saying a would-be PM ""should answer questions on everything"". However, Mr Hunt said people ""don't want a big debate"" about politicians' private lives after several Tories urged Mr Johnson to address questions about a row with his girlfriend. Cabinet minister Liam Fox said it was better to explain what happened than allow it to become a ""distraction"". Mr Johnson has refused to comment. The leadership frontrunner dodged questions on the issueon Saturday at a Conservative Party hustings held as part of the contest to replace Theresa May as leader and ultimately prime minister. It comes after a neighbour called police and recorded a heated row at the home Mr Johnson shares with his partner, Carrie Symonds, in Camberwell, south London. Defending his actions, neighbour Tom Penntold the Guardian,externalhe had been worried about his neighbours' safety, adding: ""I hope that anybody would have done the same thing."" He said he began recording from inside his flat, after he heard ""slamming and banging"" in the early hours of Friday. In the recording - heard by the Guardian, but not by the BBC - Ms Symonds could reportedly be heard telling the Tory MP to ""get off me"" and ""get out of my flat"". This video can not be played Liam Fox on Boris: 'It's always easier to just give an explanation' Neighbour defends Johnson row recording Watch: Boris Johnson avoids questions about 'home row' Johnson and Hunt make pitch to be PM Asked about the issue, Mr Hunt told Sky News: ""I think someone who wants to be PM should answer questions on everything, but I'm not going to comment on character."" But the foreign secretary also said he thought the story about Mr Johnson's row with his girlfriend was ""irrelevant to the leadership debate"" because the country was in ""such a serious situation"" over Brexit. ""What happens in people's personal lives is really a matter for them. ""What people care about is who is going to be the wise prime minister who navigates this country out of the biggest constitutional crisis in our lifetimes."" Later, to the BBC, he repeated his calls for Mr Johnson to debate live with him on television, and accused him of ""not answering"" the ""difficult"" questions about Brexit. The comments came after International Trade Secretary Mr Fox - a backer of Mr Hunt - told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that it was ""always easier to just give an explanation"" about what had happened. ""The key thing is then how you get on to the issues,"" he said. ""What we can't have is it being a distraction from explanations about wider policy."" He said it was ""fair"" for candidates to be asked questions about their character, but added: ""I'm not sure what we've seen over the last few days is a fair reflection of that."" But Mr Fox dismissed suggestions that Mr Johnson's private life made him a potential security risk. Recalling Mr Johnson's previous role in government, he said: ""Do you think Theresa May would make him foreign secretary if there were genuine worries about him being a security risk?"" ""I think we have to get away from these distractions and talk about policy issues."" Meanwhile, speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 Live, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said Mr Johnson had a proven record, so ""people know what he's like in office"". Carrie Symonds has been in a relationship with Mr Johnson since 2018 Asked about the row, she said: ""There's no point asking me. I believe it's a private matter - I don't think the public are concerned about that. ""Boris served for eight years as mayor of London, did a brilliant job; he's served as foreign secretary - people know what he's like in office, and that's what's important."" But shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said Mr Johnson was ""completely unsuitable"" to be prime minister. Speaking on Sky News, he said: ""In one sense, of course, it is a private matter, but when you're running for public office, when you are wanting to be the prime minister of the UK, then these matters are in the public interest. ""I've long held the view that Boris Johnson is unsuitable to be prime minister of this country."" Police were called to Ms Symond's Camberwell flat On Saturday, Mr Johnson repeatedly avoided questions about the incident ashe and Mr Hunt made their pitches to Tory party memberson why they should succeed Mrs May as prime minister. When the event moderator, Iain Dale, accused him of ducking the question,Mr Johnson did not respond directly, instead saying: ""People are entitled to ask me what I want to do for the country."" Mr Dale was heckled by some in the audience when he continued to press the MP, but Mr Johnson later defended his persistence. ""There will have been lots of other people in the audience who didn't boo, and who actually did want to hear the answer to that question,"" Mr Dale told the BBC. It was the first of 16 events, or hustings, to choose the next Conservative party leader - and prime minister - following Mrs May's resignation after she failed to get her Brexit deal through Parliament. She remains in office until her successor is found. Conservative Party members will vote for their next leader after an initial list of 10 candidates to replace Mrs May waswhittled down to Mr Hunt and Mr Johnsonfollowing a series of votes by Tory MPs. Members will receive their ballots between 6 and 8 July, with the new leader expected to be announced in the week beginning 22 July. Correction 24 June 2019: A previous version of this article stated Jeremy Hunt wanted Boris Johnson to answer questions about his private life, and was headlined to reflect this.

"President Erdogan has spearheaded numerous major infrastructure projects as part of a programme to modernise Turkey From humble beginnings, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has grown into a political giant, leading Turkey for 20 years and reshaping his country more than any leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the revered father of the modern republic. Despite being buffeted by a series of crises, he still came out on top in the first round of the 2023 presidential race and is tipped to maintain his grip on power. He was in his most vulnerable position for years, his opponents convinced they could defeat him. Critics blamed his unorthodox economic policies for exacerbating Turkey's cost-of-living crisis. And for a pugnacious leader who built a proud record on modernising and developing Turkey, he appeared slow to react to the loss of more than 50,000 lives in double earthquakes in February. After he survived a coup attempt in 2016, he turned his presidency into an ever more powerful executive role, and cracked down on his opponents and dissent. First as prime minister from 2003 and then as directly elected president since 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has flexed Turkey's muscles as a regional power, championed Islamist causes and been quick to outmanoeuvre political opposition. Although he is the head of a Nato country, he has positioned himself as a broker in Russia's war in Ukraine and kept Sweden waiting in its bid to join the Western defensive alliance. His muscular diplomacy has riled allies in Europe and beyond. He has polarised his country but President Erdogan is a proven election winner. His supporters call himreis- ""chief"". Accusing his opponents of treating Turkey's electorate with contempt and failing to win them over he declared: ""As 85 million, we will protect our ballot, our will and our future."" Born in February 1954, Recep Tayyip Erdogan grew up the son of a coastguard, on Turkey's Black Sea coast. When he was 13, his father decided to move to Istanbul, hoping to give his five children a better upbringing. The young Erdogan sold lemonade and sesame buns to earn extra cash. He attended an Islamic school before obtaining a degree in management from Istanbul's Marmara University - and playing professional football. Erdogan supporters like his tough language and defence of traditional Muslim values In the 1970s and 80s, he was active in Islamist circles, joining Necmettin Erbakan's pro-Islamic Welfare Party. As the party grew in popularity in the 1990s, Mr Erdogan was elected as its candidate for mayor of Istanbul in 1994 and ran the city for the next four years. But his term came to an end when he was convicted of inciting racial hatred for publicly reading a nationalist poem that included the lines: ""The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers."" After serving four months in jail, he returned to politics. But his party had been banned for violating the strict secular principles of the modern Turkish state. In August 2001, he founded an new, Islamist-rooted party with ally Abdullah Gul. In 2002, the AKP won a majority in parliamentary elections, and the following year Mr Erdogan was appointed prime minister. He remains chairman of the AKP or Justice and Development Party to this day. From 2003, he spent three terms as prime minister, presiding over a period of steady economic growth and winning praise internationally as a reformer. The  middle class expanded and millions were taken out of poverty, as Mr Erdogan prioritised giant infrastructure projects to modernise Turkey. But critics warned he was becoming increasingly autocratic. By 2013, protesters took to the streets, partly because of his government's plans to transform a much-loved park in the centre of Istanbul, but also in a challenge to more authoritarian rule. The prime minister condemned the protesters as ""capulcu"" (riff-raff), and neighbourhoods would clang pots and pans at nine o'clock every night in a spirit of defiance. Allegations of corruption ensnared the sons of three cabinet allies. The Gezi Park protests marked a turning point in his rule. To his detractors, he was acting more like a sultan from the Ottoman Empire than a democrat. Mr Erdogan also fell out with a US-based Islamic scholar called Fethullah Gulen, whose social and cultural movement had helped him to victory in three consecutive elections and had been active in removing the military from politics. It was a feud that would have dramatic repercussions for Turkish society. After a decade of his rule, Mr Erdogan's party also moved to lift a ban on women wearing headscarves in public services that was introduced after a military coup in 1980. The ban was eventually lifted for women in the police, military and judiciary. Critics complained he had chipped away at the pillars of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's secular republic. While religious himself, Mr Erdogan always denied wanting to impose Islamic values, insisting he supported the rights of Turks to express their religion more openly. Mr Erdogan's wife Emine often appeared in public in a headscarf However, he has repeatedly supported criminalising adultery. And as a father of four, he has said ""no Muslim family"" should consider birth control or family planning. ""We will multiply our descendants,"" he said in May 2016. He has extolled motherhood, condemned feminists and said men and women cannot be treated equally. Mr Erdogan has long championed Islamist causes - and was known to give the four-finger salute of Egypt's repressed Muslim Brotherhood. In July 2020, he oversaw the conversion of Istanbul's historic Hagia Sophia into a mosque, angering many Christians. Built 1,500 years ago as a cathedral, it was made into a mosque by the Ottoman Turks, but Ataturk had turned it into a museum - a symbol of the new secular state. It was no accident that the president chose to address supporters at evening prayers within hours of the 2023 vote getting under way. Barred from running again for prime minister, in 2014 he stood for the largely ceremonial role of president in unprecedented direct elections. He had big plans for reforming the post, creating a new constitution that would benefit all Turks and place their country among the world's top 10 economies. But early in his presidency, he faced two jolts to his power. His party lost its majority in parliament for several months in a 2015 vote, and then months later, in 2016, Turkey witnessed its first violent attempted coup for decades. Rebel soldiers came close to capturing the president, holidaying at a coastal resort, but he was airlifted to safety. In the early hours of 16 July, he emerged triumphant at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, to the cheers of supporters. Almost 300 civilians were killed as they blocked the advance of the coup plotters. Ankara, 16 July 2016: Erdogan supporters thwarted a military coup in a night of drama The president appeared on national TV and rallied supporters in Istanbul, declaring he was the ""chief commander"". But the strain was clear when he sobbed openly while giving a speech at the funeral of a close friend, shot with his son by mutinous soldiers. How Erdogan remoulded Turkey The plot was blamed on the Gulen movement and led to some 150,000 public servants being sacked and more than 50,000 people being detained, including soldiers, journalists, lawyers, police officers, academics and Kurdish politicians. This crackdown on critics caused alarm abroad, contributing to frosty relations with the EU: Turkey's bid to join the union has not progressed for years. Arguments over an influx of migrants into Greece exacerbated the ill-feeling. But from his gleaming, 1,000-room Ak Saray palace overlooking Ankara, President Erdogan's position appeared more secure than ever. Controversy has surrounded Mr Erdogan's costly and sprawling presidential palace in Ankara He narrowly won a 2017 referendum granting him sweeping presidential powers, including the right to impose a state of emergency and appoint top public officials as well as intervene in the legal system. A year later, he secured outright victory in the first round of a presidential poll. His core vote lies in small Anatolian towns and rural, conservative areas. In 2019, his party lost in the three biggest cities - Istanbul; the capital, Ankara; and Izmir. Losing the Istanbul mayorship narrowly to Ekrem Imamoglu of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) was a bitter blow to Mr Erdogan, who was the city's mayor in the 1990s. He never accepted the result. Mr Imamoglu was ahead of the president in the opinion polls before he was barred from running in the May elections. The president and his allies were accused of using the courts to disqualify the popular mayor from the vote. Turkey's third biggest party, the pro-Kurdish HDP, also feared being banned from the parliamentary vote because of alleged links to Kurdish militants, but instead it decided to stand under a different banner. Like previous Turkish leaders, President Erdogan has cracked down hard on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Although Turkey has taken in more than 3.5 million refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war, Ankara has also launched operations against Kurdish militias across the borders, alienating Kurds in Turkey. Mr Erdogan has long held close ties with Russia's Vladimir Putin and has sought a pivotal role as a mediator in the conflict in Ukraine. Despite being the leader of a Nato state, he bought a Russian anti-missile defence system and chose Russia to build Turkey's first nuclear reactor. Ahead of the 2023 election, he sought to bolster his credentials with nationalist and conservative voters by accusing the West of moving against him. ""My nation will foil this plot,"" he asserted, describing it as a kind of breaking point. He rounded off his 2023 presidential campaign with a visit to the mausoleum of Adnan Menderes, Turkey's first democratically-elected prime minister who was executed in 1961 after a military coup. His message: ""The era of coups and juntas is over.""

"Five people have been arrested and questioned over alleged accounting fraud at the Patisserie Valerie chain, the Serious Fraud Office has said. The arrests took place last Tuesday, 18 June, in a joint operation with police, the SFO said. The move comes eight months afterthe firm's former finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrestedand freed on bail. Patisserie Valerie went into administration in January and was bought for Â£5m by Causeway Capital. The collapse followed the discovery of a huge black hole in the firm's accounts, eventually valued at Â£94m. After it went into administration, the cafe chain was found to have overstated its cash position by Â£30m and failed to disclose overdrafts of nearly Â£10m. Patisserie Valerie puts butter back in cakes Ex-Patisserie Valerie boss 'felt like emigrating' Patisserie Valerie says finance chief arrested Patisserie Valerie black hole grows to Â£94m Patisserie Valerie's former chairman, Luke Johnson, who was also its biggest shareholder, wrote earlier this month inhis column for the Sunday Times,externalthat that he had considered fleeing the UK after the scandal broke and feared becoming ""a pariah in the business world"". The Sunday Times reported that Mr Johnson was not among those arrested by the SFO. ""On Tuesday 18 June, as part of a joint operation with the Hertfordshire, Leicestershire and Metropolitan Police Services, the SFO arrested and questioned five people in connection with the ongoing investigation into individuals associated with Patisserie Holdings,"" the SFO statement said. The cafe chain had 206 outlets and 3,000 staff when it collapsed. It now has 96 shops still in operation. Causeway Capital, an Irish private equity firm, said as far as they were aware the arrests did ""not relate to any current employees of Patisserie Valerie"". Matt Scaife a partner at Causeway Capital said the new owner aimed to restore the business to growth by ""focusing on three simple values: quality, creativity and crucially integrity"". It plans to revamp the menu, provide new uniforms for staff and boost online sales. Last week, Causeway revealed that Patisserie Valerie was in such dire straits thatmanagers had ordered puff pastry be made from margarine rather than butteras a cost-cutting measure.

"The attack targeted rocket and missile systems operated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps The US launched a cyber-attack on Iranian weapons systems on Thursday as President Trump pulled out of air strikes on the country, US reports say. The cyber-attack disabled computer systems controlling rocket and missile launchers, the Washington Post said. It was in retaliation for the shooting down of a US drone as well as attacks on oil tankers that the US has blamed Iran for, the New York Times said. There is no independent confirmation of damage to Iranian systems. The US is set to impose further sanctions on Iran that President Trump has described as ""major"". He said the sanctions were needed to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and economic pressure would be maintained unless Tehran changed course. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words US-Iran relations: A brief history How US sanctions have hit Iran Speaking in Jerusalem, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said the details of the new sanctions were likely to be announced on Monday. Nobody had granted Iran ""a hunting licence in the Middle East,"" he added. This video can not be played Bolton: Iran does not have a Mid-East 'hunting licence' Tensions between the US and Iran have risen since the US last year pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reinstated sanctions, triggering economic meltdown in Iran. Last week Iran saidit would exceed internationally agreed limitson its nuclear programme. Mr Trump has said he does not want war with Iran, but warned the country would face ""obliteration"" if conflict broke out. The attack had been planned for several weeks, the sources told US media outlets, and was suggested as a way of responding to the mine attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman. It was aimed at weapons systems used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which shot down the US drone last Thursday and which the US says also attacked the tankers. Both the Washington Post andAP news agency,externalsaidthe cyber-attack had disabled the systems,external. The New York Times saidit was intended to take the systems offline,externalfor a period of time. On Saturday the US Department for Homeland Security warned that Iran was stepping up its own cyber-attacks on the US.

'Stop attacks,' UK minister urges Iran Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran US-Russia clash over power grid 'hack attacks' They were using ""destructive 'wiper' attacks"", he said, using tactics such as ""spear phishing, password spraying and credential stuffing"" in a bid to take control of entire networks. Iran has also been trying to hack US naval ship systems, the Washington Post reported. He hasn't commented on the cyber-attack reports. On Friday he said he had pulled out of launching conventional strikes on Iran because he had been told that 150 Iranians would be killed. This video can not be played Trump: ""Let's make Iran great again"" On Saturday he said he was open to talks with the Iranians. ""If Iran wants to become a prosperous nation... it's OK with me,"" Mr Trump said. ""But they're never going to do it if they think in five or six years they're going to have nuclear weapons."" ""Let's make Iran great again,"" he added, echoing his campaign slogan from the 2016 presidential election. The reinstatement of US sanctions last year - particularly those imposed on the energy, shipping and financial sectors - caused foreign investment to dry up and hit oil exports. The sanctions bar US companies from trading with Iran, but also with foreign firms or countries that are dealing with Iran. This video can not be played The BBC's James Landale went to Tehran's Grand Bazaar see what people think of the stringent sanctions This has led to shortages of imported goods and products that are made with raw materials from abroad, most notably babies' nappies. The plunging value of the rial has also affected the cost of locally produced staples such as meat and eggs, which have soared in price. Iran's IRGC said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"". But US military officials maintain the drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at the time. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a high-ranking officer in the IRGC, said another military aircraft, carrying 35 passengers, had been flying close to the drone.

"The state's governor has tasked state troopers with finding the absentees Eleven Republican senators from the state of Oregon are in hiding. They walked out of Salem's Capitol building on Thursday and state police have been given authorisation to track them down. This bizarre series of events has unfolded amid a deep rift between the state's rival parties. Oregon's Democrats, who have a clear Senate majority, want to pass landmark climate change legislation. Local Republicans have fled to stop that happening. This weekend, the state capitol had to shut down altogether amid apparent security threats from militia groups. Oregon Democrats are trying to become the second US state to pass an ambitious ""cap and trade"" climate plan. House Bill 2020 would set overall limits on state carbon emissions, with permits or allowances auctioned off to polluting industries. The plan aims to encourage businesses to switch to green technology, with the goal of slashing emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Under it, petrol and diesel prices are expected to go up. Republicans say these changes will disproportionally affect rural Oregonians, like farm workers and loggers. They argue the plan should be referred to a state-wide ballot so ""every Oregonian has a voice"". Climate change: where we are in seven charts Final call to stop 'climate catastrophe' Democrats hold 18 of the 30 seats in the state senate, but 20 senators have to be present for a vote to take place. On Thursday, the 11 Republicans who currently hold seats failed to show up for floor proceedings after negotiations broke down, blocking the legislation's progress. Democratic Governor Kate Brown then authorised state police to try to locate them. ""It is absolutely unacceptable that the Senate Republicans would turn their back on their constituents who they are honour-bound to represent here in this building,"" she said in a statement. ""They need to return and do the jobs they were elected to do."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Republicans released a statement explaining their walkout. ""Oregonians deserve better. It's time for the majority party to consider all Oregonians - not just the ones in Portland,"" Senate Republican Leader Herman Baerschiger Jr said regarding the rural-city divide. This is the second time they have recently walked out - winning concessions on gun and vaccination laws after another incident last month. Other boycotts have also been known to happen elsewhere, including by Wisconsin Democrats in 2011. They are rumoured to have fled into neighbouring Idaho - where police are not authorised to look for them. The current legislative session is due to end on 30 June and the Republican whip has said they will ""run out the clock"" on it ""until this storm of false narratives and intimidation passes"". Before the walkout, Democrats had already said they would be willing to use police to try to force absent Republicans to come back. The row has crippled Oregon's Capitol One lawmaker, Brian Boquist, responded angrily. Speaking to a local news outlet on Wednesday, he said police should ""send bachelors and come heavily armed"" if they were to try to arrest him. ""I'm not going to be a political prisoner in the state of Oregon. It's just that simple,"" he said. His comments were condemned by Democrats who said ""threats like these are unacceptable"". The senators are being ordered to pay $500 (Â£390) each for every day they are absent. An online fundraiser to pay their fines has so far raised almost $38,000 (Â£30,000) as of Sunday. State Senate President Peter Courtney, a Democrat, said police had established a possible militia threat and recommended the closure of the Capitol on Saturday. Another Democratic lawmaker, Sara Gelser, tweeted that they had been notified ""we were physically in danger"". Self-described ""patriot"" groups had reportedly planned a two-day ""Rally to Take the Capitol"" event on Facebook,externalfor the weekend. Online comments by members of militia groups also pledged to provide armed security and escorts to the Republicans, US media report. It's not the first time that militias and libertarians in the state have made headlines. In 2016,a militia group was involved in a stand-off with federal agents for weeks at an Oregon wildlife refuge. In recent days, the @Oregon_GOP Twitter account has been mocking the militia claims and sharing content from protests and locals who support their walkout.

"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was addressing Conservatives in Peterhead Conservative leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt has said he would never allow the break-up of the United Kingdom if he becomes prime minister. Speaking at an event in Aberdeenshire, Boris Johnson's rival said he would support the union with ""every drop of blood in my veins"". His comments come after Scotland's first minister said Mr Johnson would be ""disastrous"" for the Scottish Tories. Boris Johnson is the front-runner to replace Theresa May in Number 10. Speaking in Peterhead, Jeremy Hunt told local Conservatives that he would fight to preserve the United Kingdom. Johnson and Hunt make pitch to be PM Compare the candidates It follows apoll of 1,024 Scottish voters for the Sunday Times,externalsuggested that more than half would vote to leave the UK if Boris Johnson were to become prime minister. Nicola Sturgeon has already earmarked the second half of 2020 for when a second Scottish independence referendum could be held. Mr Hunt told Conservatives: ""I'm in Scotland today because I'm the prime minister that Nicola Sturgeon does not want because I passionately support the union with every drop of blood in my veins. ""I will never allow the union to be broken up as prime minister."" He added: ""I would never pay any price if it meant that Scotland would become independent."" Boris Johnson has refused to answer questions about a row at his home He was referring to another recent poll that suggested a majority of Conservative Party members wanted Brexit even if it meant Scotland gaining independence. Mr Hunt replied: ""I don't actually believe that polling. ""Conservative Party members I know are absolutely passionate about our precious union."" The foreign secretary also said that the public did not want a debate on his Tory leadership rival's private life. Boris Johnson hasdodged questions on reports of a row with his partner that led to police being called. ""It's up to him what he says, but I don't think the public, and I don't think Conservative Party members, want a big debate about people's personal lives,"" Mr Hunt said. He added that they wanted a ""proper debate"" about how ""we're going to get out of the ""Brexit constitutional crisis"". In an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News,external, Ms Sturgeon was asked her views on the impact choosing Boris Johnson as prime minister would have on the Conservatives in Scotland. She said: ""I think he would be devastating, disastrous for the Conservatives UK-wide but particularly in Scotland. ""He is seen in Scotland I think as one of the principal politicians who are responsible for the mess that we are in over Brexit, the guy who misled people in the EU referendum campaign and the guy who now says he is prepared to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, for most people in Scotland that is a horrifying prospect."" Ms Sturgeon also said that Mr Johnson had made ""overtly racist"" comments when hecompared Burka-wearing Muslim women to ""letterboxes"". Speaking on the BBC'sSunday Politics Scotland, Conservative MP for Aberdeen South, Ross Thomson responded to Ms Sturgeon's comments by saying: ""As usual, Nicola Sturgeon is using any opportunity to whip up support for her separatist agenda. ""The truth is that Boris Johnson is absolutely committed to not just protecting, but to strengthening our union if he becomes PM."" It comes as theInternational Trade Secretary Liam Foxsaid Mr John should ""just give an explanation"" about the row recorded at his home by a neighbour earlier this week. The MP said reports of the row between Mr Johnson and his partner should not be a ""distraction"" from policy discussion in the leadership race.

"Five people have been arrested and questioned over alleged accounting fraud at the Patisserie Valerie chain, the Serious Fraud Office has said. The arrests took place last Tuesday, 18 June, in a joint operation with police, the SFO said. The move comes eight months afterthe firm's former finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrestedand freed on bail. Patisserie Valerie went into administration in January and was bought for Â£5m by Causeway Capital. The collapse followed the discovery of a huge black hole in the firm's accounts, eventually valued at Â£94m. After it went into administration, the cafe chain was found to have overstated its cash position by Â£30m and failed to disclose overdrafts of nearly Â£10m. Patisserie Valerie puts butter back in cakes Ex-Patisserie Valerie boss 'felt like emigrating' Patisserie Valerie says finance chief arrested Patisserie Valerie black hole grows to Â£94m Patisserie Valerie's former chairman, Luke Johnson, who was also its biggest shareholder, wrote earlier this month inhis column for the Sunday Times,externalthat that he had considered fleeing the UK after the scandal broke and feared becoming ""a pariah in the business world"". The Sunday Times reported that Mr Johnson was not among those arrested by the SFO. ""On Tuesday 18 June, as part of a joint operation with the Hertfordshire, Leicestershire and Metropolitan Police Services, the SFO arrested and questioned five people in connection with the ongoing investigation into individuals associated with Patisserie Holdings,"" the SFO statement said. The cafe chain had 206 outlets and 3,000 staff when it collapsed. It now has 96 shops still in operation. Causeway Capital, an Irish private equity firm, said as far as they were aware the arrests did ""not relate to any current employees of Patisserie Valerie"". Matt Scaife a partner at Causeway Capital said the new owner aimed to restore the business to growth by ""focusing on three simple values: quality, creativity and crucially integrity"". It plans to revamp the menu, provide new uniforms for staff and boost online sales.

"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was addressing Conservatives in Peterhead Conservative leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt has said he would never allow the break-up of the United Kingdom if he becomes prime minister. Speaking at an event in Aberdeenshire, Boris Johnson's rival said he would support the union with ""every drop of blood in my veins"". His comments come after Scotland's first minister said Mr Johnson would be ""disastrous"" for the Scottish Tories. Boris Johnson is the front-runner to replace Theresa May in Number 10. Speaking in Peterhead, Jeremy Hunt told local Conservatives that he would fight to preserve the United Kingdom. Johnson and Hunt make pitch to be PM Compare the candidates It follows apoll of 1,024 Scottish voters for the Sunday Times,externalsuggested that more than half would vote to leave the UK if Boris Johnson were to become prime minister. Nicola Sturgeon has already earmarked the second half of 2020 for when a second Scottish independence referendum could be held. Mr Hunt told Conservatives: ""I'm in Scotland today because I'm the prime minister that Nicola Sturgeon does not want because I passionately support the union with every drop of blood in my veins. ""I will never allow the union to be broken up as prime minister."" He added: ""I would never pay any price if it meant that Scotland would become independent."" Boris Johnson has refused to answer questions about a row at his home He was referring to another recent poll that suggested a majority of Conservative Party members wanted Brexit even if it meant Scotland gaining independence. Mr Hunt replied: ""I don't actually believe that polling. ""Conservative Party members I know are absolutely passionate about our precious union."" The foreign secretary also said that the public did not want a debate on his Tory leadership rival's private life. Boris Johnson hasdodged questions on reports of a row with his partner that led to police being called. ""It's up to him what he says, but I don't think the public, and I don't think Conservative Party members, want a big debate about people's personal lives,"" Mr Hunt said. He added that they wanted a ""proper debate"" about how ""we're going to get out of the ""Brexit constitutional crisis"". In an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News,external, Ms Sturgeon was asked her views on the impact choosing Boris Johnson as prime minister would have on the Conservatives in Scotland. She said: ""I think he would be devastating, disastrous for the Conservatives UK-wide but particularly in Scotland. ""He is seen in Scotland I think as one of the principal politicians who are responsible for the mess that we are in over Brexit, the guy who misled people in the EU referendum campaign and the guy who now says he is prepared to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, for most people in Scotland that is a horrifying prospect."" Ms Sturgeon also said that Mr Johnson had made ""overtly racist"" comments when hecompared Burka-wearing Muslim women to ""letterboxes"". Speaking on the BBC'sSunday Politics Scotland, Conservative MP for Aberdeen South, Ross Thomson responded to Ms Sturgeon's comments by saying: ""As usual, Nicola Sturgeon is using any opportunity to whip up support for her separatist agenda. ""The truth is that Boris Johnson is absolutely committed to not just protecting, but to strengthening our union if he becomes PM."" It comes as theInternational Trade Secretary Liam Foxsaid Mr John should ""just give an explanation"" about the row recorded at his home by a neighbour earlier this week. The MP said reports of the row between Mr Johnson and his partner should not be a ""distraction"" from policy discussion in the leadership race.

"The attack targeted rocket and missile systems operated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps The US launched a cyber-attack on Iranian weapons systems on Thursday as President Trump pulled out of air strikes on the country, US reports say. The cyber-attack disabled computer systems controlling rocket and missile launchers, the Washington Post said. It was in retaliation for the shooting down of a US drone as well as attacks on oil tankers that the US has blamed Iran for, the New York Times said. There is no independent confirmation of damage to Iranian systems. The US is set to impose further sanctions on Iran that President Trump has described as ""major"". He said the sanctions were needed to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and economic pressure would be maintained unless Tehran changed course. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words US-Iran relations: A brief history How US sanctions have hit Iran Speaking in Jerusalem, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said the details of the new sanctions were likely to be announced on Monday. Nobody had granted Iran ""a hunting licence in the Middle East,"" he added. This video can not be played Bolton: Iran does not have a Mid-East 'hunting licence' Tensions between the US and Iran have risen since the US last year pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reinstated sanctions, triggering economic meltdown in Iran. Last week Iran saidit would exceed internationally agreed limitson its nuclear programme. Mr Trump has said he does not want war with Iran, but warned the country would face ""obliteration"" if conflict broke out. The attack had been planned for several weeks, the sources told US media outlets, and was suggested as a way of responding to the mine attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman. It was aimed at weapons systems used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which shot down the US drone last Thursday and which the US says also attacked the tankers. Both the Washington Post andAP news agency,externalsaidthe cyber-attack had disabled the systems,external. The New York Times saidit was intended to take the systems offline,externalfor a period of time. On Saturday the US Department for Homeland Security warned that Iran was stepping up its own cyber-attacks on the US. Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said ""malicious cyberactivity"" was being directed at US industries and government agencies by ""Iranian regime actors and their proxies"". 'Stop attacks,' UK minister urges Iran Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran US-Russia clash over power grid 'hack attacks' They were using ""destructive 'wiper' attacks"", he said, using tactics such as ""spear phishing, password spraying and credential stuffing"" in a bid to take control of entire networks. Iran has also been trying to hack US naval ship systems, the Washington Post reported. He hasn't commented on the cyber-attack reports. On Friday he said he had pulled out of launching conventional strikes on Iran because he had been told that 150 Iranians would be killed. This video can not be played Trump: ""Let's make Iran great again"" On Saturday he said he was open to talks with the Iranians. ""If Iran wants to become a prosperous nation... it's OK with me,"" Mr Trump said. ""But they're never going to do it if they think in five or six years they're going to have nuclear weapons."" ""Let's make Iran great again,"" he added, echoing his campaign slogan from the 2016 presidential election. The reinstatement of US sanctions last year - particularly those imposed on the energy, shipping and financial sectors - caused foreign investment to dry up and hit oil exports. The sanctions bar US companies from trading with Iran, but also with foreign firms or countries that are dealing with Iran. This video can not be played The BBC's James Landale went to Tehran's Grand Bazaar see what people think of the stringent sanctions This has led to shortages of imported goods and products that are made with raw materials from abroad, most notably babies' nappies. The plunging value of the rial has also affected the cost of locally produced staples such as meat and eggs, which have soared in price. Iran's IRGC said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"". But US military officials maintain the drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at the time. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a high-ranking officer in the IRGC, said another military aircraft, carrying 35 passengers, had been flying close to the drone.

"Team sport players are as good at endurance as long-distance runners and as powerful as bodybuilders - and it is down to their blend of training, a study suggests. The key is to combine strength and endurance training, researchers from Manchester Metropolitan University say. Cycling, running or swimming is recommended for all-round fitness. But climbing stairs or doing chores - energetically - also works, as an alternative to the gym, they said. The research team compared the performance of three different groups of male athletes, who trained at least three times a week in their sport. There were 87 endurance athletes, such as road cyclists, skiers and distance runners, 77 power athletes, such as sprinters, bodybuilders and throwers, and 64 team athletes involved in football, basketball and volleyball. All were from the Lithuanian Sports University in Kaunas, Lithuania, and aged 17 to 37. The athletes were all tested on muscle power, how high they could jump vertically from a standing position, and their ability to use oxygen during intense exercise - a measure of aerobic endurance. The researchers discovered that team athletes had a similar aerobic stamina to endurance athletes and a similar jump range to power athletes. Professor Hans Degens, lead study author and professor of muscle physiology, said: ""Our study shows team athletes actually have the best of both and that is a fantastic observation. We did not expect to find that. ""It demonstrates that endurance training for power athletes and power training for endurance athletes is not detrimental."" He said bodybuilders tended to think that any kind of endurance training would result in them losing muscle mass and reducing their performance levels. But this wasn't the case, he explained. ""In physiological terms, if you are doing any physical activity then you need to employ a certain amount of muscle for a movement. ""But if you can recruit a smaller proportion of that muscle to do exactly the same amount of work then you can delay the onset of fatigue - or you can perform the movement at a higher speed."" Prof Degens said the findings were relevant to anyone taking part in any type of sport or fitness - not just elite athletes. ""If you're a very slender person who is more suited to endurance, or a very stocky person more suited to power, it won't harm to introduce exercises of the other type."" He said they now planned to look at how much combination training was needed to bring up performance levels to that of a specialist endurance or power athlete. Transforming fitness in South Africa.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt accuses Boris Johnson of ""ducking very important questions"" Jeremy Hunt has accused Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson of ""ducking"" scrutiny, saying a would-be PM ""should answer questions on everything"". However, Mr Hunt said people ""don't want a big debate"" about politicians' private lives after several Tories urged Mr Johnson to address questions about a row with his girlfriend. Cabinet minister Liam Fox said it was better to explain what happened than allow it to become a ""distraction"". Mr Johnson has refused to comment. The leadership frontrunner dodged questions on the issueon Saturday at a Conservative Party hustings held as part of the contest to replace Theresa May as leader and ultimately prime minister. It comes after a neighbour called police and recorded a heated row at the home Mr Johnson shares with his partner, Carrie Symonds, in Camberwell, south London. Defending his actions, neighbour Tom Penntold the Guardian,externalhe had been worried about his neighbours' safety, adding: ""I hope that anybody would have done the same thing."" He said he began recording from inside his flat, after he heard ""slamming and banging"" in the early hours of Friday. In the recording - heard by the Guardian, but not by the BBC - Ms Symonds could reportedly be heard telling the Tory MP to ""get off me"" and ""get out of my flat"". This video can not be played Liam Fox on Boris: 'It's always easier to just give an explanation' Neighbour defends Johnson row recording Watch: Boris Johnson avoids questions about 'home row' Johnson and Hunt make pitch to be PM Asked about the issue, Mr Hunt told Sky News: ""I think someone who wants to be PM should answer questions on everything, but I'm not going to comment on character."" But the foreign secretary also said he thought the story about Mr Johnson's row with his girlfriend was ""irrelevant to the leadership debate"" because the country was in ""such a serious situation"" over Brexit. ""What happens in people's personal lives is really a matter for them. ""What people care about is who is going to be the wise prime minister who navigates this country out of the biggest constitutional crisis in our lifetimes."" Later, to the BBC, he repeated his calls for Mr Johnson to debate live with him on television, and accused him of ""not answering"" the ""difficult"" questions about Brexit. The comments came after International Trade Secretary Mr Fox - a backer of Mr Hunt - told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that it was ""always easier to just give an explanation"" about what had happened. ""The key thing is then how you get on to the issues,"" he said. ""What we can't have is it being a distraction from explanations about wider policy."" He said it was ""fair"" for candidates to be asked questions about their character, but added: ""I'm not sure what we've seen over the last few days is a fair reflection of that."" But Mr Fox dismissed suggestions that Mr Johnson's private life made him a potential security risk. Recalling Mr Johnson's previous role in government, he said: ""Do you think Theresa May would make him foreign secretary if there were genuine worries about him being a security risk?"" ""I think we have to get away from these distractions and talk about policy issues."" Meanwhile, speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 Live, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said Mr Johnson had a proven record, so ""people know what he's like in office"". Carrie Symonds has been in a relationship with Mr Johnson since 2018 Asked about the row, she said: ""There's no point asking me. I believe it's a private matter - I don't think the public are concerned about that. ""Boris served for eight years as mayor of London, did a brilliant job; he's served as foreign secretary - people know what he's like in office, and that's what's important."" But shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said Mr Johnson was ""completely unsuitable"" to be prime minister. Speaking on Sky News, he said: ""In one sense, of course, it is a private matter, but when you're running for public office, when you are wanting to be the prime minister of the UK, then these matters are in the public interest. ""I've long held the view that Boris Johnson is unsuitable to be prime minister of this country."" Police were called to Ms Symond's Camberwell flat On Saturday, Mr Johnson repeatedly avoided questions about the incident ashe and Mr Hunt made their pitches to Tory party memberson why they should succeed Mrs May as prime minister. When the event moderator, Iain Dale, accused him of ducking the question,Mr Johnson did not respond directly, instead saying: ""People are entitled to ask me what I want to do for the country."" Mr Dale was heckled by some in the audience when he continued to press the MP, but Mr Johnson later defended his persistence. ""There will have been lots of other people in the audience who didn't boo, and who actually did want to hear the answer to that question,"" Mr Dale told the BBC. It was the first of 16 events, or hustings, to choose the next Conservative party leader - and prime minister - following Mrs May's resignation after she failed to get her Brexit deal through Parliament. She remains in office until her successor is found. Conservative Party members will vote for their next leader after an initial list of 10 candidates to replace Mrs May waswhittled down to Mr Hunt and Mr Johnsonfollowing a series of votes by Tory MPs. Members will receive their ballots between 6 and 8 July, with the new leader expected to be announced in the week beginning 22 July. Correction 24 June 2019: A previous version of this article stated Jeremy Hunt wanted Boris Johnson to answer questions about his private life, and was headlined to reflect this.

"Young Israeli soldiers take a selfie Time to join some dots. The WhatsApp hack, ""sabotaged"" oil tankers, the push in the US to proscribe the Muslim Brotherhood and ""plans"" to deploy American troops to the Gulf are all strands of the same story. At its heart is the struggle between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Israeli army is unique in that it forms the backbone of many industrial enterprises in Israel. That's because the bonds formed during national service last a lifetime there. It is the singular most important time in a young person's life - way more formative than the university years. US 'blames Iran' for damaged tankers WhatsApp discovers surveillance attack US to declare Muslim Brotherhood terrorists It's the ultimate ""old boy network"", though this one is made up of ""old boys and girls"". The Israeli army takes in every youngster, assesses their greatest strength and parks them where they can do the most national good. The computer nerds who would otherwise be locked in their mum's basement are forced out into the light and into doing their national service in cyber-warfare. When they leave the army, they take the skills and the connections they made into the industrial sector and they form companies like the NSO Group. The NSO Group makes hacking tools to sell to governments to fight crime and terrorism. But - and it is a big but - they'll only get an export licence from the Israeli government if it deems that the sale does not harm the national interest. In the past that meant no sales to Iran and nothing to Arab Gulf states either. That's because in the past the Gulf states stood with the Palestinians against Israel. In the post-Arab Spring period, the Gulf states (apart from Qatar) have all but abandoned the Palestinian cause and moved to side with Israel against Iran. This slow shift was accelerated by the election of Donald Trump and the appointment of so many anti-Iran hawks to his administration, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton. This video can not be played US special representative for Iran: 'We are not looking to get into a war' There's much speculation that the Israeli government would, to build relations with their new friends in the Gulf, have allowed the NSO Group to sell their software to Gulf states. What suggests that? Well it's perhaps not a coincidence that among those reportedly targeted by the WhatsApp hacking software were lawyers investigating human rights abuses in Gulf states, a Saudi dissident and a Qatari citizen. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made his reason for being (and his only political legacy) his effort to contain Iran, which he projects as Israel's only existential threat. The Saudi rulers see two existential threats. One from without: Iran. And one from within: the Muslim Brotherhood. The Saudis are scared of Iran because of its military might. They are scared of the Muslim Brotherhood because they offer political Islam as an alternative to the dynastic rule of the royal family. The Trump administration decided to pursue sanctions against the Muslim Brotherhood following an April meeting with Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi The Trump administration is made up of people who hate the Iranian regime and everything it stands for. So, this new ""Axis of Egos"" is all doing each other favours to position themselves collectively to fully unite against Iran. Lots of trades are taking place. Some involve arms sales, some involve the price of oil and gas, some involve political trades like the one that some in the White House are doing for the Saudis by trying to designate the Brotherhood as a terrorist group. In a replay of what happened before the invasion of Iraq, it appears that any strand of intelligence that can be spun into a reason to ratchet up the pressure on Iran is being used. UAE Navy boats pictured next to Al Marzoqah, a Saudi Arabian tanker which was reportedly ""sabotaged"" This atmosphere is all very familiar to those of us who were around to witness the build-up towards the war in Iraq. The difference is that the US president in charge then - George W Bush - was driven partly by an ideological belief that it was his destiny to bring democracy to the Middle East. And that involved taking out Saddam Hussein. The present occupant in the White House has far fewer ideological bones in his body, perhaps none. The signature of the Trump presidency is transactional politics built around business need. President Trump's foreign policy doctrine is ""America First"". He's unlikely to sign up to another war in the Middle East, certainly not this side of the 2020 election, unless he is seriously provoked. That would require being able to pin some very bad action on Tehran. The best way to do that is to gather intelligence. And the best way to gather intelligence is for all your allies to be spying on as many people in the region as you can. One of the best ways to do that is to hack into the Trojan horse we all voluntarily carry with us, our smartphones.

"The value of Iran's currency hit record lows as a result of the US sanctions The United States reinstated economic sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear deal in May 2018. Mr Trump says he wants to apply ""maximum pressure"" on the government in Tehran to compel it to renegotiate the accord. But Iran's leaders have remained defiant. The substantial impact the sanctions have had on the country is clear, and the economic hardship Iranians are facing helped trigger widespread protests in November 2019 that were brutally quashed by the authorities. Iran's economy was badly affected for several years by sanctions imposed by the international community over the country's nuclear programme. In 2015, President Hassan Rouhani agreed a deal with the US and five other world powers to limit Iranian nuclear activities in return for the lifting of those sanctions. The following year, after the deal was implemented, Iran's economy bounced back and GDP grew 12.3%, according to the Central Bank of Iran. But much of that growth was attributed to the oil and gas industry, and the recoveries of other sectors were not as significant as many Iranians had hoped. Growth fell back to 3.7% in 2017, helping to fuel the economic discontent that led to the biggest anti-government protests in Iran for almost a decade that December. The reinstatement of US sanctions in 2018 - particularly those imposed on the energy, shipping and financial sectors that November - caused foreign investment to dry up and hit oil exports. The sanctions bar US companies from trading with Iran, but also with foreign firms or countries that are dealing with Iran. This video can not be played Tehran's poorest hit by US sanctions In May 2019, Mr Trump ended exemptions from US secondary sanctions - such as exclusion from US markets - for major importers of Iranian oil and tightened restrictions on the Iranian banking sector. He said the decision was ""intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue"". As a result of the sanctions,Iran's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted an estimated 4.8% in the 2018 and is forecast to shrink another 9.5% in 2019,external, according to the International Monetary Fund. The unemployment rate meanwhile rose from 14.5% in 2018 to 16.8% in 2019. The IMF is forecasting zero growth in 2020, which would support Mr Rouhani's assertion in October that Iran has ridden out ""the storm"" caused by the sanctions. Has Iran's economy benefited from the nuclear deal? At the start of 2018, Iran's crude oil production reached 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), according to data gathered from secondary sources by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). The country was exporting about 2.3 million bpd. Most of the oil was bought by eight countries or territories that were granted six-month exemptions by the US when sanctions on the Iranian energy sector took effect - China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Greece and Italy. By March, Iran's oil exports had fallen to 1.1 million barrels per day on average A condition of the waivers was that the importers reduce their purchases of Iranian oil, and by April 2019 Iran's oil exports had fallen to 1 million bpd on average, according to Bloomberg. That reduced the government's revenue by billions of dollars. Two months later, President Trump decided to allow the exemptions to expire and declared that he ""intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero"". By October 2019, Iran's crude oil production had fallen to 2.1 million bpd on average, according to Opec's data. Bloomberg reported that only 260,000 bpd on average was being exported. However, analysts have said the figure may not reflect actual deliveries due to reported activities by Iran and its customers to conceal purchases or avoid tracking of tankers. Iranian tankers have been accused of flouting international rules by turning off their Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders. Iran is also said to frequently conduct ship-to-ship transfers to move oil and oil products. The plummeting oil sales have also led to a significant fall in Iran's foreign exchange earnings. The IMF estimates that Iran's reserves of foreign currency have been reduced to $86bn - 20% below their level in 2013. A senior US official, Brian Hook, said in December 2019 that he believedIran had access to only 10% of those reserves,externalbecause of restrictions on its financial sector, and that as a result it would struggle to prop up its currency and prevent inflation. Iran's government itself forecasts thatoil export revenues will be reduced by 70% in the next Iranian fiscal year,external. Is it about to get more expensive to fill my car? Currency traders were offering 143,000 rials to the US dollar at the end of April President Rouhani kept the Iranian currency stable for almost four years. But it has lost 50% of its value against the US dollar on the unofficial market since the US abandoned the nuclear deal, according to foreign exchange websites. The fixed official rate of 42,000 rials to the dollar is used for a limited range of transactions, so most Iranians rely on currency traders. Bonbast.com reported that traders were offering 13,650 rials to the dollar in early December 2019. The rial's slide has been attributed to Iran's economic problems and a high demand for foreign currency among ordinary Iranians who have seen the value of their savings eroded and their purchasing power cut sharply. The rial has regained some of its value since September 2018, when the Central Bank of Iran released more dollars into the market and authorities cracked down on currency dealers as prices reached a record low of 176,000 to the dollar. Iran's currency woes have also led to shortages of imported goods and products that are made with raw materials from abroad, most notably babies' nappies. What babies' nappies tell us about Iran's economic woes President Rouhani managed to get inflation down to 9% in 2017. But the IMF estimated that it soared to 30.5% in 2018 and projected that it would reach 35.7% in 2019. The World Bank has said that inflation in Iran has been especially high for food items,external, with meat products 116% more expensive year-on-year in April 2019, and that the rural population has been disproportionally affected. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained The Statistical Centre of Iran reported thatthe Consumer Price Index (CPI) 12-month rate of inflation for households stood at 42% in late October 2019,external. Food and beverage prices were up by 61% year-on-year and the price of tobacco was up by 80%. The price rises led to long queues at government-subsidised grocery shops, particularly for rationed meat. In an attempt to lower prices, the government banned livestock exports, flew in hundreds of thousands of cows and sheep from abroad. In November 2019, the government unexpectedly announced it was cutting petrol subsidies. It said the price of petrol would rise by 50% to 15,000 rials a litre ($0.12; Â£0.09 at the unofficial market exchange rate), and that drivers of private cars would be allowed to purchase only 60 litres each month before the price rose to 30,000 rials. Mr Rouhani said the $2.5bn in savings would allow the government to provide additional help to 18 million families. But the price rises caused widespread anger, and hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Iran. A crackdown by security forces left at least 208 people dead and thousands injured, according to Amnesty International. The government dismissed such figures as ""utter lies"".

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt accuses Boris Johnson of ""ducking very important questions"" Jeremy Hunt has accused Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson of ""ducking"" scrutiny, saying a would-be PM ""should answer questions on everything"". However, Mr Hunt said people ""don't want a big debate"" about politicians' private lives after several Tories urged Mr Johnson to address questions about a row with his girlfriend. Cabinet minister Liam Fox said it was better to explain what happened than allow it to become a ""distraction"". Mr Johnson has refused to comment. The leadership frontrunner dodged questions on the issueon Saturday at a Conservative Party hustings held as part of the contest to replace Theresa May as leader and ultimately prime minister. It comes after a neighbour called police and recorded a heated row at the home Mr Johnson shares with his partner, Carrie Symonds, in Camberwell, south London. Defending his actions, neighbour Tom Penntold the Guardian,externalhe had been worried about his neighbours' safety, adding: ""I hope that anybody would have done the same thing."" He said he began recording from inside his flat, after he heard ""slamming and banging"" in the early hours of Friday. In the recording - heard by the Guardian, but not by the BBC - Ms Symonds could reportedly be heard telling the Tory MP to ""get off me"" and ""get out of my flat"". This video can not be played Liam Fox on Boris: 'It's always easier to just give an explanation' Neighbour defends Johnson row recording Watch: Boris Johnson avoids questions about 'home row' Johnson and Hunt make pitch to be PM Asked about the issue, Mr Hunt told Sky News: ""I think someone who wants to be PM should answer questions on everything, but I'm not going to comment on character."" But the foreign secretary also said he thought the story about Mr Johnson's row with his girlfriend was ""irrelevant to the leadership debate"" because the country was in ""such a serious situation"" over Brexit. ""What happens in people's personal lives is really a matter for them. ""What people care about is who is going to be the wise prime minister who navigates this country out of the biggest constitutional crisis in our lifetimes."" Later, to the BBC, he repeated his calls for Mr Johnson to debate live with him on television, and accused him of ""not answering"" the ""difficult"" questions about Brexit. The comments came after International Trade Secretary Mr Fox - a backer of Mr Hunt - told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that it was ""always easier to just give an explanation"" about what had happened. ""The key thing is then how you get on to the issues,"" he said. ""What we can't have is it being a distraction from explanations about wider policy."" He said it was ""fair"" for candidates to be asked questions about their character, but added: ""I'm not sure what we've seen over the last few days is a fair reflection of that."" But Mr Fox dismissed suggestions that Mr Johnson's private life made him a potential security risk. Recalling Mr Johnson's previous role in government, he said: ""Do you think Theresa May would make him foreign secretary if there were genuine worries about him being a security risk?"" ""I think we have to get away from these distractions and talk about policy issues."" Meanwhile, speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 Live, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said Mr Johnson had a proven record, so ""people know what he's like in office"". Carrie Symonds has been in a relationship with Mr Johnson since 2018 Asked about the row, she said: ""There's no point asking me. I believe it's a private matter - I don't think the public are concerned about that. ""Boris served for eight years as mayor of London, did a brilliant job; he's served as foreign secretary - people know what he's like in office, and that's what's important."" But shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said Mr Johnson was ""completely unsuitable"" to be prime minister. Speaking on Sky News, he said: ""In one sense, of course, it is a private matter, but when you're running for public office, when you are wanting to be the prime minister of the UK, then these matters are in the public interest. ""I've long held the view that Boris Johnson is unsuitable to be prime minister of this country."" Police were called to Ms Symond's Camberwell flat On Saturday, Mr Johnson repeatedly avoided questions about the incident ashe and Mr Hunt made their pitches to Tory party memberson why they should succeed Mrs May as prime minister. When the event moderator, Iain Dale, accused him of ducking the question,Mr Johnson did not respond directly, instead saying: ""People are entitled to ask me what I want to do for the country."" Mr Dale was heckled by some in the audience when he continued to press the MP, but Mr Johnson later defended his persistence. ""There will have been lots of other people in the audience who didn't boo, and who actually did want to hear the answer to that question,"" Mr Dale told the BBC. It was the first of 16 events, or hustings, to choose the next Conservative party leader - and prime minister - following Mrs May's resignation after she failed to get her Brexit deal through Parliament. She remains in office until her successor is found. Conservative Party members will vote for their next leader after an initial list of 10 candidates to replace Mrs May waswhittled down to Mr Hunt and Mr Johnsonfollowing a series of votes by Tory MPs. Members will receive their ballots between 6 and 8 July, with the new leader expected to be announced in the week beginning 22 July. Correction 24 June 2019: A previous version of this article stated Jeremy Hunt wanted Boris Johnson to answer questions about his private life, and was headlined to reflect this. It has been amended to make clear Mr Hunt's demands were for Mr Johnson to explain his policies in full.

"Team sport players are as good at endurance as long-distance runners and as powerful as bodybuilders - and it is down to their blend of training, a study suggests. The key is to combine strength and endurance training, researchers from Manchester Metropolitan University say. Cycling, running or swimming is recommended for all-round fitness. But climbing stairs or doing chores - energetically - also works, as an alternative to the gym, they said. The research team compared the performance of three different groups of male athletes, who trained at least three times a week in their sport. There were 87 endurance athletes, such as road cyclists, skiers and distance runners, 77 power athletes, such as sprinters, bodybuilders and throwers, and 64 team athletes involved in football, basketball and volleyball. All were from the Lithuanian Sports University in Kaunas, Lithuania, and aged 17 to 37. The athletes were all tested on muscle power, how high they could jump vertically from a standing position, and their ability to use oxygen during intense exercise - a measure of aerobic endurance. The researchers discovered that team athletes had a similar aerobic stamina to endurance athletes and a similar jump range to power athletes. Professor Hans Degens, lead study author and professor of muscle physiology, said: ""Our study shows team athletes actually have the best of both and that is a fantastic observation. We did not expect to find that. ""It demonstrates that endurance training for power athletes and power training for endurance athletes is not detrimental."" He said bodybuilders tended to think that any kind of endurance training would result in them losing muscle mass and reducing their performance levels. But this wasn't the case, he explained. ""In physiological terms, if you are doing any physical activity then you need to employ a certain amount of muscle for a movement. ""But if you can recruit a smaller proportion of that muscle to do exactly the same amount of work then you can delay the onset of fatigue - or you can perform the movement at a higher speed."" Prof Degens said the findings were relevant to anyone taking part in any type of sport or fitness - not just elite athletes. ""If you're a very slender person who is more suited to endurance, or a very stocky person more suited to power, it won't harm to introduce exercises of the other type."" He said they now planned to look at how much combination training was needed to bring up performance levels to that of a specialist endurance or power athlete. Transforming fitness in South Africa.
