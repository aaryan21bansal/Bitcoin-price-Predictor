"Luke Symons, who has taken the name Jamal, on his wedding day in Yemen A Welshman has been released from detention in Yemen after being held without charge or trial for five years. Luke Symons, of Cardiff,was 25 when he was seized in 2017 by the Houthis, a rebel group fighting the Yemen government in the civil war. He was seized as a suspected spy, a claim his family have called ""ridiculous"". UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss thanked ""our Omani and Saudi partners for their support in securing his release"". Ms Truss said: ""I am pleased Luke Symons, who was unlawfully detained, without charge or trial since 2017 in Yemen, has been released. ""He was allegedly mistreated, in solitary confinement, and refused visits by his family, he has been flown to Muscat [in Oman], and soon he will be reunited with his family in the UK."" Yemen president hands power to council in major shake-up Yemen: Why is the war there getting more violent? He was one of 14 people whose release Oman said it helped to secure. They have been held in Yemen's Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa. They have now been transferred to Oman's capital, in preparation for being flown back to their own countries. Mr Symons converted to Islam in his late teens, taking the name Jamal. Aged 20, he made a pilgrimage to Mecca before travelling to Egypt, and then Yemen, where he taught English and married. When conflict broke out in 2015, he and his wife Tagreed left the country, but could not return to the UK because she had lost her passport amid the chaos. They returned to Yemen and had a baby, but continued to explore ways of escaping the bloody civilwar that has claimed thousands of lives. Two years later, as he presented his British passport to withdraw money to fund his family's passage out of Yemen, he was arrested as a suspected spy. In 2015, Saudi Arabia was alarmed by the prospect of the rebel group, the Houthis taking control of Yemen, fearing it would become a satellite of its rival Iran. The Saudi-led coalition backing the country's official government has spent seven years fighting the Houthis. However, the uprising from the Houthis started in 2011 with Yemen's long-standing authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, being forced to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. The new president was overwhelmed by the county's economic and security problems, and most of Yemen's armed forces felt more loyalty to the ousted president than they did to Mr Hadi, and the Houthis took advantage of his weakness. Because of the war, Yemen is now facing one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. Luke Symons's son Hoode was a few months old when he was seized by the Houthis Mr Symons, now 30, and his wife were detained by Houthi rebels in south west Yemen on suspicion of espionage, which his family strongly denies. His relatives have said that his physical and mental health had degenerated during solitary confinement in the capital Sanaa. His wife was released earlier and she has been able to visit him periodically in the prison. Earlier this year she voiced concern at his condition, according to his grandfather Robert Cummings, and he told the Agence France Presse news agency in February that his grandson was ""going through hell"". The case had been taken up by Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan, who said it was ""terrific news"" that he had been released. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The release comes after a two-month truce was implemented in Yemen on 2 April. It is the first nationwide ceasefire in the past six years in the Middle East country's civil war that erupted in 2014. Eilidh Macpherson, of Amnesty International, said: ""It is wonderful news and a huge relief that Luke Symons has finally been released from jail in Yemen after five years locked up in torturous conditions. ""Mr Symons was an innocent victim of the conflict in Yemen and should never have been detained in the first place, the unbearable conditions he faced - including solitary confinement - were taking a terrible toll on Luke's well-being, with his mental and physical health suffering."" She said Amnesty eagerly anticipated him finally being reunited with his family and able to travel back to Cardiff.

"P&O Ferries has been forced to reverse an attempt to pay its new, cheaper agency workers even less money. It comes after the RMT Union received reports of agency workers at Dover being asked to sign new contracts replacing their old ones on lower pay. The union reported P&O Ferries to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which ensured the new workers retained their original wages. The company has been asked for comment but has so far not responded. P&O Ferries sacked almost 800 employees last month and brought in cheaper agency workers on some of its boats, in a move it said would ensure the future of the business. However, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) said the firm was now ""trying to bring in an exploitative model, with the lowest possible standards they can get away with"". RMT said that a seafarer on the Spirit of Britain ferry at Dover had initially contacted the union begging for help in a dispute over pay. In an email seen by the BBC the worker wrote: ""They don't care about our rights. They try to give us less money. We are desperate."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was ""good P&O have reversed [the] further attempt at a pay cut"", but added that ""they must go much further and pay the minimum wage like all UK businesses"". ""We will legislate to force them, but they could win back some much needed credibility by acting now,"" he said. The Spirit of Britain resumed cross channel services this weekend On Friday, the Spirit of Britainwas cleared to resume sailingafter inspections by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It had been held at the port since 12 April due to a number of unspecified deficiencies, according to the regulator. It is P&O's first Dover to Calais ferry to recommence operations, with services set to resume on Tuesday morning. The seafarer who contacted the RMT told the union that they were being forced to work without contracts, after old ones had expired. The worker claimed documents had also been lost by P&O. The worker wrote in their email to the union: ""This is my sixth day working without a contract, please help us!"" On Friday, the RMT went aboard the Spirit of Britain to speak with seafarers after being previously refused access. National secretary Darren Proctor, who was on the visit, said P&O Ferries initially did not want to let them on, instead offering the use of a meeting room in the port. The RMT declined, quoting the ISPS Code, which is a comprehensive set of measures designed to strengthen the security of ships and port facilities. Once on board, the union's representatives were chaperoned to a new lounge on the ferry for pets, where the RMT inspectors were able to speak directly to newly employed workers. The RMT said it had spoken to a number of workers from around the world who have joined the ferry's crew who shared similar complaints. P&O resumes full Cairnryan - Larne service Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? New ferry rules on pay wonât work, warn ports Mr Proctor said P&O Ferries had ""brought people in on a month contract, some on two-month contracts"" and then told them that they have to accept lower pay rates if they want to stay on. ""Others are coming in on four-month contracts on lower pay. P&O is undermining safety and creating a lowest possible denominator in ferry standards,"" he said. The union complained to the Maritime and Coastguard Authority (MCA) who took action and affected seafarers' contracts were amended with their original wages reinstated. RMT said that P&O was ""desperate to keep these new crew on board because they've been on board for four weeks now and these crews were beginning to have familiarity with the vessels. They need familiarity to get them sailing again."" Tim Morris, chief of trade association UK Major Ports Group, said P&O Ferries' newest move was ""clearly not great news for the reputation for maritime in the UK"". He told the BBC's Today programme the ports industry was ""disappointed and surprised as everyone else on what has gone on"". ""It's not how we operate in the ports sector,"" he said. ""We hire locally, we pay well, we have well established industrial relations."" Mr Morris said there was a law that stopped port operators ""picking and choosing who we let into our ports outside of some very narrow safety constraints"". ""Whilst we're as disappointed and surprised as everybody else, there needs to be a change in the law before employment conditions can be linked to port access,"" he added. This video can not be played P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faces MPs Last month, P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs that the decision to sack 800 workers last month without notice broke the law. He said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" that under UK employment law the firm was required to consult unions before making the mass cuts. However, he said no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers ""in full"" instead. The P&O boss also said he would make the same decision again if he had to. Mr Shapps has said he wanted to see British ports refusing access to ferry companies ""who don't pay a fair wage"". He said the government would consult on the changes needed to make it a legal requirement, but urged ports to take action ""as soon as practical"". However, British ports have described the new pay plans for the ferry industry as ""unworkable"". ""The ports industry is genuinely sympathetic towards the situation of the impacted seafarers, however we would suggest that ports are not the competent authorities to enforce rules on employee salaries or working conditions in the shipping industry,"" said Richard Ballantyne of the British Ports Association.

"A picture from the scene of the explosion shows burned out vehicles Nigeria's president has said the country is in ""shock and trauma"" following the deaths of at least 100 people from an explosion at an illegal oil refinery. President Muhammadu Buhari described the incident in Imo state, southern Nigeria, as a ""catastrophe and a national disaster"". Many victims were burnt beyond recognition. The police are now looking for the owner of the illegal refinery. The damage to fishing and farming caused by the oil industry over the decades and the failure to share the oil wealth has led some to find other ways to make money. Illegal refining is attractive as in parts of the oil-rich Niger Delta it is seen as being relatively easy to pull off, despite efforts to halt the practice. Dozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire. The death toll has risen as emergency workers go through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency told BBC Igbo that the number killed now stood at 109. ""We learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,"" he earlier told the AFP news agency. Charred human remains, as well as fragments of belongings, such as flip flops, bags and clothing, were witnessed across the scene of the disaster by a journalist for the Reuters news agency. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Buhari offered his condolences to families of the victims and said those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice. The authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries. It is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened sometime overnight into Saturday, but accidents have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced. There have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. But Nigeria's official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country.

"This video can not be played Just one of Swansea council's 72 councillors is black There are calls for political parties in Wales to run a minimum number of ethnically diverse candidates in elections. Less than 2% of candidates in the 2017 council elections identified as being black, Asian or minority ethnic. Campaigners said it was ""time to act"" with race-based shortlists to make sure the 5.2% of people in Wales who are ethnically diverse get representation. But the three major parties in Wales all said they were against quotas. There is no official data on the ethnic background of the candidates running in the council elections on 5 May - something the Electoral Reform Society has criticised. But acandidate survey after the last election,externalfound just 1.8% of 1,682 respondents said they were from a non-white background. Three of the seven local authorities who responded to a request for figures by BBC Wales said they had no ethnically diverse councillors. Cardiff council had the highest number of non-white councillors with nine out of 72 council seats. When it came to women, Newport elected one Asian woman from 50 council seats, while Swansea had one black woman from 72 seats. ""It's appalling, absolutely,"" said Evelyn James from Women's Equality Network Wales (WEN Wales). ""It shouldn't even be something we should be talking about at this point, because we live in a diverse society. ""When you bring in the different cultures, the dynamics in the thinking, that's how you thrive... so it is important for us to allow every Welsh citizen to be part of the decision process, for their voices to be heard."" First woman of colour elected to Welsh Parliament Lack of election diversity a 'massive step back' Election 'diversity crisis' warning WEN Wales said the first step in overcoming barriers to political participation, such as prejudice, a lack of childcare provision and financial disincentives, was a system that guarantees councils elect people of colour. ""We are not saying that diversity quotas are the only effective tool... it is a starting point,"" said Ms James. ""Give them the chance to be at the decision table, because if we leave it to chance they have lots of barriers already in place that limit them. ""If you deliberately create a system that gives them the opportunity, then you get to see what potential they can bring to the table."" Evelyn James said: ""We're not going to wait until decades to come to make the difference"" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), which represents all local authorities, said it also wanted to see ""greater diversity in our councils' chambers, to ensure councils reflect the communities they serve"". It has run diversity mentoring schemes and said all councils had signed a diversity pledge. A WLGA spokesman added: ""Quotas are often politically contentious, however the WLGA council agreed that groups or parties should consider using voluntary quotas and review their use following the election."" But Welsh Labour, the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have all come out against a quota system for the selection of their candidates. Instead, Labour said black, Asian and party members from other ethnic minority backgrounds have been over-represented in its future candidate programmes. But Ramesh Patel, who is standing down after more than two decades as a Labour councillor in Cardiff, said his party was not doing enough. Ramesh Patel said the representation of diverse communities had been a ""total failure"" in Wales compared with parts of England ""We should now start to be looking at possibly all-women shortlisting for people from diverse communities,"" said Mr Patel. ""It seems like, almost, you've got to fight lots of obstacles to get your name on the ballot paper and that should not happen."" Mr Patel wants Labour to consider using diversity quotas because he said having people of colour on the Cardiff councils had made a ""huge difference"", especially when it came to communicating with constituents in different languages and understanding cultural differences. He said the need for more ethnically diverse politicians applied to all political parties. ""I think there has been a total failure compared to some parts of England [where] you've got far better representation from those diverse communities,"" he said. ""If you look at Birmingham and London, you've got day-care centres... designed for diverse communities. ""In Cardiff, I've been fighting for that for years and years and that hasn't happened... because people just don't understand what that requirement is,"" he said. ""But if you've got more diverse councillors, they could be the voice and get some of those things done."" The Welsh Conservatives called quotas ""demeaning, implying certain people are a special class that need favours based on their demography"". The party said it ""supports people from all backgrounds to join"" and had a strong record of getting ethnic minority candidates elected in Wales. Altaf Hussain became the first Asian heritage councillor for the Pen-y-Fai ward in Bridgend county in 2017. He is standing down from the council this election, after becoming a ConservativeMember of the Senedd(MS) for South Wales West last year. The retired orthopaedic surgeon said to get the best candidate, the selection process must be open to all. Altaf Hussain, one of the first Asian heritage councillors in Bridgend says he wanted to see integration, not quotas Quotas would be ""a diversion"", he said. ""What I believe is integrity, there should be no difference between you and me,"" he said. ""I don't think quota business can work, that means really you're.... limiting their competition."" But Mr Hussain said many immigrants come to Wales to earn money and see a job in politics as being too unstable and not paying enough. He added that some may not be coming forward because ""they're still thinking that we are not equal, which is horrible. ""Skills should be developed within the political parties and there should be mentors.... but that's not happening at present."" The chairman of Plaid Cymru's black and minority ethnic section, Abyd Quinn Aziz, said the party did not see quotas as the ""necessary response or an answer"". Abyd Quinn Aziz said looking at racial diversity was something ""relatively new"" for Plaid Cymru He said quotas can, in some cases, ""undermine"" politicians from a minority ethnic background. ""There are people who say that means you get the job, irrespective of whether you can do it or not,"" said Mr Aziz. ""We have an imposter syndrome or an 'am I good enough' feeling anyway, without that adding to it."" Looking at racial diversity was something ""relatively new"" for Plaid, he said, explaining that it was part of a wider effort to demonstrate the party is for everyone in Wales, not just Welsh language speakers. ""Shadowing, mentoring and encouraging people to join"" and take on different roles is the way the party will get more ethnic minority candidates standing for council, he said. Mr Aziz and Mr Hussain both said they believed educating young people was the key to more diverse politics in the future. The Welsh government said its new curriculum included ""education on citizenship and politics"" to help learners become ""ethical informed citizens."" Hemione said ethnic diversity promotes democracy by allowing everyone's voice to be heard The last election in Wales, in December, saw the Welsh Youth Parliament become the country's most diverse political body. Hermione, 15, who represents Gower, said she hoped it would inspire more participation from 16 and 17-years-olds, who will be allowed to vote in a council election for the first time in May. ""Councils and parliaments reflect the wider community,"" Hermione said. ""If people have someone they can relate to in a position of power, it will inspire them to make a change themselves."" She said she hopes her generation of politicians will help to close the diversity gap in Welsh politics.

"Marine Le Pen voted in her party's stronghold in the northern town of HÃ©nin-Beaumont French voters are heading to the polls to decide whether to give centrist Emmanuel Macron five more years as president or replace him with far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. After a divisive election campaign, Ms Le Pen faces an uphill battle with her 44-year-old opponent polling ahead. In order to win they both need to attract voters who backed other candidates in the first round. But these are two polarising figures in France and abstention is a key factor. Mr Macron's detractors call him arrogant and a president of the rich, while the far-right leader has been accused of having ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some 48.7 million people are eligible to take part and by midday (10:00 GMT) turnout was down on five years ago at 26.4%, but not as low as in the first round two weeks ago. First projections of who has won will come at 20:00. Marine Le Pen was first of the two candidates to vote, which she did in her stronghold in HÃ©nin-Beaumont. As she arrived, she sheltered a baby boy from the sun and told him: ""I will protect you."" Coraline was waiting in the sun with her baby LÃ©andre, when Marine Le Pen promised to protect him Mr Macron voted later in the northern resort of Le Touquet alongside his wife, Brigitte. He rose to power on a whirlwind promise of change, but many complain they are yet to see it. His presidency has been buffeted by protests, the Covid pandemic and now the rising cost of living. Marine Le Pen, meanwhile, has learned from the mistakes she made when she was resoundingly beaten by the same opponent in the second round in 2017. This is her third tilt at the presidency and if she fails it could be her last. Emmanuel Macron voted with his wife Brigitte in Le Touquet, where she has a home The great unknown in this election is how many voters will refuse to back either candidate, whether by casting a blank ballot or not turning out at all. Much of France is on holiday and turnout in parts of Paris appeared to be lower than usual. The campaign has been short but the choice for voters is clear, between a pro-European sitting president and a nationalist candidate who seeks to ban the headscarf and restrict immigration. On the eve of the election Mr Macron and his wife Brigitte took a stroll on the beach Whatever the result, Mr Macron will address voters on Sunday evening from a stage at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. The rising cost of living - described in France aspouvoir d'achator spending power - has become the number one issue for French voters and Marine Le Pen has promised voters an immediate onslaught on it if she wins. She has fared particularly well in the smaller towns and rural areas that have struggled economically during the Macron era. She came top two weeks ago in La FertÃ©-sous-Jouarre, a pretty town on the River Marne an hour east of Paris. Sitting outside a bar, CÃ©cile says the pandemic hit the area particularly hard: ""Before Covid there was a bar here called Avenue de Champagne, but that shut and now the place is dead after 7pm."" Fred is one of many voters in La FertÃ©-sous-Jouarre who believe it is time for a change She will vote Le Pen as will Fred, who works on the Paris metro network: ""People can't afford to pay for gas and electricity. When I'm in Paris some things are too expensive and you have to eat."" African immigrants he knows in the capital also say they will vote for her, he adds. There are plenty of shy Le Pen voters here too. France needs to change, they say, and they leave it at that. She has carefully moderated her views, but still plans a referendum on strict immigration controls and her idea for a ""Europe of nations"" would tear the EU apart. Jean-Claude, 66, may not agree with her hostility to the EU, but he complains too many people take advantage of France's welfare system and take drugs.

First-time voter SÃ©rÃ©na sees Russia's war in Ukraine as a vital issue for France Apprentice accountant SÃ©rÃ©na, 18, is worried about the war in Ukraine: ""We don't really know what Le Pen feels about Putin. Changing president would destabilise the situation now."" Nicole, 76, runs a library in a nearby village and she has noticed many people turning to the far right. ""I'm not so worried about her, more about the people behind her - her lieutenants."" Ms Le Pen fares less well in the big cities, like Paris and Lyon, where her opponent led in the second round. But what could decide this election is who secures the support of almost 22% of the electorate who voted for far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. He was narrowly beaten by Marine Le Pen but won in cities including Marseille and Nantes. The town of Trappes, to the south-west of Paris, is a MÃ©lenchon stronghold where Le Pen voters are in short supply. Outside the local shops, a woman in a hijab condemns the far-right's policies as racist. ""I'm going to vote blank,"" she says. It's a popular idea that is seen as a protest vote that benefits neither candidate. On reflection she adds she might back Mr Macron, or even not vote at all. Many MÃ©lenchon voters here appear undecided. Outside a nursery school, Murad says he might vote blank too. ""Macron is more for the rich than the poor,"" he says, before adding that he could still vote for him. Unemployment may be down and purchasing power may be higher than in 2017, but many voters on the left are disillusioned with the sitting president for cutting housing aid to millions of low earners and  abolishing a wealth tax that targeted millionaires. When Emmanuel Macron swept to power, it was on the promise of change. But a remark you hear everywhere is that nothing has changed at all. If the opinion polls are accurate and he does win, he will not face an easy second term.

"Emmanuel Macron limited his public appearances ahead of the first round to one big campaign rally They duelled for the top job in France five years ago, but now Emmanuel Macron faces a far stronger challenge from a reinvigorated leader of the far right in Marine Le Pen. The second round of France's presidential election takes place on 24 April, and the polls suggest the race will be close. The two candidates come up against each other in a televised debate on Wednesday. So who are they and what is their vision for France? When he became France's youngest ever president in 2017, it sealed a meteoric rise that came less than a year after he launched a centrist political movement calledLa RÃ©publique En Marche!to challenge the traditional parties. He easily defeated Marine Le Pen in the 2017 run-off, winning 66% of the vote. Five years on, aged 44, he continues to dominate French politics but the polls suggest this time his far-right rival has a real chance of unseating him from the ÃlysÃ©e Palace. He swept to power as an unknown quantity, a charismatic former economy minister who had never run for elected office before, offering a more centrist vision for France. A protÃ©gÃ© of Socialist President FranÃ§ois Hollande with a background in investment banking, he brushed aside old political loyalties and, to many voters, that set him apart from the ruling class, even though he shared the background of France's political elite. The Socialists and Republicans who had run France for so long are now in tatters. His rise to power appeared effortless, but he had to navigate choppy political waters to push through the controversial reforms he promised voters. He made it easier for companies to fire workers, cut taxes and introduced tough security laws to tackle terrorism. But he was forced to scrap a proposed fuel tax in 2018 after weeks of unrest stoked by yellow-vest protesters, known asgilets jaunes. Other reforms, including a promise to bring the jobless rate down from more than 10% to 7% by 2022, were hit by the Covid pandemic, although unemployment is currently down to 7.4%. He is now proposing full employment within five years, cutting taxes by â¬15bn (Â£12.5bn) a year for households and businesses, and paying for his programme by gradually raising the retirement age from 62 to 65. Increasing the pension age is unpopular with voters already facing a cost of living crunch. He has been accused of relying on expensive advice from consultants including US firm McKinsey. Marine Le Pen has denounced him as a wealthy ""candidate of finance"", even though she is something of a property owner herself. He has had to rethink a controversial plan to make a back-to-work benefit for the unemployed called RSA conditional on 15-20 hours of work a week. Mr Macron also wants to invest in the armed forces, doubling France's reserve force. What are his chances? He won more than 27% of the vote in the first round, three points higher than in 2017. But he is no longer an unknown quantity and many of the voters who backed Mr Macron first time around have tired of him. He is still favourite to win, but tightening opinion polls show the race is wide open. Macron gets election boost from Putin's war Background: The meteoric rise of Macron This is Marine Le Pen's third tilt at power but her biggest chance yet. She has made this election a choice about the future of her country's society and civilisation and promised to ""restore France's sovereignty"". Her family has been synonymous with the far right in France for decades, but when in 2011 she took over the mantle of leader of the far right from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, she set about reforming his old National Front and made it her own. A political player in France for years, Marine Le Pen became a Euro MP before acting on her presidential ambitions. After she was trounced by Emmanuel Macron in the presidential run-off in 2017, she rebranded her party asRassemblement National,or National Rally. Marine Le Pen's chances of winning the French presidency are better than ever She can no longer claim the hard-right vote to herself, but in this election that has made her look more moderate. Her more hardline rival Eric Zemmour attracted defectors from her camp, including her own niece. He made her look less extreme on Islam and immigration, and now she stands to attract his 7% of the vote. She has crafted a consistent anti-immigration, anti-EU message and Emmanuel Macron has labelled her policies as racist. She has in the past expressed her admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin and relied on a Russian bank loan for her 2017 presidential campaign. She condemns his invasion of Ukraine, while warning of the risk of sanctions to the French economy. Now 53, she has promised to halt abuse of the right to asylum, with a referendum on restricting immigration. And she wants to ban the Islamic hijab being worn in public areas. She also seeks to turn the European Union into an alliance of nations unchallenged by EU laws and pull France out of Nato's integrated command. Marine Le Pen wants to waive income tax for those under 30 and exempt companies from tax contributions if they raise minimum wages by 10% for many of their staff. What are her chances? The opinion polls give her genuine chance of victory. The final stretch of this campaign will decide whether she can improve on 2017. Who is Marine Le Pen?

"Marine Le Pen voted in her party's stronghold in the northern town of HÃ©nin-Beaumont French voters are heading to the polls to decide whether to give centrist Emmanuel Macron five more years as president or replace him with far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. After a divisive election campaign, Ms Le Pen faces an uphill battle with her 44-year-old opponent polling ahead. In order to win they both need to attract voters who backed other candidates in the first round. But these are two polarising figures in France and abstention is a key factor. Mr Macron's detractors call him arrogant and a president of the rich, while the far-right leader has been accused of having ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some 48.7 million people are eligible to take part and by midday (10:00 GMT) turnout was down on five years ago at 26.4%, but not as low as in the first round two weeks ago. First projections of who has won will come at 20:00. Marine Le Pen was first of the two candidates to vote, which she did in her stronghold in HÃ©nin-Beaumont. As she arrived, she sheltered a baby boy from the sun and told him: ""I will protect you."" Coraline was waiting in the sun with her baby LÃ©andre, when Marine Le Pen promised to protect him Mr Macron voted later in the northern resort of Le Touquet alongside his wife, Brigitte. He rose to power on a whirlwind promise of change, but many complain they are yet to see it. His presidency has been buffeted by protests, the Covid pandemic and now the rising cost of living. Marine Le Pen, meanwhile, has learned from the mistakes she made when she was resoundingly beaten by the same opponent in the second round in 2017. This is her third tilt at the presidency and if she fails it could be her last. Emmanuel Macron voted with his wife Brigitte in Le Touquet, where she has a home The great unknown in this election is how many voters will refuse to back either candidate, whether by casting a blank ballot or not turning out at all. Much of France is on holiday and turnout in parts of Paris appeared to be lower than usual. The campaign has been short but the choice for voters is clear, between a pro-European sitting president and a nationalist candidate who seeks to ban the headscarf and restrict immigration.

"Fury remains unbeaten in 33 bouts after flooring Whyte WBC champion Tyson Fury produced a stunning one-punch stoppage in the sixth round to beat fellow Briton Dillian Whyte and then insisted he will retire from boxing. Fury dominated what was a scrappy bout and then unleashed a vicious right uppercut. Whyte, admirably, got to his feet within the count before staggering into the referee as the fight was halted. ""This might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King,"" Fury said post-fight. He added later: ""I've spent a lot of time on the road. I've been away for a long time. I fulfilled everything I've ever wanted to fulfil. ""I will retire as only the second heavyweight in history, after Rocky Marciano, to retire undefeated. I was unbeatable at this game."" Fury - who also retained his Ring Magazine belt - is unbeaten in 33 bouts, while Whyte - suffering his third loss in 31 fights - fell short on his first attempt at a world title. If Fury does decide to hang up the gloves, the 33-year-old will miss out on an opportunity to fight for the undisputed crown - a fight which could potentially be staged later this year - and a chance to cement his status as Britain's greatest ever heavyweight. ""I promised my wife that would be it after the [Deontay] Wilder fight,"" he added. ""But I got offered a fight at Wembley and I owed it to the fans. What a way to go out."" Fury's wife Paris told BT Sport: ""I would like him to come out now. He has nothing more to prove. If he had anything left to do, I would say 'Yeah Tyson, you do it'. But he has nothing to prove. ""For Tyson to keep boxing, it just seems for one reason and I know in my heart, I think the only reason that Tyson will come back is for the unification fight."" The Gypsy King - end of an extraordinary era? Fight Talk - Social media reaction to big fight Recap - All the action as it happened Whyte had no answer to Fury's punching power With 94,000 fans in attendance - a post-war British record - there was an electric atmosphere like no other for a fight dubbed by some as the greatest all-British heavyweight dust-up in history. Boos echoed around the iconic stadium as a pumped-up Whyte let out his trademark wolf-like howl before walking to the ring. Fury's ring walk was extravagant. It began to the tune of Don McLean's 'American Pie', soon turned into 'Juicy' by Notorious B.I.G and ended on 'Sex on Fire' by Kings of Leon. Fury then sat on a throne as fireworks blasted skywards, before heading towards the ring. He towered over Whyte as the two men touched gloves. Fury teased before the fight that he could switch to southpaw and neutralise Whyte's dangerous left hook but, surprisingly, it was Whyte who came out as a southpaw in a cagey opening round. It was then Fury's turn to switch from orthodox in the second as the battle of mind games continued, with the champion edging the opening two rounds. He landed with a solid two-punch combination in the third, prompting Whyte to charge at his opponent. But the challenger could not get close to Fury, who used his height and reach advantage to keep Whyte at bay as the fight progressed. The contest truly heated up in a spicy fourth round. Whyte connected when asked to break, which clearly agitated Fury. The fighters twice received a telling off from Mark Lyson, as the referee struggled to control the two men who boast a combined weight of 37 stone. Whyte's telegraphed overhand rights were getting nowhere close to the elusive Fury, who was connecting with ease. Then came arguably Fury's greatest punch of what is proving to be an illustrious career. He teed it up with a left jab and as Whyte stepped forward, Fury whipped in the brutal uppercut. Whyte fell back on the canvas. He channelled the warrior spirit he spoke of before the fight but, as he made it to his feet, was clearly in no position to continue. Fury celebrates with wife Paris and his team This video can not be played 'There is nothing more I can do' - Tyson Fury on potential retirement Fury, as expected, took the microphone and treated fans to his own rendition of 'American Pie' in the ring following his victory. It was a singsong to end the perfect homecoming party for the Morecambe-based fighter, who was boxing in the United Kingdom for the first time since 2018. He said before the fight that this would be his last. That by boxing at Wembley he had reached his pinnacle. Many in the sport took those comments with a touch of scepticism - it is something he said several times before - but it seems Fury is sticking to his word. His compatriot Anthony Joshua is likely to rematch Ukraine's WBA, IBF and WBO champion Oleksandr Usyk this summer. The lure of fighting the winner for all the belts - and the lucrative nature it brings, particularly if Joshua is victorious - could just tempt Fury to halt his retirement plans. Tyson Fury made a dramatic entrance on a throne before facing Dillian Whyte If this is the end, however, it is a remarkable career from a man who at 6ft 9in and 19 stone has an ability to glide across the ring resembling an elegant ballroom dancer. His style, for his size, is unmatched. He is a boxer who went from narrowly beating John McDermott on points for the English title in Brentwood to becoming a unified world champion, shocking long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in Germany in 2015. A boxer who came back from over two and half years out of the sport and reclaimed a heavyweight title, cracking America and sharing arguably one of the greatest trilogies in the sport with Deontay Wilder. He has entertained reporters by dressing up as batman or taping his mouth shut at media conferences. Fury even had time to join the scripted world of professional wrestling. In the second coming of his career, Fury has spoken openly about - and become an advocate for - mental health struggles. But his career has not been short of controversy. Not long after his first world title, Fury made homophobic and sexist remarks during an interview. He previously tested positive for a banned steroid - something he blamed on eating uncastrated wild boar - and later admitted to use of drink and drugs to help deal with depression. More recently, his fight with Whyte had been somewhat overshadowed by Fury's links to Daniel Kinahan, who earlier this month was among seven people hit with worldwide financial sanctions by the United States. Fury had previously been advised by Kinahan but this week insisted he has ""absolutely zero"" involvement with the Irishman. It has been a career full of highs and lows. But despite the retirement, seeing the Gypsy King in a ring again - with potentially an opportunity to cement his status as the greatest British heavyweight in history - is wholly possible. Apart from the few months following his defeat to Alexander Povetkin in 2020, which he then avenged, 34-year-old Whyte had been mandatory challenger for the WBC belt since 2017. ""Dillian is a warrior and I believe he will be a world champion,"" Fury said as he and Whyte embraced post-fight. ""One of the greatest and, unfortunately, he had to fight me tonight. You are not messing with a mediocre heavyweight, you are messing with the best man on the planet."" Since his first career defeat to rival Joshua in 2015, Whyte has proven his world-level credentials with wins over the likes of Joseph Parker and Povetkin. He is still a big draw in the sport.

"Emmanuel Macron limited his public appearances ahead of the first round to one big campaign rally They duelled for the top job in France five years ago, but now Emmanuel Macron faces a far stronger challenge from a reinvigorated leader of the far right in Marine Le Pen. The second round of France's presidential election takes place on 24 April, and the polls suggest the race will be close. The two candidates come up against each other in a televised debate on Wednesday. So who are they and what is their vision for France? When he became France's youngest ever president in 2017, it sealed a meteoric rise that came less than a year after he launched a centrist political movement calledLa RÃ©publique En Marche!to challenge the traditional parties. He easily defeated Marine Le Pen in the 2017 run-off, winning 66% of the vote. Five years on, aged 44, he continues to dominate French politics but the polls suggest this time his far-right rival has a real chance of unseating him from the ÃlysÃ©e Palace. He swept to power as an unknown quantity, a charismatic former economy minister who had never run for elected office before, offering a more centrist vision for France. A protÃ©gÃ© of Socialist President FranÃ§ois Hollande with a background in investment banking, he brushed aside old political loyalties and, to many voters, that set him apart from the ruling class, even though he shared the background of France's political elite. The Socialists and Republicans who had run France for so long are now in tatters. His rise to power appeared effortless, but he had to navigate choppy political waters to push through the controversial reforms he promised voters. He made it easier for companies to fire workers, cut taxes and introduced tough security laws to tackle terrorism. But he was forced to scrap a proposed fuel tax in 2018 after weeks of unrest stoked by yellow-vest protesters, known asgilets jaunes. Other reforms, including a promise to bring the jobless rate down from more than 10% to 7% by 2022, were hit by the Covid pandemic, although unemployment is currently down to 7.4%. He is now proposing full employment within five years, cutting taxes by â¬15bn (Â£12.5bn) a year for households and businesses, and paying for his programme by gradually raising the retirement age from 62 to 65. Increasing the pension age is unpopular with voters already facing a cost of living crunch. He has been accused of relying on expensive advice from consultants including US firm McKinsey. Marine Le Pen has denounced him as a wealthy ""candidate of finance"", even though she is something of a property owner herself. He has had to rethink a controversial plan to make a back-to-work benefit for the unemployed called RSA conditional on 15-20 hours of work a week. Mr Macron also wants to invest in the armed forces, doubling France's reserve force. What are his chances? He won more than 27% of the vote in the first round, three points higher than in 2017. But he is no longer an unknown quantity and many of the voters who backed Mr Macron first time around have tired of him. He is still favourite to win, but tightening opinion polls show the race is wide open. Macron gets election boost from Putin's war Background: The meteoric rise of Macron This is Marine Le Pen's third tilt at power but her biggest chance yet. She has made this election a choice about the future of her country's society and civilisation and promised to ""restore France's sovereignty"". Her family has been synonymous with the far right in France for decades, but when in 2011 she took over the mantle of leader of the far right from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, she set about reforming his old National Front and made it her own. A political player in France for years, Marine Le Pen became a Euro MP before acting on her presidential ambitions. After she was trounced by Emmanuel Macron in the presidential run-off in 2017, she rebranded her party asRassemblement National,or National Rally. Marine Le Pen's chances of winning the French presidency are better than ever She can no longer claim the hard-right vote to herself, but in this election that has made her look more moderate. Her more hardline rival Eric Zemmour attracted defectors from her camp, including her own niece. He made her look less extreme on Islam and immigration, and now she stands to attract his 7% of the vote. She has crafted a consistent anti-immigration, anti-EU message and Emmanuel Macron has labelled her policies as racist. She has in the past expressed her admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin and relied on a Russian bank loan for her 2017 presidential campaign. She condemns his invasion of Ukraine, while warning of the risk of sanctions to the French economy. Now 53, she has promised to halt abuse of the right to asylum, with a referendum on restricting immigration. And she wants to ban the Islamic hijab being worn in public areas. She also seeks to turn the European Union into an alliance of nations unchallenged by EU laws and pull France out of Nato's integrated command. Marine Le Pen wants to waive income tax for those under 30 and exempt companies from tax contributions if they raise minimum wages by 10% for many of their staff. What are her chances? The opinion polls give her genuine chance of victory. The final stretch of this campaign will decide whether she can improve on 2017. Who is Marine Le Pen?

"The two candidates appeared only once together during the campaign to challenge each other's policies Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen are proposing two very different futures for France, at home and abroad. As French voters decide on Sunday which of the two will lead their country, what are their rival plans for the next five years? The cost of living has been the number one issue of the election, and far-right hopeful Marine Le Pen has made it the focus of her campaign. But her other big plan is to make social housing, jobs and welfare a ""national priority"" for French nationals and to fight Islamism. Under the bannerMarine, PrÃ©sidente, she tells her supporters victory has never been so close. Her centrist rival has sought to rally voters under the sloganNous Tous- All of us. And after five years in power, Emmanuel Macron's offer is for ""complete renewal"", as he tries to attract voters from the left as well as the mainstream right. Marine Le Penhas promised a raft of measures to cut the cost of living, which she wants to make the priority of a Le Pen presidency. She wants to scrap income tax for all under-30s, reduce VAT on fuel from 20% to 5.5% and abolish it on 100 other essentials. She wants to get businesses to raise wages by 10%, making the increases free of employer tax contributions, and to push up teachers' salaries by 3% every year for the next five years. She also wants to slash toll fees on motorways by 15% by renationalising them, and to privatise public broadcasting by scrapping the TV licence fee of â¬138 (Â£115). Emmanuel Macronsays the government has already spent billions of euros capping energy bills, which he says is ""twice as effective as dropping VAT"". He proposes that employers should be allowed to give staff an untaxed bonus of up to â¬6,000. He wants to increase teachers' wages too in return for extra responsibilities and he is also prepared to scrap the TV licence fee. Bosses' organisation Medef say his policies are better for growth and jobs, while warning that Ms Le Pen's are unfunded and would lead France into a dead end. Many voters on the far left are expected not to vote for either candidate Emmanuel Macronwants to pay for much of his programme by raising the pension age from 62 to 65. But his policy has not played well with voters - especially on the left - and he says he will raise it gradually by four months a year. ""It makes sense that I should be ready to listen,"" he explained. He has also promised to raise the minimum state pension from â¬950 to â¬1,100 (Â£785-Â£910). Marine Le Pencalls her rival's plan an ""absolutely unbearable injustice"" and wants to keep the pension age at 62, although anyone who began working at 20 could retire at 60. She wants to raise the minimum state pension to â¬1,000, less than her opponent. Marine Le Penwants a referendum on immigration to put an end to what she calls ""anarchic and massive immigration"", and she plans strict rules for entering France and becoming French. Under a highly controversial proposal calledPrioritÃ© nationale(national priority), she also wants French nationals to be given housing and social services ahead of foreigners - with 620,000 homes for foreign nationals put on the market for families where at least one parent is French. She was initially in favour of holding a referendum on the death penalty before realising it was ""anti-constitutional"". Emmanuel Macronhas accused her of an ""authoritarian"" drift and failing to respect the constitution. He has condemned Ms Le Pen's ""nationalist agenda, which is not patriotism"". He has promised to free up police and gendarmes from admin tasks to double the numbers on the street by 2030, with 11 new mobile units and 200 brigades of gendarmes (military police).Marine Le Penalso promises 20,000 new prison places and 7,000 extra police. Marine Le Penwants to ban women from wearing the headscarf in public places and fine them if they wear it. She calls the veil a ""uniform"" imposed by people with a radical vision of Islam. France has Western Europe's biggest Muslim population, and as 69% voted for far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon in the first round, the Muslim vote could play an important part in the second round. Emmanuel Macronhas warned that banning the headscarf could start a ""civil war"". He insists that France's principle of state secularism, called laÃ¯citÃ©, does not mean fighting against religion. He made clear his opposition to it by praising a young woman wearing a hijab who said she was a feminist. ""This is the best answer to all the nonsense,"" he said. One big question forMarine Le Penis how she could push through all her reforms if she won. She has few credible options for a government, relying on promises of a government of national unity. Her National Rally has only six seats in the National Assembly and it is difficult to see her winning a majority in elections in June. The electoral system works against her National Rally party, so she wants to introduce proportional representation (PR) in legislative elections and a seven-year term of office for president. One of her flagship policies is citizen referendums, which would enable 500,000 people to submit a proposal to change the law and bypass the problem of parliament. Emmanuel Macronis also campaigning to introduce an element of PR to the parliamentary vote, but says his opponent's plans for referendums indicate that she thinks she is above the constitution and can change the rules. Emmanuel Macronhas called this election a ""referendum on Europe"", arguing that Europe protects France from crises and war, and accusing his opponent of wanting to leave the EU in a ""Frexit"" without daring to say so. Marine Le Penhas moved a long way from her original plan to leave the EU, although the Macron camp believes that is her ultimate plan. ""Nobody is against Europe,"" she said after the first round. And yet in 2012, she was in favour of pulling France out of the EU, a stance which was then dropped in 2017 when she said she wanted to leave the euro instead. Now she speaks of a European alliance of nations. However, her plans for priority for French nationals would directly contradict EU law and she would do that via a referendum. She would also cause trouble if she tried to tighten border controls, slash French contributions to the EU budget, and give primacy to French law. She has also vowed to halt all co-operation with Germany, including military tank and warplanes projects, preferring to see France as a ""big power that counts"". An admirer of Brexit, she talks about freeing France from the ""straitjacket of Brussels"", while denying she harbours hopes of Frexit. Marine Le Penhas been critical of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but her reliance on Russia for bank loans to her party and her friendly relations with Vladimir Putin have not been forgotten. ""When you speak to Russia you are speaking to your banker,"" Mr Macron told her, saying she was dependent on Russian power. Her campaign team had to deny pulping 1.2 million election pamphlets because they featured a photo showing her shaking the Russian leader's hand ahead of the 2017 election. She is also no fan of Nato, proposing that France leaves its ""integrated command"" while remaining in the organisation, as it was from 1966-2009. After the war she believes there should be a ""strategic rapprochement between Nato and Russia"". Le Pen angered by French protest over ties to Putin Le Pen opposes sanctions on Russian gas Emmanuel Macronhas played a key diplomatic role in the war, with France holding the presidency of the EU. He has maintained close contact with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and says the role of France and Europe is to provide Ukraine with military equipment and take in refugees.

She also wants to ban food imports that don't meet French standards and she aims to force school canteens to provide 80% of French agricultural products. Emmanuel Macronhas secured the backing of the one Green presidential candidate, Yannick Jadot. He wants to make France the first big country to stop using coal and gas and has pledged to build six new nuclear power stations to add to France's energy mix of 75% nuclear. He has called Marine Le Pen's plan to leave renewable energy a ""complete aberration"". So-called healthcare deserts in rural areas of France have become a big election issue.Emmanuel Macronwants to recruit another 50,000 nurses and carers by 2027.Marine Le Penblames her rival for the closure of 18,000 hospital beds during his presidency and proposes a halt to further closures and the creation of another 10,000 nursing places. Mr Macronalso wants to focus on vocational education, with a 50% increase in paid work placements. All schools would provide more sporting activities, so that all six to 12-year-olds would do 30 minutes of sport every day from September. His opponent wants to increase teachers' pay by 3% a year over five years.

"Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen will face each other in a second round of the French presidential election on Sunday. None of the 12 candidates secured more than 50% of the votes in the first round of the presidential election on 10 April. Emmanuel Macron is the current president and is aiming for a second term. He is seen as a centrist, representing the Republic on the Move (En Marche) party and attracting voters from the right and left. Marine Le Pen is from the far-right National Rally (Rassemblement National) party. French rivals for presidency clash in TV debate Far-right Le Pen's long quest for power in France Macron: From political outsider to president Emmanuel Macron attracted 27.84% of the votes cast in the first round. Marine Le Pen scored 23.15%. Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon from far-left party France Unbowed came third with just under 22%. Overall, parties of the far left and far right gained over half the votes, whilst support for France's traditional right and left plummeted. Analysts say it is unclear how the votes of the unsuccessful candidates may divide in the second round, and how many voters might simply stay at home. Mr MÃ©lenchon has told his supporters: ""You must not give a single vote to Marine Le Pen,"" but unlike other candidates, has chosen not to back the president instead. Several polling companies are predicting that Mr Macron will win the second round. Mr Macron's projected lead for Sunday's vote appears to have widened since the first round to around eight to nine percentage points. Mr Macron has warned his supporters against complacency, urging them to vote to ensure victory. ""Nothing is decided"", he said. Analysts say Ms Le Pen has moderated her stance on some issues in recent days, in an attempt to win over undecided voters. She has promised to rule France ""like a mother, with common sense"". The war in Ukraine overshadowed early campaigning, but recent opinion polls suggest that the cost of living has become the single most important issue. Other big issues are health, security, pensions, the environment and immigration. In January, France posted its strongest annual economic growth for half a century, bouncing back from the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. Spiralling energy costs and rising inflation have hit everybody in the pocket, but generally purchasing power is on the rise in France. France has seen unemployment fall to 7.4%, just above the average for the eurozone, but close to the target set by the president when he came to power. On immigration, official statistics suggest that in 2020 there were about 6.8 million immigrants living in France. About a third were European, from both European Union and non-EU countries. Overall, Algerians are the largest foreign community, followed by Moroccans and Portuguese. Immigration has featured prominently in the campaigns of the right-wing candidates. Ms Le Pen has proposed a referendum on major reductions in immigration if she becomes president. On security, Emanuel Macron has pledged to put thousands more police on the streets, after sharp criticism from Ms Le Pen. Mr Macron says that crime has fallen under his presidency. France has suffered a string of terror attacks in recent years which have strengthened the importance of security for many French voters.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Le Pen and Macron come to blows over headscarf policy The two candidates for the French presidency have gone head to head in their only televised debate, ahead of Sunday's second-round run-off vote. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has fallen behind centrist Emmanuel Macron in the opinion polls but millions of voters are still undecided. It did not take long for the two-hour-45-minute clash to burst into life. The candidates confronted each other on the cost of living, Russia, climate change and immigration. Around 15.6 million viewers watched the debate, in which Mr Macron accused his rival of being dependent on Russian power while Marine Le Pen called him a hypocrite on climate change. Spiralling prices have dominated the campaign and immediately took centre stage in the debate. Emmanuel Macron was widely seen as the winner of the pair's 2017 encounter, when his rival appeared flustered and underprepared. But this time, Marine Le Pen was ready from the start and far more composed. Throughout the debate, it was Mr Macron who went on the offensive, appearing more like a challenger than an incumbent, repeatedly interrupting his rival. Ms Le Pen said 70% of the French people believed their standard of living had fallen over the past five years and she would be the president of civil peace and national brotherhood. ""We need to give priority to the French in their own country,"" she said. Mr Macron said France had known unprecedented crisis, with Covid followed by war in Europe. He had steered France through those challenges and aimed to make France a stronger country: the vote was a ""referendum on Europe, on secularism, and a moment of clear choice"", he said. Despite a strong performance from Ms Le Pen, a snap Elabe poll of voters suggested 59% of viewers thought Mr Macron had come out the winner. This video can not be played WATCH: Voters react to the Macron and Le Pen TV debate The sitting president was seen as most presidential, by 53% to 29%, although half of viewers also said he had come across as arrogant. Ms Le Pen was narrowly deemed to be more in tune with normal people, although 50% found her ""worrying"". The president's difficulty was that unlike in 2017, he is now defending a record in office. It meant that when asked what he planned for a second mandate, he had to stick to the unexciting option of continuity. His opponent could make hay with attacks on the inevitable failures of five years in government. And yet, the president never gave the feeling he was not on solid ground. His attacks on Marine Le Pen over the Russian loan, over Europe and over the Islamic headscarf all hit home. On the economy, he argued forcefully that his already-enacted proposals for protecting the French from inflation - a cap on fuel prices and tax exemption for pay bonuses - were both fairer and more effective than Madame Le Pen's ideas. And in the main, he avoided the trap of coming over as too arrogant or technocratic. Often, he gave the impression of wanting to launch himself more strongly against his opponent but of holding himself back. Read Hugh's full analysis After a relatively civil start, it quickly turned combative when the two candidates addressed the biggest issue for voters. Cost of living:From the start Marine Le Pen said this was her priority: ""I will permanently cut VAT on energy. I will also cut taxes, no income tax for under-30s."" She accused Mr Macron on letting pension levels fall in real terms too. Mr Macron said his solution was to impose a cap on prices which was ""twice as effective as dropping sales tax"". They became animated as they disagreed on how to bring down energy prices. Mr Macron repeatedly challenged his opponent's proposals as unworkable. She snapped back: ""I want to give the French their money back."" Mr Macron frequently went on the offensive during the long debate Russia's war in Ukraine:Emmanuel Macron said Russia was ""going down a fatal path"" and the role of France and Europe was to provide Ukraine with military equipment and take in refugees. Ms Le Pen, criticised for her close ties to the Kremlin and for taking a Russian bank loan for her party, warned that giving Ukraine weapons could make France a ""co-belligerent"". However, she supported her opponent's policy of backing Ukraine and taking in refugees. At this point Mr Macron went on the offensive, pointing out she was one of the first political leaders in 2014 to recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""You're speaking to your banker when you speak to Russia,"" he said. Ms Le Pen said she had taken Russian money as no French bank would lend to her party. When she argued that she had had to borrow money like millions of French people, he countered that the French did not look to Russia for finance. At one point Marine Le Pen held up a printed tweet to prove her backing for a free Ukraine European Union:Marine Le Pen has changed her policy from leaving the EU to seeking change from within it. But Mr Macron argued that her idea of a ""Europe of nations"" would spell the end of the EU and that ""you are selling a lie"". In the current EU she said France was failing to defend its interests and she would stop negotiating trade deals that ""hurt French producers and farmers"". Retirement age:This is another of the big election issues: Emmanuel Macron has said France needs to raise the pension age from 62 to 65 over nine years, while Ms Le Pen wants to keep it at 62. Ms Le Pen said his proposal was ""absolutely intolerable"". He hit back saying she was promising to be more generous with pensioners but did not explain how she would pay for it. Climate change:Renewable energy is another issue where the two candidates are diametrically opposed and it became one of the most animated points of the debate. The only thing they agree on is building more nuclear power stations. ""You are a climate sceptic, that's pretty obvious,"" Mr Macron said to his rival. The only Green presidential candidate has urged his voters to back the incumbent president. Marine Le Pen retorted that he was a ""climate hypocrite"". Marine Le Pen argued importing goods from thousands of miles away was responsible for climate change and producing locally would help tackle global warming. There was nothing worse than wind turbines, she complained. He countered that her policy of relying on nuclear power to replace fossil fuels was ""untenable"" and renewables had to be part of the mix. ""Wind turbines create jobs,"" he added. Immigration and Islam:Marine Le Pen went on the offensive, promising a referendum on who should stay and who should leave France and condemning what she called ""anarchic and massive immigration"" that contributed to a sense of insecurity. She then spoke about another of her key policies, banning the wearing of the headscarf in public, arguing that women had to be liberated from ""Islamist pressure"". Mr Macron objected it was wrong to mix Islam with Islamism. Her policy, he said, would lead to ""civil war"" and was a betrayal of French values: ""You would have police running down the street after girls in headscarves and [Jewish] boys wearing the kippah."" It was intolerant and she was pushing millions of compatriots out of the public space on account of their religion, he said. Constitutional change:Another of Marine Le Pen's big policies is for citizens' referendums, which she said were rooted in the yellow-vest orgilets jaunesprotests that began early in the Macron presidency. ""The main problem after your five-year term is that you have divided the country. We need to rebuild France and bring people together."" One of the big attractions of such referendums for Ms Le Pen is that they would bypass parliament, where she has only a handful of MPs. Mr Macron said they would be unconstitutional. Televised confrontations between the top two candidates have been a highlight of French presidential elections for almost five decades and they have proved most decisive when the polls are close. In 1974, conservative ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing went on to beat Socialist FranÃ§ois Mitterrand after performing well in their debate. Mitterrand did better in the rematch in 1981 and won the run-off vote. This was the first time since then that the same candidates have squared off in two consecutive elections. The 2017 debate was a disaster for Ms Le Pen that led to a big election defeat. This time around the race is much closer and her strong performance could help win over undecided voters. The gap in the opinion polls has widened slightly since the first round vote in which the incumbent president won 27.85% and Ms Le Pen came second with 23.15%. But they are still fluctuating wildly, suggesting Mr Macron will secure between 53% and 57% of the vote. The choice for voters is far clearer than five years ago, when Emmanuel Macron won with very little experience as a politician. His strict Covid policies alienated many voters and he has been accused of acting as a ""president for the rich"".

"A picture from the scene of the explosion shows burned out vehicles Nigeria's president has said the country is in ""shock and trauma"" following the deaths of at least 100 people from an explosion at an illegal oil refinery. President Muhammadu Buhari described the incident in Imo state, southern Nigeria, as a ""catastrophe and a national disaster"". Many victims were burnt beyond recognition. The police are now looking for the owner of the illegal refinery. The damage to fishing and farming caused by the oil industry over the decades and the failure to share the oil wealth has led some to find other ways to make money. Illegal refining is attractive as in parts of the oil-rich Niger Delta it is seen as being relatively easy to pull off, despite efforts to halt the practice. Dozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire. The death toll has risen as emergency workers go through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency told BBC Igbo that the number killed now stood at 109. ""We learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,"" he earlier told the AFP news agency. Charred human remains, as well as fragments of belongings, such as flip flops, bags and clothing, were witnessed across the scene of the disaster by a journalist for the Reuters news agency. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Buhari offered his condolences to families of the victims and said those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice. The authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries. It is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened sometime overnight into Saturday, but accidents have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced. There have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. But Nigeria's official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country.

"Some locked-down Shanghai residents are not allowed to shop for their own food and instead must wait for officials to deliver supplies Chinese internet authorities are trying to block a popular video highlighting the impact of Shanghai's five-week lockdown on its residents. The clip features audio of citizens complaining about their conditions, lack of food and poor medical care. Official attempts to remove it have triggered a backlash on Chinese sites. Shanghai's 25 million residents have been shut in their homes for weeks while officials try to contain a severe Covid-19 outbreak. Thesix-minute montage,externalfeatures audio clips of the local population criticising insufficient food supplies and complaining about poor medical conditions. ""We haven't eaten for days now,"" one person can be heard pleading. ""This virus can't kill us. Starvation can,"" another man says. The video, titled The Voice of April, was being widely shared on the popular Chinese platforms Weibo and WeChat. But on Saturday internet authorities began trying to take it down, battling with rebellious users who were posting new copies elsewhere on the sites. A nurse gives instructions to medical workers at a temporary hospital for Covid-positive Shanghai residents It's now five weeks since Shanghai's population was first ordered to stay at home as part of an extremely strict lockdown. The rules are intended by officials to contain the city's latest Covid-19 surge - the most severe wave Shanghai has experienced to date. Public criticism of government policies is rare in China, but in the past few weeks some Shanghai residents have posted complaints on social media sites about the poor conditions they were being kept in. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs. Other recently introduced measures includeplacing electronic alarms on doorsto prevent those with the virus from leaving andforcibly evacuating residents to allow their homes to be disinfected. Shanghai city officials have also ordered all infected patients and their close contacts to be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine. Whole communities forced to move in Shanghai's war on Covid Why Shanghai has changed its approach to Covid Shanghai lockdown residents 'running out of food' In the viral clip, one woman can be heard complaining that ""even the ceiling isn't finished yet"" at a temporary hospital she was being checked into. ""Once we arrived, everybody fought for a blanket and a bed,"" she said. Other residents shout out ""thank you, big whites!"" - a nickname for health officials kitted out in white protective gear while being deployed to Shanghai's various neighbourhoods to enforce lockdown rules. The attempt to censor the short video has itself caused a debate on Chinese social media, triggering a backlash among commentators. On Weibo, one of the most popular sites, one user responded: ""The video was just presenting raw facts. There is nothing provocative!"" ""Its content is nothing new... But the fact of seeing that even that is censored, it bothers me,"" another commentator wrote. On Saturday, when censors began removing the video, Shanghai officials reported more than 23,000 Covid-19 cases and 12 more deaths in the city. The Chinese government has pursued a zero-Covid strategy since the beginning of the pandemic, intended to keep the country completely virus free. While officials managed to keep infection levels relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic, later lockdowns have struggled to contain the more transmissible variants of the virus that have since emerged.

"Volunteers will be out again this summer helping to keep Snowdonia clean Volunteers are again taking to one of Wales' most popular mountain paths to try to keep it clear of litter. The Caru Eryri scheme began organising litter picking walks in 2021 following asharp rise in the number of visitors to Snowdon. Volunteers said that while most people keep the paths clean, there is a ""small minority"" who leave rubbish behind. It follows the council's plea for hikers touse toilet facilities before they begin their journey. ""The volunteers who come out with us are great, they give up their own time just to come out and look after a place they love,"" said one of the pickers, Alf Bodenham. The group usually organise walks up to three times a week at some of Snowdonia's most popular beauty spots, including the Snowdon paths, the Ogwen valley and Beddgelert. Activities typically include picking litter along the paths, work to tackle erosion like clearing drainage routes, and speaking with walkers. The issue of keeping paths tidy was once again in the spotlight earlier this month after a Snowdon tour guide said themountain path was"" covered in human stools"". It prompted Snowdonia National Park Authority to urge visitors to use the toilets at the bottom of the mountain before climbing. The volunteers find a range of different types of rubbish that people have discarded on their hikes The usual haul of rubbish collected is more run of the mill, however, and can often add up to over 40kg (6st 2lb) between the group on busy days. ""After the lockdowns a lot more people staycationed here, so there was more pressure on Snowdon and more people landing on the path,"" Mr Bodenham said. ""The most common things we find is food - bananas, orange peels, crisp wrappers - but also things like tissues, wet wipes, and clothes such as gloves and hats. ""We sometimes see odd things, and wonder 'how on earth did that get up Snowdon?'"" Human faeces on popular paths a 'danger to health' âWhy did you mess up Snowdonia?â litter-bugs asked Neil Gwilt, another volunteer litter picker, said dog waste is another common problem. ""They bag it, but they don't take it away, they just hide it,"" he said. ""We're trying to keep the mountain paths clean and tidy. It would be nice if people took stuff up, and when they've used it and finished with it, take it back down again - it doesn't cost them anything."" This video can not be played Snowdon is a huge attraction for tourists On the whole however, Mr Bodenham said that walkers are receptive to their message, with many thanking them for their work as they pass. ""People are very positive - I think there's more awareness now about the effect of climbing Snowdon, that it's a pretty big mountain and that you have to be prepared for the weather and all sorts. ""Our message is that people should take everything home with them that they've brought with them to the mountain."" It takes Mr Gwilt about two hours to travel from Wolverhampton almost every week to Snowdonia, but he said he gained immense satisfaction from the work he and his fellow volunteers do. ""They're a good group of people, they're friendly, happy, and it's a good day out. ""I enjoy north Wales and I like the countryside. I enjoy the geology, I enjoy the walk - it's as simple as that.""

"Sajid Javid this week told the House of Commons he thought children's gender treatment services were ""bordering on ideological"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid is to review what immediate changes can be made to gender treatment services for children in England. This could include changing the law to letthe independent Cass review,externalhave access to an NHS database of young people who already received treatment. It comes ahead of the review's report, due later this year. This week Mr Javid told MPs services in this area were too affirmative and narrow, and ""bordering on ideological"". He is now thought to be planning an overhaul of the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), which is run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, with clinics in London and Leeds. The trust has defended itself, saying while there is a need for change, doctors already take into account the wider physical and mental health of children who are referred there. Children's gender services need 'transformation' The crisis at England's NHS child gender clinic Evidence for puberty blockers use 'very low' The health secretary has been considering changing the law to allow a review of GIDS being led Dr Hilary Cass, former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, to access a database of children who were treated by GIDS to see if any later regretted having treatments, such as puberty blockers. It is unclear how the process of giving access to the information would work. Puberty blockersare powerful drugs that block the actions of sex hormones and are used to delay the onset of puberty. Last year the Court of Appeal upheld the right of the trust to give the drugs to under-16s if they were deemed capable of giving consent. The health secretary's move followsinterim findings,externalof Dr Cass's report into GIDS. She found a lack of expert agreement around what constitutes gender dysphoria, long waiting lists for treatment and an absence of data on the success of different approaches. Dr Cass also considered GPs and other non-GIDS staff felt ""under pressure to adopt an unquestioning affirmative approach"" to children unsure of their gender, ""overshadowing"" other issues such as poor mental health. In her opinion the present NHS service needed ""transformation"". The only NHS gender identity facility for young people is based at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust There is one GIDS service in England, with clinics in London and Leeds, with other satellite services offering support. They see approximately 2,500 young people each year, of which less than 10% have access to hormone treatment. Girls are more often referred to the service than boys. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said ""being respectful of someone's identity does not preclude exploration"". ""We agree that support should be holistic, based on the best available evidence and that no assumptions should be made about the right outcome for any given young person,"" it added.

"Repairs were carried out on the MV Caledonian Isles after an engine failure Announcements that Caledonian MacBrayne ferries have been withdrawn from service for repairs are becoming an increasingly common occurrence. Most islands in the west of Scotland rely on services from state-owned CalMac, which operates 34 vessels - the largest fleet in the UK. But CalMac has a problem - the pace of renewal has been slow and the ageing boats are developing more faults, leading to delays and cancellations. Four of the 10 largest ferries are beyond their expected operational life. The average age of the CalMac ferries is more than24 years and many of the large boats are even older. Of the 10 largest ferries, four are more than 30 years old and the MV Isle of Arran is 40. Three major ships - MV Caledonian Isles, MV Hebridean Isles and MV Clansman - were out of action in the spring of 2023 because of delays to repairs and annual overhauls. Even the newer ships have had breakdowns -  CalMac's biggest ship MV Loch Seaforth, built in 2014, was out of action for weeks in 2021 due to engine damage.  An investigation founda failure to replace piston screws,externalduring scheduled maintenance may have been to blame. Another fault developed in April this year, forcing it to be withdrawn from service from the main route to Lewis for two days. CalMac says its maintenance budget has risen by 67% over the past five years, with a projected spend of Â£34.2m in 2022. A spokeswoman for CalMac added: ""A long-term strategy to replace vessels and improve port infrastructure would improve the capacity we can offer to meet demand and increase resilience. ""Significant investments are being progressed by the Scottish government and its partners."" The Glen Sannox's construction at Ferguson's shipyard has been troubled The Scottish government's Transport Scotland agency has long known it needs to renew the CalMac fleet - but those ambitions have foundered, in part at least, due tothe Ferguson ferry fiasco. Back in 2012, a ferries plan included a programme of vessel replacement. In 2014, tenders went out for two new large ships - one for the Arran route and the other destined for the ""Uig triangle"", serving Skye, North Uist and Harris. Those ships, Glen Sannox and the as yet un-named hull 802, are still under construction at the now-nationalised Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow. The cost to the public purse has risen to 2.5 times the original Â£97m budget - and the first ship won't be handed over to CalMac until late 2023 at the earliest, more than five years late. An impression of one of new ferries being built for the Islay route A Â£105m order for the next two big ships - for the Islay route - has nowbeen signed with a Turkish shipyardand, if all goes to plan, they should be delivered in 2024/2025. The new ships will replace 37-year-old MV Hebridean Isles and allow the 11-year-old MV Finlaggan, to be redeployed. Two other ""Islay-class vessels"" have now been ordered from the same shipyard, destined for the Skye, Harris and North Uist routes. A replacement programme for seven smaller vessels has begun, and should go out to tender later in 2023. The Scottish government has promised Â£580m of investment in Scotland's ferry network over the next five years - about half of it for new ships - but some claim, given the scale of the problem, that's nowhere near enough. Privately-run Pentland Ferries has successfully used catamarans to and from Orkney for years While few dispute the need for new ferries, there is far less consensus on what type of vessels should be purchased. CalMac and CMAL, another government agency which owns the ships and harbours, have a reputation for choosing a certain type of vessel - large, sophisticated mono-hulled ships with capacity for the crew to sleep on board. Some island communities have suggested they would be better served by a greater number of smaller vessels, and that shore-based crews could boost their economies. Others have urged CMALto consider using catamarans,,externalarguing they require smaller engines yet can carry similar numbers of vehicles at a substantially lower cost. Privately-run Pentland Ferries has successfully used such ships to and from Orkney for years, and has recently replaced MV Pentalina with a new catamaran. The Mull and Iona Ferry Committee has urged Transport Scotland to buy MV Pentalina. This has been rejected, although leasing the ship as a temporary measure remains a possibility. CMAL's argument is that it needs to build long-lifespan ""quality"" ships, interchangeable between routes and capable of withstanding often harsh conditions. Having ship-based crews, it says, provides more robust staffing. And it insists it remains on the lookout for suitable second hand boats. One such vessel, a medium-sized Norwegian ferry now renamed MV Loch Frisa, has entered service on the Craignure to Oban route. In Denmark, fully-electric ferries are already sailing but only on relatively short routes One of the dilemmas facing Scotland's ferry network is that it needs to commit to new ships now that could be in service for decades - yet it is still unclear which future technology will win out. In Denmark, fully-electric ferries are already sailing but only on relatively short routes. A Norwegian ferry operator is now running a boat powered by liquid hydrogen. The troubled ships being still being built at Port Glasgow were meant to be ""green ferries"", using dual-fuel diesel and liquified natural gas (LNG) engines. But those ""green"" claims are questionable - LNG is still a fossil fuel, and it has to be imported from Qatar before being driven hundreds of miles from Kent to Scotland. For the new Islay ferries, CMAL has ditched LNG in favour of mainly diesel ships with ""fuel efficient hulls"" and some electric power options while manoeuvring in port. Islands like Iona are seeing visitor numbers pick up again The introduction of heavily-subsidised road equivalent tariffs - aligning fares with the cost of road travel - has increased ferry traffic over the past decade, with 5.7m passengers and nearly 1.5m vehicles being carried in 2019 before the pandemic. The past two years have seen a significant drop in numbers due to Covid restrictions but the ferry network is once again struggling to cope. The boost in numbers is good news for the islands in many ways but locals oftencomplain of trouble getting a booking. Residents on Mull have urged the government to considera system used for the Danish island of Samso,externalwhere are proportion of spaces are held back for locals, based on evidence of demand. A new ferries plan is being promised. Ministers are also currently considering Project Neptune - a review by consultants looking at the roles of Transport Scotland, CalMac and CMAL - to try to make the system work better. But like the metaphor about the time it takes to turn a tanker around, the problems facing CalMac's fleet are going to take a long time to fix.

"This video can not be played Just one of Swansea council's 72 councillors is black There are calls for political parties in Wales to run a minimum number of ethnically diverse candidates in elections. Less than 2% of candidates in the 2017 council elections identified as being black, Asian or minority ethnic. Campaigners said it was ""time to act"" with race-based shortlists to make sure the 5.2% of people in Wales who are ethnically diverse get representation. But the three major parties in Wales all said they were against quotas. There is no official data on the ethnic background of the candidates running in the council elections on 5 May - something the Electoral Reform Society has criticised. But acandidate survey after the last election,externalfound just 1.8% of 1,682 respondents said they were from a non-white background. Three of the seven local authorities who responded to a request for figures by BBC Wales said they had no ethnically diverse councillors. Cardiff council had the highest number of non-white councillors with nine out of 72 council seats. When it came to women, Newport elected one Asian woman from 50 council seats, while Swansea had one black woman from 72 seats. ""It's appalling, absolutely,"" said Evelyn James from Women's Equality Network Wales (WEN Wales). ""It shouldn't even be something we should be talking about at this point, because we live in a diverse society. ""When you bring in the different cultures, the dynamics in the thinking, that's how you thrive... so it is important for us to allow every Welsh citizen to be part of the decision process, for their voices to be heard."" First woman of colour elected to Welsh Parliament Lack of election diversity a 'massive step back' Election 'diversity crisis' warning WEN Wales said the first step in overcoming barriers to political participation, such as prejudice, a lack of childcare provision and financial disincentives, was a system that guarantees councils elect people of colour. ""We are not saying that diversity quotas are the only effective tool... it is a starting point,"" said Ms James. ""Give them the chance to be at the decision table, because if we leave it to chance they have lots of barriers already in place that limit them. ""If you deliberately create a system that gives them the opportunity, then you get to see what potential they can bring to the table."" Evelyn James said: ""We're not going to wait until decades to come to make the difference"" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), which represents all local authorities, said it also wanted to see ""greater diversity in our councils' chambers, to ensure councils reflect the communities they serve"". It has run diversity mentoring schemes and said all councils had signed a diversity pledge. A WLGA spokesman added: ""Quotas are often politically contentious, however the WLGA council agreed that groups or parties should consider using voluntary quotas and review their use following the election."" But Welsh Labour, the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have all come out against a quota system for the selection of their candidates. Instead, Labour said black, Asian and party members from other ethnic minority backgrounds have been over-represented in its future candidate programmes. But Ramesh Patel, who is standing down after more than two decades as a Labour councillor in Cardiff, said his party was not doing enough. Ramesh Patel said the representation of diverse communities had been a ""total failure"" in Wales compared with parts of England ""We should now start to be looking at possibly all-women shortlisting for people from diverse communities,"" said Mr Patel. ""It seems like, almost, you've got to fight lots of obstacles to get your name on the ballot paper and that should not happen."" Mr Patel wants Labour to consider using diversity quotas because he said having people of colour on the Cardiff councils had made a ""huge difference"", especially when it came to communicating with constituents in different languages and understanding cultural differences. He said the need for more ethnically diverse politicians applied to all political parties. ""I think there has been a total failure compared to some parts of England [where] you've got far better representation from those diverse communities,"" he said. ""If you look at Birmingham and London, you've got day-care centres... designed for diverse communities. ""In Cardiff, I've been fighting for that for years and years and that hasn't happened... because people just don't understand what that requirement is,"" he said. ""But if you've got more diverse councillors, they could be the voice and get some of those things done."" The Welsh Conservatives called quotas ""demeaning, implying certain people are a special class that need favours based on their demography"". The party said it ""supports people from all backgrounds to join"" and had a strong record of getting ethnic minority candidates elected in Wales. Altaf Hussain became the first Asian heritage councillor for the Pen-y-Fai ward in Bridgend county in 2017. He is standing down from the council this election, after becoming a ConservativeMember of the Senedd(MS) for South Wales West last year. The retired orthopaedic surgeon said to get the best candidate, the selection process must be open to all. Altaf Hussain, one of the first Asian heritage councillors in Bridgend says he wanted to see integration, not quotas Quotas would be ""a diversion"", he said. ""What I believe is integrity, there should be no difference between you and me,"" he said. ""I don't think quota business can work, that means really you're.... limiting their competition."" But Mr Hussain said many immigrants come to Wales to earn money and see a job in politics as being too unstable and not paying enough. He added that some may not be coming forward because ""they're still thinking that we are not equal, which is horrible. ""Skills should be developed within the political parties and there should be mentors.... but that's not happening at present."" The chairman of Plaid Cymru's black and minority ethnic section, Abyd Quinn Aziz, said the party did not see quotas as the ""necessary response or an answer"". Abyd Quinn Aziz said looking at racial diversity was something ""relatively new"" for Plaid Cymru He said quotas can, in some cases, ""undermine"" politicians from a minority ethnic background. ""There are people who say that means you get the job, irrespective of whether you can do it or not,"" said Mr Aziz. ""We have an imposter syndrome or an 'am I good enough' feeling anyway, without that adding to it."" Looking at racial diversity was something ""relatively new"" for Plaid, he said, explaining that it was part of a wider effort to demonstrate the party is for everyone in Wales, not just Welsh language speakers. ""Shadowing, mentoring and encouraging people to join"" and take on different roles is the way the party will get more ethnic minority candidates standing for council, he said. Mr Aziz and Mr Hussain both said they believed educating young people was the key to more diverse politics in the future. The Welsh government said its new curriculum included ""education on citizenship and politics"" to help learners become ""ethical informed citizens."" Hemione said ethnic diversity promotes democracy by allowing everyone's voice to be heard The last election in Wales, in December, saw the Welsh Youth Parliament become the country's most diverse political body. Hermione, 15, who represents Gower, said she hoped it would inspire more participation from 16 and 17-years-olds, who will be allowed to vote in a council election for the first time in May. ""Councils and parliaments reflect the wider community,"" Hermione said. ""If people have someone they can relate to in a position of power, it will inspire them to make a change themselves."" She said she hopes her generation of politicians will help to close the diversity gap in Welsh politics.

"Fury remains unbeaten in 33 bouts after flooring Whyte WBC champion Tyson Fury produced a stunning one-punch stoppage in the sixth round to beat fellow Briton Dillian Whyte and then insisted he will retire from boxing. Fury dominated what was a scrappy bout and then unleashed a vicious right uppercut. Whyte, admirably, got to his feet within the count before staggering into the referee as the fight was halted. ""This might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King,"" Fury said post-fight. He added later: ""I've spent a lot of time on the road. I've been away for a long time. I fulfilled everything I've ever wanted to fulfil. ""I will retire as only the second heavyweight in history, after Rocky Marciano, to retire undefeated. I was unbeatable at this game."" Fury - who also retained his Ring Magazine belt - is unbeaten in 33 bouts, while Whyte - suffering his third loss in 31 fights - fell short on his first attempt at a world title. If Fury does decide to hang up the gloves, the 33-year-old will miss out on an opportunity to fight for the undisputed crown - a fight which could potentially be staged later this year - and a chance to cement his status as Britain's greatest ever heavyweight. ""I promised my wife that would be it after the [Deontay] Wilder fight,"" he added. ""But I got offered a fight at Wembley and I owed it to the fans. What a way to go out."" Fury's wife Paris told BT Sport: ""I would like him to come out now. He has nothing more to prove. If he had anything left to do, I would say 'Yeah Tyson, you do it'. But he has nothing to prove. ""For Tyson to keep boxing, it just seems for one reason and I know in my heart, I think the only reason that Tyson will come back is for the unification fight."" The Gypsy King - end of an extraordinary era? Fight Talk - Social media reaction to big fight Recap - All the action as it happened Whyte had no answer to Fury's punching power With 94,000 fans in attendance - a post-war British record - there was an electric atmosphere like no other for a fight dubbed by some as the greatest all-British heavyweight dust-up in history. Boos echoed around the iconic stadium as a pumped-up Whyte let out his trademark wolf-like howl before walking to the ring. Fury's ring walk was extravagant. It began to the tune of Don McLean's 'American Pie', soon turned into 'Juicy' by Notorious B.I.G and ended on 'Sex on Fire' by Kings of Leon. Fury then sat on a throne as fireworks blasted skywards, before heading towards the ring. He towered over Whyte as the two men touched gloves. Fury teased before the fight that he could switch to southpaw and neutralise Whyte's dangerous left hook but, surprisingly, it was Whyte who came out as a southpaw in a cagey opening round. It was then Fury's turn to switch from orthodox in the second as the battle of mind games continued, with the champion edging the opening two rounds. He landed with a solid two-punch combination in the third, prompting Whyte to charge at his opponent. But the challenger could not get close to Fury, who used his height and reach advantage to keep Whyte at bay as the fight progressed. The contest truly heated up in a spicy fourth round. Whyte connected when asked to break, which clearly agitated Fury. The fighters twice received a telling off from Mark Lyson, as the referee struggled to control the two men who boast a combined weight of 37 stone. Whyte's telegraphed overhand rights were getting nowhere close to the elusive Fury, who was connecting with ease. Then came arguably Fury's greatest punch of what is proving to be an illustrious career. He teed it up with a left jab and as Whyte stepped forward, Fury whipped in the brutal uppercut. Whyte fell back on the canvas. He channelled the warrior spirit he spoke of before the fight but, as he made it to his feet, was clearly in no position to continue. Fury celebrates with wife Paris and his team This video can not be played 'There is nothing more I can do' - Tyson Fury on potential retirement Fury, as expected, took the microphone and treated fans to his own rendition of 'American Pie' in the ring following his victory. It was a singsong to end the perfect homecoming party for the Morecambe-based fighter, who was boxing in the United Kingdom for the first time since 2018. He said before the fight that this would be his last. That by boxing at Wembley he had reached his pinnacle. Many in the sport took those comments with a touch of scepticism - it is something he said several times before - but it seems Fury is sticking to his word. His compatriot Anthony Joshua is likely to rematch Ukraine's WBA, IBF and WBO champion Oleksandr Usyk this summer. The lure of fighting the winner for all the belts - and the lucrative nature it brings, particularly if Joshua is victorious - could just tempt Fury to halt his retirement plans. Tyson Fury made a dramatic entrance on a throne before facing Dillian Whyte If this is the end, however, it is a remarkable career from a man who at 6ft 9in and 19 stone has an ability to glide across the ring resembling an elegant ballroom dancer. His style, for his size, is unmatched. He is a boxer who went from narrowly beating John McDermott on points for the English title in Brentwood to becoming a unified world champion, shocking long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in Germany in 2015. A boxer who came back from over two and half years out of the sport and reclaimed a heavyweight title, cracking America and sharing arguably one of the greatest trilogies in the sport with Deontay Wilder. He has entertained reporters by dressing up as batman or taping his mouth shut at media conferences. Fury even had time to join the scripted world of professional wrestling. In the second coming of his career, Fury has spoken openly about - and become an advocate for - mental health struggles. But his career has not been short of controversy. Not long after his first world title, Fury made homophobic and sexist remarks during an interview. He previously tested positive for a banned steroid - something he blamed on eating uncastrated wild boar - and later admitted to use of drink and drugs to help deal with depression. More recently, his fight with Whyte had been somewhat overshadowed by Fury's links to Daniel Kinahan, who earlier this month was among seven people hit with worldwide financial sanctions by the United States. Fury had previously been advised by Kinahan but this week insisted he has ""absolutely zero"" involvement with the Irishman. It has been a career full of highs and lows. But despite the retirement, seeing the Gypsy King in a ring again - with potentially an opportunity to cement his status as the greatest British heavyweight in history - is wholly possible. Apart from the few months following his defeat to Alexander Povetkin in 2020, which he then avenged, 34-year-old Whyte had been mandatory challenger for the WBC belt since 2017. ""Dillian is a warrior and I believe he will be a world champion,"" Fury said as he and Whyte embraced post-fight. ""One of the greatest and, unfortunately, he had to fight me tonight. You are not messing with a mediocre heavyweight, you are messing with the best man on the planet."" Since his first career defeat to rival Joshua in 2015, Whyte has proven his world-level credentials with wins over the likes of Joseph Parker and Povetkin. He is still a big draw in the sport. ""There wasn't a lot in it - it was a close fight and I didn't feel like I was outclassed in there,"" Whyte told Radio 5 Live. ""My game plan was to press him and start moving forward. I was trying to attack but one slip and I got caught with the shot. ""He's a big awkward guy - I was expecting that. ""It was always going to be an awkward fight, but I was trying to set up and be patient and land what I could early and from round three onwards start to press. ""It was a good learning experience."" A rematch with rival Joshua, should he lose against Usyk, is easy to sell and one which could capture the imagination of boxing fans. Time will tell what the future has in store for Whyte, but the night belonged to Fury - one of, if not the greatest, British heavyweights of all time and a future hall-of-famer.

"Volunteers will be out again this summer helping to keep Snowdonia clean Volunteers are again taking to one of Wales' most popular mountain paths to try to keep it clear of litter. The Caru Eryri scheme began organising litter picking walks in 2021 following asharp rise in the number of visitors to Snowdon. Volunteers said that while most people keep the paths clean, there is a ""small minority"" who leave rubbish behind. It follows the council's plea for hikers touse toilet facilities before they begin their journey. ""The volunteers who come out with us are great, they give up their own time just to come out and look after a place they love,"" said one of the pickers, Alf Bodenham. The group usually organise walks up to three times a week at some of Snowdonia's most popular beauty spots, including the Snowdon paths, the Ogwen valley and Beddgelert. Activities typically include picking litter along the paths, work to tackle erosion like clearing drainage routes, and speaking with walkers. The issue of keeping paths tidy was once again in the spotlight earlier this month after a Snowdon tour guide said themountain path was"" covered in human stools"". It prompted Snowdonia National Park Authority to urge visitors to use the toilets at the bottom of the mountain before climbing. The volunteers find a range of different types of rubbish that people have discarded on their hikes The usual haul of rubbish collected is more run of the mill, however, and can often add up to over 40kg (6st 2lb) between the group on busy days. ""After the lockdowns a lot more people staycationed here, so there was more pressure on Snowdon and more people landing on the path,"" Mr Bodenham said. ""The most common things we find is food - bananas, orange peels, crisp wrappers - but also things like tissues, wet wipes, and clothes such as gloves and hats. ""We sometimes see odd things, and wonder 'how on earth did that get up Snowdon?'"" Human faeces on popular paths a 'danger to health' âWhy did you mess up Snowdonia?â litter-bugs asked Neil Gwilt, another volunteer litter picker, said dog waste is another common problem. ""They bag it, but they don't take it away, they just hide it,"" he said. ""We're trying to keep the mountain paths clean and tidy. It would be nice if people took stuff up, and when they've used it and finished with it, take it back down again - it doesn't cost them anything."" This video can not be played Snowdon is a huge attraction for tourists On the whole however, Mr Bodenham said that walkers are receptive to their message, with many thanking them for their work as they pass. ""People are very positive - I think there's more awareness now about the effect of climbing Snowdon, that it's a pretty big mountain and that you have to be prepared for the weather and all sorts. ""Our message is that people should take everything home with them that they've brought with them to the mountain."" It takes Mr Gwilt about two hours to travel from Wolverhampton almost every week to Snowdonia, but he said he gained immense satisfaction from the work he and his fellow volunteers do. ""They're a good group of people, they're friendly, happy, and it's a good day out. ""I enjoy north Wales and I like the countryside. I enjoy the geology, I enjoy the walk - it's as simple as that.""

"Both sides are under fire from their critics Finding a French election poster for either top candidate that hasn't yet been defaced is almost like a treasure hunt. Ahead of this Sunday's decisive presidential election, colourful slurs are scrawled everywhere: ""fascist"" or ""dirty liberal""; ""racist"" v ""elitist"" on billboards for Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron. It doesn't take long to work out what's aimed at whom. The violent dislike many voters express for one or both sides in this election can take your breath away. Marine Le Pen is used to it. The daughter of an infamous anti-immigration, nationalist politician who repeatedly spoke of Nazi gas chambers and the Holocaust as ""a detail of the history of the Second World War"", she has spent years trying to escape Jean-Marie Le Pen's toxic shadow. This is her third attempt at the presidency, and she is the softest public version of herself yet. From her pastel make-up, to a notably warmer speaking tone and her focus on the working French struggling to make ends meet, rather than concentrating on the classic far right priorities: law and order and immigration. ""Marine"", as she now likes to be known, has tried oh so very hard to rebrand herself as a patriotic centrist. I put it to her that her critics call her ""un-electable'; describing her as too far right and radical. ""I'm not radical, sorry!"" she retorted. ""The current government has been lead by the privileged minority for the privileged minority. That's the reality."" ""I am running for president to change that. To establish a government of the people, for the people... giving back power to the people."" This video can not be played Watch: What far-right leader Marine Le Pen said beforeâ¦and now In fairness, she's persuaded many, with popularity ratings she never enjoyed previously. But large swathes of France simply don't buy it. Nagette, a young Muslim office worker, told me Le Pen could '""change her mask as often as she liked"" but that she remained far-right in her roots and policies. She'd be voting Emmanuel Macron, she said, to keep Le Pen out. When I followed Le Pen on her campaign trail in the south of France a few days ago, her press officers had us journalists meet them in a car park at an arranged time. We then were left to hang around irritably, until they suddenly announced the name of the village Marine Le Pen would imminently appear in for a campaign event. It was quite surreal. But there is a logic to it. If the press didn't know ahead of time where Marine would be glad-handing, then her shouting, chanting, at times aggressive detractors wouldn't be there either, to ruin her PR event. Emmanuel Macron had a far easier time in 2017. His first presidential campaign. Then, he was a fresher-faced, brazen political disrupter, claiming to be neither of the left nor the right, just promising a bright future for all French men and women. Middle-class French women swooned over him. French businessmen had high hopes for the rabbits they hoped the former boy wonder economy minister might pull out of French tricolour-coloured hats. Now, he's been tarnished by five years in office, which included presiding over a global pandemic, a war in Ukraine which threatens wider European stability and a big, fat Covid and Russia-tensions linked economic downturn. Madame Le Pen is not the only one with a reputation problem. Macron is disparagingly referred to as ""Jupiter"" or ""president of the rich"" by his detractors. Many voters say they wouldn't touch him with a barge pole. Which makes Sunday's vote all the more fascinating. The French often talk about putting a clothes peg on their nose when casting a ballot in the final round of presidential election. It's about choosing ""the best of the worst"", people tell you. Preventing the most odious candidate from taking office. Whether it was to defeat Marine Le Pen or her father before her, French political parties would club together to form a so-called cordon sanitaire to keep the far right out of government. This election year it's far less clear cut. The big question is whether voters of the far left will abstain, because of their deep dislike of Emmanuel Macron, even if that might mean ushering Marine Le Pen into the ÃlysÃ©e Palace through the back door. Voter disdain and voter apathy are arguably the bigger threat for Macron on Sunday than Le Pen herself. Quite a contrast to the passion you find in international circles when discussing the possibility of a President Le Pen. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire, told me he thought the wider world, not only Europe, was aware of what was at stake in this election: two visions of the future of France and two visions of the future of Europe, he said. Especially in light of the raging Russia-Ukraine crisis. Brussels and Washington are watching the vote extremely closely, crossing their metaphorical fingers. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and well-known Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny have both called for Macron to be re-elected. France has the EU's only significant military force. It's the bloc's second largest economy and it's been playing an increasingly dominant European role since the departure from politics of EU grande dame Angela Merkel, which left Berlin somewhat weakened on the world stage. Macron wants to boost EU, Nato and transatlantic relations. While Le Pen is a euro- and US-sceptic with historically close ties to Moscow and an arms-length attitude towards Nato. Bruno Le Maire says the world is watching France's election carefully. ""Do you really think when you have war in Europe,"" spluttered Bruno Le Maire, ""that it's good idea for France, for the G7 countries, for all the allies of the French nation to have France, one of the most important political power in Europe, withdraw from the NATO's military command?"" he asked. Because that is what Madame Le Pen proposes. Mr Le Maire also warned the Le Pen economic programme would be disastrous, he said. Not only for France but the whole of Europe. Also damaging close economic partner the UK, he said. Marine Le Pen fiercely defends her financial proposals, which include abolishing income tax for the under-30s and helping the hard-up with France's cost of living crisis. She also claims not to be a danger to the EU. As part of her attempt to attract more mainstream voters, Le Pen has backed away from her once oft-repeated desire to remove France from the euro currency and from ""the tyranny of Brussels"". French rivals for presidency clash in TV debate EU awaits French election outcome with trepidation But her declared intention to unilaterally reduce France's contributions to the EU budget, to restrict the freedom of movement of workers across Schengen passport-free European borders and to declare the supremacy of French law over EU law, in direct contradiction to EU treaties, could end up paralysing the EU from within. French MEP Nathalie Loiseau, formerly Macron's Europe minister, told me she had gone into politics to help prevent the far right from getting to power. No-one should downplay the possibility of a Le Pen presidency, she insisted. Remember Donald Trump's surprise election victory and the Brexit vote, she added - when people went to bed, believing the UK would remain in the EU, only to wake up to a very different reality? Still, if Marine Le Pen were to beat the odds and become president this Sunday, Nathalie Loiseau said it was very unlikely she'd manage to cobble together a coalition of like-minded countries aiming to dismantle the EU from the inside. Her closest EU ally, Viktor Orban, wants the EU to keep existing, she explained, so his country can continue to benefit from subsidies. While Poland's Brussels-sceptic coalition was deeply troubled by Le Pen's cosy relationship with Russia. The campaign slogans of Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron both claim they represent all French people. Considering their very different political programmes and reputations, that is an impossibility. France is a divided nation.

"Russia says it has destroyed six substations powering Ukrainian railways used to transport foreign weapons Ukraine's armed forces say Russia is targeting rail junctions to hit military supply routes At least five people in central Ukraine were killed in the attacks, Ukrainian officials say About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalise parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims He was speaking after meeting President Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also went to Kyiv, said the US wanted to see Russia militarily weakened Edited by Jude Sheerin Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent Global military spending exceeded $2tn (Â£1.6tn) for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says. It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France. Alina Kabaeva is a 38-year old Olympic gold medalist White House press secretary Jen Psaki denied at Monday's daily press briefing the US was deliberately holding off on sanctioning the woman believed to be Putin's girlfriend. ""We're continuing to review sanctions,"" Psaki said when asked why Russian politician and ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva had not yet been targeted. ""No-one is safe from our sanctions,"" Psaki continued. ""We've already of course sanctioned President Putin, but also his daughter and his closest cronies, and we will continue to review more,"" she added. Calls have been rising for the US to sanction the 38-year old Olympic gold medalist, as the US has done to Putin's two adult daughters. Putin is known for being intensely private about his personal life, and has never acknowledged any romantic relationship with Russia's ""secret first lady"", as she has been dubbed in the Russian and foreign press. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US officials have withheld sanctions on Kabaeva due to concerns that Putin would view it as a personal attack. It would be viewed as ""so personal a blow to Mr Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the US"", the Journal wrote. An railway electricity substation near Lviv was damaged in a Russian strike aimed at halting the supply of foreign weapons If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine.  Lavrov also acknowledged there's a possibility of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons, though he also sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a peace accord. Speaking to the Russian First Channel on Monday, he said Moscow wanted to avoid ""artificially"" elevated risks of such a conflict. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of ""pretending"" to negotiate, calling him ""a good actorâ. ""If you watch attentively and read attentively what he says, you'll find a thousand contradictions,"" Russiaâs top diplomat said. The foreign minister said last week that Moscow was committed to avoiding a nuclear war. On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Lavrovâs latest comments were an indication Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraineâ. ""Thus the talk of a ârealâ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Days after the invasion began back on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert. The US and its Nato allies have said they do not want direct military intervention in Ukraine, in order to avoid the risks of a Third World War. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russiaâ. In an interview aired on Monday, he said: ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russiaâs military acting within the context of the special operation.â Lavrov also told state television: ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" In his nightly video address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Ukraine's victory is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict when the war will conclude. ""Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,"" he says in his address. ""But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land."" Earlier in his address, he marked the fact that the invasion, which began on 24 February, has just surpassed the three-month mark. Zelensky goes on to say that there is ""no simple answer"" to the question of when Ukraine will defeat the Russians, adding that victory - and peace - will come more quickly if every Ukrainian fights. ""When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. ""But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable."" ""For Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight,"" he continues. ""They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory."" This ambulance was one of 20 donated earlier this month to the war-torn country The UK is donating 22 new ambulances and medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from the government there, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. It comes just weeks after a shipment of 20 ambulances was sent to the country, as it battles against the Russian invasion. Medical aid charity UK-Med, which works on the front line of disasters around the world, has been given Â£300,000 of funding to train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics in dealing with mass casualties. The charity has also been given Â£300,000 of medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to bring to Ukrainian medical staff. More than 40 fire engines have already arrived in Ukraine from the UK, after the nation saw more than 100 of its fire stations and 250 fire engines destroyed in the war. Steve RosenbergRussia editor, reporting from Bryansk Plumes of smoke were captured rising into the sky from the oil depot in Bryansk on a video on social media The city of Bryansk is a hundred miles from Russiaâs border
with Ukraine. But today it looked like it was on the front line. Plumes of
thick black smoke dominated the skyline - the consequence of fires overnight.
First one fuel depot erupting in flames, and then another. The cause? Well, thereâs been no official explanation - there
is, however, much speculation. Was this the result of a Ukrainian strike to
disrupt logistics for Russiaâs military offensive? Was it sabotage by Russian
opponents of the Kremlinâs so-called special military operation? Neither Moscow
nor Kyiv is saying. Whatever the cause, the fires have sparked concern amongst
the Russian public. Here are some of the things people told me on the streets
of Bryansk: âThis never happened before. At 3am we heard explosions.
Weâre amazed.â âI donât know what this is. Is it war here? Well, I suppose
weâre on the front line. I wonder if Ukraine did this..?â We have seen something similar in Belgorod, earlier this
month. Another blaze at another Russian fuel depot near the border. Russia
claimed Ukrainian helicopter gunships had opened fire. Kyiv wouldnât confirm
it. But one thing is clear. Despite President Putinâs claims
that he sent his troops into Ukraine to bring Russians security, there is
little sign of that. Electronic equipment which could be used to intercept communications and spy on Ukrainians is the latest category of products to be banned by the UK for export to Russia. The Department for International Trade also announced the UK would remove tariffs and quotes on products from Ukraine, responding to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to support the country's economy as it defends itself from invasion. The decision would affect key Ukrainian exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry, the UK said. Tariffs will be lifted for 12 months initially, but could be extended. As well as equipment used to intercept and monitor communications, the UK has previously banned the export of luxury goods, aviation and space equipment, oil refining items and advanced technologies such as quantum computing. Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, reporting from Donbas Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave. But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""
