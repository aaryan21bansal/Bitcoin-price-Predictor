"Prince William and Prince Harry have spoken of their regret that their last conversation with their mother was a ""desperately rushed"" phone call. Prince Harry, who was 12 when Princess Diana died, said: ""All I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was."" In an ITV documentary to mark 20 years since their mother's death, the princes also spoke of her ""fun"" parenting. Diana encouraged them to be ""naughty"" and smuggled them sweets, they said. The princes added that she was a ""total kid through and through"", who understood the ""real life outside of palace walls"". This video can not be played ""She was one of the naughtiest parents"": Prince Harry and Prince William on their memories of their mother Unpublished photos of the princes with their mother feature in the programme. Prince Harry and Prince William are seen looking through Diana's personal album as they talk about how their childhood memories of their mother sat alongside her global image and influence as a campaigner for the homeless, Aids victims, and banning landmines. Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 when Prince William was 15 and Prince Harry was 12. Prince William said taking part in the programme initially seemed ""quite daunting"" but had been ""a healing process as well"". He said they wanted ""her legacy to live on in our work and we feel this is an appropriate way of doing that"". Princess Diana was pregnant when photographed with Prince William here. ""Believe it or not, you and I are both in this photograph,"" the Duke of Cambridge tells his brother in the programme But the Duke of Cambridge said the last conversation with their mother weighs ""quite heavily"" on his mind. It took place while the brothers were having a ""very good time"" with their cousins at Balmoral, the Queen's home in Scotland. ""Harry and I were in a desperate rush to say goodbye, you know 'see you later'... if I'd known now obviously what was going to happen, I wouldn't have been so blasÃ© about it and everything else,"" he said. Prince William says in the interview he remembers what his mother said - but does not reveal details of the conversation. Prince Harry said: ""It was her speaking from Paris, I can't really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was."" Recalling Princess Diana's sense of humour, Prince Harry said: ""Our mother was a total kid through and through. ""When everybody says to me 'so she was fun, give us an example' all I can hear is her laugh in my head."" He added: ""One of her mottos to me was, you know, 'you can be as naughty as you want,  just don't get caught'. ""She was one of the naughtiest parents.  She would come and watch us play football and, you know, smuggle sweets into our socks."" The photos shown in the programme were taken from Princess Diana's personal album Prince William said his mother was ""very informal and really enjoyed the laughter and the fun"". She could be ""sort of the joker"", he added, and ""loved the rudest cards you could imagine"". He said: ""I would be at school and I'd get a card from my mother. Usually she found something, you know, very embarrassing, you know, a very funny card, and then sort of wrote very nice stuff inside. ""But I dared not open it in case the teachers or anyone else in the class had seen it."" Prince Harry and Prince William, now aged 32 and 35 respectively, say Diana was ""the best mother ever"" He also talked about the ""very funny memory"" of coming home from school to find his mother had invited supermodels Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell to their home in Kensington Palace. ""I was probably a 12 or 13-year-old boy who had posters of them on his wall,"" he told Monday's documentary, Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy. ""I went bright red, and didn't know quite what to say and sort of fumbled and I think pretty much fell down the stairs on the way up. I was completely and utterly awestruck."" Earlier this month, theprinces attended a service to re-dedicate their mother's graveat Althorp House in Northamptonshire, on what would have been her 56th birthday. Prince Harry said he had only cried twice for his mother - one of the times was at the funeral service at Althorp in 1997. ""So there's a lot of grief that still needs to be let out,"" he said. Peter Hunt on the princes taking control of Diana's memory Prince William, who was accompanied at the re-dedication service by the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, said he keeps the memory of his mother alive for his children by ""constantly talking about granny Diana"". ""She'd be a lovely grandmother, she'd absolutely love it, she'd love the children to bits,"" he said. And he joked: ""She'd be a nightmare grandmother, absolute nightmare... She'd come, probably at bath time, cause an amazing... scene, bubbles everywhere bath water all over the place and then leave."" The princes, pictured here with their mother in 1992, recall their last conversation with her Reflecting on the anniversary of Princess Diana's death, Prince Harry told ITV: ""To myself and William she was just the best mother ever."" He said: ""It has been hard and it will continue to be hard, there's not a day William and I don't wish that she was still around and we wonder what kind of mother she would be now, and what kind of a public role she would have and what a difference she would be making."" The princes have also both agreed to take part in a forthcomingBBC documentaryabout their mother. They were were speaking to ITV from their home at Kensington Palace where they will unveil a statue of their mother in its public gardens on the 20th anniversary of her death. Prince William said: ""We won't be doing this again - we won't speak as openly or publicly about her again, because we feel hopefully this film will provide the other side from close family friends you might not have heard before, from those who knew her best and from those who want to protect her memory, and want to remind people of the person that she was."" Thedocumentary will be broadcast on ITV,externalandSTV,externalat 21:00 BST on Monday, 24 July.

"Mr Trump referred to his ""complete power to pardon"" in a tweet US President Donald Trump has insisted he has the ""complete power"" to pardon people, amid reports he is considering presidential pardons for family members, aides and even himself. A Democratic Party spokesman has called the reports ""extremely disturbing"". The US authorities are probing possible collusion between the Trump team and Russia. Intelligence agencies think Russia tried to help Mr Trump to power. Russia denies this, and the president says there was no collusion. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Mr Trump and his team were looking at ways to pardon people close to him. Presidents can pardon people before guilt is established or even before the person is charged with a crime. Describing the reports as disturbing, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said ""pardoning any individuals who may have been involved would be crossing a fundamental line"". On Saturday, Mr Trumptweeted:,external""While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS."" Could Trump pardon himself? Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded Mr Trump also attacked ""illegal leaks"" following reports his attorney general discussed campaign-related matters with a Russian envoy. The Washington Post,externalgave an account of meetings Attorney General Jeff Sessions held with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. The newspaper quoted current and former US officials who cited intelligence intercepts of Mr Kislyak's version of the encounter to his superiors. One of those quoted said Mr Kislyak spoke to Mr Sessions about key campaign issues, including Mr Trump's positions on policies significant to Russia. During his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Mr Sessions said he had no contact with Russians during the election campaign. When it later emerged he had, he said the campaign was not discussed at the meetings. An official confirmed to Reuters the detail of the intercepts, but there has been no independent corroboration. This video can not be played Commander in tweets: What we can learn from Trump's Twitter How much has Trump achieved so far? What has Trump said about your country? Trump's promises before and after election The officials spoken to by the Post said that Mr Kislyak could have exaggerated the account, and cited a Justice Department spokesperson who repeated that Mr Sessions did not discuss interference in the election. But the Post's story was the focus of one of many tweets the US president fired off on Saturday morning. ""A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions. These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!"" Mr Trump said. The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who hasbeen an occasional sparring partner for Mr Trump. ""Comey"" refers to James Comey, the former FBI boss Mr Trump fired. Earlier this week, Mr Trump told the New York Times he regretted hiring Mr Sessions because he had stepped away from overseeing an inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. Mr Sessions recused himself in March amid pressure over his meetings with Mr Kislyak. He says he plans to continue in his role as attorney general. This video can not be played Sessions said he loved the job and the department Several other regular targets for Mr Trump featured in his series of tweets. He accused the ""failing"" New York Times of foiling an attempt to assassinate the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It is not clear what Mr Trump was referring to, but on Saturday a US general complained on Fox News that a ""good lead"" on Baghdadi was leaked to a national newspaper in 2015. A New York Times report at the time revealed that valuable information had been extracted from a raid, but the paper stressed on Saturday that no-one had taken issue with their reporting until now. And Mr Trump again urged Republicans to ""step up to the plate"" and repeal and replace President Obama's healthcare reforms,a key campaign pledge of his that has collapsed in Congress.

"The hospital said ""unacceptable behaviour"" had been recorded ""within the hospital"" Staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital have received death threats over the treatment of baby Charlie Gard. The hospital said,externalpolice had been called after families were ""harassed"" and ""unacceptable behaviour"" was recorded in the hospital. It is involved in alegal battle to remove life support,externalfrom the 11-month-old, who has a rare genetic disorder. His parents Connie Yates and Chris Gard said they did not condone abuse and had also faced ""nasty and hurtful remarks"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt saidon Twitter,externalalthough Charlie's case was ""sad and complex"", this behaviour was ""totally unacceptable"". Charlie, who was born on 4 August 2016, has a form of mitochondrial disease, a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and irreversible brain damage, and his parents want to take him to the US for pioneering treatment. Connie Yates and Chris Gard want Charlie to receive an experimental therapy called nucleoside They have lost a succession of court cases to overturn the hospital's decision that it would be in the best interest of the child to be allowed to die with dignity. The latest court battle involves new testimony from a US neurologist who hasvisited Charlie in hospitalto decide whether he should travel to America for therapy. Charlie's parents want to take him to New York for experimental treatment, which the US doctor said might give him a10% chance of improving his health. Mary MacLeod, chairman of Great Ormond Street Hospital, said in a statement that Charlie's case was ""a heartbreaking one"", adding the hospital understood the ""natural sympathy people feel with his situation"". However, in recent weeks the hospital community had been subjected to a ""shocking and disgraceful tide of hostility and disturbance,"" she said. Charlie has a rare genetic condition and is on life support She added: ""Staff have received abuse both in the street and online. ""Thousands of abusive messages have been sent to doctors and nurses whose life's work is to care for sick children. ""Many of these messages are menacing, including death threats. ""Families have been harassed and discomforted while visiting their children, and we have received complaints of unacceptable behaviour even within the hospital itself."" Ms MacLeod, who also chairs the hospital's clinical ethics committee, said ""there can be no excuse"" for patients, families and staff ""to have their privacy and peace disturbed"". In a statement issued through a spokeswoman, Charlie's parents said: ""We don't condone abusive or threatening behaviour to GOSH staff or anybody in connection with our son. ""We too get abuse and have to endure nasty and hurtful remarks on a daily basis. ""People have different opinions and we accept that but there is a line that shouldn't be crossed as it makes a stressful situation worse and is very upsetting for all involved.""

"Casper Read was travelling alone to grandparents in Toulouse, France The mother of a boy taken off a plane at Gatwick due to a lack of seats is demanding EasyJet overhaul its ticketing process. Casper Read, 15, was travelling alone to grandparents in France when he was asked to leave the plane after a man was allocated the same seat. Stephanie Portal, from Worthing, West Sussex, said her son felt ""he had been kicked off and cheated"". EasyJet has apologised, offered compensation and is investigating. ""There was him and an adult for one seat and the adult was getting very angry about it all,"" Miss Portal said. ""I don't know if it was a random selection, or if they thought Casper would be the easier option to get off the plane, but it's wrong. ""He was asked to go to the cockpit - thinking he would be allocated another seat - but before he knew it, was taken outside the plane and told to go to the information desk. ""He was left to make his own way through the airport, nobody in departures to meet or help him, and despite there being three more flights that day was put on the latest one and had a 10 hour wait."" Casper Read had to wait 10 hours for the last flight of the day Miss Portal said a manager at EasyJet told her the airline overbooks its flights by up to five seats due to people often not showing up, and that it was the last people to check-in, not the last to buy their tickets, who were in danger of not getting a seat. ""The whole system needs an overhaul and the attitude of the attendants was irresponsible,"" she said. ""Children should never be pulled off a flight and the people who are should be given priority on the next one. ""Airlines cannot gamble on the probability of people not turning up."" ""Casper is quite laid back but he really felt he had been kicked off and cheated,"" she added. A spokesman for the airline said: ""EasyJet is sorry that Casper Read's flight from London Gatwick to Toulouse was overbooked on 20 July. ""We are investigating why he was able to board the aircraft as he should have been informed at the gate.

"This video can not be played Former chief whip Baroness Armstrong says Jeremy Corbyn was ""the greatest rebel ever"" A former Labour chief whip has urged Jeremy Corbyn to ""reflect"" on Tony Blair's approach when party leader by ruling out the de-selection of MPs. Baroness Hilary Armstrong told the BBC Mr Corbyn was ""the greatest rebel ever"" as a backbencher but Mr Blair was reluctant to discipline him. She said the then prime minister felt that Labour was ""a broad church"". Amid claims Mr Corbyn's opponents could be forced out, Baroness Armstrong said he needed to show he is ""tolerant"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour, Baroness Armstrong said she was pleased theLabour party chairman Ian Lavery had said de-selection was not the way forward. But she added: ""I know MPs where basically there is a process of harassment, where at every meeting they are criticised, they are challenged, they are told that they don't represent the people in the room. ""And all this is meant to do is grind them down, is wear them down, and get them to believe they shouldn't be in the Labour party any more."" Labour bids to calm de-selection row Corbyn sacks three over single market vote She said ""sectarianism"" was ""ruling"" in some areas. Baroness Armstrong added: ""Jeremy has the opportunity over the summer and at party conference to make it absolutely clear that he is not going to lead a narrow sectarian faction, he's going to lead a broad church that is tolerant. ""And the real test for Jeremy is, is he up to it?"" Mr Corbyn voted against his own government more than 500 times and Baroness Armstrong said at the time there was upset among party members in his Islington North constituency, ""I had a couple of folk from Jeremy's constituency come to see me and say 'People are a bit upset with Jeremy always being against the Labour government, what if we try to de-select him?'"". She advised them they would not be supported by the leadership. Baroness Armstrong said: ""The prime minister was very clear about that when Jeremy was a backbench MP. And he was right, we shouldn't have worked to de-select him. ""But I hope that Jeremy will now reflect on that and I hope that he will be absolutely determined to make sure it doesn't happen under his watch.""

"The ITV documentary in which Princes William and Harry talk about the death of their mother, Princess Diana, is the lead for several of the Sunday papers. They focus on the Princes' recollections of their final phone call with her, hours before she died in the Paris car crash - and their regret that they didn't speak for longer. ""Last call with Mum haunts us"", is theSunday Mirror's,externalheadline, and it's a similar theme for theStar on Sunday.,external The Mail on Sunday's coverage extends to 10 inside pages and includes a number of newly-released pictures. One of them - of a young Prince Harry being cuddled by his mother during a family holiday - appears on the front pages of theSunday Times,externaland theSunday Telegraph.,external The open letter by more than 40 of the BBC's top female presenters to the corporation's director-general, Lord Hall, calling on him to act now to close the gender pay gap, is widely covered - and makes the lead for theTelegraph.,external The paper has the headline: ""Revolt of the BBC women"".

"Former Great British Bake Off hosts Mel and Sue are to host the return of BBC classic show The Generation Game. It has been commissioned for an initial four-episode run, although a launch date has yet to be set. ""It's a cuddly toy, it's a toaster, it's a circular power saw, no it's Mel and Sue doing the Generation Game! We can't believe it, we are so excited!"" the hosts said. The new show will combine aspects of the original series with new games. Perkins hadhinted earlier this monthon Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that the presenting duo might reunite for another TV project soon, after quitting The Great British Bake Off last year when the BBC lost the rights to Channel 4. ""I'm very hopeful Mel and I will do some pratting about, but I couldn't tell you exactly what yet. Possibly some prime-time pratting,"" she told Kirsty Young. 'We won Generation Game with a war dance' BBC Studios said audiences had identified the Generation Game as ""the TV show that viewers most wanted to see back on their screens"". The show sees pairs of family members across generations take part in performance and task-based games, with the ultimate goal of facing the Conveyor Belt. This is a memory test whereby the winning pair watches prizes pass on the belt before attempting to remember each one to win it, from household appliances to the infamous cuddly toy. Sir Bruce Forsyth fronted the Generation Game from 1971-77 and again from 1990-94 All the family pairs will start the show in the studio audience and only find out which game they are playing when Mel and Sue announce them. A panel of star judges will score the pairs after each game and decide which will get to face the Conveyor Belt. Charlotte Moore, the director of BBC content, said: ""The Generation Game is an iconic BBC One show, so to be able to bring it back for today's audience with Mel and Sue overseeing things is a wonderful moment for the channel."" Larry Grayson and Jim Davidson have also presented the Generation Game One-off editions of the show were hosted by Vernon Kay in 2011 and Graham Norton in 2005 The Generation Game began on BBC One in 1971, with Sir Bruce Forsyth as its longest-serving host. The entertainer fronted the show for two spells from 1971 to 1977 and 1990 to 1994. The Generation Game was presented by Larry Grayson between 1978 and 1982 and Jim Davidson from 1995 to 2002. There have also been two one-off editions of the show. Graham Norton presented a Christmas edition in 2005, while Vernon Kay took charge of a version for Comic Relief in 2011. In 2014, one of the contestants on the Comic Relief special, Miranda Hart, wasreported to be in talks to host a revival herself. The announcement of the show's revival with Mel and Sue was described by comedianSusan Calman on Twitter as ""smashing"",external, while Sally-Ann Burgontweeted,external: ""Just perfect, literally just the most perfect ""regeneration"" of a show"".

"Beverly Martin has defected to the Conservative Party UKIP has lost overall control of the only local authority it runs following the defection of one of its councillors to the Conservatives. The loss of Beverly Martin means the party only holds 27 seats on Thanet District Council while the other parties combined hold 28. Ms Martin said she joined the Tories after UKIP failed to make ""significant change"". UKIP party members have condemned her decision to leave. UKIP councillor Stuart Piper said: ""I don't think anyone could doubt her care and concern for Ramsgate as a town, but in a sense she's just thrown away the only job she had to coordinate town promotion."" In October 2015 five councillors defected from the UK's first UKIP authority due to concerns over the council's lack of action over Manston Airport. However, the party regained control in 2016 following a by-election. Councillor Stuart Piper, UKIP, said Ms Martin had ""thrown away"" an opportunity Ms Martin has swapped allegiance twice before - from UKIP to DIG Alliance and then back to UKIP. Speaking about this occasion, she said: ""There has to be a very good reason for making a political change. ""The first one when I became an independent was specifically on the issue of Manston. ""We had the opportunity to be a flagship council, that is a very rare privilege and I really had enormous hopes that we would make significant changes on social issues, development and economic issues. Frankly we haven't, not as UKIP. ""It's Craig Mackinlay, our MP for South Thanet who invited me last year to form a group for assessing what we might do with the port and the beaches, that came from the Conservatives. ""That is where the energy is coming from."" In the June general election UKIP's vote fell by 26.4% in South Thanet and 21.2% in North Thanet - leaving them with just 6% and 4.5% of the vote. Rajdeep Sandhum -Political Reporter, BBC Radio Kent First the local elections and the party loses every seat, then the General Election and it fails to win any seat. Now it's lost the only council it controls in the country. It's been a rough ride for the party's councillors and members. They still don't know who'll lead the party nationally. Councillor Beverly Martin says she's always been a Conservative at heart and that joining the group felt like a ""homecoming"". But what of the voters? Did they know that underneath the purple rosette was a blue one? UKIP group leader Chris Wells told me wasn't surprised by the news, which he heard first from press. He said they'd been there before and they'd get through it again. This isn't the first time he's lost his majority. Nor is it the first time she's left UKIP. There will undoubtedly, as there always is, when a politician changes sides be calls for a by-election. But it doesn't sound like Councillor Martin will step down before the election in two years time. She says she'll still be fighting for the things she stood for.

"US actor Dick Van Dyke has apologised for what he called his ""atrocious Cockney accent"" in Mary Poppins, more than half a century after he played Bert the chimney sweep in the 1964 film. But the peculiarities of UK accents seem notoriously hard for foreign actors to master - so who also stands out for their bad British delivery? Van Dyke, who is from the US state of Missouri, said he had been teased for years over his Cockney accent in Mary Poppins. The 91-year-old wasrecently announced,externalas the recipient of a Bafta Britannia award for his work in TV, and said of the accolade: ""I appreciate this opportunity to apologise to the members of Bafta for inflicting on them the most atrocious Cockney accent in the history of cinema."" He recently announced that he would be doing a repeat performance in song and dance for theMary Poppins sequel, due out next year. New York-native Anne Hathaway's Yorkshire accent in One Day was deemed ""honkingly rubbish"" by the Telegraph, although a more sympathetic Guardian reviewerwrote,externalthat it was ""not as terrible as all that"". At the time, Hathaway told AP news agency about the difficulty of learning the accent: ""I was so nervous about it that I can't actually watch it for myself, but a lot of people who I trust... have told me that I have nothing to worry about."" Russell Brand attempted a Birmingham accent as Lonny Barnett, the sidekick of club owner Dennis Dupree, in the 2012 adaptation of the musical Rock Of Ages. Brand, from Essex, said he adopted the Brummie brogue as a nod to Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne. Commentators said Brand's performance took some getting used to, with theMetro,externalwriting it ""should get him banned from Birmingham"". ""They may take away our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"" Braveheart gained cult status for telling the story of the 13th Century Scottish warrior William Wallace, played by Australian-American Mel Gibson. Although his Scottish accentleft locals less than convinced, the film went to win five Oscars in 1996. Californian Kevin Costner's attempt at an English accent as Robin Hood in Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves has been widely mocked - not least in Mel Brooks's 1993 spoof Robin Hood: Men In Tights. In that film, British lead actor Cary Elwes quipped: ""Unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent."" Another bad Cockney was Don Cheadle's Basher Tarr, a munitions expert who used rhyming slang. Cheadle - like Dick van Dyke, from Missouri - later apologised for his accent in the three Ocean's films, telling an awards ceremony in LA in 2008: ""Forgive me! I won't do it again!"" He is known for his clipped English tones in the King's Speech and as Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice (above) - but Colin Firth's Texan accent in a US drama left some Americans confused, with his drawl deemed ""laughably bad"" in the US press.

"More people will be able to donate blood more easily under the new rules Blood donation rules for sex workers and gay men are being relaxed in England and Scotland after improvements in the accuracy of testing procedures. Men who have sex with men can now give blood three months after their last sexual activity instead of 12. And sex workers, who were previously barred from donating, now can, subject to the same three-month rule. Experts said the move would give more people the opportunity to donate blood without affecting blood supply safety. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs - which advises UK health departments - recommended the changes after concluding that new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules. All blood that is donated in the UK undergoes a mandatory test for Hepatitis B and C, and HIV, plus a couple of other viruses. Scientists agree that three months is a comfortably long window for a virus or infection to appear and be picked up in the blood. Prof James Neuberger, from the committee, said: ""Technologies to pick up the presence of the virus have greatly improved, so we can now pick up viruses at a much earlier stage in the infection, and therefore it's much easier to tell if a blood donor has the virus."" The rule changes will come into force at blood donation centres in Scotland in November, and in early 2018 in England. The changes affect groups including: men who have sex with other men people who have sex with high-risk partners - for example, those who have been in areas where HIV is common commercial sex workers. They will now all be able to donate blood after abstaining from sex for three months. The UK government is also considering relaxing the rules for people who have undergone acupuncture, piercing, tattooing and endoscopies, and for those with a history of non-prescribed injecting drug use. But these also need changes to current EU legislation. Alex Phillips, blood donations policy lead at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the changes were a ""victory for science over stigmatising assumptions"", adding: ""The evidence suggests three months is the right amount of time."" She told BBC One's Breakfast that the lifetime donation ban for sex industry workers was based on ""preconceptions rather than evidence"". Deborah Gold, chief executive of National Aids Trust, said the new rules were a ""huge advance"" for gay and bisexual men - who can now donate three months from their last sexual activity. Ms Gold said: ""We are also delighted that NHS Blood and Transplant have said they will now investigate how possible it is for some gay men, depending on degree of risk, to donate without even the three-month deferral."" NHS Blood and Transplant said there was not currently a shortage of blood in the UK but 200,000 new donors were needed every year to replenish supplies. It said there was a particular need for more people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to give blood.

"HMP Hewell has about 1,000 adult male prisoners at its closed site A prison officer was taken to hospital with minor injuries after an ""incident"" at HMP Hewell. Specially trained prison security teams arrived at the prison near Redditch in Worcestershire late on Saturday night. The Prison Service said a ""small number"" of inmates at the category B jail were involved in the disturbance. Prison authorities are now back in full control of the affected wing and the matter has been referred to West Mercia Police. Men shouting and swearing, as well as banging and dogs barking, could be heard coming from the prison. Specialist security squads, equipped to deal with riots, arrived at the site in unmarked vans at about 19:30 BST. HMP Hewell is surrounded by farmland and houses about 1,000 inmates - including some category A remand prisoners. Inan inspection reportpublished in January, Hewell was described as ""a prison with many challenges and areas of serious concern"". Peter Clarke, chief inspector of prisons, said the ""main concerns"" were regarding ""issues of safety and respect"". He said levels of violence were ""far too high"", communal areas were ""dirty"" and many cells were overcrowded.

"Retired nurse Christine Hughes preparing for the arrival of the refugee family They have donated time, skills, money and even a house in a bid to be allowed to help a family of refugees resettle in the UK. But, as the Home Officeannounces Â£1m,externalto help more communities sponsor refugees, just how much work was it for one group of retirees, part and full-time workers to pull together and take responsibility for a family? Christine Hughes kept seeing pictures and videos on Facebook of Syrian refugees and their desperate bids to get to the UK. And she wanted to help. ""I was hearing the most awful stories and just not sleeping,"" mother-of-four and grandmother Mrs Hughes said. ""If I started thinking about it before I went to sleep, that was it, I just couldn't sleep, because I knew what people were suffering right at that moment while there I was in my cosy bed."" No longer wanting to feel helpless, she and a few other people held a meeting in the Pembrokeshire town of Narberth to discuss what they could do. A year later and she has finally achieved her goal - to resettle a refugee family in the picturesque market town. It is one of 10 to have brought a group of refugees to the UK under a schemeintroduced in July 2016,external. It means community can take responsibility for resettling up to three refugee families - supporting their move here by setting up accommodation for them, helping them to learn English and eventually find jobs. The vast majority of the 20,000 Syrian refugees the UK hascommitted to take in,externalhave come through the support of local councils. But community groups have sponsored 53 refugees in the last year. Narbeth has a population of 2,000, according to the last census The scheme was modelled on the successful Canadian Private Sponsorship scheme which has resettledmore than 200,000 refugees since it was introduced in 1978,external. But the group calledCroeso Arberth,external- meaning Narberth Welcome - said it had not been straight-forward. It had to raise Â£4,500 as insurance to cover each of the seven supported refugees, which is kept in a separate bank account for emergencies, as well as having Â£6,000 in the bank to cover the cost of things like interpreters, transport from the airport and a Â£200 allowance for each member of the family - given in small amounts for six weeks while they wait for their applications for benefits to go through. A house had to be found, English lessons arranged, schools contacted and extensive Home Office forms filled in - and that was just to start. Listen to Croeso Arberth prepare to welcome the family of refugees on BBC Radio Wales'Eye on Wales programme TheUK government website,externalhas information about how to sponsor a family of vulnerable refugees to resettle in the UK Retired nurse Mrs Hughes said: ""I had absolutely no idea of the amount of time I was going to have to donate to it. ""I have got a house I rent out, my mother is 93, I have got three horses, I've got four children, two of who have got grandchildren, and have a few little jobs cleaning guest houses, so I'm tearing myself away from different situations, just trying to cope, really. ""Halfway through the process I did think 'what am I doing', but thinking we were nearly there is what has kept me going."" The group, which has a core of 12 people with around 100 more who have expressed a desire to help, has committed to support the resettled family for a year, and be responsible for their housing - paid for with housing benefits - for two years. Mrs Hughes said: ""I started off as an email pusher - just keeping people informed about meetings and fund-raising events. Then I started doing practical things like phoning up the schools, I went to the police, I went to the doctors."" Group tidying up the garden of the house where the refugees will be living Shortly after she and other members of the group wrote an action plan for the Home Office - a plan that has been revised multiple times since the application first went in. Jill Simpson, who works part-time at Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, liaised with the Home Office on behalf of Croeso Arberth throughout the negotiations. She said: ""I spent months sitting at my computer, pulling together all sorts of information, writing documents. At times it felt as if it was being made very difficult, but I think that, on reflection, it is because it is such a new scheme and the Home Office people have been feeling their way as well. ""There was a lot of support, but you needed to get through this nitty gritty bureaucracy."" Meet the family at the airport Provide a warm welcome Provide housing Help access medical and social services English language tuition Support towards employment and self-sufficiency Information fromHome Office,external The group needed approval from local council Pembrokeshire to go ahead with the application, as well as getting approval from Citizens UK, who acted as the lead sponsor - with legal responsibility to make sure everything runs as it should. Finding housing was extremely complicated. Mrs Simpson said: ""We had to describe the house to the Home Office, and it had to be available, but we didn't know how long it would take until we had a family, and that was really difficult because if you think about it no landlord is going to want to sit with a house empty waiting for a family to arrive at an unspecified time."" Oshi Owen has turned her former family home over to the refugee family But the group struck lucky when local Oshi Owen, who was thinking about moving from her five-bedroom house in Narberth, heard the group were looking for somewhere for the refugee family. Ms Owen said: ""I had thought about moving in September, but when the group were looking for somewhere for a family of refugees I just said I will somehow manage it and make it work and committed to move out by April."" She will be paid rent through housing benefit, although she said it is below what she could get for the house if it was privately rented. The group initially thought they might be able to have the family arrive in April and eventually the arrival date became July. Ms Owen said: ""I had to accept that for three months there wasn't going to be any rent coming in. ""But I would rather help people than it being about the money. It is about giving something to those in need."" She left some furniture in the house for the new tenants, while the community group cleared the garden and cleaned in preparation. Croeso Arberth had a small welcome party at the airport to meet the family of seven Ms Owen said neighbours were ""shocked"" to hear who was moving in, but ""really want to make the family welcome"". With the house spick and span there was a nervous wait before the refugees arrived on 13 July. As they walked through arrivals at Birmingham Airport they were greeted by a welcome party of interpreters and members of Croeso Arberth clutching balloons, chocolates and a big sign between them. BBC Wales have agreed not to identify Narberth's newest Syrian residents - but we can say they are an extended family of seven from a refugee camp in the Middle East. ""I can't believe it is all over with now,"" Mrs Hughes said. ""I would never have expected it to be such a big thing to undertake, but I feel like the family are going to be fine, and it is the start of a new chapter now with them here. Things will go wrong, but we will just have to play it by ear."" Croeso Arberth have plans to sponsor another group of refugees in the near future, but hope it will be easier next time. Mrs Hughes added: ""Because we have been one of the first groups to do this it has been a learning curve for us and the Home Office, but hopefully they will be able to do things faster for other groups and it will all move along a bit quicker. ""Obviously I still think about the people still in refugee camps, but I know I cannot do any more than I have done and am doing.""

"A slim figure, housework skills, and the need to be rescued by a man are some of the attributes often associated with Disney princesses. But behind the clichÃ©s, the characters can also demonstrate determination, compassion, ambition - and fearlessness. The England women's football team believes the traits of Disney princesses are exactly what you need to be come a successful player. The Football Association (FA) has joined with Disney on a campaign that focuses on the character's strong attributes - to encourage more young females into football. Striker Nikita Parris said: ""My favourite Disney princess is Ariel from The Little Mermaid because she was fearless. ""I was the same when it came to playing football with the boys in my home town. I had to be determined in order to make it."" Captain Steph Houghton added: ""Being brave, being strong and being kind are all important attributes when it comes to building a successful team. ""They are all qualities that girls can learn from Disney princesses."" But can modern girls pick up anything from the likes of Disney's 80-year-old Snow White - who cleans up after a bunch of men and needs a prince to save her? England striker Nikita Parris says Ariel's fearless character was an inspiration Current Miss England Stephanie Hill, 22, thinks they can. She dresses up as Disney princesses for children at Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice near Sheffield. She believes Disney princesses, both old and modern, can be positive role models for young women. ""I think the more vintage Disney princesses that are scrutinised, like Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, who people depict as waiting for success to come to them, can be inspirational. ""In the end they had similar drive. They wanted a better life and it just so happened male figures came into that. ""The famous quote is Cinderella didn't ask for a prince, she asked for a night off and a dress. ""Every single Disney princess has had to go through trouble to get where they want to be. ""They show the struggle and that you can get through the other side with enough work and support and a positive can-do attitude."" Stephanie, who dresses up as Cinderella to visit children, believes princesses are an inspiration Over the years, Disney has moved away from depicting its princesses as delicate and demure. The late 1980s saw an ambitious mermaid Ariel defy her dad to achieve her dream of becoming a human - even if she did sacrifice her voice for a man. Belle in Beauty and the Beast and Jasmine in Aladdin had an independent streak, while Mulan showed women could fight just as well as men - if not better. In 2009, Tiana became Disney's first black princess and 2012's Merida from Brave showed off an adventurous spirit and a love of archery. Despite not being official Disney princesses, Frozen's Elsa and Anna have been praised for putting sisterhood at the heart of their happiness. And Disney's newest female heroine Moana was depicted with an average body type and without a love interest. Disney's latest female heroine Moana is considered a positive role model Suzie Longstaff, headteacher of the all-girls Putney High School in south-west London, has done assemblies about empowering girls through Disney princesses. She says: ""Disney have come a long away, and my two children have grown up with Elsa and Anna and Moana and Ariel. They are all so much better female role models. ""They have traits that the FA is extolling, and any way we can empower girls to believe in themselves through role modelling they recognise and enjoy is fantastic. ""My five-year-old is permanently dressed as Moana at the moment. I think she is a great strong girl who can stand up for herself."" However, Mrs Longstaff thinks some of the older Disney princesses do not portray strong female characteristics. ""I said to the girls at school that the one role model I wish my girls wouldn't dress up as is Cinderella. ""She sits around for years for her prince to come along and in this day and age we can't encourage girls to do that. They must go out and stand up for themselves. ""Disney and the FA are on the road but there is a long way to go to completely equalise the perception of female and male role models as well as diversity."" Disney's Princess Tiana's ambition was to open her own restaurant Disney appears to be keen to move away from focusing on the stereotypes of what makes a princess. Last year it launched aten-point checklist,externalof what it takes to be a Disney princess - and it didn't include the need to wear a tiara or a ball gown. Instead, they included being honest, trying your best and never giving up. Siobhan Corria, head of inclusion for charity Action for Children, says there is a role for the more modern Disney princesses in inspiring young women. However, she believes there are more contemporary role models girls can aspire to. ""I think that more recent Disney characters that don't fit gender stereotypes are inspirational for young girls in terms of achieving things,"" she says. ""It's good to see Disney keep up with the changing times. ""But I'd prefer organisations like Disney to really be shattering the gender stereotypes as much as possible and give both genders non-traditional roles as a way of inspiring people.""

"This photograph of Tewkesbury Abbey became a defining image of the 2007 floods The summer of 2007 was the wettest on record. There was 414mm of rainfall across England and Wales from May to July - more than in any period since records began in 1766. Across Yorkshire and the Midlands, thousands of people were rescued, whole towns cut off and families forced to flee their properties. In late July, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire became the latest parts of England to be inundated. Flooding left 48,000 homes without power for two days, and 10,000 motorists were stranded on the M5 overnight. In Tewkesbury, the whole town became cut off and the RAF and Army were drafted in to help with the relief effort. Three people died. An aerial photograph of the town and its famous abbey, depicting an island surrounded by a sea of brown water, became one of the defining images of thatmost sodden of summers. Ten years on, the BBC revisits some of those caught up in the flooding. Sheila Heath ended up living in a caravan outside her flood-hit Tewkesbury home for seven months The day - 20 July - had started off like any other. But while at work, where she was a partner at a lettings firm in Cheltenham, Sheila Heath noticed the drains ""bubbling"" up with water from the torrential rainfall. She knew immediately something was ""seriously wrong"", so she sent her staff home and tried to make her way back to Tewkesbury but was forced to abandon her journey and stay with a friend. When she made it home the following morning, Mrs Heath, now 63, arrived to find her house had been inundated. She had to wade through waist-deep water to get to her front door. ""The whole area was like a lake,"" she recalls. ""There was somebody coming up the road in a canoe; it was totally surreal."" It was six days before the water subsided, during which time the family lived at a nearby bed and breakfast. With their house uninhabitable, they bought a caravan and pitched it outside, remaining there for seven months. The Army transports emergency drinking water supplies in Tewkesbury on 24 July 2007 With many in the street doing the same, it became ""like a caravan site"", she said. The cost of the damage - which was covered by the insurers - was Â£98,000, but many treasured possessions were irreplaceable. ""It was what we had built up all our married life, it was our home, all of our personal possessions,"" said Mrs Heath. ""It's still upsetting to this day. ""Everything you've built up over your life is just gone. All the photographs have gone, all the memories, gifts from the children, all your personal things have gone."" Sheila Heath says the flooding has had a lasting impact on her life Surface water and river flooding affected more than 55,000 homes and businesses across the country 7,000 people were rescued 17,000 families had to leave their homes 13 people died Estimates made shortly after the floods put the total losses at about Â£4bn, of which insurable losses were reported to be about Â£3bn Source: Environment Agency Tewkesbury was cut off on 22 July 2007 It was after saying afternoon prayers on 20 July 2007, that the Reverend Canon Paul Williams, the vicar of Tewkesbury Abbey, first became aware something unusual was happening. ""I noticed that the rain hadn't stopped all day,"" he said. ""I felt an eerie feeling so I went out up to the borough council and the mayor was there. He said 'we've been warned something serious is on the way and will we open the abbey to make sure it's a place of refuge'."" Drivers caught in the downpour slept in the abbey, with hundreds put up that Friday night. Paul Williams says the community is moving forwards following the flooding ""People were sleeping on kneelers, one family was wrapped in an altar cloth,"" he said. ""During that night lots of people were up and making sure that people using the abbey as refuge were looked after."" The rain had cleared on Saturday and those stranded were able to leave the abbey, which was even able to host a wedding ceremony. But on Sunday 22 July the rivers broke. ""The abbey changed from being an ark to being an icon of resilience,"" said Canon Williams. ""It was like a ship ploughing through the waters. It was an icon of hope."" It was that Sunday the famous photographs of Tewkesbury Abbey, standing proudly above the floodwater, were taken. They went on to become some of the most enduring images of that summer's floods. ""Someone once said it was one of the iconic images, like St Paul's in the Blitz, it's that type of image that will remain with people. You need icons to give you hope; the abbey gave us hope at that time,"" said Canon Williams. It looks like a lake - but this is actually Tewkesbury's flooded park During the Gloucestershire town's short spell as an ""island"", the sense of community spirit shone through. ""There was an extraordinary feeling of camaraderie, particularly after the rivers broke - we were helping each other, making sure people were OK. There wasn't fear, there was respect. ""You couldn't get in or out. We were completely cut off. We got on with our business."" Remarkably, the abbey came away relatively unscathed. The same could not be said for the rest of Tewkesbury. More than 800 properties were flooded that July - largely by surface water and some smaller tributaries, before the Rivers Avon and Severn rose to record levels. During the same period, the Mythe Water Treatment Works also flooded, leaving half the homes in Gloucestershire without water for 17 days. And while it took years for the town to fully recover, Canon Williams says the community is ""moving forward together"". ""Of course that's part of our history, but we are looking to the future."" Upton upon Severn, which is about seven miles north of Tewkesbury over the border in Worcestershire, was also badly hit by the floods Grahame Bunn, landlord of the Kings Head pub in Upton upon Severn, was gearing up for the town's blues festival when the rain started. ""The Environment Agency had said on the Wednesday that there was a possibility the river would flood, [but] this was the summer - we thought the Environment Agency was talking of their bottom,"" he said. The Worcestershire town was supposed to be protected by temporary flood barriers, he said, and thousands of pounds worth of stock was sitting in his cellar. ""They said the barriers would go up on Friday, [but the] rivers started rising late Thursday."" It was too late to save his stock; the pub flooded waist-high with water. His wife Claire, their son and three dogs were among those taken by boat through the floodwater. Grahame Bunn's wife Claire and their dogs were among those rescued by boat during the flooding in Upton upon Severn The pub closed for four months and did not fully reopen until February 2008. ""It just devastated not only my business, but the whole of the town,"" said Mr Bunn, 58. ""I don't think it has ever recovered."" While the Bunn family, who lived above the pub, were able to remain there as repairs were carried out, hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage was caused. Mr Bunn got a job working on the gravel barges on the river as the family had no income while the Kings Head was closed. ""We bought the pub in 2000 and knew there was a possibility it was going to flood,"" he said. ""We had flooded many times before 2007, but this time it was different - we weren't able to reopen."" Mr Bunn, who now runs the nearby Ye Olde Anchor Inn, believes improved flood defences installed over the past decade mean the scenes of 2007 will not be witnessed again. ""Hopefully, the horrendous flooding of this town will be a thing of the past."" Claire Bunn and her husband Grahame, pictured behind the pub, in July 2017 Catherine Mackie reporting from the scene of flooding in Herefordshire in the summer of 2007 Anyone who experienced the great flood of July 2007 has a story to tell. I was soaked to the skin, shivering with cold and stranded in a pub car park in Herefordshire. Inside the pub there was a small crowd of people who'd abandoned their cars on the roads-turned-rivers, resigned to spending an uncomfortable night with strangers. Our satellite truck had died after the last live broadcast so I bunked down with the crew Andy and Brian in a caravan kindly donated by the landlady. The rain continued to hammer down on the roof with the noise occasionally drowned out by Brian's snoring. Homes and businesses were badly damaged by the floods in Evesham Floods had been a fairly frequent occurrence in the south-west Midlands, with fire stations in Evesham, Hereford and Worcester equipped with boats to cope with water rescues. But nothing could prepare crews for the rain of July 2007. Firefighter Dave Hunt was on duty when his team received the call that Sedgeberrow, near Evesham, was flooding. ""There was a lot of rain so we were having a number of calls and then the call came in to Sedgeberrow,"" he said. Two boats were sent to the village from Worcester fire station. A water rescue is carried out in Evesham Crews arrived to discover two men on the roof of a Ford Transit van. ""They were clinging on to the roof and the van was submerged,"" recalls Mr Hunt. ""We launched the boats and the priority was to save them and bring them back to land."" Some rescues proved tricky, with crews unable to see house numbers or road names and, with lives on the line, decisions had to be made to prioritise those at greatest risk. ""We made several rescues of people and pets, there were about 90 flooded homes and we made rescues from 30 of the houses,"" added Mr Hunt. ""The most memorable rescue which we carried out was in liaison with the RAF helicopter of a pregnant lady and her toddler. They were trapped in floodwater. ""The RAF Sea King lowered and winched down. The toddler was rescued on a board. The winchman entered the bedroom and harnessed the pregnant lady and they both got winched up into the helicopter."" He described the floods as on a scale never seen before. ""People were scared for their lives [and] I would say a number of them were in danger of losing their lives,"" said Mr Hunt. ""We had never dealt with anything like it. That's the worst I've ever seen.""  Summer of floods: The 'forgotten city' Environment Agency Â© 2025 BBC.

"Dominic Hurley is regularly mistaken for being drunk and it has led to him getting arrested. His slurred speech and poor balance is actually a result of a brain injury caused by a moped crash while he worked abroad. In 1994, Hurley, then 21, went on a rare night out with his colleagues. He had been studying for a degree in hotel management and was on a year's placement at a hotel near Ayia Napa in Cyprus. The group had been out for some food and drinks but were tired and called an early end to the night. They travelled back to their accommodation on rented mopeds. ""I had the slowest one and was at the back,"" he says. ""I must have fallen asleep or hit a pothole or lost concentration, I don't know, but I tumbled off and I wasn't wearing a helmet."" Hurley hit his head and ended up in hospital for months. His parents were told he probably wouldn't walk or talk again. He had been in Cyprus for just seven weeks. Dominic Hurley was flown back to the UK by the air ambulance days after the crash ""It totally changed me. I was in a coma for three months but I wasn't fully aware of things for at least a year. ""At 21 I had everything going in life, I was into sports, going out, and it all changed. It's like I've got two lives - I've got one until I was 21 and I've got one afterwards."" Hurley, who now lives in Rotherham, defied the doctors' expectations and did walk and talk again, but 23 years after the crash he continues to live with paralysis on his right-side and has learned to write with his left hand. His speech is slurred and he finds organising his life difficult. His memory has also been significantly impaired. He can remember snapshots of his time in Cyprus but has a total blank of the accident and the following 12 months of recovery. He says he can only remember ""bits and bobs"" from his childhood and even then he can't be sure if he's fabricated the memories from photographs. ""There's no time or place to my memories. My brain and memory are like a brick wall where you throw bits of mud at it - some of it sticks, some slide off and other ones bounce off."" Other symptoms of his brain injury have got him into trouble with the law as he can appear drunk and his agitation quickly escalates. ""I am a very nice person but I've been arrested three times,"" he says. The first arrest was during a trip to Torquay when he complained about a meal at an Indian restaurant. The food was ""awful"", he says, and had attempted to convey the point calmly to the staff. ""I tried to explain but they locked the door and said I had to pay. They phoned the police, then I had an argument with the police and I sounded drunk and I was probably stumbling a bit. ""I was thrown in the back of the van and put in a cell. It wasn't until the morning that I could explain."" The second time, Hurley was in a taxi with friends when the driver demanded payment before he would drive them anywhere. Dominic with his parents Anne and Bill They tried to explain their friend's situation but say the police were called and Hurley was ""yanked out the car"" and taken into custody due to what they thought was drunken behaviour. ""They're not like police cells in The Bill or cells you see on TV,"" Hurley  says. ""There's excrement on the walls. They make my problems even worse when I'm cold and I get migraines."" He says the three arrests have seen him separated from friends, dragged from cars, and his hands forced behind his back - harsh treatment that made him feel like a ""common criminal"". ""Each time I was just seen as another drunk. I wasn't given much of an interview at all."" The BBC contacted the National Police Chiefs' Council but it said it could not comment on the care Hurley received. The third time he was arrested Hurley had been in close proximity to a fight at a pub, but this time he had a trick up his sleeve. He had been issued with a Brain Injury Identification Card, an initiative from Headway, which describes the side effects he might display. ""The police went through my wallet and found it and said they'd ring my parents. It really helped because they let me out rather than keeping me in all night."" The card was launched nationally this week to help all those in a similar situation to Hurley. Peter McCabe, chief executive of Headway, a brain injury charity, says: ""Many people are assumed to be drunk as a result of having slurred speech or an unsteady gait, with attempts to explain the effects of their brain injury often being ignored."" He says the ID card aims to raise awareness within the criminal justice system and help police officers understand the situation at the earliest opportunity. He calls it a ""simple solution to a tricky conversation"" and believes it also gives carriers a confidence boost to which Hurley agrees. The now 44-year-old father-of-one, says: ""All the problems started because people assumed I was intoxicated. I think the card is a great idea. You can work hard to raise awareness but you may not reach every police officer and that is where the ID card comes in. ""I want to be able to tell people rather than have them wondering what's wrong with me. It's just a better way of doing it."" The scheme has received support from the National Police Chiefs' Council, Police Scotland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Liaison and Diversion and the National Appropriate Adult Network. Following his accident, Dominic returned to education and studied graphic design at college in Sheffield. It's where he also met his wife, Doreen, who comes from Germany and was on a 12-month work placement. ""She met me and liked me,' he says. ""It is more difficult with a brain injury, but all it takes is just a bit more understanding.""

"The Hadza are one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer tribes in the world. It's thought they've lived on the same land in northern Tanzania, eating berries, tubers and 30 different mammals for 40,000 years. The BBC's Dan Saladino went to watch them foraging and hunting, and to ask whether their diet holds lessons for everyone. As I lay flat on my stomach, I put my head inside the dark tunnel and sniffed. Animal... But I couldn't believe someone was actually going to slide inside and flush the animal out. That someone was Zigwadzee. And the animal? Well, that was a porcupine. After handing his bow and arrow and honey axe to a fellow Hadza hunter, Zigwadzee stripped off, took hold of a short, sharpened stick and disappeared down the hole. Perhaps, I thought, he was the smallest of the group and so the obvious choice. But the more I watched, the more I realised it was because Zigwadzee was the one with the least fear of what might lurk there - the cobra and mamba snakes, the reptiles, fleas and ticks, and the porcupine with its bristling 35cm (14in) quills. Up to this point, my Hadza diet had been strictly vegetarian, as it is much of the time for these people. Handfuls of berries picked from bushes as we wandered the dry woodland savannah, over thorns, past acacia trees and through parched grass. There had been the occasional crunchy moist tuber dug up from just below ground and cooked on a quickly-conjured fire. Berries and tubers, gathered by Hadza women, are the mainstay of the diet There were also lots and lots of baobab fruit. The baobab tree's rattling pods of fatty beans, packed with a white, zesty chalk-like dust, are made into a drink of pure fibre and vitamin C. Baobab fruit are rich in vitamin C Anthropologists noted decades ago that the Hadza are always hungry but never starving. Their enthusiasm for eating is matched by an abundance of ingredients around them, and the tracking and foraging skills needed to find them. All around us were foodstuffs I couldn't spot, but that Hadza children, even those as young as four, are adept at finding. Soon all I could hear of Zigwadzee was a distant, muffled voice. He was 2m (6ft) underground inside a hot network of tunnels and chambers, where a porcupine was hiding. As he mapped out the animal's subterranean world, he shouted instructions to his fellow hunters above ground to close off any escape routes. After 40 minutes, he re-emerged, covered in dust and a few fleas, ready to dig down further at the exact spot where the porcupine was located. Sticks are wedged into the bark of the baobab tree in order to climb to the bees' nest Although the Hadza number around 1,000 men, women and children, there are now thought to be only 200-300 pure hunter gatherers, who grow no food and practise no form of agriculture. These Hadza find farmers a curious and amusing lot. One asked me: ""Why stand in a field all day and wait for weeks or months for food when you can eat berries from a bush, find as much honey as you can eat or spend an hour inside a porcupine den and feed an entire camp?"" Listen to Dan Saladino's reports forthe Food Programmeon BBC Radio 4 Hunting with the Hadza The Hadza and the microbiome This is how our ancient ancestors sourced their food and nourished themselves. The meals Zigwadzee and his fellow Hadza eat are our last remaining link to the diets on which humans evolved and through which our digestive system developed - including the complex community of gut bacteria we all have, weighing 1-2kg in an adult, the so-called microbiome. There is now a growing consensus in the medical world that our gut microbiomes play a major role in the operation of our immune system, and that the more rich and diverse our microbiomes are, the lower our risk of disease. And it so happens that the Hadza, because of their diet, have the most diverse human gut microbiomes on the planet. Poisoned arrows are needed to kill an animal as large as a zebra Zebras are easier to kill in the dry season, because there are fewer watering places... ... but they are becoming rarer, because pastoralists are scaring them away Among my travelling companions was Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kings College London, who was keen to find out whether, if he ate like a Hadza, his own microbiome would become more like theirs. So he took samples of his own faeces before and after three days on a Hadza diet, in order to check whether the variety of different bacteria present changed. The results were impressive. After just three days, the diversity of bacteria in his already healthy microbiome had increased by 20%, and he was able to detect rare forms of bacteria often associated with good health. Hunters may have to walk several kilometres back from a hunt, carrying their share of the meat It may take years for Spector's research to reach a definite conclusion about our own optimum diets. But there is a sense of urgency, because things are changing for the Hadza - and fast. For many years, farmers have been extending their reach into Hadza land. In the last decade they've cleared 160 hectares (395 acres) of woodland each year, woodland that was the Hadza's wild food larder. Pastoralists and their hungry cattle have also been arriving in large numbers, scaring off many of the 30 different wild mammals the Hadza have hunted and eaten for tens of thousands of years. A hyrax, prior to cooking For me, though, the biggest surprise was an incursion of a different kind. A 30-minute drive from the porcupine hunt was a mud hut at a crossroads of tracks - and inside, shelves filled with cans of sugary soft drinks and packets of biscuits. It had taken me nine hours by Land Rover over tough terrain to get here, only to find the biggest brands in the world had made it before me. Sugary soft drinks are already on sale in the Hadza's territory Zigwadzee however was keeping the flame of Hadza wisdom alive, which would mean a swift and efficient end for the porcupine. Face-to-face with the animal, Zigwadzee nudged it with a stick and called to it: ""Come out porcupineâ¦ come to me... come here porcupine!"" Then, not one but two crested porcupine emerged. The most striking thing wasn't the long black and white quills on their lumbering bodies - which at 30kg each were bigger than you might think - it was the noise. A wall of sound, of quills rattled in warning. It filled the air and intensified as Zigwadzee delivered a few hard blows to the porcupines' heads. And then it was all over. Hadza hunters share everything. Theirs is an egalitarian society. They have no leadership structures and with meat, especially, there's an obligation to divide what is caught equally. The offal, the heart, liver and lungs were cooked on the spot and eaten immediately, the butchered carcasses taken back to the camps and distributed. As I watched, and nervously nibbled on a piece of porcupine liver, I realised I'd watched something special. A hunt, and a meal, that had allowed me a connection to the ancient past. Bows are often the only possession a Hadza male will own - animal tendons are wound round the wood and the fat released helps to keep it in good condition All photographs courtesy of Jeff Leach, King's College London See also:I spent three days as a hunter-gatherer to see if it would improve my gut health,external Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

"South Korea's Park Sung-hyun has won her first women's major Newly-crowned golfing champion Park Sung-hyun has become the latest name in a stellar series of female winners from South Korea. This week, Park, 23,won the US Women's Openby two shots to claim her first LPGA title. Eight other Korean women also made it to the tour's top 10. ""It's almost like I'm floating on a cloud in the sky,"" said Park, whose nickname Dak Gong translates to ""shut up and attack"". South Korean women have dominated the fiercely-competitive game, claiming victory at the US Women's Open seven times in the past decade. So what makes them so successful? Park Sung-hyun 'floating in the sky' after first major win South Korea-born New Zealander Lydia Ko becomes golf's youngest world number one Rio Olympics 2016: Inbee Park wins women's golf gold For decades, South Korea has emerged as a major exporter of popular culture. The lucrative 'K Wave' evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon and cemented the viral status of Korean pop music groups and drama serials. Korean golfing has now joined the ranks of K-pop and K-drama stars, with its athletes being given an impressive amount of respect on the world stage. ""Many people associate South Korean women with being just K-pop and K-drama stars. But Park is just one in a long line of champion women golfers from our country,"" wrote Jin Joo-so, a golf fan on Facebook. Move aside K-drama starlets, these women are carving a new global name for their country Decades of rigorous training and intense competition has resulted in a generation of strong, young Korean women who have transformed and revolutionised the ""thinking man's game"". Eric Fleming runs a fan site titledSeoulSisters,external, devoted to South Korean players. He says that the reason why Korean golfers dominate the sport is simple: they work hard. ""When a Korean girl shows talent in golf, her family will do whatever it takes to support her dream. Even if that means spending most of their savings to make it possible,"" he explained. ""In return, she is expected to do everything possible to maximise her potential."" Golf is cut throat and pressure to excel in the sport is huge. But reality is harsh and sadly, not everyone becomes a champion. ""For the few that make it to the top, they have not only put in thousands of hours of training, they have developed a drive that makes sure they will continue to work hard to get as far as they can,"" Mr Fleming said. ""When a Korean girl makes it to the LPGA, I believe she is more motivated to win because of all the work and investment she has put in. She has to make big sacrifices. Many American golfers just don't."" Pak Se-ri changed the face of women's golf and sparked a South Korean revolution These are exciting times for South Korean golf. And there's one name that's synonymous with the Korean golfing wave and that's Pak Se-ri, the woman credited with starting it all. The 39-year-old from Daejeon city is now retired but she went out on a high in 2016 with a Hall of Fame career that yielded several major titles and inspired a wave of young women players who followed her to the renowned LPGA Tour. ""I am extremely proud of all of them. To witness the success of so many South Korean players on tour makes me feel proud of what I was able to accomplish,"" Ms Pak told BBC News from Seoul. ""Together we proved and continue to prove that no matter your country, background or circumstances, if you work hard enough to pursue your dreams, anything is possible."" She also spoke about ""competitive training regimes"" which set the standard for many South Korean women, who have learned to adapt to the gruelling game. ""Golf is a game of repetition and very often, it is difficult to remain dedicated. But hard work, dedication, passion and a lot of support was what I had,"" she said. ""I can say that from a cultural perspective, South Koreans are exposed to insane amounts of pressure from a very young age. So we naturally deal better with pressure on tour.""

"US citizens have now had six months to get used to their new president and still not all are finding it easy. For Americans in the UK there is a double dose of change, with Brexit now firmly under way. London-based writer and broadcaster Michael Goldfarb has been finding that the combination means all conversations turn inexorably to politics. Donald Trump has been president for half a year. It is a year since Britons voted to leave the European Union. Yes, the two events are linked. Like an enormous piece of Antarctic sea ice calving off from the continent and drifting away, the Anglo-American world has detached itself from its partners and headed off into the unknown. For those of us who are citizens of both countries it has been a strange time. Twenty years ago, when I was National Public Radio's London correspondent, I used to get invited to the annual American ambassador's 4 July shindig at the residence in Regent's Park. It was a perk of the job. I didn't hear of an Independence Day bash this year, and anyway there is no ambassador in place yet.  In an example of the chaos that swirls around his administration, President Trump's nominee, Woody Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson baby powder fortune and owner of the New York Jets NFL team, has only just been confirmed by the Senate but has not yet presented his credentials to the Court of St James's. Woody Johnson, pictured at Trump Tower in December, is due in London soon I haven't been to a 4 July party for ages, but this year was an exception. My hosts were an Anglo-Swiss couple, holding a party in honour of a business colleague from New York - a barbecue on their terrace overlooking a square of renovated warehouses you would never find without GPS. After six months of the Trump whirlwind everyone was exhausted and happy to lay off politics, but it was tough. Plus, the British half of the couple hosting the party works for a major international music publisher and has extensive business in the EU so it was impossible not to touch on Brexit, and once you're on Brexit you get to Trump and then on to this new historical epoch we've been led into - not by war or revolution but via the ballot box. Eventually, we extricated ourselves from the subject.  It was time to bring out the sparklers and my 11-year-old happily waved them into the night. Ronald Reagan (left) and Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street, in 1982 The ""unpresidented"" uniquely American nature of the Trump Administration makes it easy to overlook how much its existence owes to the particular political relationship the UK and the US have enjoyed since Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan came to power within a year of each other. Trump's ""unpresidented"" tweet was deleted and re-posted with the correct spelling Thatcher/Reagan tried to undo their respective nations' social democratic settlements by radically deregulating markets and gutting trade unions. The pair dominated the West's international security organisations. The Anglo-American axis continued to a greater or lesser extent right through Prime Minister Tony Blair's pledge to President George W Bush to back the US in its war to overthrow Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Ironically, Brexit and the election of Trump were made possible by the votes of those who were the losers in the deregulated, free-trading economic world led by Thatcher/Reagan, which laid the foundations for today's world of economic inequality and employment insecurity.  The votes were also an expression of the anger of people at the Iraq War. That anger was not just a phenomenon of the left. One of the key moments in Donald Trump's successful campaign to the get the Republican nomination came in a debatewhen he said to Bush's brother Jeb,external: ""The Iraq War was a big fat mistake."" Jeb Bush (left) and Donald Trump (right) debating in February 2016 Last month Henry Kissinger passed through London briefly to give the keynote address at the Centre for Policy Studies' Margaret Thatcher Conference on Security. The CPS was a think-tank founded by Mrs Thatcher and a few close colleagues in the mid-1970s.  I attended expecting to hear Kissinger say something about the security implications of the uncharted waters Anglo-America has entered. It never happened. The secret of the 94-year-old Kissinger's rise to secretary of state, and his continued presence on the world stage, is a courtier's ability to flatter his audience. Answering a question about Brexit, Kissinger admitted to the Eurosceptic audience he initially thought it was a terrible idea but now realised Brexit wasn't so bad and could be made to work. He never mentioned Trump once. It seemed odd. I would have thought Trump's disruptive approach to foreign relations, the opposite of Kissinger's ideas of rationally maintaining order among the great powers, would have been worth a comment. Especially since the president will be with us for a while yet. Henry Kissinger and Donald Trump in the Oval Office in May 2017 Six months into the Trump presidency, his popularity numbers are only slowly eroding. A recent Washington Post/ABC News Poll shows the president's approval ratingdown to 36%,external. That's six points lower than it was in April. That month I was in America making a BBC radio programme to mark Trump's first 100 days in office and I wastalking to some of his unswayable supportersthat I had met covering the campaign. Nothing had happened at that stage that would make them change their views, and I doubt even the Russia scandal has reached a point where they will stop supporting him. Similarly, in Britain, Brexit voters have been unswayed by the rocky start to negotiations made by Prime Minister Theresa May's government. Despite the Conservatives' poor performance at the recent general election,more than two-thirds of Britons want to continue the Brexit process,external. Recently, I found myself chatting with a member of the House of Lords, a former cabinet minister in both the Thatcher and Major governments, and an ardent pro-European. We were in the Green Room at New Broadcasting House waiting to go on different BBC news programmes. We were marvelling at the way our world had been turned on its head in the last year. An item about Donald Trump came up on the television. The former minister shook his head in bewilderment and asked me how long I thought Trump could last. I told him that so long as the President had 35% to 40% of the country solidly behind him he would be in office a while.  I also said I didn't think he would be impeached and that the end of his presidency, whenever it comes, would be ""unpresidented"". The Conservative grandee, shook his head. ""This can't go onâ¦ it can't go on."" But it can.

"John Cunningham had been living in the US without papers since 1999 After a high-profile deportation, undocumented Irish immigrants are on edge, and trying to help Latino immigrants who are more likely targets for immigration officials. John Cunningham came to Boston in 1999. Like many Irish immigrants to the US, he arrived on a 90-day visa for summer work. But then he settled in, worked as an electrician and ran his own company, remaining in the country without authorisation. ""All of a sudden you turn around, so much time has gone by, and you start to realise what is going to be in store for yourself for the future,"" Cunningham said in a March interviewwith the Irish Times,external. On 16 June, nearly two decades later, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents came to his home to arrest him. He was deported to Ireland on 5 July. Because he arrived in the US under the visa waiver programme, one commonly used by European immigrants, he had waived his right to a hearing. Ronnie Millar, who runs Boston'sIrish International Immigrant Center,external, thinks Cunningham's decision to share his experiences and speak out for the rights of unauthorised immigrants in the United States made him a target for deportation. A warrant was issued for Cunningham's arrest in 2014 after he failed to appear in court on an allegation he did not complete work he charged a client for. But ICE would only confirm that his arrest and deportation was due to his visa overstay. Cunningham became the first high-profile Irish immigrant deported under President Donald Trump, and it's created a chilling effect in Boston. ""There were shock waves sent through the community, a disbelief that this was actually happening,"" said Millar, a close friend of Cunningham's. New citizens sing the US national anthem in Boston US widens net for deporting immigrants Kenny vows to 'press' Trump during US visit It is a chill felt by people like Jerry. He asked to be identified by only his first name because he remains unauthorised to live in the US and fears deportation. When Jerry first arrived in the US on a three-month visa waiver in the summer of 2011, he hadn't made up his mind about returning to Ireland. ""The lifestyle, the work, everything was just better here at the time. So things just kind of happened,"" he said. ""I had a return ticket booked. I just never got on the plane."" The Migration Policy Institute estimates there are 16,000 undocumented Irish living in the US. The Irish Embassy in Washington puts that number closer to 50,000. Most live in Boston, New York or Chicago. Like Jerry, many are hiding in plain sight, navigating a difficult world of privilege and panic as white, undocumented immigrants. ""I don't think anyone is outright targeting people who look like me,"" Jerry said, ""But there's still a fear. You could be walking in the street and bump into the wrong person, you can get pulled over while driving, walk into the wrong building or show the wrong ID."" ""Most people think undocumented and they think people who come across the southern border,"" Cunningham said in an interview with this reporter a year before his arrest. ""They're not thinking about the Irish guy who lives right next to them."" Jerry, Millar and Cunningham all acknowledged that, as white men, they can fly under the radar of those who associate unauthorised immigrants with Mexico and Central America. This video can not be played Where do America's undocumented immigrants live? Cunningham recalled local police and immigration officials not questioning his status during stops. He felt that he was given a pass because of his Irish accent. He wondered if the officers would have treated him differently if he were black or brown. As a whole, white and other non-Latino immigrants are targeted for arrest and detention at disproportionately lower rates, says Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute. ""It's the Latino immigrants from Mexico and Central America that are overrepresented in terms of arrests and deportations,"" said Capps. Accusations of unequal treatment and racial profiling among immigrant communities have also sparked criticism in Boston about local media attention to Cunningham's arrest. Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said that for every one story of a white immigrant who faces deportation, there are many other stories of non-white immigrant experiences not told. Rose points to Boston's Francisco RodrÃ­guez, a Salvadoran immigrant who, after two denied asylum requests, had been granted a stay of removal every year since 2011. Tales of deportation in Trump's America Students in US face anxious future That changed this year under President Donald Trump, who greatly broadened which immigrants the government considers a priority for deportation. Rodriguez was arrested when he arrived for a check-in with immigration authorities in June and remains in custody while fighting his deportation to El Salvador. Critics also point to racial bias in how Cunningham's story was told. Julio Varela, co-host for Futuro Media's In the Thick podcast and a Boston native, has often challenged what he calls an ""Irish immigrant privilege"" in local media. In a column on theLatino Rebels blog,externalhe argues Irish and other white immigrants like Cunningham are more often portrayed as model community members undeserving of deportation. Francisco RodrÃ­guez and supporters It's why the Irish International Immigrant Center offers its legal and social services to more than Irish immigrants. Christina Freeman, a lawyer at the centre, said their ""know your rights"" workshops often include talk about racial bias and law enforcement. The participants ""know there is a racial bias, they've experienced it"". ""You look around the room and see who's in there and there's not one white face in the crowd,"" Freeman said. ""It's because the teenagers being stopped the most often are teenagers of colour."" While white undocumented immigrants may benefit from blending in, there is still an impact. Millar recalls his centre aiding an Irish woman so embarrassed to reveal her immigration status to her American-born family that when a parent died back in Ireland, she instead stayed in a hotel in the US to give her family the illusion she went home, rather than admit that she's undocumented and risk not gaining re-entry into the US. Following Trump's electoral victory, Millar said there was an increased fear that Boston's previously welcoming stance toward Irish immigrants would soon change. Those fears were compounded following Cunningham's arrest, he adds. ""We are not in a good place as a society,"" Millar said. ""As a nation, we've really lost our way, who we are and our values - being a country that's made up of immigrants."" The World is a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH.

"Marian Hill wrote their breakout song, Down, in the space of one night It's an ordinary day in Advert-ville, USA. As the black-and-white sun rises over a black-and-white street, authentic-looking extras with a variety of contemporary hairstyles walk past a dilapidated warehouse. A shoeshine boy flicks open his newspaper, passing time until a customer arrives. None ever will, because shoeshine boys only exist in the movies. Perched on an upturned milk crate is a tall and slender young man. Let's call him Lil Buck, because that is his name. Bored, he puts in his earphones and fires up a song. Suddenly, the music brings him to life. He springs off the crate and contorts his body to an irresistible beat, defying gravity as he dances on walls and shop-fronts. That's how Applechose to promote,externaltheir new wireless headphones earlier this year - and the song selected for the soundtrack was Marian Hill's Down. The ""Stroll"" commercial has been watched more than 12m times A sparsely atmospheric track, it pits Samantha Gongol's husky voice against a simple piano figure before crashing into a staccato beat in the chorus. Apple's advertising agency, Media Arts Lab, stressed the importance of finding ""an unknown band"" for their commercial. ""People get excited when they discover a new band,"" music supervisor Peymon Maskantold Music Week,externalearlier this year. ""They pull out their phone to Shazam the track and they tell their friends. That's a music fan's experience when discovering an ad like this."" Within days of the advert airing, the song had racked up 12 million views on YouTube and Down became the most searched-for song in America - ahead of Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars. Nielsen Soundscan, which compiles the charts, said sales of the song jumped from ""negligible"" (not worth reporting) to 101,000 in the space of a week. In the UK, it was streamed more than 3 million times. ""That commercial was the catalyst for a lot of things,"" says keyboardist and producer Jeremy Lloyd. ""It put us in so many people's living rooms - and to have them instantly love the song felt so validating for all the work we had done."" As they take a break from making their second album, the duo tell the BBC how they got together and found their sound. How did the band get together? Samantha: Jeremy and I have been friends since we were about 12 or 13. We got the name Marian Hill from a production of The Music Man that we were in together in eighth grade. He played Harold Hill, I played Marian Paroo and we combined our character names. We stayed friends throughout high school and college, until Jeremy showed me a beat and asked if I wanted to write with him. That song was calledWhisky,external, and the rest is history. Right out of the gate you had a unique, minimalistic sound. How did it come about? Jeremy: We really stumbled into it. At the time we'd written a couple of other things together that were all over the map musically. Then I was playing Sam a couple of different beats and I had one that had this hip-hop feel to it - and that was the Whisky beat. Neither of us had ever made anything like it before. I was able to recognise how much better it was - and so, for me, the goal became, how do you carry this forward? ""Jeremy and I can be honest without hurting each other's feelings,"" says Samantha And what was the answer? Jeremy: At that point, it still wasn't that serious, necessarily. It was just a thing we'd made. And when I was about to graduate college, I decided I wanted to give it a real try, so I emailed, like, 50 blogs and thankfully people picked up on the song and liked it. From then on it's been this slow, steady stream of people wanting to hear more. Samantha, your vocals are very jazzy. Who were your influences? Samantha: I grew up loving the diva vocalists - Whitney Houston, Lauryn Hill, Ella Fitzgerald, Etta James. I was a huge Norah Jones fan too. That was a huge watershed moment for me, in terms of discovering a contemporary vocalist that I connected with. Jeremy: So often in songs, there's no room for the vocal to sit - the voice is just pasted on top, so the whole mix is throbbing at the seams. With our stuff I try to make sure the vocal has space, and you can hear all the textures and nuances that would otherwise get lost. Before Marian Hill, Samantha did some work as a ""top liner"", writing melodies for big pop singers. What was that like? Samantha: Writing sessions are kind of like blind dating: You're just thrown into a room together and you hope you get along and make something incredible. How did you go about writing Down? Samantha: We were just messing around in the studio and I think the piano line came first, Jeremy? Jeremy: Yeah, it was the first thing we'd written on a piano. I was goofing around and I stumbled on that piano line. It wasn't like, ""OK, we're writing a song now."" I wasn't quite sure about it. But I asked Sam, ""Do you think we could do something with this?"" and she figured out a melody. Looking back on it, it was such a simple process. I'm pretty sure it was all one night. The duo released their debut EP in 2013 The song's about going to a party against your better judgment, is that right? Samantha: We just wanted to have fun with it. There are so many party songs about getting on the dancefloor and throwing your hands in the air (like you just don't care). We thought it could be cool to write it from the perspective of Marian Hill, and what it would sound like if we did a song like that. ""I'm not sure I want to go, but do you?"" And then the crash of the chorus was the party itself. The Apple commercial really fitted the song. How much input did you have? Jeremy: We probably would have had a veto if we'd hated it, but it very much was on them. They put it together and we were just like, ""Wow, this is perfect."" What effect did it have? Jeremy: It was amazing because our album [Act One] had been out for a minute and our fans were loving it, but it hadn't really broken out to a larger audience. Having this spotlight, it put us in so many people's living rooms, and to have them instantly love the song felt so validating for all the work we had done. It was a great way to finish off the album campaign. The band will be playing in the UK later this year So what comes next? Jeremy: We've been writing a lot over the last two months, together in New York and at home in Philadelphia. It's an exciting point to be at, coming off the success of Down, so we're really excited to get these songs out to our new fans. What changes are you making compared to the first album? Jeremy: It's the same aesthetic, only it's a little more brash. But we're right in the middle of it and that direction could change. And when do we get so hear it? Jeremy: It will be within a six-month window. We have a deadline in mind. Samantha: Probably in the fall. Marian Hill's Act One (The Complete Collection) is out now. They play a headline gig at London's Scala on 9 October. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"This video can not be played Jerusalem holy site security row explained Israel is willing to consider alternatives to controversial metal detectors it installed at a holy site in Jerusalem, a senior official says. Major General Yoav Mordechai called on the Muslim world to put forward other suggestions. Israel installed the detectors after two Israeli policemen were killed near thereearlier this month. The measures angered the Palestinians, who accuse Israel of trying to take control over a sacred place. Tensions over the site, known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount, have surged in the past couple of days. What makes Jerusalem so holy? ""We hope that Jordan and other Arab nations can suggest another security solution for this (problem),"" Maj-Gen Mordechai told BBC Arabic, referring to the metal detectors. ""Any solution be it electronic, cyber or modern technology: Israel is ready for a solution. We need a security solution; not political or religious."" The BBC World Service's Middle East editor Alan Johnston says it is the first sign of a softening of Israel's position over the measures.

"It's one of the most debated theories in sci-fi - is Harrison Ford's character in Blade Runner human or an artificially created replicant? The answer was left as a mystery in the theatrical release of Ridley Scott's 1982 film - with even Scott and Ford arguing about it - and with a sequel due to be released in October, fans are hoping the issue will finally be resolved. Ford and fellow cast members including Ryan Gosling introduced asecond trailer,externaland new clips from the movie at Comic-Con on Saturday, which connect the sequel to the original film. Moderator Chris Hardwicke couldn't help but ask Ford if Blade Runner 2049 would address the lingering questions about Deckard's identity - human or replicant? After a long pause,the star responded,external: ""It doesn't matter what I think."" So that clears that up then. However he did say he returned for the sequel because: ""We had a really good script based on a really good idea. It deepened the understanding of my characterâ¦ It had great depth."" Ben Affleck denies Batman exit rumours Everything Marvel unleashed at Comic-Con Comic-Con day 2 recap: Big Bang Theory, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones and more Set 30 years after the events of the first film, the sequel sees Gosling play Blade Runner Officer K, who discovers a dark secret which leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard. The Comic-Con panel was introduced by a hologram of Jared Leto, who stars as the villain in the movie but wasn't able to be in San Diego in person. Gosling admitted making a Blade Runner sequel was surreal and it still hadn't quite sunk in yet that he was making it. ""I just remember when I was a kid it was one of the first films that I'd seen where it wasn't clear how I was supposed to feel when it was over,"" he said.

"This video can not be played ""Boots spectacularly misjudged public opinion,"" says Clare Murphy of the BPAS Boots has said it is ""truly sorry"" for its response to calls to cut the cost of one of its morning-after pills. The pharmaceutical company was criticised after telling the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) it was avoiding ""incentivising inappropriate use"". It now says it is looking for cheaper alternatives to the Levonelle brand. The firm said it ""sincerely"" apologised for its ""poor choice of words"" over the emergency contraception pricing. The progestogen-based drug Levonelle costs Â£28.25 in Boots, with a non-branded equivalent priced at Â£26.75. The branded drug costs Â£13.50 at Tesco and a generic version is Â£13.49 in Superdrug. Claire Murphy from the BPAS welcomed the move by Boots but said it would keep up the pressure on the chain. ""Women struggle to access emergency contraception and the cost is a key barrier,"" she said. ""It's been wonderful to hear the women, and the men, of this country stand up and really make their voices heard in response to the position Boots originally took."" But Laura Perrins from the blog Conservative Women said condemning a pharmacy for setting a price on a particular drug was itself a ""form of moralising"". She said Boots should not be forced to reduce the cost, saying Levonelle ""is a drug that is unlike others and is a drug that can be given to under-age girls without parental consent"". The BPAS has lobbied Boots to reduce the cost of the pill to make it more accessible for women having difficulty getting the drug quickly on the NHS. The service also found the pills can cost up to five times more in the UK than in some parts of Europe. Previously, Boots had defended its pricing plan for the pill, saying it was often contacted by individuals who criticise the company for providing the service. It also said it ""would not want to be accused of incentivising inappropriate use, and provoking complaints, by significantly reducing the price of this product"". The response led to some Labour MPs saying Boots had taken an ""unacceptable"" moral position, while health campaigners talked of a ""sexist surcharge"". The company later issued another statement, stating regret that its previous response had ""caused offence and misunderstanding"". It added: ""The pricing of [emergency hormonal contraception] is determined by the cost of the medicine and the cost of the pharmacy consultation. ""We are committed to looking at the sourcing of less expensive EHC medicines, for example generics, to enable us to continue to make a privately-funded EHC service even more accessible in the future. ""In addition the NHS EHC service where it is locally commissioned, is provided for free in over 1,700 of our pharmacies, and we continue to urge the NHS to extend this free service more widely."" The morning-after pill can be taken in the days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy. In England, Levonelle and EllaOne are free of charge from most sexual health clinics, most GP surgeries and most NHS walk-in centres or urgent care centres, but they are free only to women in certain age groups from pharmacies in some parts of the country. In Scotland and Wales, the emergency contraceptive pill is available free of charge on the NHS from pharmacies, GPs and sexual health clinics. In Northern Ireland, some pharmacies allow it to be bought on the NHS, and it is available free of charge from sexual health clinics and GPs. Sandra Gidley, from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said the original stance taken by Boots was a ""little uncomfortable"". She said: ""They seemed to be saying women would be irresponsible and that can't be the case because pharmacists have to ask a set number of questions so if women are regularly trying to use the morning after pill as a method of contraception they're simply not allowed to have it.""

"Train firms could be forced to reduce first class seats on busy commuter lines to ease overcrowding, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said. He said people will see ""less first class in the future"" with busy suburban trains having ""one class"" instead. Mr Grayling suggested operators may be forced to scrap first class areas when franchises are awarded in the future. Rail Delivery Group - which represents train operators - said it would work to increase seat numbers on key lines. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Grayling said he was ""absolutely"" committed to scrapping first class carriages on shorter, commuter routes, at busy times of the day, and wanted train operators to take action if passengers demanded it. ""I absolutely understand what a total pain it is if you are standing on a train for 20 to 30 minutes on the way to work,"" he told the paper. ""I don't really see a case for a non-long distance journey for there to be any division between first and second class. There should just be one class on the train."" ""People will see less first class in the future as we start to say that on busy suburban trains you can't start segregating,"" he added. The Department for Transport issues contracts to run rail franchises in England, and can include conditions such as whether first class seating should be provided. In March, ahead of contract negotiations to run the Southeastern franchise,passengers were askedif they wanted to remove first class seats at busy times. The contract to run the line - which serves south-east London, Kent and parts of East Sussex - expires next year. Otherfranchises to be renewed,externalin the next 12 months include the West Coast Main Line from April 2019, and the East Midlands regional contract, which has three firms bidding to run the contract from March 2018. However, some are not due for renewal for several years, with the Northern and East Anglia franchises currently not due for renewal until 2025. David Sidebottom, director of Transport Focus - which represents passengers - said it was important train users have a choice, ""as long as that choice is not to the extreme detriment of everyone else"". ""A balance needs to be achieved between the number of standard and first class carriages a train has,"" he added. ""However, it is clear that where passengers are being squeezed into standard class carriages while there are plenty of empty seats in first class, this balance is not being achieved. ""In the long-term we need a big increase in capacity. This means continued investment in new and longer trains to meet existing demand."" Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group - which represents train operators - said firms were prepared to work with the government over the issue. ""We understand passengers' frustration when they can't get a seat which is why rail companies are working together to invest and improve journeys with thousands of new carriages and 6,400 extra train services a week by 2021,"" he said. ""We will continue to work with governments to increase seats on key routes to boost communities, businesses and the economy.""

"The medals were awarded to Lieutenant-General Rowland Hill who fought alongside the Duke of Wellington A military badge with medals awarded to a soldier who fought with the Duke of Wellington in 1815 has been found. The medals were discovered in their original box in Derbyshire and will be auctioned later this month. The brooch with the medals, including several grand crosses, belonged to Viscount Hill, Charles Hanson of Hanson's Auctioneers said. The general, born in Shropshire, was known as Daddy Hill by his troops due to his caring nature. Known as Daddy Hill, the general was ""renowned for looking after his men"" The medals are expected to sell for thousands of pounds. Lieutenant-General Rowland Hill was a British Army officer who served in the Napoleonic Wars as a commander under Wellington. The medals discovered in Derbyshire include the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, the Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order,  the Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and the Sword and the Peninsular Cross. A statue in Shrewsbury commemorates the Waterloo general but has been damaged by heavy rain, frost and snow Mr Hanson said: ""(Hill) was a man who never married, he devoted his life to serving his country. He led armies of up to 30,000 men in some of the most important battles of the 1800s in Egypt, Spain, Portugal and France. ""He inevitably had brushes with death. At the Battle of Waterloo, where Hill commanded the II Corps, he was lost in the melee and feared dead but escaped unscathed. ""He was brilliant on the battlefield and yet humble, a commander renowned for looking after his men."" General Hill was born in 1772 at Hawkstone Hall in Shropshire and died in in 1842 at the age of 70.

"The families of victims of an IRA bomb attack in London's Hyde Park have held a march to seek support for a civil prosecution of the alleged bomber. Four soldiers were killed by a nail bomb as they made their way to a Changing of the Guard ceremony at Horse Guards Parade on 20 July 1982. The 2014 murder trial of John Downey collapsed after it emerged he had been assured he would not be tried. Relatives now want to raise Â£620,000 for a civil prosecution of Mr Downey. Roy Bright, Anthony Daly, Simon Tipper and Geoffrey Young, all from the Household Cavalry, were killed in the attack, which remains one of the most significant unsolved IRA bombings of the Troubles. Mr Downey, who was convicted of IRA membership in the 1970s, had been Scotland Yard's prime suspect for the bombing - but was not extradited from the Republic of Ireland at the time. John Downey received an assurance he would not face prosecution In 2013, he was arrested at Gatwick Airport while en route to Greece, and was subsequently charged with the Hyde Park killings. Mr Downey, from County Donegal, denied murder and intending to cause an explosion likely to endanger life. However, his trial at the Old Bailey in central London was halted after it was revealed he had been given an assurance by the UK government that he was no longer wanted. The assurance was made as part of the controversial ""on the runs"" scheme. Giving his judgement on the case, Mr Justice Sweeney said Mr Downey had received an official letter in 2007 stating that he was not ""wanted in Northern Ireland for arrest, questioning or charging by police"". But the Police Service of Northern Ireland later admitted making a mistake by also assuring Mr Downey it was not ""aware of any interest in you by any other police force"", when he remained a suspect at Scotland Yard. The families of those killed in the bombing are now seeking the money to pay for a civil prosecution of Mr Downey, and held a march in London on Saturday to mark the 35th anniversary of the attack. Supporters marched from barracks in Kensington to Wellington Arch in Hyde Park. Mark Tipper, whose teenage brother Trooper Simon Tipper was among those killed, said his families had never been given the chance to find out who carried out the attack. ""My brother had only been married a week. It was his first duty back after honeymoon, he was just 19. Nobody could imagine what that poor bride felt like, and 35 years on I know she still hurts,"" he said. ""If that letter had not have gone to Downey that trial would have continued and he would have been found either guilty or not guilty. ""We as families were never given that chance. All we want to know is that if this man did it, he will be brought to justice."" They are about 187 former IRA members who had been wanted by police during the Troubles, between 1969 and 1998. The signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement meant anyone convicted of paramilitary crimes was eligible for early release - but it did not cover those suspected of crimes or those who had escaped from prison. Negotiations continued between Sinn FÃ©in and the government over how to deal with those known as ""on the runs"" after the signing of the agreement. The UK government agreed in 2001 to give assurances that there would be no prosecutions of on the runs if paramilitary organisations continued to support the peace process. Initially, the government tried pass laws to ensure they would not be prosecuted for crimes for which they were wanted. But after facing opposition, government negotiators offered letters saying they were no longer wanted by police Details of letters sent to on the run only became more widely known in February 2014, following the collapse of Mr Downey's trial.

"Mr Trump referred to his ""complete power to pardon"" in a tweet US President Donald Trump has insisted he has the ""complete power"" to pardon people, amid reports he is considering presidential pardons for family members, aides and even himself. A Democratic Party spokesman has called the reports ""extremely disturbing"". The US authorities are probing possible collusion between the Trump team and Russia. Intelligence agencies think Russia tried to help Mr Trump to power. Russia denies this, and the president says there was no collusion. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Mr Trump and his team were looking at ways to pardon people close to him. Presidents can pardon people before guilt is established or even before the person is charged with a crime. Describing the reports as disturbing, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said ""pardoning any individuals who may have been involved would be crossing a fundamental line"". On Saturday, Mr Trumptweeted:,external""While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS."" Could Trump pardon himself? Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded Mr Trump also attacked ""illegal leaks"" following reports his attorney general discussed campaign-related matters with a Russian envoy. The Washington Post,externalgave an account of meetings Attorney General Jeff Sessions held with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. The newspaper quoted current and former US officials who cited intelligence intercepts of Mr Kislyak's version of the encounter to his superiors. One of those quoted said Mr Kislyak spoke to Mr Sessions about key campaign issues, including Mr Trump's positions on policies significant to Russia. During his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Mr Sessions said he had no contact with Russians during the election campaign. When it later emerged he had, he said the campaign was not discussed at the meetings. An official confirmed to Reuters the detail of the intercepts, but there has been no independent corroboration. This video can not be played Commander in tweets: What we can learn from Trump's Twitter How much has Trump achieved so far? What has Trump said about your country? Trump's promises before and after election The officials spoken to by the Post said that Mr Kislyak could have exaggerated the account, and cited a Justice Department spokesperson who repeated that Mr Sessions did not discuss interference in the election. But the Post's story was the focus of one of many tweets the US president fired off on Saturday morning. ""A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions. These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!"" Mr Trump said. The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who hasbeen an occasional sparring partner for Mr Trump. ""Comey"" refers to James Comey, the former FBI boss Mr Trump fired. Earlier this week, Mr Trump told the New York Times he regretted hiring Mr Sessions because he had stepped away from overseeing an inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. Mr Sessions recused himself in March amid pressure over his meetings with Mr Kislyak. He says he plans to continue in his role as attorney general. This video can not be played Sessions said he loved the job and the department Several other regular targets for Mr Trump featured in his series of tweets. He accused the ""failing"" New York Times of foiling an attempt to assassinate the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It is not clear what Mr Trump was referring to, but on Saturday a US general complained on Fox News that a ""good lead"" on Baghdadi was leaked to a national newspaper in 2015. A New York Times report at the time revealed that valuable information had been extracted from a raid, but the paper stressed on Saturday that no-one had taken issue with their reporting until now. And Mr Trump again urged Republicans to ""step up to the plate"" and repeal and replace President Obama's healthcare reforms,a key campaign pledge of his that has collapsed in Congress.

"Retired nurse Christine Hughes preparing for the arrival of the refugee family They have donated time, skills, money and even a house in a bid to be allowed to help a family of refugees resettle in the UK. But, as the Home Officeannounces Â£1m,externalto help more communities sponsor refugees, just how much work was it for one group of retirees, part and full-time workers to pull together and take responsibility for a family? Christine Hughes kept seeing pictures and videos on Facebook of Syrian refugees and their desperate bids to get to the UK. And she wanted to help. ""I was hearing the most awful stories and just not sleeping,"" mother-of-four and grandmother Mrs Hughes said. ""If I started thinking about it before I went to sleep, that was it, I just couldn't sleep, because I knew what people were suffering right at that moment while there I was in my cosy bed."" No longer wanting to feel helpless, she and a few other people held a meeting in the Pembrokeshire town of Narberth to discuss what they could do. A year later and she has finally achieved her goal - to resettle a refugee family in the picturesque market town. It is one of 10 to have brought a group of refugees to the UK under a schemeintroduced in July 2016,external. It means community can take responsibility for resettling up to three refugee families - supporting their move here by setting up accommodation for them, helping them to learn English and eventually find jobs. The vast majority of the 20,000 Syrian refugees the UK hascommitted to take in,externalhave come through the support of local councils. But community groups have sponsored 53 refugees in the last year. Narbeth has a population of 2,000, according to the last census The scheme was modelled on the successful Canadian Private Sponsorship scheme which has resettledmore than 200,000 refugees since it was introduced in 1978,external. But the group calledCroeso Arberth,external- meaning Narberth Welcome - said it had not been straight-forward. It had to raise Â£4,500 as insurance to cover each of the seven supported refugees, which is kept in a separate bank account for emergencies, as well as having Â£6,000 in the bank to cover the cost of things like interpreters, transport from the airport and a Â£200 allowance for each member of the family - given in small amounts for six weeks while they wait for their applications for benefits to go through. A house had to be found, English lessons arranged, schools contacted and extensive Home Office forms filled in - and that was just to start. Listen to Croeso Arberth prepare to welcome the family of refugees on BBC Radio Wales'Eye on Wales programme TheUK government website,externalhas information about how to sponsor a family of vulnerable refugees to resettle in the UK Retired nurse Mrs Hughes said: ""I had absolutely no idea of the amount of time I was going to have to donate to it. ""I have got a house I rent out, my mother is 93, I have got three horses, I've got four children, two of who have got grandchildren, and have a few little jobs cleaning guest houses, so I'm tearing myself away from different situations, just trying to cope, really. ""Halfway through the process I did think 'what am I doing', but thinking we were nearly there is what has kept me going."" The group, which has a core of 12 people with around 100 more who have expressed a desire to help, has committed to support the resettled family for a year, and be responsible for their housing - paid for with housing benefits - for two years. Mrs Hughes said: ""I started off as an email pusher - just keeping people informed about meetings and fund-raising events. Then I started doing practical things like phoning up the schools, I went to the police, I went to the doctors."" Group tidying up the garden of the house where the refugees will be living Shortly after she and other members of the group wrote an action plan for the Home Office - a plan that has been revised multiple times since the application first went in. Jill Simpson, who works part-time at Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, liaised with the Home Office on behalf of Croeso Arberth throughout the negotiations. She said: ""I spent months sitting at my computer, pulling together all sorts of information, writing documents. At times it felt as if it was being made very difficult, but I think that, on reflection, it is because it is such a new scheme and the Home Office people have been feeling their way as well. ""There was a lot of support, but you needed to get through this nitty gritty bureaucracy."" Meet the family at the airport Provide a warm welcome Provide housing Help access medical and social services English language tuition Support towards employment and self-sufficiency Information fromHome Office,external The group needed approval from local council Pembrokeshire to go ahead with the application, as well as getting approval from Citizens UK, who acted as the lead sponsor - with legal responsibility to make sure everything runs as it should. Finding housing was extremely complicated. Mrs Simpson said: ""We had to describe the house to the Home Office, and it had to be available, but we didn't know how long it would take until we had a family, and that was really difficult because if you think about it no landlord is going to want to sit with a house empty waiting for a family to arrive at an unspecified time."" Oshi Owen has turned her former family home over to the refugee family But the group struck lucky when local Oshi Owen, who was thinking about moving from her five-bedroom house in Narberth, heard the group were looking for somewhere for the refugee family. Ms Owen said: ""I had thought about moving in September, but when the group were looking for somewhere for a family of refugees I just said I will somehow manage it and make it work and committed to move out by April."" She will be paid rent through housing benefit, although she said it is below what she could get for the house if it was privately rented. The group initially thought they might be able to have the family arrive in April and eventually the arrival date became July. Ms Owen said: ""I had to accept that for three months there wasn't going to be any rent coming in. ""But I would rather help people than it being about the money. It is about giving something to those in need."" She left some furniture in the house for the new tenants, while the community group cleared the garden and cleaned in preparation. Croeso Arberth had a small welcome party at the airport to meet the family of seven Ms Owen said neighbours were ""shocked"" to hear who was moving in, but ""really want to make the family welcome"". With the house spick and span there was a nervous wait before the refugees arrived on 13 July. As they walked through arrivals at Birmingham Airport they were greeted by a welcome party of interpreters and members of Croeso Arberth clutching balloons, chocolates and a big sign between them. BBC Wales have agreed not to identify Narberth's newest Syrian residents - but we can say they are an extended family of seven from a refugee camp in the Middle East. ""I can't believe it is all over with now,"" Mrs Hughes said. ""I would never have expected it to be such a big thing to undertake, but I feel like the family are going to be fine, and it is the start of a new chapter now with them here. Things will go wrong, but we will just have to play it by ear."" Croeso Arberth have plans to sponsor another group of refugees in the near future, but hope it will be easier next time. Mrs Hughes added: ""Because we have been one of the first groups to do this it has been a learning curve for us and the Home Office, but hopefully they will be able to do things faster for other groups and it will all move along a bit quicker. ""Obviously I still think about the people still in refugee camps, but I know I cannot do any more than I have done and am doing.""

"This video can not be played Should people with a mental illness be helped to die? A year ago, Canada legalised medically assisted suicide for terminally ill people approaching death. But one man's activism has forced Canada to ask difficult and controversial questions about the limits on an individual's right to die. In the basement of his father's home in Windsor, Ontario, Adam Maier-Clayton lays out orange prescription bottles full of pills. They contain just some of the medication that doctors have given him to treat his mental health condition. In a video posted on YouTube, he lists the anti-depressants, mood stabilisers and tranquilisers he's taken, as well as ""lots and lots of therapy"". Adam's mental health problems first emerged in childhood. He suffered from obsessive thoughts, depression and anxiety. Later, as a talented soccer player and prolific goal scorer, he'd bind his fingers with tape to try to stop his physical tics from distracting him from his game. But after experimenting with cannabis for the first time at the age of 23, Adam's symptoms worsened significantly. ""Man, it knocked him right off his tracks,"" his father Graham told me. Adam Maier-Clayton campaigned for expanding the limits of assisted dying legislation ""He was in and out of hospital for six or seven days. He suffered depersonalisation, a kind of 'other worldliness.' Doctors thought it was just a temporary effect of the drug - but it brought about a permanent change in him and things started to go downhill from there on."" Adam began experiencing crippling physical pain throughout his body. He described the experience as akin to being ""burned with acid"". Any kind of cognitive activity, such as reading, writing or even talking for more than a short time, made the pain worse and left him incapacitated for hours afterwards. He was diagnosed with Somatic Symptom Disorder, a psychiatric condition characterised by physical complaints that aren't faked but can't always be traced to a known medical illness. In June 2016, as Adam's bouts of pain were becoming ever more frequent and debilitating, Canada's federal parliament passed a landmark piece of legislation. Adam Maier-Clayton and his father, Graham Clayton The law is called Bill C-14. It legalises physician-assisted suicide, provided certain strict criteria are met. ""C-14 allows people who are broadly conceived to be at the end of life, who are 18 years old or older, who suffer from a serious disease or disability, who have irreversible decline in capabilities and who suffer unbearably to obtain medical assistance in dying - basically a doctor or a nurse who will be able to end their lives,"" explains Trudo Lemmens, Professor of Health Law and Policy at the University of Toronto. The boundaries permitting assisted suicide under Bill C-14 are deliberately narrow in scope - and exclude people suffering solely from a mental illness who aren't also grievously and terminally ill. Adam Maier-Clayton believed the law was ambiguous, unconstitutional and discriminatory. Convinced his condition was untreatable, he began a vocal campaign of media activism, arguing that Canada should follow the example of Belgium and the Netherlands. In those countries, people who believe their lives have become intolerable because of severe mental illness can seek permission to receive lethal drugs with a doctor or nurse's help. ""Every Canadian deserves this right, the right to have the ability to terminate pain that is chronic, incurable,"" he told the Canadian Press in September last year. Adam Maier-Clayton was diagnosed with Somatic Symptom Disorder But in cases of psychiatric illness, critics say, determining whether a person's condition is chronic and incurable isn't clear-cut. ""If we provide adequate mental healthcare, the majority of people will recover in a way that provides them with quality of life,"" argues Professor Lemmens. ""Yes, some people people will continue to suffer. Yes, some people will likely commit suicide - but at the outset we don't know who are the people who will not recover. That's very hard to determine."" Dr Michael Bach agrees. He's executive director of IRIS, a Toronto-based institute that works to improve the rights of people with disabilities. He's not totally opposed to euthanasia, but fears a creeping inevitability should the criteria for assisted suicide be widened. Once assisted suicide is made available to people with mental health problems, he says, more and more people are likely to be drawn to it before all their treatment options have been exhausted. ""To suggest that we can remediate suffering by terminating a life is a very strange logic,"" Dr Bach told me. ""We need to be careful not to provide an 'out' to tough situations. ""I don't want to say that we shouldn't do everything we can to minimise personal suffering. But we can't expect of medicine that we're going to eradicate suffering from life. Somehow that has emerged as the social and medical and political project."" The Supreme Court weighed in on medically-assisted suicide in 2015 Pro-euthanasia campaigners in Canada argue otherwise. They point to a Supreme Court decision from 2015 in the case of Carter v Canada, which they say makes no reference to terminal illness as one of the core criteria for a medically assisted death. ""The Supreme Court justices in that decision could have at any time put 'terminal illness' or 'imminently dying' as part of the decision - they did not,"" says Shanaaz Gokool, chief executive of Dying with Dignity Canada. ""What they looked at was the person, and the level and degree of suffering that they may have, that may be physical or psychological or psychiatric in nature. ""And so from that decision our Supreme Court justices said that, yes, there is a role here to ensure that people who have grievous and irremediable medical conditions, that cause them enduring and intolerable suffering for which there is no remedy acceptable to the person as long as they're an adult and they're clearly consenting, should be able to have an assisted death,"" Gokool says. Medically assisted dying for people with mental health problems is currently the subject of one of three reviews being carried out by the Council of Canadian Academies. A report is due before the end of next year, although its findings will be advisory and not binding on any future changes to legislation by Ottawa's lawmakers. The review, though, will come too late for Adam Maier-Clayton. On April 13th he drove to a motel just off Highway 401, ate breakfast, and then took his own life. Adam Maier-Clayton excelled at soccer He was 27. In his final Facebook post he wrote: ""I am my own saviour. Always have been. Always will be."" Following his death, Graham Clayton plans to continue his son's activism by campaigning for an extension of Canada's assisted suicide laws to include people with enduring mental illnesses. ""Adam didn't believe in suicide. He believed in suicide prevention,"" Mr Clayton told me. ""For the overwhelming majority of people there's hope. The research has been done. The medical treatment is there. If they have to go through a variety of different treatments and drug therapies to find what works, fine. Hang in there and stay the course. ""But when you know that you're in such a dire situation and the science hasn't been done it should be your call when you've had enough. ""If you're so inclined you should be able to ask for help - help in ending the pain."" If you are depressed and need to ask for help, there's advice on who to contact at BBC Advice.

"Casper Read was travelling alone to grandparents in Toulouse, France The mother of a boy taken off a plane at Gatwick due to a lack of seats is demanding EasyJet overhaul its ticketing process. Casper Read, 15, was travelling alone to grandparents in France when he was asked to leave the plane after a man was allocated the same seat. Stephanie Portal, from Worthing, West Sussex, said her son felt ""he had been kicked off and cheated"". EasyJet has apologised, offered compensation and is investigating. ""There was him and an adult for one seat and the adult was getting very angry about it all,"" Miss Portal said. ""I don't know if it was a random selection, or if they thought Casper would be the easier option to get off the plane, but it's wrong. ""He was asked to go to the cockpit - thinking he would be allocated another seat - but before he knew it, was taken outside the plane and told to go to the information desk. ""He was left to make his own way through the airport, nobody in departures to meet or help him, and despite there being three more flights that day was put on the latest one and had a 10 hour wait."" Casper Read had to wait 10 hours for the last flight of the day Miss Portal said a manager at EasyJet told her the airline overbooks its flights by up to five seats due to people often not showing up, and that it was the last people to check-in, not the last to buy their tickets, who were in danger of not getting a seat. ""The whole system needs an overhaul and the attitude of the attendants was irresponsible,"" she said. ""Children should never be pulled off a flight and the people who are should be given priority on the next one. ""Airlines cannot gamble on the probability of people not turning up."" ""Casper is quite laid back but he really felt he had been kicked off and cheated,"" she added. A spokesman for the airline said: ""EasyJet is sorry that Casper Read's flight from London Gatwick to Toulouse was overbooked on 20 July. ""We are investigating why he was able to board the aircraft as he should have been informed at the gate.

"This video can not be played Mayor Betsy Hodges was interrupted by angry protesters at a news conference about the resignation A police chief in the US state of Minnesota has resigned after one of her officers fatally shot an unarmed Australian woman. Justine Damond was killed after she called the police to report a woman screaming outside her home in a quiet suburb of Minneapolis last week. Police chief Janee Harteau had earlier said it ""should not have happened"". The city's mayor accepted her resignation, saying she had lost confidence in Ms Harteau. Ms Damond's death provoked outrage in her homeland, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called it ""inexplicable"" and ""a shocking killing"". The 40-year-old yoga and meditation teacher, originally from Sydney, was shot when she approached a police car after reporting a suspected rape. A lawyer for Ms Damond's family has called it""ludicrous""to suggest the two officers inside had feared an ambush. Australia waits for answers in US shooting Speaking at a news conference in Minneapolis shortly before her resignation was announced, Ms Harteau said the killing was ""the actions and judgement of one individual"". This video can not be played Police Chief Janee Harteau held a news conference before her resignation Officer Mohamed Noor, who shot Ms Damond in the abdomen, has refused to be interviewed by investigators, as is his legal right. Body cameras, which are worn by all Minneapolis police,had not been turned onat the time of the shooting and the squad car dashboard camera also failed to capture the incident. Chief Harteau said the cameras worn by Officers Noor and Matthew Harrity ""should have been activated"". Mayor Betsy Hodges said, in a written statement, that it was unacceptable for body cameras ""to fail us when we needed them most"". Justine Damond with her fiancÃ©, Don Fred Bruno, the lawyer for Officer Harrity, has said: ""It is reasonable to assume an officer in that situation would be concerned about a possible ambush."" However Robert Bennett, who represents Ms Damond's family, said she ""was not a threat to anyone"". He told CBS News: ""I think that [the ambush fear] is ludicrous. It's disinformation. It doesn't have any basis in fact."" Justine Damond's death: What we know Death raises questions about camera use Minneapolis police claim 'ludicrous' On Wednesday, police released the transcript of two separate 911 calls Ms Damond made after hearing screams nearby. ""I'm not sure if she's having sex or being raped,"" she told the police operator, before giving her address. This video can not be played Justine Damond's family held a silent vigil on Sydney's Freshwater Beach ""I think she just yelled out 'help', but it's difficult, the sound has been going on for a while,"" she continued.

"US actor Dick Van Dyke has apologised for what he called his ""atrocious Cockney accent"" in Mary Poppins, more than half a century after he played Bert the chimney sweep in the 1964 film. But the peculiarities of UK accents seem notoriously hard for foreign actors to master - so who also stands out for their bad British delivery? Van Dyke, who is from the US state of Missouri, said he had been teased for years over his Cockney accent in Mary Poppins. The 91-year-old wasrecently announced,externalas the recipient of a Bafta Britannia award for his work in TV, and said of the accolade: ""I appreciate this opportunity to apologise to the members of Bafta for inflicting on them the most atrocious Cockney accent in the history of cinema."" He recently announced that he would be doing a repeat performance in song and dance for theMary Poppins sequel, due out next year. New York-native Anne Hathaway's Yorkshire accent in One Day was deemed ""honkingly rubbish"" by the Telegraph, although a more sympathetic Guardian reviewerwrote,externalthat it was ""not as terrible as all that"". At the time, Hathaway told AP news agency about the difficulty of learning the accent: ""I was so nervous about it that I can't actually watch it for myself, but a lot of people who I trust... have told me that I have nothing to worry about."" Russell Brand attempted a Birmingham accent as Lonny Barnett, the sidekick of club owner Dennis Dupree, in the 2012 adaptation of the musical Rock Of Ages. Brand, from Essex, said he adopted the Brummie brogue as a nod to Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne. Commentators said Brand's performance took some getting used to, with theMetro,externalwriting it ""should get him banned from Birmingham"". ""They may take away our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"" Braveheart gained cult status for telling the story of the 13th Century Scottish warrior William Wallace, played by Australian-American Mel Gibson. Although his Scottish accentleft locals less than convinced, the film went to win five Oscars in 1996. Californian Kevin Costner's attempt at an English accent as Robin Hood in Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves has been widely mocked - not least in Mel Brooks's 1993 spoof Robin Hood: Men In Tights. In that film, British lead actor Cary Elwes quipped: ""Unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent."" Another bad Cockney was Don Cheadle's Basher Tarr, a munitions expert who used rhyming slang. Cheadle - like Dick van Dyke, from Missouri - later apologised for his accent in the three Ocean's films, telling an awards ceremony in LA in 2008: ""Forgive me! I won't do it again!"" He is known for his clipped English tones in the King's Speech and as Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice (above) - but Colin Firth's Texan accent in a US drama left some Americans confused, with his drawl deemed ""laughably bad"" in the US press.

"Mr Spicer's press briefings were a cable news hit White House press secretary Sean Spicer has moved to minimise talk of divisions within the Trump administration after announcing his resignation. Mr Spicer is reportedly stepping down because he is unhappy with President Donald Trump's appointment of a new communications director. But he told Fox News he had ""no regrets"" about his six-month stint. Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci has been picked for the role that Mr Spicer had partially filled. The shake-up at the White House comes amid several investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last year's US presidential election and whether Mr Trump's campaign team colluded with Moscow. ""The president obviously wanted to add to the team, more than anything,"" Mr Spicer told interviewer Sean Hannity. ""I just thought it was in the best interest of our communications department, of our press organisation, to not have too many cooks in the kitchen. ""Without me in the way, they have a fresh start, so that I'm not lurking over them."" He defended President Trump's agenda, saying it was an honour and a privilege to serve him, and hit out at what he termed ""media bias"". He said: ""I was increasingly disappointed about the way the media here do their job - or don't do their job."" Who is 'The Mooch'? My six hectic months with Sean Spicer The 45 year old also said he had told Mr Trump he ""would stay on for a few weeks to achieve a smooth transition"", and was looking forward to spending more time with his family. President Trumptweeted,external: ""Sean Spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media - but his future is bright!"" The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had ""vehemently"" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a ""major mistake"".

In an assured debut, he attended Friday afternoon's news conference to announce that Sarah Huckabee Sanders, formerly Mr Spicer's deputy, would step into his shoes. ""I love the president and it's an honour to be here,"" Mr Scaramucci said, adding: ""He is genuinely a wonderful human being."" Mr Scaramucci, who has no previous experience in communications roles, paid tribute to Mr Spicer as ""a true American patriot"" and ""incredibly gracious"". ""I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money,"" he added. This video can not be played It's his first day, and he has to say sorry to the boss Mr Scaramucci also apologised and said he had been ""unexperienced"" as he explained his previous criticism of the president. In an August 2015 interview with Fox Business, he dismissed Mr Trump as a ""hack"" and ""an inherited money dude"" with ""a big mouth"". Mr Scaramucci is currently senior vice-president of the Export-Import Bank, a US government agency which guarantees loans for foreign buyers of American exports. A former member of the Trump transition team, he mistakenly suggested to the BBC in January thatElton John would playat the new president's inauguration. The singer promptly denied it. Life on a White House staff is intense and exhausting. This administration is under particular pressure, given the ongoing Russia investigation, recent legislative setbacks and a president who can be, shall we say, occasionally off-message. Now cracks in the structure are beginning to show. Sean Spicer's departure, reportedly because he doesn't want to work for newly named communication director Anthony Scaramucci, represents the most significant shakeup within the administration's senior team to date. It could also be a sign of bigger tremors to come. Mr Spicer was closely allied with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was his boss last year in the Republican National Committee. The Trump team has been rife with personal feuds, as various factions vie for a mercurial president's ear. Leaks abound. The prestige and power of advisers and aides wax and wane. Media reports abound of a White House under siege. And just a reminder - the Trump presidency is only six months old. On day one in January, Mr Spicer set the tone of his relationship with the press by bursting into the briefing room to berate journalists for their reporting of crowd numbers at President Trump's inauguration. His proclivity for gaffes and garbling of his words, as well as making debatable assertions, soon made Mr Spicer a household name. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was named on Friday as the new White House press secretary But he could also be charming and was liked by many among the press corps. Mr Spicer was lampooned on topical comedy show Saturday Night Live, where Melissa McCarthy played him as a loud-mouthed bully who brandished his lectern at reporters. Mr Trump noted approvingly in April that Mr Spicer ""gets great ratings"". A month later, the president said: ""He's doing a good job but he gets beat up."" Mr Spicer was roundly mocked after he reportedly hid by a hedgerow on the White House grounds to avoid reporters on the night Mr Trump fired the FBI director in May. His last on-camera briefing was on 20 June, and there have been few since then. Members of the media have accused the Trump administration of attempting to kill off the daily news conferences to avoid scrutiny.
