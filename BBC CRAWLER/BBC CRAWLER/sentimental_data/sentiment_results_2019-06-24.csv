"The group says it is non-partisan, but praised Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax idea Some of America's richest people are urging US presidential candidates to back a wealth tax on the super-rich to improve inequality and climate change. ""America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more,"" they said in a letter. Signatories include investor George Soros, Facebook's co-founder Chris Hughes, and Molly Munger, daughter of billionaire Charlie Munger. The group said they were non-partisan and not endorsing any candidate. The open letter said,external: ""A wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms. Instituting a wealth tax is in the interest of our republic."" Among the 18 were a descendant of Walt Disney and the owners of the Hyatt hotel chain. Many in the group have been associated with progressive initiatives on issues such as climate change and the growing wealth gap. The letter pointed out that fellow billionaire Warren Buffett has said he is taxed at a lower rate than his secretary. While the group did not back a particular candidate, it praised a proposal by Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren that would raise taxes on those with more than $50m, a measure that would affect the 75,000 wealthiest families. She estimated that it would raise $2.75tn over 10 years. The letter alluded to support among Democratic presidential candidates for higher taxes on the super-wealthy, including Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke.

Taxing the super-wealthy ""would slow the growing concentration of wealth that undermines the stability and integrity of our republic,"" the letter said. It added: ""Today, major policies seldom come to pass without the prior support of wealthy elites or other wealthy interests.

"One Manchester-based dancer who was filmed said she feared the footage may be leaked Strippers have said they are ""angry and terrified"" after an anti-strip club campaign group carried out undercover filming of private nude dances. Not Buying It claimed the recordings in Victorias and Obsessions lap dancing clubs in Manchester showed breaches in licensing rules, including sexual acts. The group said covert filming was the ""only way to get anything done about the strip industry"". A union has compared it to ""revenge porn"". Not Buying It, which was set up to challenge exploitation in pornography and the sex trade, said it took the ""drastic step"" in March of hiring investigators to film strippers to ""expose how the industry really operates"". ""I consent to being on CCTV, I consent to it every night when I go to work [because it keeps me safe] but I don't consent to them filming me,"" said Daisy, who was filmed and whose name has been changed. ""We have a right to our body, despite what we do for a job, and they've taken that right completely away from us."" She said her biggest fear was the footage being leaked. Both Victorias and Obsessions offer ""full, nude"" lap dances in ""discreet"" private rooms. Not Buying It claimed to have filmed dancers both touching themselves sexually and ""straddling"" investigators, despite licensing rules forbidding contact. Investigators covertly filmed at Victorias and Obsessions in Manchester One dancer offered prostitution, the group claimed. But Daisy said: ""I certainly don't offer 'extras' and I don't know any other girls who do."" A spokesperson for Victorias said it had ""taken these allegations seriously"" and was co-operating fully with a council investigation. Victorias had ""not knowingly contravened or permitted the contravention of any term or condition of their licence,"" they added. Obsessions has also been approached for comment. Hen party rescue elderly man from flat fire Harassment 'part of being a shot girl' 'I hope my daughter will live with me again' Not Buying It said it chose to visit two lap dancing clubs in Manchester because of ""numerous, serious"" incidents linked to clubs in the city, but added: ""We have no doubt that they could have gone into any club in the country and found the same."" Campaigner Dr Sasha Rakoff said: ""We have been telling councils for years of the extreme harm and abuse of the strip industry. ""Nothing has been listened to."" Dr Rakoff said she hoped the filming would now show councillors the strip industry was ""hugely harmful and abusive"". Jan Williams, chairman of Object, a group which campaigns against the sexual objectification of women, said ""well-attested stories of strip clubs where dancers have to contravene rules in order to earn a living have been around forever"". ""There is no other way to prove this is going on currently other than to film,"" she added. But Daisy said ""the industry is legal"" and ""licensed"". ""I don't understand what they're trying to expose. When I go into work I feel completely in control. I am in control of my body, of who sees me, of what I do. I've lost that control, they've taken that away from me."" United Voices of the World Union (UVW), which represents workers in the sex industry, said it was appalled by the ""duplicitous 'sting' operations"" which had ""violated women's right to privacy."" ""Sharing undercover footage of naked women constitutes revenge porn and UVW will take legal action against anyone who uses this tactic to harm our members,"" it said. The footage collected has been sent to Manchester City Council, which said an investigation was ongoing. ""Our officers are nearing the conclusion of that investigation and will be contacting the management of the clubs in due course,"" said Rabnawaz Akbar, the council's executive member for neighbourhoods.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's home was renovated with Â£2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs, royal accounts show. Frogmore Cottage in Windsor was turned into a single property for Prince Harry and Meghan, from five separate homes. The couple, who moved from Kensington Palace in April before the birth of their son Archie, paid for fittings. The Queen's Sovereign Grant from the Treasury was Â£82m in 2018-19, with Â£33m set aside for maintenance, including major work on Buckingham Palace. The Sovereign Grant isfunded by profits from the Crown Estate.,external The estate is the Royal Family's commercial property arm and owns land and buildings in prime central London locations and across the UK.  It is managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers. Separate accounts show the Crown Estate provided a record Â£343.5m to the Treasury in 2018-19, up 4.3% on last year. Theroyal accounts,externalsaid the renovation of Frogmore Cottage was paid out of the Sovereign Grant and involved the ""reconfiguration and full refurbishment of five residential units in poor condition to create the official residence for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex"". The 19th Century, Grade II-listed, property was given to them by the Queen. It sits in the grounds of royal residence Frogmore House, where Prince Harry and Meghan held their wedding reception in May 2018. Who lived in Harry and Meghan's house? Harry and Meghan split from royal charity Harry and Meghan move to Windsor MPs back Â£369m Buckingham Palace revamp Defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced and inefficient heating systems updated. The house also required extensive rewiring - including an electrical sub-station - and the installation of gas and water mains. The refurbishment took about six months although some areas are yet to be completed, such as repainting the exterior. Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation in line with our responsibility to maintain the condition of the occupied royal palaces estate."" The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also carried out renovations before moving into their Kensington Palace home in 2013,spending more than Â£4m on converting offices into an apartment. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved to Frogmore Cottage in April Taxpayer-funded spending on the royals has been a sensitive topic for decades. That's why Palace officials went out of their way to explain how much had to be done to Frogmore Cottage, and how anything over basic fixtures and fittings would be paid for by the couple themselves. The Sovereign Grant is to cover the cost of official duties and for the upkeep of royal palaces. However, some will ask, why did the couple have to move out of Kensington Palace? And why, if they felt that strongly about it, didn't they pay for the refurbishment of the house in Windsor themselves? The Royal Family's ""core"" sovereign grant is based on 15% of the net surplus of the Crown Estate, and allocated two years in arrears. From 2017-18, the total grant was increased to 25% of the surplus for a 10-year period - with the extra funding intended to meet theÂ£369m costs of refurbishing Buckingham Palace. Excluding money transferred to reserves for future building work at the palace, the Queen's official expenses last year were Â£67m, a 41% year-on-year increase,the figures show.,external A large amount of the rise was due to the ongoing renovation at Buckingham Palace, and work on the other occupied royal residences. The campaign group Republic questioned why money had been spent on Frogmore Cottage at a time while public services were under financial pressure. Graham Smith, from Republic, called for a parliamentary inquiry into royal spending, adding: ""The general funds of the Treasury should not be spent on individual members of the royal family at all - even if we had all the money to spend on public services it should not be happening."" An independent commercial property business and one of the largest property portfolios in the UK The majority of assets are in London, but the estate also owns property in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Holdings include Windsor Great Park and Ascot racecourse, but most of the portfolio is made up of residential property, commercial offices, shops, businesses and retail parks Managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers Dates back from the time of the Norman Conquest Has been managed on behalf of the government since 1760 when George III handed over its running in return for an annual payment Funds the Sovereign Grant which supports the official duties of the Queen and maintains the occupied royal palaces The royal accounts show the cost of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall's official travel by air and rail funded by the Sovereign Grant rose by almost a third last year to Â£1.3m, as the couple took on more royal duties from the Queen. The report said there was a 98% increase in carbon emissions from flights used on official royal visits overseas in 2018-19 - going up to 3,344 tonnes of CO2 from 1,687. Buckingham Palace said the rise was ""due to higher usage of chartered large fixed wing aircraft for foreign business travel"", adding there was five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one the previous year. The trips are decided by the Foreign Office. The accounts also reveal the Duke of Edinburgh maintains an office with a private secretary and receives Â£359,000 annuity from the Treasury. Despite retiring from public duties in 2017, Prince Philip has an official relationship with hundreds of organisations and charities, Separately, the Prince of Wales pays for the public duties of Prince Harry and Meghan and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and some of their private costs, out of his Duchy of Cornwall income, which was Â£21.6m last year. Accounts from Clarence House show this funding - in the year Meghan officially joined the Royal Family - stood at just over Â£5m, up 1.8% on 2017-18.

"This video can not be played Plumes of smoke as fighter jets crash over Germany A pilot has been killed in an air collision involving two German air force Eurofighter jets in the MÃ¼ritz area of north-eastern Germany. While both pilots managed to eject from the planes, only one of them survived. One of the Eurofighters went down in a forest while the other crashed near a village about 10km (6 miles) away, the interior ministry in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania said. The pilot who survived was found dangling from a tree by rescue teams. The mid-air collision happened as three Eurofighter Typhoons were taking part in an air combat exercise shortly after 14:00 (12:00 GMT), about 20 minutes after they had taken off. The third pilot witnessed the collision over the Fleesensee and reported seeing two parachutes. ""All three aircraft were unarmed, and after 20 minutes for unknown reasons, two of the three Eurofighters touched each other in the air,"" air force commander Ingo Gerhartz said. ""According to the third pilot, who is of course still in shock, he could see the two parachutes attached to the eject seats and he confirmed that both parachutes could be seen."" File picture of two Eurofighter jets taking off from the same base near Rostock Local media showed footage of the smoke from both planes after they hit the ground. One of the pilots was found alive by rescuers near the village of Nossentiner HÃ¼tte, and residents said the fire brigade quickly brought the fire at the scene under control. The other was found dead, officials said. The mayor of Nossentiner HÃ¼tte, Birgit Kurth, told Germany's NDR radio station she was ""relieved"" that the pilot had survived and that the plane had not come down in the village or caused further damage. Police had earlier warned that debris from the crash had been strewn over a large area and could be dangerous. The second plane went down in a wooded area near the village of Jabel. Images of the crash site in Jabel showed officials surveying the area, with debris scattered across a field. An official stands alongside debris belonging to the Eurofighter jet that crashed near the village of Jabel The two planes were based at Laage near the district of Rostock, home to the ""Steinhoff"" Tactical Air Force Wing 73. Neither plane was carrying weapons. Built by a European consortium of Airbus, the UK's BAE Systems and Italy's Leonardo, the fighter costs around â¬90m (Â£80m). Germany's military has some 140 Eurofighter Typhoons but has struggled to keep them ready for combat. A report last year said only four of its planes were available because of a leak of cooling fluid in the wing sensors. What is it like to fly a Typhoon jet?

"Jeremy Hunt has urged Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson not to be ""a coward"" about facing public scrutiny. Mr Hunt said he was ""not interested"" in his private life but he should ""man up"" and debate with him on TV this week. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has warned the UK will face a ""democratic explosion"" if it does not leave the EU by 31 October. But Mr Hunt challenged him to reveal whether he would call a general election if MPs refused to allow the UK to leave without a deal on that date. After Prime Minister Theresa May failed to get her Brexit deal through Parliament earlier this year, the date of the UK's departure for the EU was moved to 31 October. Mr Johnson is under pressure to answer questions abouta row with his partner in the early hours of Fridaywhich led to police being called to his London home. The Metropolitan Police has said it will not be taking any further action over the incident and his supporters have rallied around him. Johnson 'should give row explanation' Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Former International Development Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a recording of the argument, given to the Guardian newspaper, was part of a ""politically-motivated series of attacks"". ""That is not the type of behaviour that you'd expect in our country, that's the type of behaviour associated with the old Eastern bloc,"" she added. Mr Johnson refused to answer questions about the incident at a hustings event on Saturday, instead insisting his stance on Brexit was what mattered to the public and to the Conservative Party members who will choose the next leader. In his Daily Telegraph column on Monday,,externalhe said of the 31 October deadline: ""This time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail."" He said it was ""disgraceful"" the UK was still in the EU three years after it voted to leave, and exiting the EU would ""renew the national faith in democracy"". He did not address questions about his private life in the column. This video can not be played Priti Patel said Mr Johnson would ""never"" comment on his personal life The BBC's Norman Smith says Mr Hunt's shift in language is striking. He is using a much more combative, pugilistic tone, our assistant political editor says, perhaps realising there is no point doing this softly and nicely because if he does, Mr Johnson is just going to walk into Number 10. Writing in the Times,external, Mr Hunt called for a ""fair and open contest, not one that one side is trying to rig to avoid scrutiny"". ""Only then can you walk through the front door of No 10 with your head held high instead of slinking through the back door, which is what Boris appears to want."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""very disrespectful"" of Mr Johnson to refuse to do ""any tough media interviews"" and urged him to take part in a Sky News leadership debate scheduled for Tuesday. The two men are due to face off on ITV in July, but by then voting papers will already have been sent to party members. Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? What is 'no deal'? Mr Hunt said he feared a government led by Mr Johnson would rapidly collapse, because he would be unable to hold together a coalition of supporters that range from MPs who back no deal to others who feel it would be totally unacceptable. ""If you are not clear about exactly what you are going to do, that coalition will collapse immediately and you will have Corbyn in Number 10,"" the foreign secretary said. He said Mr Johnson must explain how he could guarantee the UK would leave the EU on 31 October if Parliament voted to stop a no-deal Brexit,as it did in a non-binding votein March. Mr Hunt ruled out calling a general election in such a circumstance - saying it would destroy the Conservative Party - and demanded that Mr Johnson be clear whether he would do the same. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Health Secretary Matt Hancock, whowithdrew from the leadership contestafter coming sixth in the first ballot of the party's MPs, told BBC Breakfast Mr Johnson had the ""best chance"" of securing a new Brexit deal with the EU. Mr Hancock said it was ""total nonsense"" to suggest Mr Johnson was not open to scrutiny, drawing attention to the various hustings he has taken part in. ""He's got the energy, he's got the support from right across the party, and I think that's why he's the right man for the job,"" Mr Hancock added. In a separate development, defence minister Tobias Ellwoodtold the BBC's Panorama programmethat ""a dozen or so"" Conservative MPs would support a vote of no confidence in the government to stop a no-deal Brexit. A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules. Opponents say it would cause huge disruption at the borders and be catastrophic to many firms reliant on trade with the continent. Next month around 160,000 Conservative Party members will choose the next leader of the Tory Party - and the next prime minister. Members will receive their ballots between 6 and 8 July, with the new leader expected to be announced in the week beginning 22 July.

"Boris Johnson's tax proposals would cost ""many billions"" and benefit the wealthy the most, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Mr Johnson, the front-runner in the race to lead the Conservative Party, has outlined plans to raise the threshold for the higher rate of income tax to Â£80,000. The IFS said only 8% of individuals would gain in the short run. Changes to national insurance would help lower earners, the IFS said. Under Mr Johnson's proposals: the higher rate of tax would be paid on earnings over Â£80,000 (rather than the current threshold of Â£50,000) the point at which workers start paying national insurance contributions would rise, although a new threshold was not specified ""These are expensive pledges to cut tax [which] between them will cost many billions of pounds"", said Tom Waters, research economist at the IFS and co-author of the report. ""It is not clear that spending such sums on tax cuts is compatible with both ending austerity in public spending and prudent management of the public finances,"" he added. Following the financial crisis government spending was curtailed in order to reduce borrowing, but the government has recently signalled an easing of austerity. Mr Johnson's campaign team did not respond to an approach for comment on the IFS report. But earlier this monthhe told the Telegraph,externalhe would fund the income tax cuts partly by using money that had been set aside by the Treasury for a possible no-deal Brexit. ""We should be raising thresholds of income tax so that we help the huge numbers that have been captured in the higher rate by fiscal drag,"" Mr Johnson said. However during the televised leadership debate he described the tax plan as ""an ambition"" rather than a fixed policy. On Monday,in an interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson addressed questions over Britain's exit from the EU. The IFS said raising the threshold for the higher rate of tax would take around two and half million people out of the top income tax bracket and cost about Â£9bn. Top earners would gain an average of nearly Â£2,500 a year, the IFS said. But while in the short run only 8% of the population were set to benefit, more people would move into the Â£50,000 to Â£80,000 bracket as time went on and would enjoy a lower rate of tax as a result, it said. The numbers of those falling into the higher tax bracket had ""crept up"" over time, so that there are currently more than four million higher rate taxpayers, compared with one and a half million 30 years ago, the IFS said. Johnson defends Brexit plan and 'row' silence Who gets to choose the UK's next prime minister? Scale of Brexit task facing future PM Raising the point at which workers start to pay national insurance contributions would help low-earning individuals, the IFS said, although it benefited higher earners as well. The IFS said increases to tax credits would be a more effective way to help low income households. Mr Johnson is running against Jeremy Hunt in a vote by Conservative party members to be chosen as the next Conservative party leader and to take over from Theresa May as prime minister. Mr Hunt has said he is in favour of a plan to cut the tax on company profits from 17% to 12.5% from 2020.

"This video can not be played Edinburgh flooding: Rising water causes chaos Edinburgh and Stirling have been hit with flash flooding and thunder with one man stranded on a car roof. Heavy rain led to disruption in the west of the capital across Bankhead, Clermiston and Corstorphine. Tram services were temporarily shut down in some areas as flood water covered tracks. After soaking the capital, heavy rain made its way to Stirling, prompting warnings from police and Stirling Council about flash floods. A Tesco supermarket in the city appeared to have suffered a failure in its roof as a social media post showed water pouring into the store. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Jardine said: ""The water appears to have gone down as quick as it rose - but we're hearing terrible stories about people in other parts on top of cars. ""I'm worried about people coming home to flooded homes. The first thing we did was put the electricity off - if it gets into the wiring it can be dangerous. ""We've had heavy thunder from around 13:00 and I think the drains couldn't cope as we're at the foot of the hill."" The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for rain affecting much of the country. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) also issued five amber flood alerts for Fife, Edinburgh and Lothians, Dumfries and Galloway, Scottish Borders and West Central Scotland. Sepa tweeted: ""Heavy and persistent rainfall expected today, mainly across eastern regions with potential for localised impacts and surface water disruption.""

"""Operation burkini"" was launched by a group of Muslim and non-Muslim women in Grenoble Muslim women in France are disobeying the rules at a local swimming pool by wearing burkinis. In a protest inspired by US civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks, they bathed in suits covering their entire bodies - apart from the face, hands and feet - in the city of Grenoble on Sunday. The Jean Bron swimming pool is among many in France that ban burkinis. Many people in the country regard the swimsuit as a symbol of political Islam and incompatible with secularism. ""Operation burkini"" was launched last month by members of the group Citizen Alliance of Grenoble to defend what they say is the right of Muslim women. After changing into burkinis, the Muslim members of the group were told by lifeguards that their swimsuits were not allowed. Despite this, they entered the pool and bathed for about an hour with members of the community, many of whom cheered and applauded them for doing so. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC, two of the Muslim women involved in the protest, Hassiba and Latifa, said they should have the same rights as other citizens. ""We have a dream: to have fun in public swimming pools like all other citizens, to accompany our children whenever they want to have a swim while it is very hot in the summer here in Grenoble. ""We must fight against discriminatory policies and prejudice in France, as we are actually deprived of our civil rights of access to public services and city-owned infrastructures."" Why do some people find the burkini offensive? What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? In a Facebook post, the Citizen Alliance said the move was part of a campaign that began in May 2018 with a petition signed by more than 600 Muslim women urging the Genoble Mayor Ãric Piolle to reform the rules governing public swimming pools. Responding to events on Sunday, a member of France's centre-right party The Republicans, Matthieu Chamussy said: ""Political Islam is moving forward step by step and the cause of women receding.""

Burkinis, a mix of the words ""burka"" and ""bikini"", are marketed to Muslim women as a way for them to swim in public while adhering to modesty edicts. But the burkini remains controversial in France, where authorities in several French towns have proposed banning the garment altogether. In 2010, France became the first European country to ban the full-face veil in public. Ms Parks, the woman who inspired the ""operation burkini"" campaign, was arrested for refusing to give up her seat for white passengers in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. At the time, black travellers were required to pay at the front of the bus, leave it, walk to the back of the vehicle and then re-enter. They also had to give up their seats for white customers if the bus started filling up. Ms Parks' protest sparked a bus boycott and eventually led to the end of racial segregation on buses in the US.

"This video can not be played President Trump: '""The assets of Ayatollah Khamenei and his office will not be spared"" US President Donald Trump has said he is imposing hard-hitting new sanctions on Iran, including on the office of the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Mr Trump said the additional sanctions were in response to the shooting down of a US drone and ""many other things"". Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's highest authority, was singled out because he was ""ultimately responsible for the hostile conduct of the regime"". Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the Americans ""despise diplomacy"". In a tweet sent after the announcement,Mr Zarif also accused the Trump administration,externalof having a ""thirst for war"". Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words US-Iran relations: A brief history How US sanctions have hit Iran Tensions between the two countries have been escalating in recent weeks. However, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Mr Trump's executive order - which would lock up ""billions"" of dollars in Iranian assets - was in the works beforeTehran shot down an unmanned US drone in the Gulf last week. The UN Security Council has urged calm and the use of diplomacy. The US Treasury department said eight senior Iranian commanders who ""sit atop a bureaucracy that supervises the IRGC's [the elite Islamic Revolution Guard Corps] malicious regional activities"", were being targeted. Who is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei? Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards It added that Mr Trump's executive order would also ""deny Iran's leadership access to financial resources and authorises the targeting of persons appointed to certain official or other positions by the Supreme Leader or the Supreme Leader's Office"", as well as foreign financial institutions which help them conduct transitions. Sanctions will also be imposed on Mr Zarif later this week, according to Mr Mnuchin. Putting sanctions on the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is significant. He is indeed the Supreme Leader, with the ultimate say in Iran's politics and military - and he has enormous economic power. He supervises an organisation known as Setad, which confiscated property abandoned after the 1979 revolution and morphed into a business juggernaut with holdings of about $95bn (Â£75bn). Setad was already under US sanctions, but President Trump has gone further, targeting anyone connected to the Ayatollah - presumably including those sitting on company boards, or officials in his extensive ""shadow government"". So the US administration is tightening the squeeze on already draconian oil and financial sanctions and waiting to see if Tehran will eventually be forced to capitulate and accept negotiations. The US is demanding that Iran end its nuclear programme, curb its missile production and stop support for partner Arab militias. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the ""maximum pressure"" campaign is denying Iran revenue to support its regional military operations. That might be the more important goal for hawks such as Mr Pompeo, who has said he doesn't believe the Iranian regime can change in the way the US administration is demanding. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is Iran's highest authority Back in May 2018,the White House reinstated all sanctions removed under a 2015 nuclear dealmade with world powers which sought to prevent Iran creating its own nuclear weapon. Relations between the two nations continued to sour, and in May - a year after Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear deal -  the US stepped up pressure on Iran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. This video can not be played The BBC's Mark Lowen reports: ""It has sparked huge international tension"" This was followed by a series of attacks on tankers in the Gulf, which the White House said Iran was behind. Tehran has denied all allegations. Iranian officials then announced the country was set to breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium that was set under the 2015 deal on 27 June. Days later, the drone was shot down over what the US says was international waters, but Iran says was its territory. The sanctions - particularly those imposed on the energy, shipping and financial sectors - caused foreign investment to dry up and hit oil exports. They bar US companies from trading with Iran, but also with foreign firms or countries that are dealing with Iran. This video can not be played The BBC's James Landale went to Tehran's Grand Bazaar see what people think of the stringent sanctions This has led to shortages of imported goods and products that are made with raw materials from abroad, most notably babies' nappies. The plunging value of the national currency, the rial, has also affected the cost of locally produced staples such as meat and eggs, which have soared in price. Iran has responded to the economic pressure by saying it planned to violate some of the nuclear deal's commitments.It has also accused European countries of failing to live up to their promises of protecting Iran's economy from US sanctions. Iran's IRGC said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"". But US military officials maintain the drone was in international airspace over the Strait  of Hormuz at the time. Jonathan Cohen, acting Permanent Representative of the US to the UN, said Iran's argument was based on the drone being in the country's flight information region, which is different to a country's airspace. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a high-ranking officer in the IRGC, said another military aircraft, carrying 35 passengers, had been flying close to the drone. ""We could have shot down that one too, but we did not,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Brexit, privacy and his character Boris Johnson has admitted he would need EU co-operation to avoid a hard Irish border or the possibility of crippling tariffs on trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, the favourite to be the next PM said: ""It's not just up to us."" But he said he did ""not believe for a moment"" the UK would leave without a deal, although he was willing to do so. Asked about a row he'd had with his partner, he said it was ""simply unfair"" to involve ""loved ones"" in the debate. Reports of the argument on Friday with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, dominated headlines over the weekend after the police were called to their address in London. The interview comes afterSky News said it would have to cancel a head-to-head debateon Tuesday between the two leadership contenders as Mr Johnson had ""so far declined"" to take part. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Who chooses the next PM? Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told Radio 4's Today programme she found Mr Johnson's decision to ignore live TV debates ""very odd"" and urged him ""to reconsider"". Following days of criticism that he has been avoiding media scrutiny, Mr Johnson has given a number of other interviews, including with LBC and Talk Radio. On LBC, he was repeatedly challenged on his personal life and a photograph which showed him and his partner. Asked whether his campaign was behind the release of the picture, Mr Johnson refused to answer. He told Talk Radio's political editor Ross Kempsell he would ""not rest"" until the UK had left the EU, insisting Brexit would happen on 31 October ""come what may... do or die"". Meanwhile, the other candidate, Jeremy Hunt haspromised to boost defence spending by Â£15bnover the next five years if he becomes prime minister. In his interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Johnson said the existing deal negotiated by Theresa May ""is dead"". He insisted it was possible to broker a new deal with the EU before the end of October because the political landscape had changed in the UK and on the continent. ""I think actually that politics has changed so much since 29 March,"" he said, referring to the original Brexit deadline. ""I think on both sides of the Channel there's a really different understanding of what is needed."" Watch Laura Kuenssberg's interview in full Read the full transcript Compare the candidates Would obscure trade rule help with no-deal Brexit? At the moment, the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October after the PM's Brexit deal was rejected three times by Parliament, and the EU has previously said the withdrawal agreement reached with the UK cannot be reopened. Mr Johnson said he would be able to persuade Brussels to resolve the Irish border issue - a key sticking point - despite repeated warnings from EU leaders that that was impossible. He said there were ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" that could be made to avoid border checks. When challenged that these did not exist yet, Mr Johnson replied: ""Well, they do actually... in very large measure they do, you have trusted trader schemes, all sorts of schemes that you could put into place."" But, he admitted, there was ""no single magic bullet"" to solve the issue. Mr Johnson's really controversial gamble is to say he could do a new trade deal with EU leaders before the end of October. And he says he would be able to do that before resolving the most controversial conundrum - how you fix the dilemma over the Irish border. He clearly believes he has the political skill to pull that off. He and his supporters would say that is a plan. But it is a plan that is full of ifs and buts - either heroic or foolhardy assumptions to imagine that EU leaders and Parliament would be ready to back his vision - and back it by Halloween - on an extremely tight deadline. The political pressure is on, not just to get it done quickly, but done in a way that does not harm our relations with the rest of the world and the livelihoods of people living in this country. In terms of the controversies over his personal life, it is absolutely clear even now - when he is on the threshold of No 10 - that Boris Johnson thinks there are questions he simply does not have to answer. And for a politician about whose character many people have their doubts, that is going to follow him around unless and until he is willing to give more. Mr Johnson said if he was elected he would start new talks as soon as he reached Downing Street to discuss a free trade agreement. He also said he hoped the EU would be willing to grant a period of time where the status quo was maintained for a deal to be finalised after Brexit. He called this ""an implementation period"", but accepted this was not the same as the implementation period in the current draft treaty agreed with the EU. 'Don't be a coward,' Hunt tells Johnson Neighbour defends Johnson row recording Is it OK to tell someone to 'man up'? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Mr Johnson committed to passing new laws as soon as possible in order to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. The former foreign secretary also suggested EU leaders might change their attitude to renegotiation because they had Brexit Party MEPs they did not want in their Parliament, and wanted to get the Â£39bn that had been promised as part of the so-called divorce bill. And he said MPs could be more willing to back a revised deal because - after disappointing local and European elections last month - they realised both Labour and the Conservatives would face ""real danger of extinction"" if Brexit were to be stalled again. Mr Johnson refused again to give more detail of what happened at his home in the early hours of Friday. ""I do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones,"" he said. ""And there's a very good reason for that. That is that, if you do, you drag them into things that really is... not fair on them."" Instead of his private life, he said the public actually want to know ""what is going on with this guy?"" ""Does he, when it comes to trust, when it comes to character, all those things, does he deliver what he says he's going to deliver?"" Despite widespread criticisms from his fellow Conservatives that he cannot be trusted, Mr Johnson said anyone questioning his character was ""talking absolute nonsense"". He also refused to respond to accusations from rival Jeremy Hunt that he was being a ""coward"" for avoiding more head-to-head TV debates, promising that if elected he would ""govern from the centre right"" because the centre ""is where you win"". Ms Rudd, who is supporting Mr Hunt, said Mr Johnson was making a mistake by shying away from the debates and said he needed to ""go further"" in explaining his Brexit plan. ""This is an incredibly difficult situation and Boris needs to explain how he will deal with both sides of the Conservative Party that have concerns and try and break the impasse with the European Union. ""Enthusiasm and optimism is not sufficient."" Respondingto claims that a dozen Tory MPs would be prepared to bring down a governmentheading to a no-deal Brexit, she said: ""I think that's about right. I think it's slightly less than that, but it's certainly more than two."" Correction 7th August 2019: An earlier version of this article referred to crippling tariffs on trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit and has been amended to make clear that Boris Johnson was asked about this as a possibility.

"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year.

"Former deputy prime minister and Labour veteran John Prescott has been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke, his family has said. A statement on the 81-year-old's Twitter account said he was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary on Friday. He is ""over the worst"" and ""talking"", former Home Secretary Alan Johnson told the BBC. Ex-PM Tony Blair said,externalhis thoughts were with Lord Prescott, adding: ""Hoping very much that he gets better soon."" A statement from the family of Lord Prescott said the hospital staff had been ""remarkable and we cannot thank them enough"". ""He is receiving excellent care from the NHS,"" they said, praising the ""swift actions"" of the paramedics and A&E staff. Mr Johnson said Lord Prescott was enormously grateful for the care he had received. ""Now it's about the aftercare - it's what comes afterwards that is as important as what happens on the day of the stroke itself,"" he said. ""They want him to get proper rest to get over this, that's the number one priority, to recover and get over that important after-stage."" He said there had been no concerns for Lord Prescott's health in the days prior to the stroke and there were ""no signs of him slowing down at all"". The John Prescott story ""John is such an important figure now, as he has always been, in the Labour Party and I think there's enormous affection for him well beyond the Labour Party,"" Mr Johnson said. ""He's a character. Around Hull and East Yorkshire he's hugely respected, but it goes much wider."" John Prescott served as deputy prime minister under Tony Blair for 10 years A former trade union activist, Lord Prescott entered Parliament in 1970 as Labour MP for Hull East and went on to hold the seat for almost 40 years. He became a Labour frontbench spokesman in 1979 and joined the shadow cabinet in 1983, with responsibility for transport. He served as deputy to former Prime Minister Tony Blair for 10 years between 1997 and 2007, and received a peerage in 2010. At the height of his political career, Lord Prescott was a favourite target of the tabloids, dubbed ""Two Jags"" - after the two official Jaguar cars he is meant to have had at one point. He famously punched a man who had thrown an egg at him while on the 2001 general election campaign trail. ""John is John,"" Mr Blair said the following day, after pictures of the scuffle featured in the press around the world. In 1993, in what was perhaps his greatest claim to fame, he called for the end to the union block vote and was credited with saving the then Labour leader John Smith from a humiliating defeat. His role as a power-broker and counsellor smoothed the often strained relationship between Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, and also helped ensure a trouble-free transition from one leader to the other. He also provided an important link between the New Labour of Mr Blair and Mr Brown and the party's old Labour traditions. Lord Prescott was Labour MP for Hull East for almost 40 years As environment, transport and the regions secretary in 1997, he was a key player in agreeing Kyoto Protocol on climate change - an international agreement setting targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. In the early 2000s, he proposed an elected regional assembly, but this was rejected in the north-east in a 2004 referendum, with 78% voting against. After the news broke about Lord Prescott's health, Labour MPs sent him their best wishes. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his thoughts were with his ""good friend John and his family and friends at this difficult time"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The film reunites much of the original cast of the first movie, with some new additions such as Forky Toy Story 4, the long-awaited fourth film in the animated franchise, has broken global box office records for an animated movie. It earned $238m (Â£187m) since opening worldwide over the weekend, performing particularly well in Latin America and Europe. The filmstruggled in China,external, however, and also failed to meet expectations in the US, where its $118m (Â£93m) fell short of a predicted $140m (Â£110m). It comes 24 years after the first film. Film audiences' introduction to Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and their band of fellow toys in 1995 went on to make $395m (Â£310m) at the global box office. What did the critics make of Toy Story 4? It's been nine years since Toy Story 3 opened to rave reviews and became the first animated film to gross over $1 billion worldwide in ticket sales. There were some fears the latest instalment could underperform as many fans felt the third movie wrapped up the series so perfectly. However, the new film - which sees Woody, Buzz and the gang joined by a new homemade toy called Forky - has beenwarmly reviewed with a 98% fresh rating,externalon critical aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. Other new toys in the film include doll Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), Bunny and Ducky (Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key) and stunt motorbike rider Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves). Keanu Reeves' is the Canadian toy Duke Caboom in Toy Story 4 In a widely-viewed Twitter thread, US journalist Mark Harris suggested the fact the star-studded film failed to match expectations was because ""endless brand extensions are starting to bore people"".

"This video can not be played Who are the Conservative Party members? Conservative MPs may have whittled the contenders in the leadership race down to the final two - but it will not be politicians who will decide who gets to be the next prime minister. Instead it will be the party's grassroots members who will decide which of Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson gets to succeed Theresa May. They will do so in a postal ballot, with the winner announced in the week beginning 22 July. In other words, it is members of the public - those who pay Â£25 a year to join the Conservative Party - who get the final say on who leads the country. There will not be a general election because the party is already in power. So, who are the Conservative Party's members and what do they think on key issues, not least, of course, Brexit? The Conservative Party membership iscurrently thought to be around 160,000,external- a rise of more than 30,000 in the past 12 months. The last time official figures were released was in March 2018, when they put the figure at 124,000. Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? That is way down on the peak of nearly 3 million that the party boasted in the early 1950s. The Tories have far fewer members than the Labour Party. Even if we assume that Labour's membership has fallen from the late 2017 peak of more than 550,000, it still has a huge advantage over the Conservatives when it comes to campaigning on the ground. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? How much difference does going to a top US university make? The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Right now, however, none of that matters as much as the fact that those 160,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party have a crucial role. They are going to be choosing the next prime minister of a country of over 65 million people - something which has never happened before. From studies of the 124,000 members that the party had in 2018, we know quite a lot about who they are and their beliefs. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: some 86% of them fall into the ABC1 category used by market researchers to describe the top social grade. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters and, indeed, the members of other parties. On the other hand, the fact that 97% of Conservative Party members are white doesn't do much to distinguish them from their counterparts in other parties. It does inevitably mean, however, that ethnic minorities, who make up well over 10% of British people, are heavily under-represented in the Tory rank and file. So, too, are women. Other parties - notably Labour and the Greens, but also the SNP - now come close to gender balance, but seven out of 10 Conservative members are male. Tory members are also older than the members of most other parties. True, their average age may ""only"" be 57, but this disguises the fact that four out of 10 are over 65. They are concentrated in the southern half of England. Nearly 60% of Tory members live in London, the east, south-east and south-west. So much for demography and geography.  What about ideology? Well, not surprisingly, Tory Party members are more right-wing than the population as a whole. On a scale where zero represents very left-wing and 10 very right-wing, the average voter places themselves at the centre point. The average Conservative Party member places themselves at 7.6. Laura Kuenssberg: May was just overwhelmed Premiership in six charts The Theresa May story Certainly, grassroots Tories are socially conservative. Three-quarters of them believe, for instance, that young people today don't have enough respect for traditional values. Nearly six out of 10 support the death penalty. They are also conventionally right-wing on some aspects of economic policy. For example, only 15% of them believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off. But on other issues they hold views that may be more unexpected. A third of Tory rank-and-file members believe that ordinary working people do not get their fair share of the nation's wealth and that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. About half believe that big business takes advantage of ordinary people. Interestingly, they have also cooled on austerity. In the summer of 2015, some 55% said government spending cuts hadn't gone far enough, but two years later that had fallen to 28%. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit amid a backlash against Brexit plans What Tory members haven't cooled on, however, is Brexit. Indeed, since we started tracking them in 2015, they've hardened their position. It is clear that they are not supporters of the deal negotiated by Theresa May. In fact, it is now the case that fully two-thirds of them back a no-deal Brexit - an outcome supported by only a quarter of voters as a whole. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Nor are they in the least bit keen on the idea of letting the public have another say on the UK's EU membership. Some 84% of them oppose the idea of a new referendum on the issue. In short, the grassroots aren't simply sceptical on Europe; they can't wait to leave, whatever that might take. Furthermore, a breakdown of YouGov polling data suggests that the 30,000 or so members who have joined in the past year are even more likely to be pro-Brexit. This, then, is the Conservative Party electorate. And those MPs hoping to succeed Mrs May will need to pitch their promises accordingly.

"New cases are understood to include still births and deaths of babies in the final stages of labour The number of cases uncovered by a maternity review at hospitals in Shropshire has more than doubled. In 2017,then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced an investigationinto avoidable baby deaths at SaTH, which runs Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal. NHS Improvement has now asked for the total of deaths, still births and babies with brain damage since 1998. It said they were not necessarily the result of sub-standard care. BBC Social Affairs Correspondent Michael Buchanan said 300 new cases of concern had come to light since NHSI asked SaTh for details on all cases of potential errors. The independent review, being led by midwife Donna Ockenden, was already investigating250 cases. Latest news from the West Midlands It initially focused on 23 cases in which maternity failings were alleged. But by March, 250 families had come forward, although it is understood not all the cases related to death or serious harm. What do we know about the review? Baby death investigation 'not watered down' Temporary new boss for under-fire trust The trust, which wasput into special measures in November, was also made subject to""further urgent action"" in Mayamid safety concerns over emergency and maternity services, following an inspection by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Rhiannon Davies pictured with her daughter Kate, who was born at Ludlow Community Hospital Rhiannon Davies,whose baby Kate died in 2009, said she was ""shocked but not surprised"" by an increase in numbers. ""The Ockenden Review team continues to have my full support and needs to be given full and public support from the Department of Health down,"" she said. ""Whilst any increase in numbers will likely result in another delay to the official findings of the review, I am prepared to wait - because this has to be done once and done properly for the sake of everyone affected."" An NHSI spokesman said: ""As part of the independent Ockenden Review, the trust was requested to share all potentially relevant information relating to maternity to establish if any more cases should be included in this investigation so that all families are given the answers they need and lessons are learned."" By BBC Social Affairs Correspondent Michael Buchanan NHS regulators have had to be dragged to acknowledge the potential scale of failings at this trust. The original inquiry was instigated by two sets of parents going through newspaper clippings, and forcing the then health secretary to recognise their concerns and set up what has become known as the Ockenden Review. These new cases were uncovered after NHSI finally put pressure on the trust last autumn to open up its books, rather than relying on families to highlight their own cases. However, they didn't turn the screw until more than 18 months after Jeremy Hunt asked regulators to investigate the problems. Not everyone whose case is being highlighted will have been failed. But there was clearly a cultural problem at this trust, spanning more than a decade, that allowed far too many errors to be committed, allowed healthy babies to die or to be harmed unnecessarily. The potential scale of those mistakes is now, perhaps finally, being revealed.

"This video can not be played Edinburgh flooding: Rising water causes chaos Edinburgh and Stirling have been hit with flash flooding and thunder with one man stranded on a car roof. Heavy rain led to disruption in the west of the capital across Bankhead, Clermiston and Corstorphine. Tram services were temporarily shut down in some areas as flood water covered tracks. After soaking the capital, heavy rain made its way to Stirling, prompting warnings from police and Stirling Council about flash floods. A Tesco supermarket in the city appeared to have suffered a failure in its roof as a social media post showed water pouring into the store. Allow Twitter content?

""I'm worried about people coming home to flooded homes. The first thing we did was put the electricity off - if it gets into the wiring it can be dangerous. ""We've had heavy thunder from around 13:00 and I think the drains couldn't cope as we're at the foot of the hill.""

"Health and beauty chain Boots has started to replace plastic bags with brown paper bags in an attempt to cut down on the use of single-use plastic. The retailer is also introducing unbleached paper dispensing bags for prescriptions. However, prescriptions assembled at its central pharmacy will still be sent out in plastic packaging, apractice that has been criticised by customers. Boots says these bags need to be durable and the plastic is recyclable. The new paper bags will initially be available in 53 of its 2,485 stores, with all of Boots' outlets using paper by early 2020, and are aimed at customers who have not brought their own bag. The bags will cost 5p, 7p and 10p - the current plastic ones come in two 5p and 10p sizes - and, as is the case now, profits from the bags will go to BBC Children in Need. The paper bags in England are not subject to the carrier bag levy, but they will be in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? Boots warns of possible store closures Boots UK signed up to the UK Plastics Pact last year and said at the time it was ""committed to reducing single-use plastic"". It said it had been looking for ways to change its use of plastic before last month's stories about the use of plastic by its centralised pharmacy - which can handle services such as repeat prescriptions. For these central facilities, it is looking at alternative packaging, such as using potato starch or a paper alternative, but in the meantime the centralised pharmacy will move to a minimum of 60% recyclable content plastic from July. There is a debate about the impact of replacing plastic with paper. While paper bags require marginally fewer reuses than bags for life to make them more environmentally friendly than single-use plastic bags, they are less durable than other type of bags. Greenpeace's senior oceans campaigner Louise Edge said: ""If our oceans had a doctor, what they would order is a drastic cut in the amount of single-use plastic in circulation. So it's great to see a major High Street brand like Boots listening to public concerns and ditching plastic bags. ""But retailers need to be careful that by swapping plastic for paper they don't end up shifting the problem from our oceans to our forests. This is why as well as looking for new materials for their carrier bags, High Street chains should also encourage their customers to bring their own reusable bags and truly tackle the throwaway culture that's damaging our living world."" Helen Normoyle, director of marketing at Boots UK, said the paper bags ""have been carefully tested to make sure that over their entire life cycle they are better for the environment, whilst still being a sturdy, practical option for customers who haven't bought their own bags with them when shopping"". ""We have seen a significant shift in our customers' attitudes towards plastics and recycling in recent years - there's never been a more important time to show our customers that we're taking action to reduce our impact,"" she added. The change to paper bags - which are made from recycled brown paper and printed with water-based inks -  is intended to remove 900 tonnes of plastic from Boots' store operations each year. Its website shows that in the 1870s - when it started it out - products were sold in paper and wrapped in string. Other retailers,such as Morrisons, have introduced paper bags, whileWaitrose is piloting a schemewhere customers use their own containers. Boots is owned by US company Walgreens Boots Alliance, which warned in April it was considering store closures to save costs. The move comes afterthe chain said,externalit had suffered its ""most difficult quarter"" since the firm's formation, with UK like-for-like sales down 2.3%.

"Tobias Ellwood was speaking to the BBC's Panorama ""A dozen or so"" Conservative MPs could support a vote of no confidence to stop a no-deal Brexit, defence minister Tobias Ellwood has told the BBC. He told Panoramathat many backbenchers and ministers would rebel if the UK faced leaving the EU on the 31 October deadline without a legal agreement. Boris Johnson, the favourite to succeed Theresa May as Tory leader, says the UK must leave by that date, come what may. If the government lost a confidence vote, it could trigger an election. A vote of no confidence lets MPs decide whether they want a government to continue. A 14-day countdown is started if a majority of MPs vote for the motion - and a general election will be called if, during that period, the government or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence. What is a vote of no confidence? 'Don't be a coward,' Hunt tells Johnson Johnson and Hunt make pitch to be PM The current government has a working Commons majority - its effective numerical advantage over all the other parties - of just four and depends on the backing of the Democratic Unionists. This makes it highly vulnerable to defeat if a small number of its MPs side with Labour and other opposition parties. Theresa May survived a no confidence vote in January after MPs rejected her Withdrawal Agreement with the EU for the first time. At the time, no Tory MPs backed the move. But MPs have suggested this could change if the next prime minister - whether it is Boris Johnson or his rival Jeremy Hunt - tries to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October without a legally-binding agreement. A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules. What is 'no deal'? Can Parliament stop no deal? Opponents say it would cause huge disruption at the borders and be catastrophic to many firms reliant on trade with the continent. But it remains the default legal outcome unless the EU grants the UK another extension to the Brexit process. Asked if Conservatives opposed to a no-deal Brexit had the ""numbers"", Mr Ellwood told Panorama: ""I believe that absolutely is the case. ""I think a dozen or so members of Parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no deal, and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers."" Tory former chancellor and pro-European Ken Clarke suggested he would be prepared to bring down a Conservative government to avoid a no-deal Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""It depends on the circumstances at the time... ""But I am not going to vote in favour of a government that says it is going to pursue policies which are totally incompatible with everything the Conservative Party has stood for under all those prime ministers for the decades that I have been in Parliament."" But Conservative MP Marcus Fysh, a supporter of Mr Johnson's, said such ""negative"" comments from his colleagues were ""unwise"". He said Mr Johnson was the only person able to reassure MPs and the public that the UK was properly prepared for the eventuality of a no-deal exit and could make the best of it. Meanwhile, Change UK, Parliament's newest political party - which has five MPs - says it will back a no confidence vote in the government to avoid a no-deal Brexit. This is a change from the party's suggestion in April that it would back the government in such a circumstance because its MPs did not believe a general election would solve the Brexit deadlock. A Change UK spokesman said: ""If faced with the prospect of crashing out of the EU with no deal, MPs from all parties must put our country first and support a vote of no confidence in the government. ""No deal would be a disaster for the UK's economy, for people's livelihoods and for our reputation on the international stage."" Brexit was supposed to happen on 29 March but the UK was given an extra seven months to try and get Parliament's approval for the terms of withdrawal, rejected three times by MPs. In his Daily Telegraph column on Monday,,externalMr Johnson said of the new 31 October deadline: ""This time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail."" But Mr Hunt challenged his rival to reveal whether he would call an election, something he himself has ruled out, if MPs refused to allow the UK to leave without a deal on that date. He said he feared a government led by Mr Johnson would rapidly collapse, because he would be unable to hold together a coalition of supporters that range from MPs who back no deal to others who feel it would be totally unacceptable. ""If you are not clear about exactly what you are going to do, that coalition will collapse immediately and you will have Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10,"" the foreign secretary said. The Race For No 10 will be broadcast on Panorama on BBC One at 20.30 BST on 24 June.

"The film reunites much of the original cast of the first movie, with some new additions such as Forky Toy Story 4, the long-awaited fourth film in the animated franchise, has broken global box office records for an animated movie. It earned $238m (Â£187m) since opening worldwide over the weekend, performing particularly well in Latin America and Europe. The filmstruggled in China,external, however, and also failed to meet expectations in the US, where its $118m (Â£93m) fell short of a predicted $140m (Â£110m). It comes 24 years after the first film. Film audiences' introduction to Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and their band of fellow toys in 1995 went on to make $395m (Â£310m) at the global box office. What did the critics make of Toy Story 4? It's been nine years since Toy Story 3 opened to rave reviews and became the first animated film to gross over $1 billion worldwide in ticket sales. There were some fears the latest instalment could underperform as many fans felt the third movie wrapped up the series so perfectly. However, the new film - which sees Woody, Buzz and the gang joined by a new homemade toy called Forky - has beenwarmly reviewed with a 98% fresh rating,externalon critical aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. Other new toys in the film include doll Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), Bunny and Ducky (Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key) and stunt motorbike rider Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves). Keanu Reeves' is the Canadian toy Duke Caboom in Toy Story 4 In a widely-viewed Twitter thread, US journalist Mark Harris suggested the fact the star-studded film failed to match expectations was because ""endless brand extensions are starting to bore people"".

"""Operation burkini"" was launched by a group of Muslim and non-Muslim women in Grenoble Muslim women in France are disobeying the rules at a local swimming pool by wearing burkinis. In a protest inspired by US civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks, they bathed in suits covering their entire bodies - apart from the face, hands and feet - in the city of Grenoble on Sunday. The Jean Bron swimming pool is among many in France that ban burkinis. Many people in the country regard the swimsuit as a symbol of political Islam and incompatible with secularism. ""Operation burkini"" was launched last month by members of the group Citizen Alliance of Grenoble to defend what they say is the right of Muslim women. After changing into burkinis, the Muslim members of the group were told by lifeguards that their swimsuits were not allowed. Despite this, they entered the pool and bathed for about an hour with members of the community, many of whom cheered and applauded them for doing so. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC, two of the Muslim women involved in the protest, Hassiba and Latifa, said they should have the same rights as other citizens. ""We have a dream: to have fun in public swimming pools like all other citizens, to accompany our children whenever they want to have a swim while it is very hot in the summer here in Grenoble. ""We must fight against discriminatory policies and prejudice in France, as we are actually deprived of our civil rights of access to public services and city-owned infrastructures."" Why do some people find the burkini offensive? What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? In a Facebook post, the Citizen Alliance said the move was part of a campaign that began in May 2018 with a petition signed by more than 600 Muslim women urging the Genoble Mayor Ãric Piolle to reform the rules governing public swimming pools. Responding to events on Sunday, a member of France's centre-right party The Republicans, Matthieu Chamussy said: ""Political Islam is moving forward step by step and the cause of women receding.""

Burkinis, a mix of the words ""burka"" and ""bikini"", are marketed to Muslim women as a way for them to swim in public while adhering to modesty edicts. But the burkini remains controversial in France, where authorities in several French towns have proposed banning the garment altogether. In 2010, France became the first European country to ban the full-face veil in public. Ms Parks, the woman who inspired the ""operation burkini"" campaign, was arrested for refusing to give up her seat for white passengers in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. At the time, black travellers were required to pay at the front of the bus, leave it, walk to the back of the vehicle and then re-enter. They also had to give up their seats for white customers if the bus started filling up. Ms Parks' protest sparked a bus boycott and eventually led to the end of racial segregation on buses in the US.

"Former deputy prime minister and Labour veteran John Prescott has been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke, his family has said. A statement on the 81-year-old's Twitter account said he was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary on Friday. He is ""over the worst"" and ""talking"", former Home Secretary Alan Johnson told the BBC. Ex-PM Tony Blair said,externalhis thoughts were with Lord Prescott, adding: ""Hoping very much that he gets better soon."" A statement from the family of Lord Prescott said the hospital staff had been ""remarkable and we cannot thank them enough"". ""He is receiving excellent care from the NHS,"" they said, praising the ""swift actions"" of the paramedics and A&E staff. Mr Johnson said Lord Prescott was enormously grateful for the care he had received. ""Now it's about the aftercare - it's what comes afterwards that is as important as what happens on the day of the stroke itself,"" he said. ""They want him to get proper rest to get over this, that's the number one priority, to recover and get over that important after-stage."" He said there had been no concerns for Lord Prescott's health in the days prior to the stroke and there were ""no signs of him slowing down at all"". The John Prescott story ""John is such an important figure now, as he has always been, in the Labour Party and I think there's enormous affection for him well beyond the Labour Party,"" Mr Johnson said. ""He's a character. Around Hull and East Yorkshire he's hugely respected, but it goes much wider."" John Prescott served as deputy prime minister under Tony Blair for 10 years A former trade union activist, Lord Prescott entered Parliament in 1970 as Labour MP for Hull East and went on to hold the seat for almost 40 years. He became a Labour frontbench spokesman in 1979 and joined the shadow cabinet in 1983, with responsibility for transport. He served as deputy to former Prime Minister Tony Blair for 10 years between 1997 and 2007, and received a peerage in 2010. At the height of his political career, Lord Prescott was a favourite target of the tabloids, dubbed ""Two Jags"" - after the two official Jaguar cars he is meant to have had at one point. He famously punched a man who had thrown an egg at him while on the 2001 general election campaign trail. ""John is John,"" Mr Blair said the following day, after pictures of the scuffle featured in the press around the world. In 1993, in what was perhaps his greatest claim to fame, he called for the end to the union block vote and was credited with saving the then Labour leader John Smith from a humiliating defeat. His role as a power-broker and counsellor smoothed the often strained relationship between Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, and also helped ensure a trouble-free transition from one leader to the other. He also provided an important link between the New Labour of Mr Blair and Mr Brown and the party's old Labour traditions. Lord Prescott was Labour MP for Hull East for almost 40 years As environment, transport and the regions secretary in 1997, he was a key player in agreeing Kyoto Protocol on climate change - an international agreement setting targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. In the early 2000s, he proposed an elected regional assembly, but this was rejected in the north-east in a 2004 referendum, with 78% voting against. After the news broke about Lord Prescott's health, Labour MPs sent him their best wishes. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his thoughts were with his ""good friend John and his family and friends at this difficult time"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"New cases are understood to include still births and deaths of babies in the final stages of labour The number of cases uncovered by a maternity review at hospitals in Shropshire has more than doubled. In 2017,then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced an investigationinto avoidable baby deaths at SaTH, which runs Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal. NHS Improvement has now asked for the total of deaths, still births and babies with brain damage since 1998. It said they were not necessarily the result of sub-standard care. BBC Social Affairs Correspondent Michael Buchanan said 300 new cases of concern had come to light since NHSI asked SaTh for details on all cases of potential errors. The independent review, being led by midwife Donna Ockenden, was already investigating250 cases. Latest news from the West Midlands It initially focused on 23 cases in which maternity failings were alleged. But by March, 250 families had come forward, although it is understood not all the cases related to death or serious harm. What do we know about the review? Baby death investigation 'not watered down' Temporary new boss for under-fire trust The trust, which wasput into special measures in November, was also made subject to""further urgent action"" in Mayamid safety concerns over emergency and maternity services, following an inspection by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Rhiannon Davies pictured with her daughter Kate, who was born at Ludlow Community Hospital Rhiannon Davies,whose baby Kate died in 2009, said she was ""shocked but not surprised"" by an increase in numbers. ""The Ockenden Review team continues to have my full support and needs to be given full and public support from the Department of Health down,"" she said. ""Whilst any increase in numbers will likely result in another delay to the official findings of the review, I am prepared to wait - because this has to be done once and done properly for the sake of everyone affected."" An NHSI spokesman said: ""As part of the independent Ockenden Review, the trust was requested to share all potentially relevant information relating to maternity to establish if any more cases should be included in this investigation so that all families are given the answers they need and lessons are learned."" By BBC Social Affairs Correspondent Michael Buchanan NHS regulators have had to be dragged to acknowledge the potential scale of failings at this trust. The original inquiry was instigated by two sets of parents going through newspaper clippings, and forcing the then health secretary to recognise their concerns and set up what has become known as the Ockenden Review. These new cases were uncovered after NHSI finally put pressure on the trust last autumn to open up its books, rather than relying on families to highlight their own cases. However, they didn't turn the screw until more than 18 months after Jeremy Hunt asked regulators to investigate the problems. Not everyone whose case is being highlighted will have been failed. But there was clearly a cultural problem at this trust, spanning more than a decade, that allowed far too many errors to be committed, allowed healthy babies to die or to be harmed unnecessarily. The potential scale of those mistakes is now, perhaps finally, being revealed.

"Poverty campaigners have written to Nicola Sturgeon urging her to bring forward the timetable for a new benefit to tackle child poverty. The Scottish government has said the family income supplement will be introduced in 2022. However, charities have said this date is too far away and called on the first minister to introduce it sooner. Ministers are due to update parliament on Wednesday about plans to ""top up"" the earnings of low-income parents. Full timetable for Scots welfare agency Poverty report backs benefits top up Poverty fight 'needs deeds and not words' However, campaigners hope legislation will be included in the next programme for government, with an interim version brought in ahead of legislation being passed. A total of 70 signatories - including academics, children's charities, trade unions, women's groups and faith leaders - penned a joint letter which said the benefit would provide a ""valuable lifeline"" for 240,000 children living in poverty in Scotland. SallyAnn Kelly, CEO of the children's charity Aberlour, said: ""Waiting until 2022 is too late for many families who are struggling now and the 240,000 children living in poverty. ""Working with families across Scotland every day we see how many of them are at risk of falling deeper into financial hardship and being exposed to the worst effects of poverty and related toxic stress. ""The Scottish government must use the powers available to them before it's too late."" Peter Kelly, of the Poverty Alliance, added that urgent action was required, as ""the equivalent of one classroom of children a day [is] being pulled into poverty in Scotland."" Commenting on the letter, Children and Young People's Commissioner Bruce Adamson said child poverty was ""the most significant human rights issue facing children in Scotland"". He added that ""living in poverty affects every aspect of a child's life"", and that addressing the issue had to be a ""priority"". Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the government's first Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan, published last year, ""outlined the range of actions to be taken to help meet our child poverty targets, backed by a Â£50m fund"". She continued: ""Our actions include working on development of a new income supplement and we have involved stakeholders, including Poverty Alliance and many of their signatories, in that work. ""A one-year progress report on the delivery plan will be given to parliament on Wednesday.""

"West Midlands Police announced 'Project Guardian' to tackle youth violence and knife crime A police force has revealed plans to spend Â£7m tackling youth violence after declaring knife crime a ""national emergency"". West Midlands Police said the majority of the ""Project Guardian"" funding would go towards preventing knife crime. The force will focus more resources on Birmingham's night-time economy and mediation services for young people. Critics said the funding was not enough and the plan relied too heavily on police officers working overtime. David Jamieson declared knife crime was a ""national emergency"" earlier this year The plans include recruiting 75 new police staff investigators for a year, spending Â£1.5m on diversion, mediation, support and mentoring projects, 15 police cars and newmetal detecting ""knife wands"". The force will also give Â£100,000 to young people to improve their communities ""via local initiatives"". West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) David Jamieson acknowledged the funding was ""short term"" but said the investment was ""to break the cycle of crime"". Latest news from the West Midlands ""Earlier this year I declared knife crime to be anational emergency,"" he said. ""Project Guardian is a vital part of West Midlands Police's response to that emergency."" Over the next year, the force has pledged to fund an extra 163,400 policing hours using existing officers working overtime. ""It's not an ideal solution, but it's what we've been reduced to,"" Richard Cooke, the West Midlands Police Federation Chair, told the BBC. He added that after a spate of violence in whichthree local teenagers were murdered in 12 days, the force relied again on officers working overtime. The three teenagers stabbed to death in 12 days: (l-r) Hazrat Umar, 18, Abdullah Muhammad and Sidali Mohamed, both 16 ""We're having to use overtime to plug the gaps when what we should have is a police force that's fit for purpose,"" he said. Lynne Baird's son Daniel 26, was stabbed to death in Birmingham in 2017. She has since campaigned forspecialist first aid kits, which have been installed in more than 50 bars and clubs in the cityto help reduce deaths from knife attacks. Widower ending 4,250 mile cancer walk 'People spat at you - they were horrible' Could we all be better off renting? Daniel Baird was stabbed outside The Forge Tavern in the Digbeth area of Birmingham Ms Baird said there were ""good parts"" to the plan, but had hoped to see more neighbourhood police officers on the streets. ""That is what you used to see,"" she said. ""They could sometimes spot a problem before it was going to happen. ""On the whole it looks quite promising. It is badly needed and I think the police and crime commissioner has tried his best to do what he can."" Joshua Ribera was stabbed near TC's nightclub in Selly Oak Alison Cope's son Joshua Ribera was stabbed through the heart near TC's nightclub in Selly Oak in 2014. She added: ""When you see more money being thrown at the situation, you want to make sure it is allocated correctly, regulated and audited correctly, so it doesn't go in a poof of smoke. ""I hope it goes in the right areas and the right places. ""For me, there needs to be a combination of things. Long term prevention which makes young people think enough to engage with positive activities, engagement, family support and extra police on streets, young people need to know there are consequences."" The renewed focus on mediation was welcomed by Kirk Dawes, a former police officer who ran a pioneering unit to combat serious gang violence. However, he raised concerns about the funding not being enough and the plans too short term. Kirk Dawes ran The Centre for Conflict Transformation (TCFCT) between 2004 and 2012 ""True investment would be a 10-year plan but that would cost more money than they've been given,"" he said. Until mediators can create peace, the situation would get worse with retaliation and revenge, Mr Dawes said. ""It's not nearly enough, but you can't blame the PCC for that.""

"This video can not be played Who are the Conservative Party members? Conservative MPs may have whittled the contenders in the leadership race down to the final two - but it will not be politicians who will decide who gets to be the next prime minister. Instead it will be the party's grassroots members who will decide which of Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson gets to succeed Theresa May. They will do so in a postal ballot, with the winner announced in the week beginning 22 July. In other words, it is members of the public - those who pay Â£25 a year to join the Conservative Party - who get the final say on who leads the country. There will not be a general election because the party is already in power. So, who are the Conservative Party's members and what do they think on key issues, not least, of course, Brexit? The Conservative Party membership iscurrently thought to be around 160,000,external- a rise of more than 30,000 in the past 12 months. The last time official figures were released was in March 2018, when they put the figure at 124,000. Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? That is way down on the peak of nearly 3 million that the party boasted in the early 1950s. The Tories have far fewer members than the Labour Party. Even if we assume that Labour's membership has fallen from the late 2017 peak of more than 550,000, it still has a huge advantage over the Conservatives when it comes to campaigning on the ground. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? How much difference does going to a top US university make? The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Right now, however, none of that matters as much as the fact that those 160,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party have a crucial role. They are going to be choosing the next prime minister of a country of over 65 million people - something which has never happened before. From studies of the 124,000 members that the party had in 2018, we know quite a lot about who they are and their beliefs. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: some 86% of them fall into the ABC1 category used by market researchers to describe the top social grade. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters and, indeed, the members of other parties. On the other hand, the fact that 97% of Conservative Party members are white doesn't do much to distinguish them from their counterparts in other parties. It does inevitably mean, however, that ethnic minorities, who make up well over 10% of British people, are heavily under-represented in the Tory rank and file. So, too, are women. Other parties - notably Labour and the Greens, but also the SNP - now come close to gender balance, but seven out of 10 Conservative members are male. Tory members are also older than the members of most other parties. True, their average age may ""only"" be 57, but this disguises the fact that four out of 10 are over 65. They are concentrated in the southern half of England. Nearly 60% of Tory members live in London, the east, south-east and south-west. So much for demography and geography.  What about ideology? Well, not surprisingly, Tory Party members are more right-wing than the population as a whole. On a scale where zero represents very left-wing and 10 very right-wing, the average voter places themselves at the centre point. The average Conservative Party member places themselves at 7.6. Laura Kuenssberg: May was just overwhelmed Premiership in six charts The Theresa May story Certainly, grassroots Tories are socially conservative. Three-quarters of them believe, for instance, that young people today don't have enough respect for traditional values. Nearly six out of 10 support the death penalty. They are also conventionally right-wing on some aspects of economic policy. For example, only 15% of them believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off. But on other issues they hold views that may be more unexpected. A third of Tory rank-and-file members believe that ordinary working people do not get their fair share of the nation's wealth and that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. About half believe that big business takes advantage of ordinary people. Interestingly, they have also cooled on austerity. In the summer of 2015, some 55% said government spending cuts hadn't gone far enough, but two years later that had fallen to 28%. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit amid a backlash against Brexit plans What Tory members haven't cooled on, however, is Brexit. Indeed, since we started tracking them in 2015, they've hardened their position. It is clear that they are not supporters of the deal negotiated by Theresa May. In fact, it is now the case that fully two-thirds of them back a no-deal Brexit - an outcome supported by only a quarter of voters as a whole. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Nor are they in the least bit keen on the idea of letting the public have another say on the UK's EU membership. Some 84% of them oppose the idea of a new referendum on the issue. In short, the grassroots aren't simply sceptical on Europe; they can't wait to leave, whatever that might take. Furthermore, a breakdown of YouGov polling data suggests that the 30,000 or so members who have joined in the past year are even more likely to be pro-Brexit. This, then, is the Conservative Party electorate. And those MPs hoping to succeed Mrs May will need to pitch their promises accordingly.

"Jeremy Hunt has urged Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson not to be ""a coward"" about facing public scrutiny. Mr Hunt said he was ""not interested"" in his private life but he should ""man up"" and debate with him on TV this week. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has warned the UK will face a ""democratic explosion"" if it does not leave the EU by 31 October. But Mr Hunt challenged him to reveal whether he would call a general election if MPs refused to allow the UK to leave without a deal on that date. After Prime Minister Theresa May failed to get her Brexit deal through Parliament earlier this year, the date of the UK's departure for the EU was moved to 31 October. Mr Johnson is under pressure to answer questions abouta row with his partner in the early hours of Fridaywhich led to police being called to his London home. The Metropolitan Police has said it will not be taking any further action over the incident and his supporters have rallied around him. Johnson 'should give row explanation' Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Former International Development Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a recording of the argument, given to the Guardian newspaper, was part of a ""politically-motivated series of attacks"". ""That is not the type of behaviour that you'd expect in our country, that's the type of behaviour associated with the old Eastern bloc,"" she added. Mr Johnson refused to answer questions about the incident at a hustings event on Saturday, instead insisting his stance on Brexit was what mattered to the public and to the Conservative Party members who will choose the next leader. In his Daily Telegraph column on Monday,,externalhe said of the 31 October deadline: ""This time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail."" He said it was ""disgraceful"" the UK was still in the EU three years after it voted to leave, and exiting the EU would ""renew the national faith in democracy"". He did not address questions about his private life in the column. This video can not be played Priti Patel said Mr Johnson would ""never"" comment on his personal life The BBC's Norman Smith says Mr Hunt's shift in language is striking. He is using a much more combative, pugilistic tone, our assistant political editor says, perhaps realising there is no point doing this softly and nicely because if he does, Mr Johnson is just going to walk into Number 10. Writing in the Times,external, Mr Hunt called for a ""fair and open contest, not one that one side is trying to rig to avoid scrutiny"". ""Only then can you walk through the front door of No 10 with your head held high instead of slinking through the back door, which is what Boris appears to want."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""very disrespectful"" of Mr Johnson to refuse to do ""any tough media interviews"" and urged him to take part in a Sky News leadership debate scheduled for Tuesday. The two men are due to face off on ITV in July, but by then voting papers will already have been sent to party members. Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? What is 'no deal'? Mr Hunt said he feared a government led by Mr Johnson would rapidly collapse, because he would be unable to hold together a coalition of supporters that range from MPs who back no deal to others who feel it would be totally unacceptable. ""If you are not clear about exactly what you are going to do, that coalition will collapse immediately and you will have Corbyn in Number 10,"" the foreign secretary said. He said Mr Johnson must explain how he could guarantee the UK would leave the EU on 31 October if Parliament voted to stop a no-deal Brexit,as it did in a non-binding votein March. Mr Hunt ruled out calling a general election in such a circumstance - saying it would destroy the Conservative Party - and demanded that Mr Johnson be clear whether he would do the same. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Health Secretary Matt Hancock, whowithdrew from the leadership contestafter coming sixth in the first ballot of the party's MPs, told BBC Breakfast Mr Johnson had the ""best chance"" of securing a new Brexit deal with the EU. Mr Hancock said it was ""total nonsense"" to suggest Mr Johnson was not open to scrutiny, drawing attention to the various hustings he has taken part in. ""He's got the energy, he's got the support from right across the party, and I think that's why he's the right man for the job,"" Mr Hancock added. In a separate development, defence minister Tobias Ellwoodtold the BBC's Panorama programmethat ""a dozen or so"" Conservative MPs would support a vote of no confidence in the government to stop a no-deal Brexit. A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules. Opponents say it would cause huge disruption at the borders and be catastrophic to many firms reliant on trade with the continent. Next month around 160,000 Conservative Party members will choose the next leader of the Tory Party - and the next prime minister. Members will receive their ballots between 6 and 8 July, with the new leader expected to be announced in the week beginning 22 July.
