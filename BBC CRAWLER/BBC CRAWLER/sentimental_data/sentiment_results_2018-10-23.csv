"Six men walk into a shop... A gang of robbers walk into a shop. The owner asks them to come back later when he has more money, and when they do... It feels like the makings of a joke, but for a Belgian e-cigarette shop owner this was a frightening reality. Six people entered Didier's shop in the suburbs of Charleroi in daylight with the intent to rob him. The salesman told the group to return at the end of the day, when he could give them more money. In the end though, he got them arrested instead. ""It's like it was a comedy,"" he told the BBC over the phone. ""They're being called the worst robbers in Belgium.""

""There was some pushing and shoving,"" Didier said. ""I didn't give them a thing, but said if they came back later I would have 2 or 3,000 euros."" The group bought his bluff, and left. ""When I called the police, they didn't believe they would come back."" But back they did come at 17:30, an hour before the vape shop's closing time. Didier told local media he saw one of the robbers at the door and told them it still was not end of business. When the men returned a third time, at 18:30, the police were at the back of the shop ready to catch them. Five males were arrested, including a minor.

"The one with the doppelganger: People thought the suspect (left) bore a striking resemblance to actor David Schwimmer A UK police force's image of a Ross Geller ""lookalike"" has drawn thousands of comedy responses. Officers shared the CCTV still of the man, dubbed the ""spitting image"" of Friends actor David Schwimmer, clutching a crate of beer. Within minutes, fans of the 90s sitcom had bombardedBlackpool Police's Facebook post with jokes inspired by the show,external. Police later said Schwimmer was not in the UK at the time of the offence. ""Thank you to everyone for your speedy responses. We have investigated this matter thoroughly and have confirmed that David Schwimmer was in America on this date,"" they wrote. ""We're so sorry it has to be this way."" People made plenty of Friends gags on the police's Facebook page As comments on the post descended into something of a Friends quote-fest, a number of the 50,000 users who chipped in referenced the show's chart-topping theme song. ""I don't think it's been this guy's day, his week, his month or even his year,"" wrote Nick Croston, while Olly Byrne quipped: ""I'm suprised you've not found him... it's like you're always stuck in second gear."" Others, such as Joe Richardson, riffed on some of Ross's most well-known quotes. ""Shouldn't he be at work...or is he on a break?"", asked Joe. While Jay Murdoch wrote: ""Apparently the police had him cornered then he performed a pivot manoeuvre and escaped."" Craig Thompson added: ""I saw him behind me in the shop around that time.. just as I was paying for MY SANDWICH."" Scottish police also got in on the act, with bobbies in Dumfries and Galloway sharing the post and warning members of the public to ""keep away"" from the suspect. ""He is known to have studied Karate and we believe he has mastered the art of Unagi, the state of total awareness,"" they wrote. Could he BE any more innocent? Police said the real Schwimmer was not in the UK at the time of the offence However, some commentators reminded their fellow Friends fans that a real-life crime had been committed. ""He's a thief and it's serious,"" wrote Grace Higham.  ""But these comments are hilarious.""

"This video can not be played Recep Tayyip Erdogan says many questions need to be answered The killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was planned days in advance, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has told MPs from his ruling party. He said Turkey had strong evidence Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated and ""savage"" murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. He also called for the suspects to be tried in Istanbul. He demanded Saudi Arabia provide answers about where Khashoggi's body was, and who had ordered the operation. The Saudi kingdom has provided conflicting accounts of what happened to Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post contributor. After weeks of maintaining he was still alive, the authorities now say the 59-year-old was killed in a rogue operation. Mr Erdogan's address coincided with the start of an investment conference in Saudi Arabia that has been overshadowed by the Khashoggi case. Dozens of government and business leaders have pulled out, but Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeared at the event on Tuesday. Saudi summit begins despite calls for a boycott How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi Many world leaders have condemned the murder of the prominent Saudi critic and demanded a full investigation. US President Donald Trump says he is not satisfied with the Saudi explanation but he has also highlighted the kingdom's importance as a US ally. CIA director Gina Haspel has been sent to Turkey to review the matter. This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? Fifteen Saudi nationals, Mr Erdogan said, arrived in Istanbul in three teams, on separate flights, in the days and hours leading up to the murder. A day before the killing, he said, some members from the group travelled to Belgrad forest, near the consulate - an area searched last week by Turkish police looking for the body. He also described how the team had removed the hard drives from the consulate's surveillance camera system prior to the arrival of Khashoggi, who was visiting to obtain documents for his forthcoming marriage. A man who looked like Khashoggi, wearing his outfit, glasses and a fake beard, was among a group who left the consulate the same day as the killing, the president added. On Monday, CNN broadcast images appearing to show that Saudi operative leaving the consulate. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons President Erdogan confirmed 18 people had been arrested in Saudi Arabia over the case. He told MPs from his ruling AK party the 18 should ""be tried in Istanbul"", adding that ""all those who played a role in the murder"" would be punished. All you need to know about Khashoggi's death Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Who was the victim? Mr Erdogan called for an independent commission to be set up but said he was confident in King Salman's full co-operation. He did not mention the crown prince, widely seen as the most powerful figure in the kingdom. Many believe he ordered the killing, although the Saudis deny this. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says Mr Erdogan's speech was notable as much for what it left out as for what it left in. There was no mention of the much-discussed audio tape from inside the Saudi consulate which Turkish media say reveals gruesome details of the murder. Trailed as something that would expose ""the naked truth"", the speech fell well short of many people's expectations, our correspondent says. King Salman chaired a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, after which a statement said that Saudi Arabia would hold to account those responsible for the killing, whoever they might be. The Saudi king (R) and crown prince (2R) meet Khashoggi's son, Salah bin Jamal (L), and another family member in Riyadh State media also said the king and the crown prince had held a meeting in Riyadh with members of the Khashoggi family, including Khashoggi's son, Salah bin Jamal. Mr Erdogan also spoke to family members by phone on Tuesday, offering condolences and saying he would do all he could to solve the murder. Saudi Arabia has given conflicting accounts up to now, initially saying Khashoggi had left the building alive, then later saying that he had been killed in a ""fist-fight"" inside the consulate. On Sunday, the Saudi foreign minister acknowledged Khashoggi had been murdered but said the leadership had not been aware of the ""rogue operation"". ""The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority,"" Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told Fox News. ""There obviously was a tremendous mistake made, and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up."" He said that Saudi Arabia did not know where the body was. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West An unnamed Saudi official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing President Erdogan demanded in his speech on Tuesday for this individual's identity to be revealed. In addition to the arrests, the Saudis say they have sacked two of the crown prince's aides and set up an organisation, under his leadership, to reform the intelligence agency over the killing. Saudi summit website attacked by hackers What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? According to Reuters news agency, quoting Turkish and Arabic intelligence sources, one of the sacked aides appeared via Skype during Khashoggi's questioning. Saud al-Qahtani was quoted as giving the instructions ""bring me the head of the dog"", after the two men traded insults. The sources say President Erdogan has a copy of the Skype audio but is refusing to hand it over to the US. BBC's Sebastian Usher in Riyadh A media scrum as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives at the conference There's an odd mixture of unreality and hard-faced pragmatism here. Attendees say they're here to stay with the opportunities Saudi Arabia provides for the long haul - however much pressure may be building in the short term. But that means that the urgency and outrage over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi that is fuelling the news outside is absent here. As President Erdogan was delivering his explosive speech, the conference here announced $50bn (Â£38.5bn) of investment in 12 mega-deals. The contracts were signed with a flourish by a host of foreign CEOs with their Saudi partners to the applause of the audience. It was no doubt intended as a resounding vote of confidence in the vision of Saudi Arabia's future laid out by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But that future and those investments could still turn sour, despite the mood of optimism and self-approbation exhibited here.

"This video can not be played The US President criticises Saudi Arabia's handling of Jamal Khashoggi's death US President Donald Trump has said Saudi Arabia's response to the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi is ""the worst cover-up ever"". Those behind the killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul three weeks ago ""should be in big trouble"", he said. Shortly afterwards, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US would ""punish those responsible"" and had revoked visas of 21 identified suspects. The Saudi government has blamed the murder on rogue agents. But President Erdogan of Turkey has said the journalist was the victim of a carefully planned ""political murder"" by Saudi intelligence officers and other officials. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said: ""They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups. ""Whoever thought of that idea, I think is in big trouble. And they should be in big trouble."" The Saudi government has provided conflicting accounts of what happened to Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post contributor. After weeks of maintaining he was still alive, senior officials now say the 59-year-old was murdered in a rogue operation after visiting the Saudi consulate in Turkey. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia? What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? European Council President Donald Tusk said EU member states must pursue the full details of the killing and avoid any ""trace of hypocrisy"". In a speech to the European Parliament, Mr Tusk said he expected member states and institutions to avoid any ""ambiguous game"". Mr Trump's public criticism of Saudi Arabia on Tuesday was his strongest so far, but he has continued to highlight the kingdom's importance as a US ally. In a separate interview with the Wall Street Journal,Mr Trump addressed the possible involvement of Saudi royals in the killing,externaland said he did not believe King Salman had prior knowledge of the operation. When asked about the possible role of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the president replied: ""He's running things and so if anybody were going to be [informed], it would be him."" This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing He said he had questioned the crown prince about Khashoggi's death, and been told he did not know about the operation when it was being planned. Asked if he believed the royal family's denial, Mr Trump reportedly gave a long pause before saying: ""I really want to believe them."" All you need to know about Khashoggi's death Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Who was the victim? Mr Trump also said US intelligence officials were returning from Turkey and Saudi Arabia with information about the case. CIA director Gina Haspel has been sent to Turkey.Intelligence officials have shared an audio recording from inside the Saudi consulate,externalwith her, the Daily Sabah newspaper says. The reported recording is said to reveal gruesome details of the murder. The US president appears to have changed his mind on the issue. When asked by a reporter in Arizona a few days ago whether he thought Saudi Arabia's explanation for Khashoggi's death was credible, he said: ""I do."" Mr Pompeo said the US was looking into the possibility of imposing sanctions on those believed to be involved in Khashoggi's killing beyond revoking their visas. ""These penalties will not be the last word on this matter from the United States,"" he added. Mr Pompeo told reporters he was working on other measures against the suspected killers Mr Pompeo said the suspects worked in the Saudi intelligence services, the foreign ministry and the royal court. But a state department official said they would not be named due to ""visa confidentiality"".

"Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte (L) and his two deputies - Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini (R) - have been told to revise their budget The European Commission has told Italy to revise its budget, an unprecedented move with regard to an EU member state. The Commission is worried about the impact of higher spending on already high levels of debt in Italy, the eurozone's third-biggest economy. Italy's governing populist parties have vowed to push ahead with campaign promises including a minimum income for the unemployed. The country now has three weeks to submit a new, draft budget to Brussels. The Commission said the first draft represented a ""particularly serious non-compliance"" with its recommendations. What's behind Italy's economic turbulence? Italy populists take power: What comes next? The Commission Vice-President for the euro, Valdis Dombrovskis, said Italy's response to the commission's concerns was ""not sufficient"" to assuage fears - and the euro's rules were the same for everybody. ""This is the first Italian budget that the EU doesn't like,"" wrote Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio on Facebook. ""No surprise: This is the first Italian budget written in Rome and not in Brussels!"" His co-deputy PM Matteo Salvini added: ""This doesn't change anything."" ""They're not attacking a government but a people. These are things that will anger Italians even more,"" he said. The new government has vowed to ""end poverty"" with a minimum income for the unemployed. Other measures include tax cuts and scrapping extensions to the retirement age - fulfilling several key campaign promises from the election in March. A defiant Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte insisted earlier that the budget deficit would go no higher than 2.4% of GDP, although the target is three times than that of the previous government. The government argues that servicing its debt of 131% of national output - second only to bailed-out Greece - would hurt Italians, who have still not recovered from the decade-old financial crisis. Italy's economy is still smaller than it was in 2008. The governing League and Five Star parties argue an increase in spending would kick-start growth. Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe correspondent Four week ago, cries of ""We did it!"" followed the budget's approval in Italy Italy' has put itself on a collision course with the EU. The dispute takes the eurozone into uncharted waters. The authorities in Brussels have the right to reject a budget and demand new proposals - and to impose fines - if its requests are ignored. This is the first time they've gone as far as this down that road and the EU has to weigh the prospect of taking firm measures to discourage other eurozone states from breaking the rules against the prospect of a drawn-out conflict with one of its largest member states at a time when its political energies are already absorbed by Brexit. The Italian government says its measures are necessary to restore growth and that it has no intention of backing down. Italy's neutral Finance Minister, Giovanni Tria, and international observers had hoped the country would keep its deficit under 2% of GDP - and perhaps as low as 1.6%. While 2.4% falls well short of the 3% deficit limit under eurozone rules, Italy's debt level is alarming. ""For the first time the Commission is obliged to request a euro area country to revise its draft budgetary plan but we see no alternative than to request the Italian authorities to do so,"" Mr Dombrovskis said. He pointed out that Italian taxpayers were having to spend as much servicing the national debt as on education. ""Breaking rules can appear tempting at the first look - it can provide the illusion of breaking free,"" he said. ""It is tempting to try and cure debt with more debt. At some point, the debt weighs too heavy... you end up having no freedom at all."" After Italy announced its draft budget last month, weeks of market turmoil followed. Before the Commission announced its rejection of the Italian budget on Tuesday,European shares fell to their lowest levels in nearly two years. Following the announcement, the Italy-Germany 10-year bond yield gap, widely used as a relative yardstick of Italy's position on the markets, widened to a new high of 314 points. Italy's populists agree new budget Budget makes Italians 'worse off', says EU What's behind Italy's economic turbulence? Italy populists take power: What comes next?

"This video can not be played Footage shared online shows the escalator moving at speed More than 20 people were hurt, some seriously, when an escalator ran out of control at a Rome metro station. Footage shared on social media showed people being crushed at the bottom as stairs on the escalator crumpled. Many of those injured were fans of the visiting Russian football team CSKA Moscow. One of the fans had a foot partially severed in the crush. At least two others needed surgery for injuries to their legs. The accident happened before CSKA Moscow's match with Roma in the group stages of the Champions League. Metal plates were left mangled at the bottom of the structure Witnesses quoted by police said the Russian fans had been singing and jumping before the escalator gave way. ""A group of CSKA fans were going down into the station. At that moment the escalator collapsed,"" a police spokesman told Russian news agency RIA. Most of the injured were CSKA fans, the spokesman added. Video posted by a Russian fan showed the escalator moving down at very high speed, with people trying to cling to the handrails. There was panic as people ploughed into each other at the bottom and one person was hauled to safety by a man on a parallel escalator. ""I just experienced a scene from the apocalypse,"" one witness told Repubblica newspaper. ""One of the steps on the downward escalator, just a metre away from me, started accelerating extremely fast like it had gone crazy."" Pictures of the damaged escalator show a tangle of broken and twisted metal. The fire brigade tweeted a video of its operation at 21:00 (19:00 GMT) to say all the wounded had been rescued and taken to hospital. Allow Twitter content?

Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, collapsed during a flight from Heathrow to Nice in 2016 and died within hours. Her parents met the Environment Secretary to lobby for all pre-packaged food to clearly show allergens. Michael Gove said businesses should ""not wait for the law to change"". Natasha's father Nadim blamed her death on ""inadequate food labelling laws"". A coroner found that Natasha, from Fulham, south-west London, had been ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging. Following the inquest, Pret announced it would be listing all ingredients on its freshly made food. However, her parents are keen for it to become law for all pre-packaged products to clearly show what allergens are in the ingredients. Michael Gove said it was an ""honour"" to meet Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse After meeting Mr Gove her parents said in a joint statement that ""an internal review of the law will take place before Christmas, ahead of a consultation in the New Year"". They added: ""We have every hope that Natasha's law could be a reality by the end of next year."" Earlier this month Mr Gove told civil servants to investigate a law change, after Natasha's death highlighted the ""importance of acting urgently"". Pret death prompts food label law review Pret allergic reaction 'like explosion' Pret labels 'inadequate', says coroner After meeting Natasha's parents he said the government had been ""working at pace"" with the Food Standards Agency and businesses to review the current allergen labelling laws. He added: ""We are aiming to bring forward concrete proposals to change the law around the turn of the year. ""I also want to make clear that businesses do not need to wait for the law to change to do the right thing. They should be doing all they can now to make sure consumers have the information they need to stay safe.""

"Wireless Festival had its licence reviewed following complaints from campaigners and residents Wireless Festival has been allowed to remain in London's Finsbury Park, but artists will be asked not to swear or wear ""offensive"" clothes. The Friends of Finsbury Park complained about noise levels, drug taking and anti-social behaviour at the festival. But Haringey Council granted festival promoter Live Nation a licence after a review called for by campaigners. The council's licensing committee decided to amend conditions rather than revoke the licence altogether. The new conditions include a ""request that performers do not sing or play any vulgar, obscene or banned songs or carry out indecent acts or make any vulgar gestures, actions or remarks during the performance"". It also says that performers must ""not offend the general public"" and gives examples like ""attire which expose the groin, private parts, buttock or female breast(s)"". The council said it was down to the organisers to ""ensure conditions are met and all reasonable steps are taken"". Live Nation declined to comment on how it plans to implement the conditions. The last day of the festival will now finish 30 minutes earlier at 21:30 BST and new sound level limits and monitoring will be put in place.

"The female passenger said she was groped twice A man accused of groping a woman on an aircraft has told US police that President Donald Trump had said it was OK to grab women. The man was charged in New Mexico with ""abusive sexual contact"" after he allegedly touched the breasts of the passenger sitting in front of him. The woman was helped by aircraft staff to find a different seat and the man was arrested on arrival in Albuquerque. Mr Trump was once recorded boasting about grabbing womenby the genitals. According to the criminal complaint released by the district court in Albuquerque,the accused told police ""that the President of the United States says it's ok to grab women by their private parts"",external. The accused will remain in custody,externalpending a preliminary hearing, the court said. A conviction of abusive sexual contact would carry a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a fine of $250,000 (Â£193,000). The woman says in the complaint that she fell asleep after boarding but woke from being touched ""on her right side at and around her 'bra line'"". She first assumed the contact had been by accident but half an hour later was allegedly being groped a second time. Street harassment 'relentless' for women Victim blaming: Is it a woman's responsibility to stay safe? The woman said she had then got up and confronted the man seated behind her.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have arrived in Fiji, where Prince Harry has tried kava - a traditional non-alcoholic social drink. He tried the beverage at a ceremony which featured chants and dancing. Crowds cheered as Prince Harry sipped the kava, which is used to treat anxiety and stress in some countriesbut cannot be imported to the EU.,external Harry and Meghan were then met by huge crowds of people at the Grand Pacific Hotel, where they waved from a balcony. The pair's 16-day tour which will also take them to New Zealand, Tonga and return to Australia. The duke and duchess, who are expecting their first baby, visited Albert Park in Fiji's capital Suva - the same place visited by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh 65 years ago. Harry and Meghan stood on the same hotel balcony overlooking the park as the Queen and Prince Philip in 1953 Speaking to the crowds, Prince Harry said: ""Bula venaka! The duchess and I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible during the next two days and celebrating the links and close friendship between Fiji and the United Kingdom."" The couple also attended a reception and dinner hosted by Fiji's president.

Pharmacology professor David Colquhoun, from University College London, said kava can be ""dangerous"", adding: ""It's pretty foolish to drink it."" He pointed to a warning from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2002 which highlighted the risk of liver damage from kava. Harry's grandfather, Prince Philip, also tried kava during a visit to Fiji in 1982 And Prince Charles tried kava while wearing a grass skirt during a visit to the neighbouring island of Vanuatu earlier this year By BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond It was an astonishing welcome and even hardened royal watchers were open-mouthed. In the centre of Suva, as the clock facing Albert Park struck six, the duke and duchess arrived. Around 15,000 Fijians had gathered at the Park. Thousands more had lined the route from the airport. In pictures: Harry and Meghan in Australia Prince Harry reveals hopes for a baby girl at Invictus Games Why Harry is a hero for 'rangas' Cheers swept the park as Harry and Meghan stepped from their car. And then for around an hour, a welcoming ceremony under the darkening skies. There was dancing, and singing, men in grass skirts, and spears. There were prayers. And there was kava, a drink cultivated from the plant of the same name that is drunk throughout Polynesia. The duke drank some, to more applause from the crowd. Rain swept the park. The couple have brought miserable English weather with them to many stops on their tour. Nobody cares. Harry spoke, lurching briefly into Fijian at times, to more applause. And then the couple made their way to the Grand Pacific Hotel, where in front of another huge crowd, they appeared on the balcony and waved.

"Tommy Robinson arrives at the Old Bailey in London A judge retrying ex-English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson for contempt of court has referred the case to the government's top legal adviser. Mr Robinson faced an allegation that he had committed contempt by filming people before a criminal trial. But Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC ruled the case needed to be referred up to the attorney general to decide. The brief appearance was the latest in a long-running case that began in 2017. The 35-year-old - who appeared under his real name, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - was released on bail. About 1,000 of his supporters, plus some opponents, gathered outside the Old Bailey court in London. After the hearing, Mr Yaxley-Lennon told the cheering crowd: ""I shouldn't face another trial. I've been here three times with a prison bag. I've kissed my kids goodbye three times."" But he welcomed the referral to the attorney general and said he hoped he ""makes the right decision"". The attorney general has the power to discontinue the case. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent This is the second time the allegations against Mr Yaxley-Lennon have been heard at the Old Bailey - and the second time a decision on the case has been postponed. It is also the second time that hundreds of his supporters have turned out - perhaps even more than before - and that the City of London Police have run a significant public order operation to contain both supporters and a smaller counter-demo. He arrived in the security cordon flanked by his closest advisers from his days running the English Defence League to loud cheers and chanting. Some supporters were carrying far-right banners - including two banners from organisations which are considered to be highly Islamophobic. Office workers in the swish buildings around the Old Bailey and a fair few court staff looked on from above. One of the most unexpected episodes this morning came when they began singing ""How they Rule Ya"" to the tune of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. After the case, his supporters were jubilant, hailing him as some kind of martyr for free speech. Mr Yaxley-Lennon's counsel, Richard Furlong, said the case should be referred to the attorney general - currently Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox. Judge Hilliard then confirmed the case would be referred up, saying the matter was so complex it needed further consideration. The move would also allow lawyers to cross-examine witnesses. Judge Hilliard added: ""All the evidence must be rigorously tested."" Now the case has been referred to the attorney general's office, who will decide whether to send the case to the High Court or to drop the contempt proceedings. The attorney general's office confirmed there was no set timescale for this decision to be made. Mr Yaxley-Lennon addressed the crowds outside the court before his hearing In May 2017, Mr Yaxley-Lennon filmed four men outside a court, who were later convicted of gang-raping a teenage girl. The trial was subject to reporting restrictions, and a judge at Canterbury Crown Court gave him a three-month suspended sentence for contempt of court. In May 2018, he was jailed for potentially prejudicing a court case after broadcasting on social media outside Leeds Crown Court. He was sentenced to 13 months - 10 months for the contempt of court in Leeds and a further three months for breaching the previous suspended sentence. Mr Yaxley-Lennon appealed against both contempt findings. Three judges quashed the Leeds ruling, saying the judge should not have commenced contempt proceedings that day. They ordered the case be reheard so that the allegations could be fully examined and, after a brief appearance at the Old Bailey in September, the case was adjourned until today. Mr Yaxley-Lennon says the whole thing is a ""political witch-hunt"" designed to stop him telling the truth about what he calls ""Muslim rape gangs"". The anti-Islam campaigner described the media as the ""enemy of the people"" and blamed the government, police and social services for ""sacrificing a generation of our daughters at the hands of the multiculturalism altar"". Supporters, some of whom are funding his legal campaign, cheered Mr Robinson outside Central Criminal Court. Criticism of MR Robinson came from a group of anti-racism campaigners who were also outside the court. One woman said: ""He [Mr Yaxley-Lennon] was the [co-]founder of the English Defence League, which is a fascist party, and we've got to stop it. ""If people believe they're joining something that is a bit more innocuous they're wrong. ""The fact of the matter is not only is it racist, but a hard core of them are fascists."" Joe Mulhall of anti-racism group Hope Not Hate said: ""He's dividing this country in a whole host of ways and, worst of all, he's dividing communities."" Contempt of court laws are designed to protect the rule of law, ensure fair trials - and avoid trial by media. Contempt can be committed by a broad range of people and organisations including the press, jurors, and social media users. The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years' imprisonment, but it can also be punished with a fine. Read more about the contempt law from BBC Legal Affairs Correspondent Clive Coleman.

"The iceberg had recently calved from the Larsen C ice shelf in Antarctica Nasa has released a striking photo of a rectangular iceberg floating in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica. The US space agency said the object's sharp angles and flat surface suggested it had recently broken away from an ice shelf. The edges are still pointed, and have not yet been worn down by the ocean waves. The picture was taken last week by scientists on a Nasa research plane. Such objects are not unknown, however, and even have a name - tabular icebergs. These are flat and long and form by splitting away from the edges of ice shelves. Kelly Brunt, a glaciologist with Nasa and the University of Maryland, said the process of formation was a bit like a fingernail growing too long and cracking off at the end. They were often geometrically-shaped as a result, she said. ""What makes this one a bit unusual is that it looks almost like a square,"" she added. This particular 'berg came from the crumbling Larsen C ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula. It's difficult to tell exactly how big the iceberg is from the photo, but experts said it was probably more than 1.6km (1 mile) across. And, as with all icebergs, the part visible on the surface comprises just a small fraction of the object's mass - in this case about 10%.

"Ferry and freight firms will be urged to plan alternative routes for drugs and other vital supplies if a no-deal Brexit blocks cross-Channel traffic. The suppliers will be told to use Belgian and Dutch ports if blockages at Calais threaten to delay shipments. The news emerged after a ""passionate"" cabinet meeting in which ministers were told about contingencies for no deal. Meanwhile,a government watchdog is warning new UK border controls may not be readyin a no-deal situation. Cabinet ministers are receiving weekly updates about preparations for Brexit until the UK leaves the EU next March. Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit May says 95% of Brexit deal now agreed Brexit: All you need to know After Tuesday's cabinet meeting a senior government source denied there were plans to buy or charter vessels to keep the NHS working or to guarantee food supplies. Instead, private carriers would be expected to carry out their normal roles, the BBC has been told. But there are worries among ministers and officials that the sudden introduction of border checks at Calais could cause sudden and serious backlogs. The Sun reported that ministers,externalhad been warned that France could effectively shut down Calais, which it said would have a devastating effect on food exporters and manufacturers reliant on the port. And BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said there was a discussion at the cabinet meeting that there could be a 75-80% drop-off on traffic across the Calais-Dover route, causing a huge impact on supplies including food. Stockpiling of medicines that need refrigerating, such as insulin and vaccines, is difficult The BBC's deputy political editor, John Pienaar, said one source described the meeting as ""passionate"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was said to have expressed concern that the UK must not be trapped indefinitely in the so-called ""backstop"" customs union arrangement with the EU, which could hamper the UK from striking wider trade deals. Reality Check: Back to the backstop Attorney General Geoffrey Cox compared that status to being trapped in Dante's ""first circle of hell"". The BBC's deputy political editor says the mood among ministers at the meeting was more evidence of the prime minister's limited room for manoeuvre in the Brexit talks, as she prepares to address Tory backbenchers on Wednesday. Theresa May's appearance before the 1922 Committee will see her face some MPs who have been critical of her Brexit plans and leadership. It comes as aNational Audit Office report,externalsays the the UK needs to replace IT systems, boost Border Force staffing levels and build new infrastructure to track goods. The government said it was confident of striking a ""good"" deal with the EU for as ""frictionless"" trade as possible. It said that plans were already 95% complete. The government has already asked firms to start stockpiling a six-week supply of drugs and if necessary plan to fly in medicines which cannot be stockpiled because of their short shelf life. The UK imports 37 million packs of medicine each month from the EU. Concern has been raised that prolonged disruption at the borders could disrupt the supply chain. Macron in English faux pas over visas Drug makers stockpiling for Brexit On Tuesday, Martin Sawer, of the Healthcare Distributors Association, told MPs that the pharmaceutical  industry was ""very concerned"" about a no-deal as it could have ""catastrophic"" consequences for the supply of drugs. He warned it could lead to patients being put on drugs that they are not currently prescribed. The Department for Transport said that while it was confident of the UK reaching an agreement with the EU on the terms of its exit, it was sensible to plan for all possible outcomes. ""We are continuing to work closely with partners on contingency plans to ensure that trade can continue to move as freely as possible between the UK and Europe,"" a spokesman said. But Labour MP David Lammy, who supports a new referendum on the outcome of the negotiations with the option of remaining in the EU, said Brexit had become ""like a declaration of war on ourselves"". France has also stepped up its planning for a no-deal Brexit, publishing a draft law last week which would give the government powers to deal with visas, transport and other services. The UK is due to leave on 29 March 2019 but during the post-Brexit ""transition period"", set to run until 31 December 2020, the UK-EU relationship will stay largely the same. Mrs May has insisted that if an extension is necessary it should only last a few months. However,the Times newspaper says a leaked document given to ministers warns the transition period,externaltying the UK to Brussels until the end of 2020 ""could, in theory"" turn into a long-running arrangement over ""many years"". A Downing Street spokesman said this was ""nothing more than a partial reflection of advice to ministers, and not of decisions taken"". He saidMrs May had made her position ""absolutely clear"" on Monday when she told the Commonsshe intended any such backstop arrangement to be temporary, and would end ""well before"" the next election.

"The DVD's days appear to be numbered after the John Lewis department store chain said it would stop selling the players once found under almost every television. The firm said it would not put more players on shelves when stocks run out. Sales are down 40% as more people watch movies and shows on streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon. However, John Lewis will continue to sell Blu-ray players, which can also be used for standard DVDs. The chain also said 55-inch televisions were now the most popular screen size, compared with 36 inches eight years ago. During the World Cup over the summer, 70-inch screens notched up the biggest rise in sales. The retailer said other gadgets proving popular were smart doorbells, which can be linked to WiFi and smartphones, and robotic lawnmowers, sales of which are up 367% and 75% respectively compared with last year. Gill Hind, director of TV at Enders Analysis, said its decision to ditch DVD players was as much about retailers' desire to offer the latest innovations to consumers as the rise of streaming services alone. Bean-slicers and bedwarmers: Household items we miss the most Is 'Never knowingly undersold' killing John Lewis? Why we no longer love department stores Prices of DVD players have fallen to as low as Â£20 at supermarkets. The cheapest Blu-ray player sold by John Lewis is Â£79, ranging up to Â£449 for a model that can also record TV programmes. The likes of Argos would continue to sell DVD players, Ms Hind said, but the margins were now too low for upmarket retailers such as John Lewis. Although streaming accounted for more than four fifths of the Â£2.7bn UK video market last year, the Christopher Nolan film Dunkirk still sold 640,000 copies on DVD and Blu-ray. The most popular title of 2017 - Disney's Beauty and the Beast - sold 1.5 million copies across physical and digital formats. DVDs can still be bought from more than 15,000 UK retailers, with supermarkets accounting for sales of one in two DVDs and one in three Blu-rays. However, one in 10 is now sold in retailers such as fashion and DIY stores, garden centres and petrol stations, according to theBritish Association for Screen Entertainment,external. Shoppers are also calling time on the bedside alarm clock, as more people use their phones for the same purpose, prompting the retailer to cut its range by a third following a 16% slump in sales. As well as waking us up, mobiles have become the most popular way for John Lewis customers to shop online for the first time, with the number of orders placed on the devices up by 35%. Meanwhile, the popularity of the BBC series Blue Planet II led to a 71% surge in sales of reusable coffee cups, travel cups and flasks. Another TV programme that proved a huge ratings hit this year - the ITV reality show Love Island - was responsible for a similar jump in sales of thongs - lingerie, not Australian footwear - and a 132% increase in sales of suspenders. Those increases were the ""biggest surprises"" of the year, John Lewis said. The show also boosted sales of colourful men's swimming shorts - worn by its male contestants. This year has proved difficult for John Lewis, which said it was ""one of the toughest retailers have seen"". Last month the Partnership, which also owns Waitrose, saidprofits fell 99% to just Â£1.2mfor the six months to 28 July. The household items we miss the most John Lewis half-year profits slump 99% Is 'Never knowingly undersold' killing John Lewis?

"This video can not be played Footage shared online shows the escalator moving at speed More than 20 people were hurt, some seriously, when an escalator ran out of control at a Rome metro station. Footage shared on social media showed people being crushed at the bottom as stairs on the escalator crumpled. Many of those injured were fans of the visiting Russian football team CSKA Moscow. One of the fans had a foot partially severed in the crush. At least two others needed surgery for injuries to their legs. The accident happened before CSKA Moscow's match with Roma in the group stages of the Champions League. Metal plates were left mangled at the bottom of the structure Witnesses quoted by police said the Russian fans had been singing and jumping before the escalator gave way. ""A group of CSKA fans were going down into the station. At that moment the escalator collapsed,"" a police spokesman told Russian news agency RIA. Most of the injured were CSKA fans, the spokesman added. Video posted by a Russian fan showed the escalator moving down at very high speed, with people trying to cling to the handrails. There was panic as people ploughed into each other at the bottom and one person was hauled to safety by a man on a parallel escalator. ""I just experienced a scene from the apocalypse,"" one witness told Repubblica newspaper. ""One of the steps on the downward escalator, just a metre away from me, started accelerating extremely fast like it had gone crazy."" Pictures of the damaged escalator show a tangle of broken and twisted metal. The fire brigade tweeted a video of its operation at 21:00 (19:00 GMT) to say all the wounded had been rescued and taken to hospital. Allow Twitter content?

"Data harvesting and sharing by mobile apps is ""out of control"", University of Oxford researchers have warned. Nearly 90% of free apps on the Google Play store share data with Google parent company Alphabet,the Financial Times reported,external. Google said it had clear policies for how developers could handle data, and that the research had mischaracterised some ""ordinary functions"" of apps. ""If an app violates our policies, we take action,"" the online giant said. Many free apps track behaviour across many different digital services, which lets companies build up a detailed profile of people using the app. This data can include age, gender, location, and information about other apps on a smartphone. The data can then be used for a number of purposes including targeted advertising, credit scoring, or targeted political campaign messages,the researchers said in a paper,external. Revenues from online advertising are more than $59bn (Â£45bn) per year in the US alone, they said. And many people are not aware how data flows from smartphones to advertising groups, data brokers and other intermediaries, Prof Nigel Shadbolt, who lead the research team, told the BBC. ""People [in businesses] are desperate to get as many eyeballs and click-throughs as they can,"" he said. Associate professor Max Van Kleek added: ""I don't think there's any notion of control."" Data tended to get concentrated by big companies and their subsidiaries. The researchers found that more than 88% of free apps on Google Play shared information with firms owned by Alphabet. Nearly 43% of apps shared data with Facebook, while significant percentages shared data with Twitter, Verizon, Microsoft and Amazon firms. News apps - and apps aimed at children - shared information with the largest number of trackers, they found. Google said: ""Across Google and in Google Play we have clear policies and guidelines for how developers and third-party apps can handle data and we require developers to be transparent and ask for user permission. If an app violates our policies, we take action."" Google added that it disagreed with the methodology of the study. ""It mischaracterises ordinary functional services like crash reporting and analytics, and how apps share data to deliver those services,"" Google said. But campaigner Frederike Kaltheuner from Privacy International said that it has become ""impossible"" for the average user to understand how their data is being used, and to opt out. ""Companies track people... and they use this data to profile and then target people in ways that most of us would find intrusive and very surprising,"" she said. ""This is no longer about the need to collect data to show 'relevant ads' - this is about profit maximisation at the expense of people's fundamental rights,"" Ms Kaltheuner added.

"Ed Farmer was found unresponsive and taken to hospital, but died Students at an ""initiation-style"" event had their heads shaved and were made to apple bob in a mixture of urine and alcohol, an inquest has heard. Newcastle University student Ed Farmer suffered a cardiac arrest and died in hospital in December 2016. The 20-year-old from Leicester had been at an event organised by members of the Agricultural Society where students were encouraged to drink heavily. One witness said some of those at the event had ""felt anxious and nervous"". Guy Barker, a second-year student at the time of the incident, described how some first-year students had their head shaved at the event, were sprayed with paint used to mark stock, and bobbed for apples in a mixture of urine and alcohol. He agreed it was possible such events placed pressure on students to drink high volumes of alcohol in a short period of time. Mr Barker added that students were not forced to attend and could leave at any time. He said that he understood initiation events were banned by the university because they were ""dangerous and put a lot of pressure on people"". Another witness, Jonathan Hedley, told the inquest he sent a WhatsApp message to a group of fellow first-year students instructing them to refute knowledge of the bar crawl. He said the message, which read ""The three D's boys, deny, deny, deny,"" was sent as a ""joke"" before he became aware of the seriousness of the situation. He told the hearing he believed Mr Farmer was being questioned by police because his iPhone tracker located him at a local station. Mr Hedley said he knew the university had a ""zero tolerance"" approach to initiation-style events but added it was regarded by some as a ""tradition"" and ""a thing you just had to do"".

Catherine Corless collated hundreds of death certificates for the infants who died in the home The Irish government set up a public inquiry in 2015 to investigate the Tuam burials and to conduct a wider examination of how mother and baby homes were run.

In March 2017, the commission confirmed that ""significant quantities"" of human remains have been discovered in at least 17 underground chambers.

"Women and girls across the UK face ""relentless"" harassment on the street and not enough is being done to stop it, MPs say. The politicians making up the Women and Equalities Committee looked into the issue for nine months and found the amount of harassment meant it became ""normalised"" for girls growing up. The MPs are now calling for the government to take action to tackle it. The Home Office said the issue was a ""key priority"". What's it like for a woman who's harassed? The committee heard evidence that street harassment was widespread, from being shouted at and cat-called through to sexual assaults. They also heard it took place in a number of public spaces - on transport, in bars and clubs, through online spaces, at universities, in parks and on the street. One woman, Sarah, told the BBC her 12-year-old daughter has faced harassment on her school bus - including boys pushing her off her seat, spitting at her, and calling her a slut. Although the school did take action when Sarah reported the incidents, she said more needed to be done to stop such behaviour being normalised. ""It starts off as a bit of banter between young boys and girls but quickly can grow into something more concerning,"" she said. ""It's an indication of how boys think they can treat girls. If they think it's acceptable at that age what will they be like when they are older?"" Committee chairwoman Maria Miller said: ""Women feel the onus is put on them to avoid 'risky' situations - all of this keeps women and girls unequal."" The report,externalconcluded that social attitudes underpinned sexual harassment, and the normalisation of it contributed to a ""wider negative cultural effect on society"". And while the government has pledged to eliminate sexual harassment of women and girls by 2030, the committee said there was ""no evidence of any programme to achieve this"". The report outlined seven key recommendations to tackle street harassment: Force train and bus operators to take tougher action against sexual harassment and block the viewing of pornography on public transport Ban all non-consensual sharing of intimate images Publish a new ""Violence Against Women and Girls"" strategy Create a public campaign to change attitudes Take an evidence-based approach to addressing the harms of pornography, along the lines of road safety or anti-smoking campaigns Tougher laws to ensure pub landlords take action on sexual harassment - and make local authorities consult women's groups before licensing strip clubs Make it a legal obligation for universities to have policies outlawing sexual harassment This video can not be played 'I've been harassed on the street, on buses and in bars' Hollaback! - an international movement tackling harassment - says there is no right or wrong way to respond. It says the most important thing is to get yourself out of the situation if you feel unsafe. But if you choose to speak directly to the assailant, it offers the following advice: Be firm:Look them in the eye and denounce their behaviour with a strong, clear voice Say what feels natural:The important thing is that you are not apologetic in your response Don't engage:Harassers may try to argue with you or dismiss you through further conversation or by making fun of you. As tempting as it may be get into a verbal war with them, it is not recommended. The attention may feed their abusive behaviour Keep moving:Once you've said your piece, keep moving. Harassers do not deserve the pleasure of your company Read more: What should you do if you are harassed? The Home Office said it had pledged Â£100m in funding until 2020 to help local services combat violence against women and girls. And it said it was working on an updated ""Violence Against Women and Girls"" strategy. 'Third of girls' harassed in school uniform France issues first street harassment fine Nearly half of young women harassed at festivals A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""Unwelcome advances that intimidate, degrade or humiliate women and girls are an abuse of power and unlawful. Whether in the home, the workplace or in public, sexual harassment is unacceptable. ""The government has made protecting women and girls from all forms of violence, and supporting victims and survivors a key priority."" She said the Home Office would consider the report's recommendations before publishing a full response. There's no specific law against sexual harassment in public in the UK - but there are laws prohibiting lots of behaviour that might be considered harassment. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 makes it an offence to cause ""alarm or distress"" or put people ""in fear of violence"". There are also laws against stalking. If street harassment crosses the line into unwanted touching, that can then be dealt with as a sexual offence such as sexual assault. And when it comes to watching pornography on public transport, there is a pre-internet era law criminalising the public display of ""indecent matter"" - but the parliamentary inquiry described this as ""little-known and likely to be little-used"".

"Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte (L) and his two deputies - Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini (R) - have been told to revise their budget The European Commission has told Italy to revise its budget, an unprecedented move with regard to an EU member state. The Commission is worried about the impact of higher spending on already high levels of debt in Italy, the eurozone's third-biggest economy. Italy's governing populist parties have vowed to push ahead with campaign promises including a minimum income for the unemployed. The country now has three weeks to submit a new, draft budget to Brussels. The Commission said the first draft represented a ""particularly serious non-compliance"" with its recommendations. What's behind Italy's economic turbulence? Italy populists take power: What comes next? The Commission Vice-President for the euro, Valdis Dombrovskis, said Italy's response to the commission's concerns was ""not sufficient"" to assuage fears - and the euro's rules were the same for everybody. ""This is the first Italian budget that the EU doesn't like,"" wrote Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio on Facebook. ""No surprise: This is the first Italian budget written in Rome and not in Brussels!"" His co-deputy PM Matteo Salvini added: ""This doesn't change anything."" ""They're not attacking a government but a people. These are things that will anger Italians even more,"" he said. The new government has vowed to ""end poverty"" with a minimum income for the unemployed. Other measures include tax cuts and scrapping extensions to the retirement age - fulfilling several key campaign promises from the election in March. A defiant Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte insisted earlier that the budget deficit would go no higher than 2.4% of GDP, although the target is three times than that of the previous government. The government argues that servicing its debt of 131% of national output - second only to bailed-out Greece - would hurt Italians, who have still not recovered from the decade-old financial crisis. Italy's economy is still smaller than it was in 2008. The governing League and Five Star parties argue an increase in spending would kick-start growth. Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe correspondent Four week ago, cries of ""We did it!"" followed the budget's approval in Italy Italy' has put itself on a collision course with the EU. The dispute takes the eurozone into uncharted waters. The authorities in Brussels have the right to reject a budget and demand new proposals - and to impose fines - if its requests are ignored. This is the first time they've gone as far as this down that road and the EU has to weigh the prospect of taking firm measures to discourage other eurozone states from breaking the rules against the prospect of a drawn-out conflict with one of its largest member states at a time when its political energies are already absorbed by Brexit. The Italian government says its measures are necessary to restore growth and that it has no intention of backing down. Italy's neutral Finance Minister, Giovanni Tria, and international observers had hoped the country would keep its deficit under 2% of GDP - and perhaps as low as 1.6%. While 2.4% falls well short of the 3% deficit limit under eurozone rules, Italy's debt level is alarming. ""For the first time the Commission is obliged to request a euro area country to revise its draft budgetary plan but we see no alternative than to request the Italian authorities to do so,"" Mr Dombrovskis said. He pointed out that Italian taxpayers were having to spend as much servicing the national debt as on education. ""Breaking rules can appear tempting at the first look - it can provide the illusion of breaking free,"" he said. ""It is tempting to try and cure debt with more debt. At some point, the debt weighs too heavy... you end up having no freedom at all."" After Italy announced its draft budget last month, weeks of market turmoil followed. Before the Commission announced its rejection of the Italian budget on Tuesday,European shares fell to their lowest levels in nearly two years. Following the announcement, the Italy-Germany 10-year bond yield gap, widely used as a relative yardstick of Italy's position on the markets, widened to a new high of 314 points. Italy's populists agree new budget Budget makes Italians 'worse off', says EU What's behind Italy's economic turbulence? Italy populists take power: What comes next?

"Uber decorated a car in greenery to promote the electric-power fee Uber is planning to add a surcharge to all fares booked via its app in London to help its drivers buy electric vehicles. The fee, expected to be 15p per mile, will be introduced ""early"" in 2019. Uber said drivers working for 40 hours per week could get cash help of about Â£1,500 a year from passengers via the top-up fee. The ride-hailing firm said the scheme would also contribute towards plans to curb air pollution in the capital. Uber said it expected the scheme to raise more than Â£200m ($260m) over the ""next few years"" to help drivers swap vehicles. It said the fee would add about 45p to the average London journey. Attempts to tackle air pollution in London are driving the push towards electric vehicles It hopes to hand cash to 20,000 drivers to help them switch by 2021 and get all of them converted by the middle of that decade. Uber currently has about 40,000 drivers in London. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, said in a statement that the plan was a ""a long-term investment in the future of London aimed at going all electric in the capital in 2025"". He added: ""Over time, it's our goal to help people replace their car with their phone by offering a range of mobility options - whether cars, bikes, scooters or public transport - all in the Uber app."" It said the introduction of the fee would build on other partnerships it has fostered to improve London's infrastructure for electric vehicles which have led to the installation of more charging points. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Mayor of London said Uber's recognition on the importance of clean air was a ""positive step"". She added: ""Electric cars are not a complete solution. We also need to address the damaging impact that the rising number of private hire vehicles has on congestion and air pollution."" The Uber initiative comes soon after the UK governmentcut subsidies for buying greener cars.From 9 November, grants for plug-in hybrids will stop and those for all-electric cars will shrink from Â£4,500 to Â£3,500. The UK government has cut subsidies that helped people pay for electric vehicles and hybrids Professor David Bailey, an expert in industrial strategy from Aston University, said the move was a ""welcome first step"". ""Uber is not doing this out of the goodness of its heart,"" he told the BBC, explaining that larger London plans to clean up the capital's air will put more and more restrictions on the types of vehicles that can pass through it. ""If they don't act they risk not having any drivers or customers,"" he said. ""The move to electric cars is going to happen anyway and they want to be seen to be playing their part,"" said Prof Bailey. Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi acknowledges the need for spending on more charging stations Uber's plan looks very ambitious. The average driver on the road for 40 hours a week will build up Â£4,500 from the clean air levy over three years - but that will still leave many of them struggling to afford an electric car. By then some of them will have moved on - after all, Uber driving is often a short-term activity - and the money they have saved will just go back into the central fund. But the biggest problem is going to be charging. Most drivers will not have off-street parking where they can plug in overnight. Dara Khosrowshahi admits there is a problem with the infrastructure. ""The city is going to need to invest in it and we'll need to support them."" Read Rory's full blog Other concrete steps Uber could take would involve it letting drivers of electric vehicles keep more of the cash passengers pay, he said. ""There are still quite significant barriers to electric vehicle take-up,"" said Prof Bailey. The relatively high cost of electric vehicles was one factor, as was the lack of charging points and fears about range. Those problems would be solved in time, he said, but government and other policy makers also needed to think about smarter ways to get people moving to using electric cars and other vehicles.

"Businesses are being consulted by government about adding calorie labelling to menus UK high streets have the highest concentration of fast food outlets in almost a decade, figures show. Despite town halls attempting to limit their spread, in most areas the number of takeaways per 100,000 people was at its highest since 2010. Research suggests people most exposed to them arenearly twice as likely to be obese. An industry group said proposals to introduce calorie labels on menus could hit independent shops. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map If you cannot view the map,click to launch it in a browser.,external The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed the latest figuresfrom the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS).  It found: The UK has seen a 34% increase in fast food outlets from 2010 to 2018 In 2010, the average number of fast food outlets per 100,000 people was 47.  It had risen to 61 by 2018 In nearly every area (204 out of 215) the rate of takeaways per 100,000 people was higher in 2018 than 2010 This video can not be played Joseph Law from Rotherham was eating a takeaway for lunch and dinner at 16 years old. In Rotherham, South Yorkshire, nearly three quarters of people are deemed to be overweight or obese, according to figures published by Public Health England. At the age of 16, Joseph Law weighed 30 stone after eating a daily diet of takeaway food from the town centre. ""At my heaviest I was eating a Chinese for dinner every day, and then I'd have perhaps pizza or fish and chips for tea,"" he said. ""I was just sucked in by the price of the cheap food. I could get a sandwich for Â£3 or a full Chinese for Â£2.50. ""There are more takeaways than corner shops in Rotherham, it's ridiculous and I definitely think they need to be banned."" Ismail Shahjahan says the increasing number of takeaways in Rotherham has damaged existing businesses Nearly 60% of all food businesses in Rotherham are fast food or takeaways, and nearby business owners say the number of outlets has been growing rapidly. ""In the last couple of years I've seen 60 to 80 pizza shops open in Rotherham,"" said Ismail Shahjahan, who has run a takeaway in the town for the past 16 years. ""My business was very good two or three years ago, but given that there are now so many more takeaways I've seen the number of customers coming to my takeaway fall."" Rotherham Council said any new application to open a takeaway had to be considered against its ""Hot Food Takeaways"" policy to limit them. Councils have introduced various initiativesto limit the opening or location of new takeaways,external, such as stopping clusters of shops forming near schools Public Health England's chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said it was working with the food and drink industry to make everyday products healthier The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said local authorities needed ""more planning powers"" to help tackle the ""clustering of existing takeaways already open"" Dr Thomas Burgoine, who researched the link between obesity and exposure to fast food, said the ""consistency of year-on-year growth in the takeaway sector was a concern"". ""It's common for takeaways to represent a third and sometimes up to half of all the high street food available - reducing consumer choice,"" said Dr Burgoine, from the Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR) at the University of Cambridge. ""From a public health point of view, it should be healthy choices that are the easy choices.  In many places we seem to be moving away from that."" Some takeaways are trialling a healthier menu The British Takeaway Campaign (BTC), representing the sector, said outlets ""wanted to play their part to tackle obesity"" but small independents ""needed support"" rather than mandatory calorie labelling on menus, which would have a cost impact.

The eating out of home sector, including cafes, restaurants and pubs, provides 20-25% of an adult's energy intake, according to research published by Public Health England in March. Unlicensed restaurants and cafes (those where alcohol is not offered) saw an even steeper rise in their numbers than fast food outlets - 88% - between 2010 and 2018. The average number of unlicensed restaurants/cafes per 100,000 people was 26 in 2010. Last year, it had risen to 45 per 100,000 people. The ONS said the rise was likely to have been driven by a surge in coffee shops. Prof Jonathan Morris, a historian at the University of Hertfordshire who has studied the spread of coffee shops, said their numbers had increased five-fold since 1997, as much because they ""sold space"" as because they sold drinks and sometimes food. England's Department of Health and Social Care launched a three-year programme in October, inviting councils to pitch ideas to tackle childhood obesity. It said: ""Local authorities have a range of powers to create healthier environments, including planning policies to limit the opening of additional fast food outlets close to schools and in areas of over-concentration. ""However, we know these decisions are not always easy for councils, which is why we recently announced our Trailblazer programme to support them to use their powers to best effect. ""We are also consulting on introducing calorie labelling for takeaway menus and other outlets including restaurants, to help families make more informed decisions about their food when eating out or getting a takeaway.""

PC Tom Dorman had his leg amputated after a car crash in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in September. He said members of the public ""ran out of their homes"" to stop ""catastrophic"" bleeding in his leg, which meant he could have ""died within two minutes"". Two men have been arrested in connection with the collision. PC Dorman, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, was in a stationary vehicle which wasstruck by a silver Ford Focus at 05:30 BST on 2 September. He said the ""loud bang"" of the crash caused people to wake up and come out of their homes to his aid. ""I managed to explain, somehow, to someone, how to improvise a tourniquet, that they could tie round and keep pulling to slow the bleeding in the wound and close up the artery,"" he said. Tom Dorman was working the night shift when he was involved in a crash which led to the amputation of his leg Not being able to remember who applied the tourniquet, he said ""a jumper was used to at least stem the flow"", although he had ""no idea where it came from"". ""To everyone else who helped, I owe you my life, and I'm very thankful to them,"" PC Dorman said. ""I'm effectively the luckiest person in the world.""

"The ship was surveyed and digitally mapped by two remote underwater vehicles A Greek merchant ship dating back more than 2,400 years has been found lying on its side off the Bulgarian coast. The 23m (75ft) wreck, found in the Black Sea by an Anglo-Bulgarian team, is being hailed as officially the world's oldest known intact shipwreck. The researchers were stunned to find the merchant vessel closely resembled in design a ship that decorated ancient Greek wine vases. The rudder, rowing benches and even the contents of its hold remain intact. ""It's like another world,"" Helen Farr from the expedition told the BBC. ""It's when the ROV [remote operated vehicle] drops down through the water column and you see this ship appear in the light at the bottom so perfectly preserved it feels like you step back in time."" The shipwreck that became a landmark on the Clyde Portugal makes 'discovery of a decade' Sonar reveals WW1 U-boat wreck The reason the trading vessel, dating back to around 400 BC, has remained in such good condition for so long is that the water is anoxic, or free of oxygen. Lying more than 2,000m below the surface, it is also beyond the reach of modern divers. ""It's preserved, it's safe,"" she added. ""It's not deteriorating and it's unlikely to attract hunters."" The vessel was one of many tracking between the Mediterranean and Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast. It was discovered more than 80km off the Bulgarian city of Burgas. The Anglo-Bulgarian team believe the Black Sea wreck dates back to the Fourth Century BC, perhaps 100 years after the Siren Vase was painted The team used two underwater robotic explorers to map out a 3-D image of the ship and they took a sample to carbon-date its age. How did ancient Greek music sound? Pompeii's destruction date could be wrong The vessel is similar in style to that depicted by the so-called Siren Painter on the Siren Vase in the British Museum. Dating back to around 480 BC, the vase shows Odysseus strapped to the mast as his ship sails past three mythical sea nymphs whose tune was thought to drive sailors to their deaths. As yet the ship's cargo remains unknown and the team say they need more funding if they are to return to the site. ""Normally we find amphorae (wine vases) and can guess where it's come from, but with this it's still in the hold,"" said Dr Farr. ""As archaeologists we're interested in what it can tell us about technology, trade and movements in the area.""

"The woman wants the sleeves, trim, collar and bodice of the dress to feature her mother's hair A woman is searching for a dressmaker who can create a garment featuring her dead mother's hair. She says she had been collecting the hair for four years before her mother died in August and will pay Â£15k for a replica of her mother's wedding dress. The 61-year-old from Bristol, who wants to remain anonymous,posted the request,externalon the fashion manufacturing website Sewport. So far, no designer has volunteered to take on the task. In her post, the woman writes: ""I'm looking for someone to recreate my mother's wedding dress from 1953, which she wore when she married my father. ""My mother passed away recently and I'd like to create a special memento of her life. She wrote: ""I found out my mother was ill in 2014 and from that point onward I began to collect her hair. ""At the time I wasn't sure why I was collecting it, however, now I think I do."" She acknowledges the task is ""admittedly quite weird"" but says she is keen to have the finished piece ready in time for the anniversary of her mother's death next August. It was usual for Victorian mourners to wear lockets and rings containinga lock of hairfrom a dead person. Queen Victoria is said to have regularly worn a locket of Prince Albert's hair from his death in 1861, up until her own 40 years later. The preparation of hair for mourning jewellery was a professional occupation in the 19th Century. At the same time in the US there was a trend for making wreaths out of loved ones' hair. Wreaths intertwining the hair of dead and living relatives were viewed as objects to signify the family tree. Details of how to shape and create a hair wreath are included in the Self-Instructor in the Art of Hair Work published in 1867, and a catalogue from the National Artistic Hairwork Company. Leila Cohoon's Hair Museum in Independence, Missouri, displays more than 400 wreaths and more than 2,000 pieces of jewellery made out of human hair. The ideal design she says, would feature hair sewn into the sleeves, trim, collar and bodice of the ballroom-style dress. She has sketched out a design and says she would like it to be as ""authentic"" as possible and feature the box of hair she started collecting in 2014. Boris Hodakel, founder of the Sewport website, said most design requests were typically snapped up by manufacturers within six hours. He said: ""We deal with quirky and wonderful designs every day - that's fashion.""

"This is the first time Piper Jaffray's survey has placed Instagram ahead of Snapchat in recent years Instagram has overtaken Snapchat as the most used social media app among US teens, according to a study. A total of 8,600 teenagers were surveyed for investment bank Piper Jaffray'stwice-annual look at so-called Generation Z's habits,external. The report indicates that 85% of participants used Instagram at least once a month compared with an equivalent figure of 84% for Snapchat. But rankings were reversed when the teens were asked which they preferred. Snapchat was picked as the ""favourite social platform"" by 46% of those questioned, while Instagram was chosen by 32%. That figure may offer some reassurance to Evan Spiegel and other chiefs at parent firm Snap that their efforts to address a backlash against an unpopular redesign are working. But it is the engagement figure that has dominated headlines, and threatens to feed a narrative that Snapchat is on the decline. Snapchat adds selfie filters for cats Does drop in Snapchat users spell trouble? US teens ditch Facebook for other apps In August, Snap reported that for the first time the number of people using its serviceon a daily basis had dropped. And on 11 October, its shares hit an all-time-low after one analyst claimed the firm was ""running out of money"". Snapchat's latest features include the ability to carry out Amazon searches by pointing a phone's camera at nearby objects By contrast, Instagram is flush with cash thanks to its popularity with marketers. ""Instagram continues to show dominance in selling, as teens overwhelmingly prefer brands contact them on Instagram versus other channels,"" said Piper Jaffray in its report. In particular, the Facebook-owned Instagram's addition of Stories - which was launched in August 2016 - has fuelled its popularity among teenagers. The self-destructing videos and photos - which remain live for just 24 hours - were only introduced after a similar feature had already been popularised by Snapchat. But according to Instagram's own figures,more than 400 million people use its version each day,external, which is more than double the number of peopleSnapchat says log into its service to carry out any activity over the same period,external. Instagram added its Stories slideshows in 2016 ""Instagram will add just more than 12 million new users [in the US] this year, which is more than double any other social network,"" commented Rimma Kats from the consultancy eMarketerin a report earlier this week,external. ""And while Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram all have a 'Stories' feature, it's Instagram Stories that will be especially successful in capturing new sign-ups."" Piper Jaffray's report follows a similar but smallersurvey by the Pew Research Center earlier in the year. Of the 750 US teens it questioned in April, 72% said they used Instagram compared with 69% who said they used Snapchat. In the UK, the media regulator Ofcom publishes two studies - one that covers the16-to-24s,externaland theother that looks at 12-to-15s,external. Its latest figures for both age groups suggest Snapchat still has a slight edge over Instagram when it comes to usage, but the watchdog is due to update its figures for the younger demographic in about a month's time.

"More than a quarter of meat-free burgers, sausages and mince tested for a study exceed maximum recommended salt levels, a campaign group has warned. A total of 28% of the 157 meat substitute products studied by Action on Salt missed the voluntary salt targets set by Public Health England. The worst offenders were saltier than Atlantic seawater, the report found. Public Health England said it had told companies the importance of meeting its voluntary targets. But Action on Salt called on PHE to take ""urgent action"" to do more to lower salt in the products. Will going vegan make you healthier? Is social media behind the rise of veganism? Of all of the meat-free alternatives studied by Action on Salt, only three were low in salt. The saltiest product was Tofurky's Deli Slices Hickory Smoked, followed by Tesco's Meat Free Bacon Style Rashers - with 3.5g and 3.2g of salt per 100g respectively. PHE's target for meat-free bacon is 1.88g of salt per 100g. Seawater has 2.5g of salt per 100g. Meat-free bacon was found to be the saltiest range of products, followed by sliced ""meat"", while vegetarian burgers were saltier on average than those containing meat. There were also large variations between products in the same category, with the biggest being the 83% between the saltiest and least salty meat-free mince products. Tesco's Meat Free Mince had one of the lowest levels of salt of all the 157 products analysed. Tofurky and Tesco have yet to respond to a request to comment on the findings. Action on Salt nutritionist Mhairi Brown said: ""The food industry has ensured greater availability of meat-free alternatives, but now they must do more to ensure that meat-free alternatives contain far less salt - at the very least lower than their meat equivalents. ""This survey drives home the urgent need for Public Health England to reinvigorate the UK's salt reduction strategy."" Researchers said some of the foods were saltier, per 100g, than seawater in the Atlantic Ocean Plain meat alternatives (including plain mince, pieces and fillets): 0.63g of salt per 100g Meat-free products (all meat alternative products, including sausages, burgers, bites, pies and sliced ""meats""): 1.25g of salt per 100g Meat-free bacon: 1.88g of salt per 100g Tofurky's Deli Slices Hickory Smoked: 3.5g of salt per 100g Tesco Meat Free Bacon Style Rashers: 3.2g of salt per 100g Tesco Meat Free Mince (least salty): 0.2g of salt per 100g Atlantic seawater: 2.5g of salt per 100g Action on Salt chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at London's Queen Mary University, said: ""Reducing salt is the most cost-effective measure to reduce the number of people dying or suffering from entirely unnecessary strokes and heart disease."" He added: ""It is incomprehensible that Public Health England are not doing more to reduce the amount of salt in our food. We are again calling on PHE to take urgent action"". Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, said salt consumption had fallen over the last decade ""but there is still a long way to go, as some foods still contain too much salt"". He added: ""Government has been clear with the food industry on the importance of meeting the 2017 salt targets. ""Since taking over salt reduction, PHE has been collecting data on industry's progress and we'll report later this year as planned."" Quorn, one of the leading producers of vegetarian meat, said it had varying levels of salt in its products. Its Meat-Free Best of British Sausages contain 1.9g of salt per 100g - more than the PHE recommendation. That means eating one sausage will give you 1.1g of salt. Adults would need to eat more than six of them in a day to bust their salt allowance (not counting any other salt in foods they also eat). A spokeswoman added: ""While they are higher in salt, as clearly marked on the pack, they are still low in saturated fat. ""We review all our product recipes on an ongoing basis to ensure we are achieving what our consumers want in terms of taste and health credentials."" Will going vegan make you healthier?

"Sir James Dyson is the founder of the company Dyson, the UK-based company best known for its vacuum cleaners, has chosen to build its new electric car in Singapore. The company will break ground on its new factory in Singapore later this year with the first car scheduled to roll off the production line in 2021. Dyson said the decision was based on the availability of engineering talent, regional supply chains and proximity to some key target markets. Cost was not a consideration. Singapore is one of the most expensive territories in the world to do business and space for manufacturing is at a premium in the city state. Dyson gears up for electric car testing Dyson creates 300 electric car jobs The company has previously said it will commit Â£2bn to the project, including Â£200m to be spent in the UK on research and development and test track facilities - much of which has already been spent. Dyson insisted the decision to locate production in Asia, rather than the UK, had nothing to do with Brexit. Although there may be some disappointment that car manufacturing will not be coming to Malmesbury in Wiltshire, Dyson doesn't currently manufacture any of its products in the UK, so this decision is no real departure from that pattern. Dyson is given credit for tripling its UK workforce to 4,800 over the last five years and founding a new engineering institute on the site of an old air base which it has renovated. The company currently has 1,100 employees in Singapore, 1,300 in Malaysia, 1,000 in China and 800 in the Philippines. Dyson is committing Â£2bn to the project Dyson has not yet revealed what kind of batteries its new cars will use, or where they will be made. It recently wrote off Â£46m of its investment in American solid state battery development company Sakti3 - which it bought in 2015 for Â£58m. Industry experts say that solid state batteries - which can potentially be charged faster and hold a greater charge for longer - are still in an experimental phase. Dyson continues to develop both solid state and traditional lithium ion batteries in parallel. The company's founder, Sir James Dyson, has been a prominent advocate for Brexit and recently insisted that the UK leaving the EU with no deal would ""make no difference"". Brexit: Jaguar boss issues stark warning for jobs and profit Toyota says no-deal Brexit would stall production at Burnaston His critics say this approach is because his company is less vulnerable to the same problems as other car manufacturers, who have supply chains that include components that cross between the EU and the UK many times. Several major manufacturers, including BMW, Airbus and Jaguar Land Rover - who manufacture in the UK - have recently sounded dire warnings about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on UK investment.

"Gilberto Benetton, a co-founder of the Benetton clothing firm, has died at the age of 77 after a short illness. He, with brothers Luciano and Carlo and sister Giuliana, founded United Colors of Benetton in Italy in the 1960s. The family is one of the most powerful in Italy, with interests in construction, transport and catering. Gilberto is credited with diversifying the company away from the clothing business, and growing it into a multi-billion euro giant. He was the former head of the family holding company, Edizione, which controls Italy's biggest infrastructure group Atlantia. A unit of Atlantia operated the bridge in Genoa which collapsed in August, leading to the death of 43 people. His death comes just three months after that of younger brother Carlo in July. He was aged 74. The Benettons also control roadside caterer Autogrill and Rome's airports. Benetton was criticised for the use of photos of migrants being rescued from the Mediterranean The Benetton clothing chain's brightly-coloured sweaters were considered most chic in the 1980s and 1990s and its eye-catching advertisements kept it in the spotlight. An early one featured a black woman breastfeeding a white baby. A later one, labelled ""We, On Death Row"", used photographs of prisoners sentenced to death in the US. The company continues to provoke. This summer, its advertising featuring images of migrants being rescued from the Mediterranean, was called ""despicable"" by Italy's interior minister and attacked by the charity, SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e, for using pictures of people ""in distress"".

"This video can not be played What happens during a smear test? About three million women across England have not had a smear test for at least three-and-a-half years. GPs are trying to improve take-up rates as figures show up to half of women under 50 in some areas have not had a cervical screening in the recommended time frame. Screening rates are at their lowest for two decades. Public Health England said it was ""concerned"" by the fall. A further million women aged 50 to 64 have not had a smear test for at least five and a half years. About 72% of women aged 25 to 64 have had a smear test within the period recommended for their age, according to figures compiled in March 2017. This is down from 75.4% in 2012. A total of 220,000 British women are diagnosed with cervical abnormalities each year and there were 854 deaths from cervical cancer in England in 2016. Cervical screening detects abnormal cells on the entrance to the womb. Samme Allen says more needs to be done to make sure women know the screening is a ""preventative test"" Samme Allen, from Kingston, says the manner of a nurse at a cervical screening she had aged 25 was ""the opposite of reassuring"". It was 10 years before she had another one and the result led to a diagnosis of cervical cancer. She had to undergo ""a couple of operations"" and has subsequently been given the all clear. ""I worked overseas and regularly moved, so I always seemed to avoid thinking about it,"" she said. ""I never had any symptoms for cervical cancer, and so didn't feel I needed to go to the doctor."" This continued for a decade until a nurse at a routine health check in 2010 told her she was overdue a screening. Business consultant Ms Allen said the test should be seen in a similar way to ""going to the dentist or opticians"". ""Yes, it's uncomfortable and no it's not a pleasant experience, but my story shows how important it really is,"" she said. The NHS target is for 80% of women aged 25 to 49to be tested every three years,externaland the same proportion aged 50 to 64 to be screened every five years. WATCH: Is there scraping in a smear test? The truth about what it really involves,external London has some of the lowest rates of women screened for cervical cancer. In some boroughs just over half of eligible women under 50 had a test within the past three and a half years. Official figures from Public Health England (PHE),external, matched to local authority districts, reveal about half of eligible 25 to 49-year-old women registered at GP practices in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and Hammersmith and Fulham had received adequate screening. Cambridge and Oxford also had rates of 54 and 55%. In Leicester it was 60%, rising to 61% in Luton and 62% in Manchester, Slough, Haringey and Birmingham. Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire was at the other end, with 80% of eligible women having had the test in the past three-and-a-half years. A spokeswoman for Rushcliffe CCG said practices in the Nottinghamshire area deemed not to be achieving screening targets were given extra support. She said Cancer Research UK had been helping to improve uptake. Baking helping Beth beat brain damage 'Degrading strip search left me with PTSD' PC told public how to save his life Experts put it down toembarrassment, a lack of awareness or just putting it off. A survey of 2,017 women by the charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust suggested young women were embarrassed to attend smear tests because of their body shape (35%), the appearance of their vulva (34%) and concerns over smell (38%). A third said they would not go if they had not waxed or shaved their bikini area. About 15% said they would miss their smear tests for a gym class or a waxing appointment. Dr Laura Marlow from University College London conducted research into cervical cancer screenings and said ethnicity also played ""an important role"". ""We found that women from ethnic minority groups were more likely to be unaware of screening and older women were more likely to have decided not to go,"" she said. ""Understanding these patterns will help us to decide how interventions might be shaped differently for different types of non-attenders."" However, she added: ""I think we have to be careful about saying that ethnicity contributes to the absolute numbers because it is only a part of the picture."" A spokeswoman for clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in north west London said GPs faced challenges in areas with ""language barriers, religious concerns and high levels of deprivation"". Former Big Brother contestant Jade Goody is credited with a rise in cervical screening rates following her death in 2009 Cervical screening rates rose following the death of realty TV star Jade Goody,externalat the age of 27 in 2009, as her story brought about greater awareness, but the numbers have fallen back since. Dr Asha Kasliwal, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said: ""Cervical screening is not a mandated requirement for local authority commissioning. Local authorities under severe budgetary pressure are not including this essential aspect of women's health care in their service specifications. ""GPs have a very positive role to play in increasing uptake by offering opportunistic screening, but primary care is not able to effectively meet the increased demand. ""Screening rates are now at their lowest in two decades and the minimum 80% national target is far from being achieved,"" she said. Dr Kasliwal is calling for resources and more funding for cervical screening in primary healthcare, and for it to be included in sexual health services. Women in north-west London women are being offered evening and weekend screenings in order to make it more convenient to attend. Robert Music from Jo's Cancer Trust said there was ""no one magic solution"" to improve attendance, but the charity was working with GPs to provide drop in surgeries, phone clinics and ""engagement with community or faith groups"". Professor Anne Mackie, PHE's director of screening said: ""PHE, alongside charities including Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, the NHS and local authorities, are concerned about the fall in women taking the test. ""Currently 72% of women have cervical screening and we're working together to ensure that every woman knows what the test is about and to make it easy to attend screening appointments.""

"Women and girls across the UK face ""relentless"" harassment on the street and not enough is being done to stop it, MPs say. The politicians making up the Women and Equalities Committee looked into the issue for nine months and found the amount of harassment meant it became ""normalised"" for girls growing up. The MPs are now calling for the government to take action to tackle it. The Home Office said the issue was a ""key priority"". What's it like for a woman who's harassed? The committee heard evidence that street harassment was widespread, from being shouted at and cat-called through to sexual assaults. They also heard it took place in a number of public spaces - on transport, in bars and clubs, through online spaces, at universities, in parks and on the street. One woman, Sarah, told the BBC her 12-year-old daughter has faced harassment on her school bus - including boys pushing her off her seat, spitting at her, and calling her a slut. Although the school did take action when Sarah reported the incidents, she said more needed to be done to stop such behaviour being normalised. ""It starts off as a bit of banter between young boys and girls but quickly can grow into something more concerning,"" she said. ""It's an indication of how boys think they can treat girls. If they think it's acceptable at that age what will they be like when they are older?"" Committee chairwoman Maria Miller said: ""Women feel the onus is put on them to avoid 'risky' situations - all of this keeps women and girls unequal."" The report,externalconcluded that social attitudes underpinned sexual harassment, and the normalisation of it contributed to a ""wider negative cultural effect on society"". And while the government has pledged to eliminate sexual harassment of women and girls by 2030, the committee said there was ""no evidence of any programme to achieve this"". The report outlined seven key recommendations to tackle street harassment: Force train and bus operators to take tougher action against sexual harassment and block the viewing of pornography on public transport Ban all non-consensual sharing of intimate images Publish a new ""Violence Against Women and Girls"" strategy Create a public campaign to change attitudes Take an evidence-based approach to addressing the harms of pornography, along the lines of road safety or anti-smoking campaigns Tougher laws to ensure pub landlords take action on sexual harassment - and make local authorities consult women's groups before licensing strip clubs Make it a legal obligation for universities to have policies outlawing sexual harassment This video can not be played 'I've been harassed on the street, on buses and in bars' Hollaback! - an international movement tackling harassment - says there is no right or wrong way to respond. It says the most important thing is to get yourself out of the situation if you feel unsafe. But if you choose to speak directly to the assailant, it offers the following advice: Be firm:Look them in the eye and denounce their behaviour with a strong, clear voice Say what feels natural:The important thing is that you are not apologetic in your response Don't engage:Harassers may try to argue with you or dismiss you through further conversation or by making fun of you. As tempting as it may be get into a verbal war with them, it is not recommended. The attention may feed their abusive behaviour Keep moving:Once you've said your piece, keep moving. Harassers do not deserve the pleasure of your company Read more: What should you do if you are harassed? The Home Office said it had pledged Â£100m in funding until 2020 to help local services combat violence against women and girls. And it said it was working on an updated ""Violence Against Women and Girls"" strategy. 'Third of girls' harassed in school uniform France issues first street harassment fine Nearly half of young women harassed at festivals A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""Unwelcome advances that intimidate, degrade or humiliate women and girls are an abuse of power and unlawful. Whether in the home, the workplace or in public, sexual harassment is unacceptable. ""The government has made protecting women and girls from all forms of violence, and supporting victims and survivors a key priority."" She said the Home Office would consider the report's recommendations before publishing a full response. There's no specific law against sexual harassment in public in the UK - but there are laws prohibiting lots of behaviour that might be considered harassment. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 makes it an offence to cause ""alarm or distress"" or put people ""in fear of violence"". There are also laws against stalking. If street harassment crosses the line into unwanted touching, that can then be dealt with as a sexual offence such as sexual assault. And when it comes to watching pornography on public transport, there is a pre-internet era law criminalising the public display of ""indecent matter"" - but the parliamentary inquiry described this as ""little-known and likely to be little-used"".

"This video can not be played Recep Tayyip Erdogan says many questions need to be answered The killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was planned days in advance, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has told MPs from his ruling party. He said Turkey had strong evidence Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated and ""savage"" murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. He also called for the suspects to be tried in Istanbul. He demanded Saudi Arabia provide answers about where Khashoggi's body was, and who had ordered the operation. The Saudi kingdom has provided conflicting accounts of what happened to Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post contributor. After weeks of maintaining he was still alive, the authorities now say the 59-year-old was killed in a rogue operation. Mr Erdogan's address coincided with the start of an investment conference in Saudi Arabia that has been overshadowed by the Khashoggi case. Dozens of government and business leaders have pulled out, but Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeared at the event on Tuesday. Saudi summit begins despite calls for a boycott How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi Many world leaders have condemned the murder of the prominent Saudi critic and demanded a full investigation. US President Donald Trump says he is not satisfied with the Saudi explanation but he has also highlighted the kingdom's importance as a US ally. CIA director Gina Haspel has been sent to Turkey to review the matter. This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? Fifteen Saudi nationals, Mr Erdogan said, arrived in Istanbul in three teams, on separate flights, in the days and hours leading up to the murder. A day before the killing, he said, some members from the group travelled to Belgrad forest, near the consulate - an area searched last week by Turkish police looking for the body. He also described how the team had removed the hard drives from the consulate's surveillance camera system prior to the arrival of Khashoggi, who was visiting to obtain documents for his forthcoming marriage. A man who looked like Khashoggi, wearing his outfit, glasses and a fake beard, was among a group who left the consulate the same day as the killing, the president added. On Monday, CNN broadcast images appearing to show that Saudi operative leaving the consulate. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons President Erdogan confirmed 18 people had been arrested in Saudi Arabia over the case. He told MPs from his ruling AK party the 18 should ""be tried in Istanbul"", adding that ""all those who played a role in the murder"" would be punished. All you need to know about Khashoggi's death Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Who was the victim? Mr Erdogan called for an independent commission to be set up but said he was confident in King Salman's full co-operation. He did not mention the crown prince, widely seen as the most powerful figure in the kingdom. Many believe he ordered the killing, although the Saudis deny this. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says Mr Erdogan's speech was notable as much for what it left out as for what it left in. There was no mention of the much-discussed audio tape from inside the Saudi consulate which Turkish media say reveals gruesome details of the murder. Trailed as something that would expose ""the naked truth"", the speech fell well short of many people's expectations, our correspondent says. King Salman chaired a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, after which a statement said that Saudi Arabia would hold to account those responsible for the killing, whoever they might be. The Saudi king (R) and crown prince (2R) meet Khashoggi's son, Salah bin Jamal (L), and another family member in Riyadh State media also said the king and the crown prince had held a meeting in Riyadh with members of the Khashoggi family, including Khashoggi's son, Salah bin Jamal. Mr Erdogan also spoke to family members by phone on Tuesday, offering condolences and saying he would do all he could to solve the murder. Saudi Arabia has given conflicting accounts up to now, initially saying Khashoggi had left the building alive, then later saying that he had been killed in a ""fist-fight"" inside the consulate. On Sunday, the Saudi foreign minister acknowledged Khashoggi had been murdered but said the leadership had not been aware of the ""rogue operation"". ""The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority,"" Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told Fox News. ""There obviously was a tremendous mistake made, and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up."" He said that Saudi Arabia did not know where the body was. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West An unnamed Saudi official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing President Erdogan demanded in his speech on Tuesday for this individual's identity to be revealed. In addition to the arrests, the Saudis say they have sacked two of the crown prince's aides and set up an organisation, under his leadership, to reform the intelligence agency over the killing. Saudi summit website attacked by hackers What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? According to Reuters news agency, quoting Turkish and Arabic intelligence sources, one of the sacked aides appeared via Skype during Khashoggi's questioning. Saud al-Qahtani was quoted as giving the instructions ""bring me the head of the dog"", after the two men traded insults. The sources say President Erdogan has a copy of the Skype audio but is refusing to hand it over to the US. BBC's Sebastian Usher in Riyadh A media scrum as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives at the conference There's an odd mixture of unreality and hard-faced pragmatism here. Attendees say they're here to stay with the opportunities Saudi Arabia provides for the long haul - however much pressure may be building in the short term. But that means that the urgency and outrage over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi that is fuelling the news outside is absent here. As President Erdogan was delivering his explosive speech, the conference here announced $50bn (Â£38.5bn) of investment in 12 mega-deals. The contracts were signed with a flourish by a host of foreign CEOs with their Saudi partners to the applause of the audience. It was no doubt intended as a resounding vote of confidence in the vision of Saudi Arabia's future laid out by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But that future and those investments could still turn sour, despite the mood of optimism and self-approbation exhibited here.

"This video can not be played ""Sexy girl! Excuse me! Yo!"" ""You better learn to answer a man when he speaks to you!"" It's a rainy afternoon in east London and two women are writing these words on a pavement in coloured chalk. The words are a catcall - shouted by a stranger to a woman walking down a street in London. The trend of writing out catcalls started in New York and now it's spreading to other cities around the world. The woman who started the idea says she wants to stop ""street harassment"". Warning: This article contains language shouted at women which you may find offensive. Sophie started the Catcalls of NYC account on Instagram Sophie Sandberg and Farah Benis met on social media after Sophie started the catcallsofnyc Instagram account. Farah was inspired, and started a similar account based in London. Newsbeat was there when they met in person in Victoria Park in east London. Farah writes out catcalls in London ""When I first came across Sophie's account it really resonated with me."" Farah told Newsbeat. She says she wants to try to raise awareness about sexual harassment on the streets. ""I saw there wasn't a London version of it, and I wanted to get involved. It's a massive issue and I thought highlighting it is one way to make it stop."" She adds: ""A lot of the time when people say these things there is a sense of entitlement that you have to stop. People feel they're entitled to your time."" ""Let me be your Harvey Weinstein,"" was another catcall said to a different woman in London Farah says she has been shocked about how many 12 and 13-year-olds have contacted her about catcalls.

""It felt really gross and even though it was in broad daylight it made me feel really unsafe. ""One second I was being a child and the next I was being forced to see myself as a sexual object.""

Ambrien, 16, started catcalls of Amsterdam. She says when she was 12 she noticed she was getting more attention from men. ""At first it was just looks and whistling and I didn't think it was a problem, but then I spoke to my sister about it. ""Some people like the attention, which is fine, but I feel uncomfortable. I am not a sexual object,"" Ambrien adds. She hopes to expand the account and go to other cities in the Netherlands to write out catcalls. ""I think people aren't talking about it enough in Amsterdam and girls who are 12 or 13 shouldn't be getting unwanted attention from older men."" Ambrien started Catcalls of Amsterdam Some would argue that catcalls are meant as compliments. Farah has an answer for that. ""I've had a lot of people talk to me about the fact that you should be grateful for the attention and it's a compliment, so what's the problem?"" she says. ""It's not a compliment to me and I should not have to give my time to you."" As Farah and Sophie talk, a man passing by spots the chalk on the pavement. He thinks it will help to get people talking. ""I have never been catcalled, but my friends have been and it isn't very nice,"" he says. ""It's not enough that only women are talking about this, I think men need to talk about it too and men should hold their friends and themselves accountable."" Sophie says she has had positive and negative reactions from men. ""Men have said to me: 'This is a good cause, I can't believe men would say that and I didn't know this was happening.'"" She says she's had negative comments too. ""I've had men say: 'Why can't you just take the compliment? This isn't a big deal, move on and get on with your life.'"" Allow Instagram content?

"Saudi Arabia initially said Khashoggi had left the consulate on 2 October Saudi Arabia has said that journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed at its consulate in Istanbul as part of a ""rogue operation"" by Saudi agents who had nothing to do with the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This latest account of what happened in Turkey on 2 October differs from previous statements presented by Saudi officials. It is also in conflict with those by Turkish officials who claim they have video and audio proof that Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was murdered by a 15-strong team who arrived and departed on the same day. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' So how has Saudi Arabia changed its story since Khashoggi's disappearance was first reported? Khashoggi, who had been living in self-imposed exile in the US, was reported missing hours after he entered the Saudi consulate to obtain paperwork that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e. The next day a Saudi official insisted that Khashoggi had left shortly after getting the paperwork and that he was ""not in the consulate nor in Saudi custody"". The consulate later issued a statement saying it was working with Turkish authorities ""to uncover the circumstances"" of his disappearance. Crown Prince Mohammed's brother and the Saudi ambassador to the US, Prince Khaled bin Salman, published a letter on 8 October insisting that reports about Khashoggi's death were ""completely false and baseless"". ""Jamal is a Saudi citizen who went missing after leaving the consulate,"" he wrote. ""After Turkish authorities and the media were allowed to inspect the consulate building in its entirety, the accusations changed to the outrageous claim that he was murdered, in the consulate, during business hours, and with dozens of staff and visitors in the building,"" he said, adding: ""I don't know who is behind these claims, or their intentions, nor do I care frankly."" Following a telephone conversation between Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Donald Trump, the US president told reporters that the king had denied all knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance. Mr Trump described the king's denial as ""very, very strong"". This video can not be played President Trump and the King of Saudi Arabia discussed the disappearance of the Saudi journalist ""It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers,"" Mr Trump said, adding: ""Who knows?"" On 20 October, the Saudi government issued a press release following ""preliminary investigations"" by the Saudi public prosecution office. It said the investigations had ""revealed that the discussions that took place between [Khashoggi] and the persons who met him... at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul led to a brawl and a fist fight"". Who is murdered journalist Khashoggi? Saudi critic in his own words This, it added, led to Khashoggi's death. CCTV images showed Khashoggi arriving at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul A second official statement on the same day suggested that ""a fight and a quarrel"" had occurred between the journalist and ""some"" of those with him at the consulate, resulting in his ""death and their attempt to conceal what had happened"". In an interview with Fox News, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir referred to Khashoggi's reported death as ""murder"" for the first time. ""We are determined to find out all the facts and we are determined to punish those who are responsible for this murder,"" he said. ""The individuals who did this, did this outside the scope of their authority,"" he said. ""Even the senior leadership of our intelligence service was not aware of this,"" he added, calling it a ""rogue operation"".

"This week, women around the world have been sharing their stories of harassment. From the workplace, to schools, the streets, to buses - women say they experience harassment in all areas of their lives. 100 Women has been focusing on harassment in public transport this week and has challenged women in London to come up with innovative ways to tackle it. One of the questions they have heard from women who have been harassed is: ""Who do I report it to?"" This video can not be played Why I didn't report sexual harassment on the bus Sian Lewis, who is researching sexual harassment, says she did not report an incident she faced in a London bus two months back. ""I froze. I didn't do anything,"" she says. In 90% of cases, sexual harassment on London transport goes unreported and, according to onestudy,external, sexual offences on London's buses increased from 2012-13 to 2014-15. Authorities say that reporting incidents of harassment would help prevent crime. The 'right amount' of panic for women in public Reality Check: Are women safer in single-sex carriages? The British Transport Police deploys undercover officers during rush hour and on night tubes in order to spot suspicious behaviour and potentially arrest offenders. ""Their job is to see the offences, hopefully, before they occur and stop them and deal with the individual,"" says Detective Inspector Brett Walker. Text the transport police on 61016 about the incident Call 101 or 0800 40 50 40 Use the passenger alarm Approach a nearest staff member in the bus or tube The reasons for not reporting sexual harassment cases are varied. In crowded buses or tubes, women are often confused if it happened by mistake or if it was intentional. ""If an individual accidentally brushes against someone, the officers will appreciate this behaviour is normal,"" says DI Walker. ""But if an individual is seen getting on and off from the same train or following various women around, it would attract the officers' suspicion."" Women may be concerned about their confidentiality while reporting a case. Other factors that may deter women include fear of police inaction and concern about being treated insensitively while lodging a complaint. Women can often feel their cases would be treated as ""trivial"". ""We know that many women don't think the police will take the matter seriously or don't know how to report,"" says Siwan Hayward, Head of Transport Policing, Transport For London. ""That's why we have worked with our policing partners on the Report It To Stop It campaign to make it easy to report your experience by texting 61016.

"Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will host the conference Saudi Arabia's investment conference has gone ahead, with many boycotting the event. The Future Investment Initiative (FII) was due to feature 150 high-profile speakers from 140 firms. But some 40 participants are understood to have pulled out amid allegations the country was behind Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing. Prominent Saudi critic Khashoggi vanished on 2 October after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish authorities allege he was killed in the building by Saudi agents. On Monday,Saudi Arabia blamed Khashoggi's death on a ""rogue operation"". State-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco said on Tuesday it had signed 15 agreements worth $34bn (Â£26.1bn), with companies including Total, Hyundai and Halliburton. Commodity trader Trafigura also secured a deal to develop metals at a new complex in the Kingdom, whilst Total said it would be announcing a retail network. BBC Middle East journalist Sebastian Usher, who is in Riyadh, says while the big names may have pulled out, hundreds are still attending - in some cases representing the very companies whose bosses decided it was no longer expedient for them to attend. Our reporter says the talk among delegates is of pragmatism, that there is a big future at stake in Saudi Arabia and this obstacle - however shocking and overwhelming - will eventually be overcome. This video can not be played The BBC's Tim Willcox asks the crown prince how he's finding the conference. The FII is a three-day event from 23 to 25 October organised by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The conference is a forum for business figures, politicians and civic society groups to discuss topics related to economic development, including technology, global governance and the environment. The first FII, held last year, featured discussions on artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and climate change. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also announced the investment of $500bn (Â£381bn) in a new city and business zone. The conference aims to attract more foreign investment into Saudi Arabia and is an opportunity for companies to build relationships and secure lucrative contracts in the Kingdom. It's part of the country's ""2030 Vision"", an economic plan to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy and reduce its reliance on oil revenues. The Kingdom is currently one of the world's largest oil producers but foreign investment has dropped in recent years. According to the UN, investments came to just $1.4bn last year, down from $12.2bn in 2012. Organisers said more than 150 speakers and moderators were due to attend the event. At least 40 attendees have said they'll no longer be going. These include the chief executives of JP Morgan, Siemens and Blackrock, and IMF head Christine Lagarde, many of whom attended the event when it was first held last year. Sir Richard Branson has also halted talks over a $1bn (Â£756m) Saudi investment in Virgin. Several media outlets have withdrawn their support too, including Bloomberg, CNN and the Financial Times. A page with a full list of confirmed speakers has been removed from the conference's website. Consultancy firms McKinsey, PWC, Ernst & Young, Deloitte, BCG, Oliver Wyman, and Bain & Company are all named as sponsors of the event, along with research company SWFI. None responded to questions about whether or not they had plans to withdraw. The majority of initially-confirmed speakers are still attending including Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, PepsiCo's vice-chairman Mohmood Khan and George Atta, global smart city leader at Ernst & Young. The BBC also understands that while several high-profile guests have withdrawn their support, representatives from their businesses will still be present at the conference. Several governments have pulled attendees from the conference including ministers from France, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox announced his withdrawal from the event last week and on Tuesday the Department for International Trade confirmed that no UK officials would attend the conference. ""As with the decision about Dr Fox's attendance, we have decided that it is not the right time for officials or ministers to attend the conference,"" it said in a statement. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will not attend the conference, but has said he will still be in Riyadh for a meeting to combat terrorism financing. Simon Paul Collis, the UK's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, will still be attending, along with Simon Penney, Britain's Trade Commissioner for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

"Tommy Robinson arrives at the Old Bailey in London A judge retrying ex-English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson for contempt of court has referred the case to the government's top legal adviser. Mr Robinson faced an allegation that he had committed contempt by filming people before a criminal trial. But Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC ruled the case needed to be referred up to the attorney general to decide. The brief appearance was the latest in a long-running case that began in 2017. The 35-year-old - who appeared under his real name, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - was released on bail. About 1,000 of his supporters, plus some opponents, gathered outside the Old Bailey court in London. After the hearing, Mr Yaxley-Lennon told the cheering crowd: ""I shouldn't face another trial. I've been here three times with a prison bag. I've kissed my kids goodbye three times."" But he welcomed the referral to the attorney general and said he hoped he ""makes the right decision"". The attorney general has the power to discontinue the case. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent This is the second time the allegations against Mr Yaxley-Lennon have been heard at the Old Bailey - and the second time a decision on the case has been postponed. It is also the second time that hundreds of his supporters have turned out - perhaps even more than before - and that the City of London Police have run a significant public order operation to contain both supporters and a smaller counter-demo. He arrived in the security cordon flanked by his closest advisers from his days running the English Defence League to loud cheers and chanting. Some supporters were carrying far-right banners - including two banners from organisations which are considered to be highly Islamophobic. Office workers in the swish buildings around the Old Bailey and a fair few court staff looked on from above. One of the most unexpected episodes this morning came when they began singing ""How they Rule Ya"" to the tune of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. After the case, his supporters were jubilant, hailing him as some kind of martyr for free speech. Mr Yaxley-Lennon's counsel, Richard Furlong, said the case should be referred to the attorney general - currently Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox. Judge Hilliard then confirmed the case would be referred up, saying the matter was so complex it needed further consideration. The move would also allow lawyers to cross-examine witnesses. Judge Hilliard added: ""All the evidence must be rigorously tested."" Now the case has been referred to the attorney general's office, who will decide whether to send the case to the High Court or to drop the contempt proceedings. The attorney general's office confirmed there was no set timescale for this decision to be made. Mr Yaxley-Lennon addressed the crowds outside the court before his hearing In May 2017, Mr Yaxley-Lennon filmed four men outside a court, who were later convicted of gang-raping a teenage girl. The trial was subject to reporting restrictions, and a judge at Canterbury Crown Court gave him a three-month suspended sentence for contempt of court. In May 2018, he was jailed for potentially prejudicing a court case after broadcasting on social media outside Leeds Crown Court. He was sentenced to 13 months - 10 months for the contempt of court in Leeds and a further three months for breaching the previous suspended sentence. Mr Yaxley-Lennon appealed against both contempt findings. Three judges quashed the Leeds ruling, saying the judge should not have commenced contempt proceedings that day. They ordered the case be reheard so that the allegations could be fully examined and, after a brief appearance at the Old Bailey in September, the case was adjourned until today. Mr Yaxley-Lennon says the whole thing is a ""political witch-hunt"" designed to stop him telling the truth about what he calls ""Muslim rape gangs"". The anti-Islam campaigner described the media as the ""enemy of the people"" and blamed the government, police and social services for ""sacrificing a generation of our daughters at the hands of the multiculturalism altar"". Supporters, some of whom are funding his legal campaign, cheered Mr Robinson outside Central Criminal Court. Criticism of MR Robinson came from a group of anti-racism campaigners who were also outside the court. One woman said: ""He [Mr Yaxley-Lennon] was the [co-]founder of the English Defence League, which is a fascist party, and we've got to stop it. ""If people believe they're joining something that is a bit more innocuous they're wrong. ""The fact of the matter is not only is it racist, but a hard core of them are fascists."" Joe Mulhall of anti-racism group Hope Not Hate said: ""He's dividing this country in a whole host of ways and, worst of all, he's dividing communities."" Contempt of court laws are designed to protect the rule of law, ensure fair trials - and avoid trial by media. Contempt can be committed by a broad range of people and organisations including the press, jurors, and social media users. The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years' imprisonment, but it can also be punished with a fine. Read more about the contempt law from BBC Legal Affairs Correspondent Clive Coleman.

"Former soldiers staged a protest outside the Ministry of Defence Theresa May is facing demands from 150 Tory MPs and peers to drop plans to investigate past crimes in Northern Ireland and other military conflicts. In a letter to the PM, they say a new Historical Investigations Unit would put ""service and security personnel at an exceptional disadvantage"". And they accuse the government of breaking the Armed Forces Covenant - its manifesto commitment to personnel. The Northern Ireland Office declined a request for comment. Proposals for a Historical Investigations Unit were part of the 2014 Stormont House agreement and designed to deal with killings where there had been no prosecutions. Last year, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)said that investigations into killings by the Army account for about 30% of its Troubles legacy workload. But concerns have been building in Westminster over whether military veterans have enough protection from unfair prosecutions, with some cases going back decades.

The new unit is meant to take over the work of the Historical Enquiries Team and   legacy work of Northern Ireland's police ombudsman that remains outstanding. But the Tory MPs and peers say the existing system is ""completely at odds"" with the government's commitment to the armed forces - and the proposal for a new unit would put ""service and security personnel at an exceptional disadvantage"". The Ministry of Defence and the Northern Ireland Office have clashed over the plans in recent months and a consultation recently finished. Now Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is understood to be looking at ways of limiting the likelihood of unfair prosecutions. Cabinet sources have told the BBC that one proposal under consideration would be for potential prosecutions of former service personnel to require consent from the attorney general before taking place.

Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""I don't want to see elderly veterans having to face repeated investigations decades after the events in question. The Northern Ireland Office recently closed a consultation on legacy cases like this and will report soon.

"The strikers marched to George Square for a rally in front of City Chambers Hundreds of schools were shut and home care services affected in Glasgow as council workers stage one of the UK's biggest strikes over equal pay. Primary schools and nurseries  closed and other services were hit on the first day of the 48-hour action. About 8,000 workers are striking amid a ""lack of progress"" on equal pay claims from thousands of female workers, the GMB and Unison said. Glasgow City Council said the walkout was unnecessary. It added that it hoped to reach an agreement on the long-running issue in the coming months. Q&A: What is the Glasgow dispute all about? Thousands to strike over equal pay The local authority announced in January that it planned to reach a negotiated settlement to thousands of equal pay claims arising from a pay and conditions scheme introduced more than a decade ago. Campaigners say the scheme led to workers in female-dominated roles such as catering or cleaning receiving up to Â£3 an hour less than those in male-dominated areas such as refuse collection. All mainstream primary schools, nurseries and additional support schools closed Secondary schools will remain open but services such as school meals will be affected Home care services - help with washing, getting dressed, meal preparation - face significant disruption Museums, leisure services and libraries will open but cafes and cleaning services could be disrupted Following two judgements against the council in the Court of Session, the SNP-led administration said it had ""grasped the nettle"" and planned to settle about 12,000 claims. Unions, however, say the talks - which would pave the way for payouts - have made no progress despite 21 meetings being held in the past 10 months. Many strikers joined picket lines outside council buildings as the strike got under way on Tuesday morning. Hundreds later gathered at Glasgow Green and set off on a march to City Chambers in George Square. This video can not be played Care worker Debbie McGrath: ""We are all out here heavy hearted about leaving our clients."" GMB Scotland organiser Rhea Wolfson said: ""The voice of Glasgow's working women will be heard around the world. After decades of rampant sex discrimination they will tell their employer, 'Stop the delays. We want justice.'"" Unison Glasgow chairwoman Mary Dawson added: ""We have given the council 10 months to make progress on addressing the historical discrimination suffered by these workers. ""However, the council has agreed nothing, offered nothing and all we have had are meetings about meetings and talks about talks. It's time for some action."" Are you affected by 48-hour strike in Glasgow? If you are prepared to speak to the BBC about its impact on you or your family pleaseemail BBC Scotland,external. 2006 - Glasgow City Council draws up its own bespoke job evaluation scheme, the Workforce Pay and Benefits Review (WPBR), intended to comply with equal pay law. From 2009 claimants challenge the scheme through employment tribunals, arguing it favours workers in male-dominated roles. May 2017 Court of Session rules that women were wrongly excluded from a bonus protection scheme. In the same month the SNP becomes the biggest party on Glasgow City Council after years of Labour control, and forms a minority administration. August 2017 - Court of Session rules the WPBR was less favourable to women workers. January 2018 - Glasgow City Council announces it intends to reach a negotiated settlement over equal pay. October 2018 - GMB and Unison members stage 48-hour strike in protest at lack of progress in talks. The SNP took control of the council in May last year after decades of Labour control with a promise to resolve the issue of equal pay. In January the council said it would reach a negotiated settlement, and has a 30-strong team working on the details. It insists progress has been made, and it had hoped to agree a settlement figure in December, although this could be delayed because of the industrial action. Council leader Susan Aitken said: ""I'm not entirely sure why this strike is taking place. This video can not be played Council leader Susan Aitken says industrial action is unnecessary ""Negotiations have been continuing. We've made considerable progress in a number of areas."" She highlighted a decision to bring women who worked for arms length body Cordia back into direct council employment and the harmonisation of their terms and conditions. She added: ""There's going to be enormous disruption caused in Glasgow - and to some of the most vulnerable people in the city. Some people who are at end of life, receiving end of life care."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard and Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie both expressed their solidarity with the strikers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she ""had nothing but admiration"" for the women taking part in the dispute - but accused Labour of hypocrisy because the council, when it was Labour-controlled, had challenged the equal pay claims in the courts.

Campaign group Action 4 Equality has estimated that backdated claims and pay increases could eventually cost the council between Â£500m and Â£1bn. Ms Aitken has disputed that figure, but acknowledged the council faces financial challenges. Strikers joined picket lines outside many council buildings Some have speculated the authority may be forced to sell off assets such as the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) or the Salvador Dali masterpiece Christ of St John of the Cross, normally displayed at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Earlier this year, Ms Aitken insisted officials were not discussing ""flogging off the Dali"" but were drawing up proposals that would minimise the impact on jobs and services.

"This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan President Donald Trump has said the US will ""begin cutting off"" foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of a large convoy of migrants heading north. Mr Trump criticised the countries on Monday for allowing people to leave the region and come ""illegally"" to the US. The group is travelling through Mexico, but is still far from the US border. Human rights organisations have said that cutting aid would make the situation worse. The president has not specified what money will be cut and it is unclear if such action can be taken by presidential order. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In 2017, Guatemala received over $248m (Â£191m) in US aid. The same year, Honduras received $175m and El Salvador $115m, according to the US Agency for International Development. ""Cutting aid to refugee-producing countries will only make worse the conditions that displace people in the first place,"" said Human Rights Watch on Sunday. The organisation said root causes must be addressed. ""People generally don't want to leave their homes if they can live normal, safe lives there."" This video can not be played Celebrations and sickness - thousands of migrants make it to Mexico, but what happens next? Though President Trump has accused the migrants of trying to illegally enter the US, many of the families travelling towards the border are seeking asylum. They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries. Watch: Migrant caravan travels north By the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Mexico The square in Tapachula - the first major population centre inside Mexico for these migrants - has turned into what looked like a makeshift camp. Along one side, ambulances lined up so medics could treat those who had become sick or got injured on their journey. Mexicans came to offer food, water and clothes to the many hundreds of Hondurans who rested ahead of the long punishing journey that still remains ahead of them to the US border. Many women among the group in particular have told us that they could never have made this journey alone, because it would have been too dangerous. So in spite of their tiredness, they are glad to be with others. But there is a sense that this is no longer just a convoy of those here in Tapachula, but that there is now a long stream of people stretching back along the route through Guatemala to Honduras, with people stuck at various obstacles and others who are still coming to join this migration. Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president. His Republican Party is facing mid-term elections on 6 November and could be unseated by Democrats in the House of Representatives. Without offering evidence, Mr Trump has repeatedly suggested the caravan was politically motivated. On Monday he urged people to blame Democrats for the border crisis, saying: ""Remember the mid-terms"". He also tweeted that the caravan contained ""criminals and unknown Middle Easterners"". When he was later pressed by journalists on what this meant, he offered no origin for the claim but invited reporters to investigate for themselves. On Sunday, the migrant caravan reached the town of Tapachula, approximately 37km (23 miles) from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. The Mexican authorities had earlier tried to stop them at a border bridge, but some managed to cross into Mexico illegally by boat over the Suchiate river. ""We have sunburn. We have blisters. But we got here. Our strength is greater than Trump's threats,"" migrant Britany HernÃ¡ndez told AFP news agency. It is expected to take weeks before the caravan reaches the US-Mexico border, according to US media. One of the closest border crossings in Brownsville, Texas is still over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) away from Tapachula. The last leg of their journey will also have to wait until Mexico processes the group, and asylum claims can take up to 45 days. A group of about 1,000 Hondurans set off on foot from a bus terminal in the crime-ridden city of San Pedro Sula on 13 October in an attempt to escape unemployment and the threat of violence. Many of those in the caravan are women with children Many of them had become aware of the caravan after a former lawmaker had published a poster announcing the caravan on Facebook. News of it quickly spread on social media. They have since been joined by other Central American nationals as they crossed Guatemala towards the Mexican border. The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world and many try to flee gang violence. Playing mother to El Salvador's gang children Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' How gang violence is spreading fear in El Salvador The exact number is hard to determine as the group has split up. Some are already in the Mexican city of Tapachula, while others are still at the Guatemala-Mexico border. The caravan has been growing in size with more people joining along the way Some estimates put the number of migrants who left Ciudad Hidalgo for Tapachula on Sunday at 5,000 while a Mexican federal police commander gave a lower number of 3,000. Another 1,500 migrants are estimated to be waiting to cross at the Guatemalan side of the border. A newly formed group of 1,000 mainly Honduran migrants has set off for the US, as well. However, 3,400 Hondurans have also turned back, according to official figures. Honduran President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez urged citizens not to join the caravan. His country has also sent buses to the Mexico-Guatemala border to repatriate those who may have changed their minds about heading to the US or who are simply too exhausted to carry on. Mexico said it would stop those who did not have passports or the correct visas at its southern border. But faced with thousands of migrants and after initial clashes, riot police got back on the buses that had brought them to the border bridge. About 900 migrants crossed the river and made it into Mexico, without the police intervening. In pictures: Migrants face border tear gas On Monday, incoming Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard - who will take up the post on 1 December - told reporters that Mr Trump's tweets were linked with domestic politics. ""The tweets we've been seeing lately do not surprise me, they do not surprise the government,"" he said via an interpreter, according to Reuters news agency. ""It's very close to the mid-term elections in the United States,"" Mr Ebrard said after meeting with Canada's foreign minister in Ottawa. Mr Ebrard did not answer when asked directly about how Mexico will treat the caravan, but said that his country planned changes to its immigration policy. ""There are going to be many more work visas. We are going to invest in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador,"" he said. Mexican officials say they have been encouraging the migrants to apply for asylum and that more than 1,000 have started the process. Those whose claims are rejected by Mexican officials will be deported. Those who managed to cross into Mexico expressed their joy at having it made that far. Many shouted ""Yes, we could!"" and ""we won't stop"".

GPs are trying to improve take-up rates as figures show up to half of women under 50 in some areas have not had a cervical screening in the recommended time frame. Screening rates are at their lowest for two decades. Public Health England said it was ""concerned"" by the fall. A further million women aged 50 to 64 have not had a smear test for at least five and a half years. About 72% of women aged 25 to 64 have had a smear test within the period recommended for their age, according to figures compiled in March 2017. This is down from 75.4% in 2012. A total of 220,000 British women are diagnosed with cervical abnormalities each year and there were 854 deaths from cervical cancer in England in 2016. Cervical screening detects abnormal cells on the entrance to the womb. Samme Allen says more needs to be done to make sure women know the screening is a ""preventative test"" Samme Allen, from Kingston, says the manner of a nurse at a cervical screening she had aged 25 was ""the opposite of reassuring"". It was 10 years before she had another one and the result led to a diagnosis of cervical cancer. She had to undergo ""a couple of operations"" and has subsequently been given the all clear. ""I worked overseas and regularly moved, so I always seemed to avoid thinking about it,"" she said. ""I never had any symptoms for cervical cancer, and so didn't feel I needed to go to the doctor."" This continued for a decade until a nurse at a routine health check in 2010 told her she was overdue a screening. Business consultant Ms Allen said the test should be seen in a similar way to ""going to the dentist or opticians"". ""Yes, it's uncomfortable and no it's not a pleasant experience, but my story shows how important it really is,"" she said. The NHS target is for 80% of women aged 25 to 49to be tested every three years,externaland the same proportion aged 50 to 64 to be screened every five years. WATCH: Is there scraping in a smear test? The truth about what it really involves,external London has some of the lowest rates of women screened for cervical cancer. In some boroughs just over half of eligible women under 50 had a test within the past three and a half years. Official figures from Public Health England (PHE),external, matched to local authority districts, reveal about half of eligible 25 to 49-year-old women registered at GP practices in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and Hammersmith and Fulham had received adequate screening. Cambridge and Oxford also had rates of 54 and 55%. In Leicester it was 60%, rising to 61% in Luton and 62% in Manchester, Slough, Haringey and Birmingham. Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire was at the other end, with 80% of eligible women having had the test in the past three-and-a-half years. A spokeswoman for Rushcliffe CCG said practices in the Nottinghamshire area deemed not to be achieving screening targets were given extra support. She said Cancer Research UK had been helping to improve uptake. Baking helping Beth beat brain damage 'Degrading strip search left me with PTSD' PC told public how to save his life Experts put it down toembarrassment, a lack of awareness or just putting it off. A survey of 2,017 women by the charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust suggested young women were embarrassed to attend smear tests because of their body shape (35%), the appearance of their vulva (34%) and concerns over smell (38%). A third said they would not go if they had not waxed or shaved their bikini area. About 15% said they would miss their smear tests for a gym class or a waxing appointment. Dr Laura Marlow from University College London conducted research into cervical cancer screenings and said ethnicity also played ""an important role"". ""We found that women from ethnic minority groups were more likely to be unaware of screening and older women were more likely to have decided not to go,"" she said. ""Understanding these patterns will help us to decide how interventions might be shaped differently for different types of non-attenders."" However, she added: ""I think we have to be careful about saying that ethnicity contributes to the absolute numbers because it is only a part of the picture."" A spokeswoman for clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in north west London said GPs faced challenges in areas with ""language barriers, religious concerns and high levels of deprivation"". Former Big Brother contestant Jade Goody is credited with a rise in cervical screening rates following her death in 2009 Cervical screening rates rose following the death of realty TV star Jade Goody,externalat the age of 27 in 2009, as her story brought about greater awareness, but the numbers have fallen back since. Dr Asha Kasliwal, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said: ""Cervical screening is not a mandated requirement for local authority commissioning. Local authorities under severe budgetary pressure are not including this essential aspect of women's health care in their service specifications. ""GPs have a very positive role to play in increasing uptake by offering opportunistic screening, but primary care is not able to effectively meet the increased demand. ""Screening rates are now at their lowest in two decades and the minimum 80% national target is far from being achieved,"" she said. Dr Kasliwal is calling for resources and more funding for cervical screening in primary healthcare, and for it to be included in sexual health services. Women in north-west London women are being offered evening and weekend screenings in order to make it more convenient to attend. Robert Music from Jo's Cancer Trust said there was ""no one magic solution"" to improve attendance, but the charity was working with GPs to provide drop in surgeries, phone clinics and ""engagement with community or faith groups"". Professor Anne Mackie, PHE's director of screening said: ""PHE, alongside charities including Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, the NHS and local authorities, are concerned about the fall in women taking the test. ""Currently 72% of women have cervical screening and we're working together to ensure that every woman knows what the test is about and to make it easy to attend screening appointments.""

"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing A senior US official has held talks with Saudi Arabia's crown prince in Riyadh, despite growing concern over the Saudis' role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

"The strikers marched to George Square for a rally in front of City Chambers Hundreds of schools were shut and home care services affected in Glasgow as council workers stage one of the UK's biggest strikes over equal pay. Primary schools and nurseries  closed and other services were hit on the first day of the 48-hour action. About 8,000 workers are striking amid a ""lack of progress"" on equal pay claims from thousands of female workers, the GMB and Unison said. Glasgow City Council said the walkout was unnecessary. It added that it hoped to reach an agreement on the long-running issue in the coming months. Q&A: What is the Glasgow dispute all about? Thousands to strike over equal pay The local authority announced in January that it planned to reach a negotiated settlement to thousands of equal pay claims arising from a pay and conditions scheme introduced more than a decade ago. Campaigners say the scheme led to workers in female-dominated roles such as catering or cleaning receiving up to Â£3 an hour less than those in male-dominated areas such as refuse collection. All mainstream primary schools, nurseries and additional support schools closed Secondary schools will remain open but services such as school meals will be affected Home care services - help with washing, getting dressed, meal preparation - face significant disruption Museums, leisure services and libraries will open but cafes and cleaning services could be disrupted Following two judgements against the council in the Court of Session, the SNP-led administration said it had ""grasped the nettle"" and planned to settle about 12,000 claims. Unions, however, say the talks - which would pave the way for payouts - have made no progress despite 21 meetings being held in the past 10 months. Many strikers joined picket lines outside council buildings as the strike got under way on Tuesday morning. Hundreds later gathered at Glasgow Green and set off on a march to City Chambers in George Square. This video can not be played Care worker Debbie McGrath: ""We are all out here heavy hearted about leaving our clients."" GMB Scotland organiser Rhea Wolfson said: ""The voice of Glasgow's working women will be heard around the world. After decades of rampant sex discrimination they will tell their employer, 'Stop the delays. We want justice.'"" Unison Glasgow chairwoman Mary Dawson added: ""We have given the council 10 months to make progress on addressing the historical discrimination suffered by these workers. ""However, the council has agreed nothing, offered nothing and all we have had are meetings about meetings and talks about talks. It's time for some action."" Are you affected by 48-hour strike in Glasgow? If you are prepared to speak to the BBC about its impact on you or your family pleaseemail BBC Scotland,external. 2006 - Glasgow City Council draws up its own bespoke job evaluation scheme, the Workforce Pay and Benefits Review (WPBR), intended to comply with equal pay law. From 2009 claimants challenge the scheme through employment tribunals, arguing it favours workers in male-dominated roles. May 2017 Court of Session rules that women were wrongly excluded from a bonus protection scheme. In the same month the SNP becomes the biggest party on Glasgow City Council after years of Labour control, and forms a minority administration. August 2017 - Court of Session rules the WPBR was less favourable to women workers. January 2018 - Glasgow City Council announces it intends to reach a negotiated settlement over equal pay. October 2018 - GMB and Unison members stage 48-hour strike in protest at lack of progress in talks. The SNP took control of the council in May last year after decades of Labour control with a promise to resolve the issue of equal pay. In January the council said it would reach a negotiated settlement, and has a 30-strong team working on the details. It insists progress has been made, and it had hoped to agree a settlement figure in December, although this could be delayed because of the industrial action. Council leader Susan Aitken said: ""I'm not entirely sure why this strike is taking place. This video can not be played Council leader Susan Aitken says industrial action is unnecessary ""Negotiations have been continuing. We've made considerable progress in a number of areas."" She highlighted a decision to bring women who worked for arms length body Cordia back into direct council employment and the harmonisation of their terms and conditions. She added: ""There's going to be enormous disruption caused in Glasgow - and to some of the most vulnerable people in the city. Some people who are at end of life, receiving end of life care."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard and Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie both expressed their solidarity with the strikers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she ""had nothing but admiration"" for the women taking part in the dispute - but accused Labour of hypocrisy because the council, when it was Labour-controlled, had challenged the equal pay claims in the courts.

Campaign group Action 4 Equality has estimated that backdated claims and pay increases could eventually cost the council between Â£500m and Â£1bn. Ms Aitken has disputed that figure, but acknowledged the council faces financial challenges. Strikers joined picket lines outside many council buildings Some have speculated the authority may be forced to sell off assets such as the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) or the Salvador Dali masterpiece Christ of St John of the Cross, normally displayed at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.

"Free speech is being threatened at British universities by a culture of offence among certain students, according to critics. A Parliamentary inquiry has reported, regulator the Office for Students has threatened to fine universities that fail to uphold free speech and the Equality and Human Rights Commission is drawing up guidelines for universities. A small number of incidents have been held up time and again and debated fiercely. But what evidence is there that challenges to free speech are widespread? At the end of last year, the then Universities Minister, Jo Johnson, claimed that books were being removed from libraries, ""undermining the principle of free speech"". BBC Reality Check asked for evidence of this under the Freedom of Information law. The Department for Education shared letters referring to books by Holocaust denier David Irving being moved from history to another section of two university libraries. Nobody provided evidence of books being banned. We sent Freedom of Information requests to every UK university to find out about: changes to courses books being removed from libraries speakers being cancelled From the responses of 120 universities, we found that since 2010 there had been: Seven student complaints about course content being in some way offensive or inappropriate - four have resulted in action being taken six occasions on which universities cancelled speakers as a result of complaints no instances of books being removed or banned We picked these measures as ones that would reveal restrictions at an institutional level regarding what students are learning. And of the 136 universities and more than two million higher education students in the UK, the numbers of incidents uncovered is small. At the University of Sheffield, Chinese students complained about a film showing state discrimination against Tibetans in China containing an offensive phrase. It was replaced with a different film, still showing discrimination against Tibetans. The University of Portsmouth received ""several complaints"" from students about a presentation on the first dinosaur to be scientifically described. It was namedScrotum humanum(because of its apparent resemblance to human testicles) and an image of a ""mammalian scrotum"" was included for comparison. The image was removed from the presentation. Universities could face free speech fines Free speech pledge for universities 'Intolerance' risk to campus free speech Three universities said they had changed course content because the subject matter had been likely to offend (not as a result of complaints): At the University of Sheffield, a law lecturer was advised not to use ""cross-dressing"" as an example of when an injunction might be sought At Keele University, a tutor stopped teaching a novel that referred to the Hillsborough disaster At Leeds Beckett University, a lecture on ""suicide terrorism"" was replaced with ""alternative content"" Only 11 universities said they had received any complaints about the content of library books since 2010. None of them removed books from their library as a result. Three universities - Central Lancashire, Surrey and Westminster - received complaints over the placement of the Koran in their libraries. There are principles in Islam around how the the central religious text should be stored and handled. The Universities of Manchester and Surrey moved David Irving's writing to a different section, while Churchill College, Cambridge says it keeps Mr Irving's writings in its archives, where they are available on request. Those who fear that free speech is being restricted often point to incidences of students protesting against speakers and, occasionally, events being cancelled. Many of these events are organised by students' unions, not universities. ""No-platforming"" - a policy of refusing to host particular speakers - dates back to the 1970s but the practice has become one of  the most heated topics of the current free speech debate. Six organisations are on the National Union of Students' (NUS) official ""no platform list"": al-Muhajiroun British National Party (BNP) English Defence League (EDL) Hizb-ut-Tahir Muslim Public Affairs Committee National Action Critics are concerned that others, not included in this list, are being prevented from speaking for fear of causing offence. Feminist writer Germaine Greer and LGBT rights campaigner Peter Tatchell both delivered talks despite complaints at their presence. There have been cases - like that of YouTuber Sargon of Akkad, whose talk at King's College London was interrupted by protesters, or ex-Muslim feminist campaigner Maryam Namazie, who was heckled by some students at Goldsmiths - where speaking events have been disrupted by a small number of vocal students. These were not institutional bans. It was reported that Warwick students' union tried to block Ms Namazie from speaking, and the decision was then overturned. But the union told a parliamentary inquiry that this had been caused by an administrative error, which resulted in a risk assessment not being completed. ""As soon as this simple human error was brought to our attention, the correct procedure was immediately followed, the supposed 'decision' reversed and the speaker's talk confirmed,"" the union said. Smita Jamdar, a higher education lawyer who has represented universities, says protests or complaints are themselves a manifestation of free speech in action. ""The ideal situation is you would see the event going ahead and protests too,"" she says. But the problem comes if anticipated protests lead to events being cancelled, as has happened on a small number of occasions, or if fear of protest puts off people from booking potentially controversial speakers in the first place. Students' unions are membership organisations that do not have a legal duty to promote freedom of speech, and are not subject to Freedom of Information laws. Because universities do have this duty, under the Education Act 1986, we asked them whether they had received complaints about speakers. Since 2010, 16 universities have received formal complaints about speakers and nine events in all were cancelled. The University of Westminster cancelled an event with controversial Islamic cleric Haitham al-Haddad. Queen Mary's University, London cancelled a speech by prominent professor Tariq Ramadan after he was arrested over rape allegations - which he strongly denies The University of Liverpool cancelled a 2012 mayoral debate, which was due to include panel representation from the National Front and BNP, because of planned demonstrations that caused ""concerns for student, staff and public safety"". What the requests don't capture are internal policies, how they are interpreted and whether they are creating bureaucratic hurdles which may lead to certain speakers never being requested in the first place. Universities tend to have external speaker policies for any event taking place on campus, even ones hosted by students or unions. For example, the University of Westminster has a policy that it ""will offer no platform to those who are intolerant of the free speech of others"". Libertarianmagazine Spiked ranks universities,externalon how far they are upholding or restricting free speech, using a traffic light system. It believes these policies can shut down critical debate and gives universities amber or red scores for having guidelines for dealing with bullying, bans on transphobic material or zero tolerance to sexual harassment policies. The NUS argues that, far from restricting free speech,many of these policies are about accessibility,external- helping people from marginalised groups, who don't always get to speak freely, to have their voices heard. Universities have other legal duties which can come into conflict with their duty to promote free speech. They must have ""due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism"" under the Prevent strategy - part of the government's counter-terror laws. Prof Alison Scott-Baumann, at SOAS University of London, conducted a survey of 2,000 students and said her findings indicate that some Muslim students are shying away from inviting certain speakers or having certain discussions in the first place for fear of being flagged to Prevent. A Department for Education spokesperson said while there was no evidence of widespread censorship, there were some ""genuine problems"", including the effect of the ""complex web of rules and guidance"", as well as the behaviour of protestors and student groups. New guidance is due to be published this autumn. Absence of evidence does not equal evidence of absence, and these figures are not exhaustive. They may not capture more informal complaints. We don't know whether pressure was being exerted on lecturers and those booking speakers, affecting what people were and weren't willing to discuss. Trying to quantify that is ""trying to prove a negative"", says Simon Perfect, a researcher for Christian think tank Theos. How do you capture the instances of speakers never requested, debates never had and material never taught? Alistair Jarvis, the head of representative body Universities UK, said: ""Universities host hundreds, if not thousands, of events each year, among a student population of over two million. The vast majority of these events pass without incident."" As universities attempt to balance their legal duties and accommodate different groups' rights without challenging free speech, there have been some inevitable sticking points over what should be permitted. Whether or not new guidance can overcome this confusion should soon become a bit clearer.

"It started with Harvey Weinstein, one of the biggest names in cinema, then went global with the #metoo Twitter hashtag before engulfing the UK's members of Parliament. The sex scandal spanning Hollywood, Parliament and beyond has exposed a possible gap in UK legislation - sexual harassment is not actually a criminal offence in its own right. The Equality Act currently covers sexual harassment in the workplace - but outside work, prosecutors must use different pieces of legislation, depending on the nature of the offence. Critics say this leaves us without a proper definition of the types of behaviour that amount to sexual harassment - or clear boundaries. It also makes it near impossible to get an accurate picture of the scale of the problem. So, is it time to make sexual harassment a specific criminal offence? Should Parliament decide where the bar on acceptable behaviour falls? ""Of course sexual harassment should be criminalised,"" says Samantha Rennie, director of Rosa, a charity which supports initiatives for women and children. Two-thirds of UK women have reportedly been sexually harassed so it's important that we have the law behind women, she says. But Conservative MP Maria Miller, who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, has her doubts. ""It's a really difficult area. It's not an easy area of law,"" she says. When does flirting become sexual harassment? Society and Parliament would have to decide where the bar falls - what behaviours were acceptable and not acceptable, she explains. Most parliamentarians and police would consider sexual harassment outside work ""too big and too difficult an issue"" to treat with the same zero-tolerance approach that we do, for example, race hate crimes, she says. ""That in itself is very telling - we have got a huge cultural problem here, and it needs to be tackled."" Sophie Walker, leader of the Women's Equality Party, is not convinced a ""quick change in the law"" would resolve low conviction rates around sexual harassment. ""People are rightly looking for a silver bullet,"" she says - but she believes that a fundamental change in the balance of power in everything from work and caring, to representation and rights is what is needed. Is sexual harassment of a woman a hate crime? This video can not be played BBC reporter Sarah Teale was harassed by a passerby during her report on a conference about harassment No - not in most places. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, hate crimes fall into five categories - disability, race, religion, transgender identity and sexual orientation. However police forces can create their own categories, depending on local concerns and problems. Nottinghamshire has done just that- recording harassment as a misogynistic incident - and other areas are starting to follow suit. Ms Miller says if this was taken up by other forces, it would be a straightforward way to record incidents and get an idea of the scale of sexual harassment. Samantha Rennie says hate crimes are prosecuted when race, sexuality and other prejudices are apparent, so gender should be no different. When has a law change like this worked? Posters in a hard-hitting campaign in Scotland earlier this year highlight the new ""revenge porn"" law Revenge pornography is one example. Until 2015, there was no specific law against the offence, which often involves an ex-partner uploading sexual images of someone to humiliate and embarrass them. Instead, convictions were sought under existing copyright or harassment laws. Within a year of theCriminal Justice and Courts Act 2015,externalcoming into force, 206 people in England and Wales had been prosecuted for disclosing private sexual images. Lead campaigner Maria Miller cited figures suggesting that before the law was changed only two prosecutions had been made. In Scotland, cases are brought under theAbusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Act 2016.,external If not a new law, how does current legislation stand up? The Equality Act - which covers sexual harassment at work - needs more teeth, Ms Miller says TheEquality Act 2010,external- which offers protection at work - sets out a clear framework and covers what is most people's experience of sexual harassment, says Ms Miller. It includes sexual jokes on email, hugging and staring in a sexually suggestive way. However, she says the legislation leaves the victim to do ""all the running"". They have to highlight the Equality Act to their manager and, if that doesn't help, take their case to a tribunal. A claim must be brought within three months of the alleged act of harassment and a claim can be made simultaneously against the employer and the perpetrator. Ms Miller believes the government should look at giving the Equality Act, which covers England, Wales and Scotland, more ""teeth"" by making elements statutory as with, for example, maternity rights. Sexual harassment in the workplace can damage self-confidence and career prospects, she says: ""It feels an important area to get right."" Sian Hawkins, from Women's Aid - a charity which supports abused women - says existing legislation needs to be regularly reviewed to make sure allegations are dealt with properly, victims get the right response and perpetrators are held accountable. ""The criminal justice system needs to send a clear message to everyone that sexual harassment is unacceptable and that this crime is taken seriously,"" she adds. Are you being sexually harassed at work? Workers share sexual harassment stories How many people have been prosecuted for sexual harassment? We don't know. Perpetrators can currently be tried under a number of different pieces of legislation. For example, a man sending a woman unwanted messages could be charged under theProtection from Harassment Act 1997,external, and fondling on public transport would come under theSexual Offences Act.,external Because it's not necessarily recorded as a sexually-motivated offence, the Crown Prosecution Service is unable to get a true figure. In the workplace,more than half of women said they had been sexually harassed, a TUC survey from last year found. However only a fifth of them told their employer. The reasons they gave for keeping quiet were fears for their careers prospects and working relationships, concern they would not be believed and embarrassment.

"This video can not be played ""Sexy girl! Excuse me! Yo!"" ""You better learn to answer a man when he speaks to you!"" It's a rainy afternoon in east London and two women are writing these words on a pavement in coloured chalk. The words are a catcall - shouted by a stranger to a woman walking down a street in London. The trend of writing out catcalls started in New York and now it's spreading to other cities around the world. The woman who started the idea says she wants to stop ""street harassment"". Warning: This article contains language shouted at women which you may find offensive. Sophie started the Catcalls of NYC account on Instagram Sophie Sandberg and Farah Benis met on social media after Sophie started the catcallsofnyc Instagram account. Farah was inspired, and started a similar account based in London. Newsbeat was there when they met in person in Victoria Park in east London. Farah writes out catcalls in London ""When I first came across Sophie's account it really resonated with me."" Farah told Newsbeat. She says she wants to try to raise awareness about sexual harassment on the streets. ""I saw there wasn't a London version of it, and I wanted to get involved. It's a massive issue and I thought highlighting it is one way to make it stop."" She adds: ""A lot of the time when people say these things there is a sense of entitlement that you have to stop. People feel they're entitled to your time."" ""Let me be your Harvey Weinstein,"" was another catcall said to a different woman in London Farah says she has been shocked about how many 12 and 13-year-olds have contacted her about catcalls.

Ambrien, 16, started catcalls of Amsterdam. She says when she was 12 she noticed she was getting more attention from men. ""At first it was just looks and whistling and I didn't think it was a problem, but then I spoke to my sister about it. ""Some people like the attention, which is fine, but I feel uncomfortable. I am not a sexual object,"" Ambrien adds. She hopes to expand the account and go to other cities in the Netherlands to write out catcalls. ""I think people aren't talking about it enough in Amsterdam and girls who are 12 or 13 shouldn't be getting unwanted attention from older men."" Ambrien started Catcalls of Amsterdam Some would argue that catcalls are meant as compliments. Farah has an answer for that. ""I've had a lot of people talk to me about the fact that you should be grateful for the attention and it's a compliment, so what's the problem?"" she says. ""It's not a compliment to me and I should not have to give my time to you."" As Farah and Sophie talk, a man passing by spots the chalk on the pavement. He thinks it will help to get people talking. ""I have never been catcalled, but my friends have been and it isn't very nice,"" he says. ""It's not enough that only women are talking about this, I think men need to talk about it too and men should hold their friends and themselves accountable."" Sophie says she has had positive and negative reactions from men. ""Men have said to me: 'This is a good cause, I can't believe men would say that and I didn't know this was happening.'""

"This week, women around the world have been sharing their stories of harassment. From the workplace, to schools, the streets, to buses - women say they experience harassment in all areas of their lives. 100 Women has been focusing on harassment in public transport this week and has challenged women in London to come up with innovative ways to tackle it. One of the questions they have heard from women who have been harassed is: ""Who do I report it to?"" This video can not be played Why I didn't report sexual harassment on the bus Sian Lewis, who is researching sexual harassment, says she did not report an incident she faced in a London bus two months back. ""I froze. I didn't do anything,"" she says. In 90% of cases, sexual harassment on London transport goes unreported and, according to onestudy,external, sexual offences on London's buses increased from 2012-13 to 2014-15. Authorities say that reporting incidents of harassment would help prevent crime. The 'right amount' of panic for women in public Reality Check: Are women safer in single-sex carriages? The British Transport Police deploys undercover officers during rush hour and on night tubes in order to spot suspicious behaviour and potentially arrest offenders. ""Their job is to see the offences, hopefully, before they occur and stop them and deal with the individual,"" says Detective Inspector Brett Walker. Text the transport police on 61016 about the incident Call 101 or 0800 40 50 40 Use the passenger alarm Approach a nearest staff member in the bus or tube The reasons for not reporting sexual harassment cases are varied. In crowded buses or tubes, women are often confused if it happened by mistake or if it was intentional. ""If an individual accidentally brushes against someone, the officers will appreciate this behaviour is normal,"" says DI Walker. ""But if an individual is seen getting on and off from the same train or following various women around, it would attract the officers' suspicion."" Women may be concerned about their confidentiality while reporting a case. Other factors that may deter women include fear of police inaction and concern about being treated insensitively while lodging a complaint. Women can often feel their cases would be treated as ""trivial"". ""We know that many women don't think the police will take the matter seriously or don't know how to report,"" says Siwan Hayward, Head of Transport Policing, Transport For London. ""That's why we have worked with our policing partners on the Report It To Stop It campaign to make it easy to report your experience by texting 61016. ""You will be believed and you will be taken seriously. Every single report matters, it helps police build a picture so the offender can be brought to justice.

"This video can not be played Flying over the world's longest sea bridge Chinese President Xi Jinping has officially opened the world's longest sea crossing bridge, nine years after construction first began. Including its access roads, the bridge spans 55km (34 miles) and connects Hong Kong to Macau and the mainland Chinese city of Zhuhai. The bridge cost about $20bn (Â£15.3bn) and should have opened in 2016. Construction has been dogged by safety issues - at least 18 workers have died on the project, officials say. 'World's longest' hanging foot bridge opens in Switzerland Russia opens controversial bridge to Crimea Mr Xi attended the opening ceremony of the bridge, which took place in Zhuhai, along with the leaders of Hong Kong and Macau. Limited bus services begin on Wednesday. Designed to withstand earthquakes and typhoons, it was built using 400,000 tonnes of steel, enough to build 60 Eiffel Towers. Images of China's mega bridge About 30km of its total length crosses the sea of the Pearl River delta. To allow ships through, a 6.7km section in the middle dips into an undersea tunnel that runs between two artificial islands. One of two artificial islands that have been built as part of the multi-billion-dollar project The remaining sections are link roads, viaducts and land tunnels connecting Zhuhai and Hong Kong to the main bridge. It is part of China's plan to create a Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, Macau and nine other cities in southern China. The mega-machines helping China link the world Do you dare cross China's glass bridges? The bridge where you can 'walk through god's hands' The area is currently home to 68 million people. In the past, travelling between Zhuhai and Hong Kong would take up to four hours - the new bridge cuts this down to 30 minutes. No. Those who want to cross the bridge must obtain special permits, allocated by a quota system. And all vehicles will pay a toll. The bridge is not served by public transport, so private shuttle buses will ply the route. There is no rail link. Authorities initially estimated that 9,200 vehicles would cross the bridge every day. They later lowered their estimations after new transport networks were built in the region. There's been a great deal of criticism of the project. It has been dubbed the ""bridge of death"" by some local media. At least nine workers on the Hong Kong side have died and officials told BBC News Chinese that nine had died on the mainland side, too. Hundreds of workers have also been injured during the construction. Special cameras will be on the look-out for drivers on the bridge who show signs of getting sleepy, among other checks -yawn three times and the authorities will be alerted,external, local media report. To help counter potential terror attacks,there will also be ""48 high-definition surveillance cameras"",externalmounted at intervals along the bridge as well as anti-terror police patrols, the South China Morning Post reports. And drivers will have to change which side of the road they are on at the crossing. People drive on the left in Hong Kong and Macau but the bridge is Chinese territory and special merger channels have been built to cope with this.

Where film stars and police chiefs can simply vanish Why an 'encouraging' Chinese phrase is in the OED The giant cave hall discovered in a sinkhole At least 18 people have died working on the bridge There have also been concerns about the environmental impact. Environmental groups say the project may have caused serious harm to marine life in the area, including the critically rare Chinese white dolphin. The number of dolphins seen in Hong Kong waters has decreased from 148 to 47 in the past 10 years and they are now absent from the waters near the bridge, according to the Hong Kong branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). ""The project has made irreversible damage to the sea,"" said Samantha Lee, Assistant Director of Ocean Conservation at the WWF. ""I am worried that the number will never rise again."" It is rare to see Chinese White Dolphins around the bridge after years of construction, say environmental groups The bridge, surrounding link roads and artificial islands cost a staggering $20bn to build - the main bridge alone cost $6.92bn. Chinese officials say it will generate up to 10 trillion yuan ($1.44tn; Â£1tn) for the economy, but one Hong Kong lawmaker cast doubt on that figure. ""I am not so sure either how the bridge can sustain itself if not many cars are using it,"" Tanya Chan told BBC News Chinese. ""I am pretty sure that we would never earn that [construction cost] back."" According to an estimate by BBC Chinese, the bridge will only earn around $86m in tolls per year. In fact, the bridge's maintenance costs would already take away a third of this income. Critics have called the bridge a ""big white elephant"" that guarantees no economic return. Others have said its main purpose is symbolic, ensuring Hong Kong is physically connected to the mainland. Additional reporting by Lam Cho Wai, BBC Chinese. Flying over China's mega bridge.

"MPs debate private members' bills Sophie Morris, Robbie Hawkins and Julia Butler That's where we leave today's coverage of the Commons. Join us next week, when we'll be covering the Budget and subsequent debate, as well as committee meetings and events in the Lords chamber. Thanks for joining us. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dan Jarvis thanks MPs for the cross-party support that has seen the ""safe passage"" of the bill through the House of Commons. The bill will go on to be debated in the Lords before it can become law. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Minister Jackie Doyle-Price stands to wind up today's debate on the bill. ""To give the gift of life"" is something that donors and their families should be very proud of and it is a ""pleasure"" to be able to confirm that the government supports the bill, she says. The health minister says thoughts today are with those who benefit from organ donation, and the families of the organ donors and encourages families to have advance discussions with one another about their wishes.

Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Neil O'Brien says it is a ""pleasure to support"" the bill, telling the Commons that between 2005-10 there were 49,000 people waiting for an organ transplant and that 6,000 died while waiting - 270 of which were children. Mr O'Brien said it is ""ironic"" that when few MPs are here on a Friday, it is ""matters of life and death"" that are discussed. Conservative MP tweets Allow Twitter content?

Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament There is no doubt that we need more organ donors in England, Sharon Hodgson tells the Commons. The shadow health minister says Labour supports the bill, which, it is hoped, would deliver an increase in available donors. She says that when one donor can save up to nine people, a future system needs to be supported by a national campaign and increased resources. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament MPs are now debating the Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill at third reading. Dan Jarvis says moving to an ""opt-out"" system where consent for donation is deemed would add ""thousands of names"" to the organ donor register and ""save hundreds of lives"". Third reading is the final chance for the Commons to debate the contents of a bill. Debate on the bill is usually short, and limited to what is actually in the bill, rather than, as at second reading, what might have been included. Civil Partnerships Bill House of CommonsParliament The private members' bill clears all legislative stages in the Commons and now moves to be debated in the Lords on a future date. MPs will now debate Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson's Organ Donation Bill. Mr Robinson is absent so the bill is being moved by his colleague Dan Jarvis. The bill would enable people in England to withhold consent for organ donation and
transplantation. It would introduce an 'opt-out' system. Labour MP responds Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Budget is the week's big event - but how could the government's opponents use it to cause parliamentary disruption? Civil Partnerships Bill House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Will Quince talks of the importance of ""providing comfort"" for bereaved parents and says this bill would help as they can prove their child existed, even if they do not survive. The campaigner for recognition of baby loss says ""whether it is a miscarriage or stillbirth - that baby is still born"". They were created in 2004 to give same-sex couples - who at the time couldn't marry - similar legal and financial protection to a marriage. They weren't available to mixed-sex couples. Then, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales and the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 did the same there. Since then, same-sex couples there have been able to choose between marriage or civil partnerships - except in Northern Ireland, where they are still not able to marry. But the opposite didn't become true - mixed-sex couples didn't get the right to a civil partnership. That's what's now set to change. A civil partnership is formed by signing a document. There is no requirement for a ceremony to take place or to exchange vows - unlike for a marriage - but you can do so if you wish. ParlyApp tweets Allow Twitter content?

Civil Partnerships Bill House of CommonsParliament MPs are debating other aspects of the bill, which include requiring the government to prepare a report on whether the law ought to be changed to permit the registration of pregnancy losses and stillbirths. Labour MP Sharon Hodgson tells the House she was ""overwhelmed"" with messages from families who have experienced ""the heartache of losing a baby pre-24 weeks and were unable to register that death"". She supports the bill and the registration of pregnancy losses. Also supporting the bill, Conservative MP Victoria Prentis says that if MPs can't talk with passion about birth, marriage and death then ""what on earth are we here for"". Civil Partnerships Bill House of CommonsParliament Tim Loughton's bill passes report stage without a division and moves to third reading. Mr Loughton apologises to officials because there will be a lot of work to do in a short period of time - this will be a ""welcome distraction"" from Brexit, he jokes.

Civil Partnerships Bill House of CommonsParliament Home Office Minister Caroline Nokes says the government support an early move to allow straight couples to enter into civil partnerships but there are ""concerns"" this bill may not be the best vehicle for change. The consultation has started and we want to conclude it, she says, and the government would prefer to introduce a bill in the next parliamentary session. ""The government does not support extending civil partnerships to siblings, and this bill is vulnerable to being amended to allow that,"" she adds. Civil Partnerships Bill House of CommonsParliament Next up is Conservative MP Tim Loughton's Civil Partnerships Bill which would extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples and create this change within six months. Mr Loughton says there are 3.3 million cohabiting heterosexual couples and many have waited a long time for the ""chance for equality"". Earlier this month, the prime minister announced that all couples in England and Waleswill be able to choose to have a civil partnership. Mr Loughton says the proposal will be ""under pressure"" from the parliamentary timetable and ""emergency Brexit legislation"" means it may not take effect until 2021. Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Bill House of CommonsParliament Housing minister Heather Wheeler says ""rogue landlords will have to improve their properties or leave the business"". Ms Wheeler describes how the government has introduced minimum size requirements in properties to prevent overcrowding and concludes the debate by saying the government ""strongly supports"" this bill. The bill has cleared all remaining stages in the Commons and will now move to the Lords for further consideration. Â© 2025 BBC.
