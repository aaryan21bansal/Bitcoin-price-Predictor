"Sarah Fuller played with an inspirational message on her helmet Sarah Fuller has become the first woman to play in a Power 5 match - the elite level of collegiate American football. Fuller, 21, took to the field for the Vanderbilt Commodores as a placekicker in a road game against the Missouri Tigers in the city of Columbia. ""I just want to tell all the girls out there that you can do anything you set your mind to,"" she said afterwards. Fuller was called in because many players were self-isolating due to the coronavirus outbreak in the US. During Saturday's match, which her team lost 41-0,she wore a helmet with the slogan Play Like A Girl on the back,external- in support of a non-profit group encouraging girls to play sports. The female American Football coach breaking barriers on and off the pitch Arizona Cardinals appoint NFL's first female coach ""History made,"" tweeted the Southeastern Conference (SEC), showing the moment Fuller stepped on to the pitch to kick off at the start of the second half. There was some social media criticism at the length of the kick but coach Derek Mason said it was an executed plan - a squib kick intended to prevent a return. Given the score, it was her only opportunity. The Power 5 refers to five conferences, including the SEC, considered the elite of collegiate football. The SEC has 14 university teams. College football is massive in the US, supplying the vast majority of players who go on to the NFL. Several women have appeared at lower levels of collegiate football.

"Christmas is often a frantic time for travel, with people rushing across the UK to be with loved ones for the holiday season. But now thatCovid restrictions will be eased from 23 to 27 December, public transport is expected to be even busier than normal, as travel for the holidays is compressed into a five-day window. And this year there will be no squeezing on to a packed train carriage. Trains, coaches and planes are all running at reduced capacity to allow for social distancing, with tickets often needing to be booked in advance. The prospect of public transport being unable to cope with demand has prompted the government to appoint a Christmas travel tsar - Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy. He is assessing whether road, rail and air networks are prepared enough for the onslaught of travellers during the festive window. What are the Covid rules at Christmas? What will England's new lockdown rules be? Three households can mix over Christmas in UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced a series of measures to minimise disruption during the travel window, including clearing roadworks, postponing rail upgrades and cutting some rail ticket charges. Mr Shapps said Sir Peter was carrying out a ""rigorous assessment"" of transport services to ensure ""everything possible is being done to help"". He urged people to ""closely consider their journey, plan and book ahead"". So what should you do if you're going to travel this year to spend Christmas with loved ones, and how might services be affected? As is standard every year, there are no train services running on Christmas Day and only a very limited number of services running on a small number of routes on Boxing Day. But for the days passengers can travel, they are being urged to book ahead and avoid busy times due to the combination of reduced capacity and the limited travel window. And some operators will prevent passengers from boarding without a pre-booked ticket. There have already been reports of advance tickets selling out or going for exorbitant prices.

The good news is that operators say more advance tickets will soon be available, blaming the current shortage on changes to the timetable caused by the pandemic. But the bad news is that tickets are expected to sell fast. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, advised people to keep checking for tickets and consider signing up for notifications from rail operators, some of whom will confirm when more fares are available. Avanti West Coast, which operates trains on the West Coast Main Line, has said it is suspending peak fares between 18 December and the end of the year to help maintain social distancing on its trains. This will slash the cost of many journeys on its network - for example, passengers buying a fully-flexible fare from Manchester to London during what is usually a peak period will be charged Â£64.40 instead of Â£180. Meanwhile, under the government's latest Christmas travel plans, admin fees of up to Â£10 for changing advance tickets are being waived to encourage people to comply with the new restrictions. This applies to tickets that were bought for specific trains before England's Covid tiers were announced on 26 November There are also annual Christmas rail works to contend with - though the majority of the network has been cleared of engineering works in a bid to avoid disruption. However,Network Rail engineering works,externalare taking place from 23 December to 4 January, with some railway lines closing to allow the work to take place. London King's Cross station will be closed for six days from Christmas Day as a Â£1.2bn upgrade of the East Coast Main Line continues. Network Rail is also warning of a ""significantly reduced service"" from 25 December to 4 January between Clapham Junction and London Waterloo because of major work. But some work scheduled for the festive period has been reviewed. The closure of King's Cross on Christmas Eve for major engineering works has now been postponed from the afternoon until the end of service, to ease congestion for people making getaway journeys out of London. And works on the West Coast Main Line will be completed earlier than planned on 27 December. That will allow a full Sunday service to run from 10:00 GMT rather than midday, making it easier for passengers to return from their Christmas bubbles. Longer trains will run on Anglo-Scotland and Liverpool routes to boost the number of seats at anticipated busy times on the West Coast Main Line. Chiltern Railway will also run additional services on 27 December, and East Midlands Railway will run a full intercity timetable over the Christmas period. The government said rail engineering works such as the East Coast Upgrade had been planned for two years - and ""cancelling or delaying these works would see benefits to punctuality, safety and reliability deferred by up to two years"". With trains likely to struggle with demand, coach operator National Express has said it will increase its services in the run-up to Christmas, having seen a ""significant"" increase in traffic to its website since the Christmas Covid rules were announced. However, this still amounts to a reduced service, the operator said, with this year's Christmas Day timetable covering about 55% of the locations compared with 2019. The operator said it will focus on major cities, towns and airports and expects demand for services to grow as more guidance about what we can do over Christmas is released by the government. Megabus also said it had seen an increase in bookings over the past few days and expected demand to continue to grow. Both will have a role in themass exodus of studentsfrom universities between 3 and 9 December, aimed at minimising the risk of them spreading Covid-19 to their home areas. Megabus said extra seats will be available from all the largest university campuses, cities and towns for students travelling home for Christmas, including Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Oxford, Newcastle, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Sheffield, Leeds, Norwich, Cardiff and Bristol. National Express said it had increased capacity its usual routes that serve university locations and was speaking with universities about the possible need for special services. Both operators will have services on Christmas Day. Mr Shapps has also said the government is relaxing rules to allow more types of coaches to run over the festive period. One upside for those travelling by road is that there are likely to be fewer roadworks than normal over the Christmas period. The transport secretary said 778 miles of roadworks had been cleared on motorways and A-roads to ease any congestion. Where essential roadworks must continue, speed limits will be set at 60mph where possible, including on key routes such as the M6 and M1, ""to keep disruption to a minimum"". Melanie Clarke, customer service director for Highways England, said the ""current plan"" was to remove ""non-essential"" roadworks from 20 December to 4 January 2021. The RAC said its breakdown team is planning for the roads to be busy during the five-day period when coronavirus restrictions are eased, though it said it ""remains to be seen"" what the appetite for journeys would be this year. The AA said it was not ""overly concerned"" that traffic congestion would occur on roads. A survey it conducted found two-fifths of drivers had already cancelled festive travel plans. EasyJet said it had already taken the decision to increase the number of seats on offer between London and Belfast, and London and Scotland over the Christmas period. ""We are operating flights in line with demand, which we will be monitoring over the coming days and are able to adjust our flight schedule accordingly,"" a spokesman said. British Airways said it had seen an uptick in the numbers of people visiting its website looking at flights and holidays. A spokesman said it would be putting on larger aircraft if needed, ""where possible"". But Irish airline Aer Lingus said it would be operating a ""much-reduced schedule"" due to a ""lack of demand"" for air travel. However, it said additional capacity had been added to key routes including Dublin to London Heathrow over the Christmas period. What are the rules for Christmas bubbles?

"This video can not be played John Swinney made the pledge in a speech to the virtual SNP conference The SNP has pledged to expand free school meals to all primary school pupils in Scotland. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said if the party retains power after the Holyrood elections in May, it would fund free breakfasts and lunches for all children in P1-P7. He told the SNP conference that the scheme would also run in the school holidays - not just term time. The Scottish Conservatives announceda similar policy,externalin September. However the Scottish Greens said free school meals should be provided in high school as well as primary school. Currently all pupils in P1 to P3 in Scotland are entitled to free school lunches. They are also available to older children whose parents are in receipt of certain benefits. The SNP's scheme is expected to cost Â£230m a year. It would be implemented from August 2022, making Scotland the first nation in the UK to offer universal free primary school meals. Mr Swinney made the commitment as he warned that Scotland was facing a ""tsunami of child poverty"" if UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak imposes a ""second wave of austerity"". Praising the free school meals campaign led by footballer Marcus Rashford, Mr Swinney said: ""We must recognise that this is not just an issue for the very poorest. ""This is an issue for working families, forced to feed children from foodbanks or go hungry themselves."" How Marcus Rashford campaign changed free school meals for children in England Children who currently qualify for free school meals have been able to receive them during the holidays this year, amid concern about the impact of the pandemic. Meals were distributed in schools that remained opened or through direct cash or voucher payments. Mr Swinney said: ""Hunger doesn't take a holiday and so neither can we. ""Just as we extended free meals through the holidays this year and next, if re-elected we will extend free school meals through every school holidays. All primary school pupils. All classes. All year round."" Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said he was pleased Mr Swinney had decided to ""follow our lead"" on the free school meals policy. But he said there was no reason to wait two years to implement the programme. ""We can deliver this now, so our young people get the benefit as soon as possible,"" he said. ""As the SNP are now supportive of our policy, there is no reason why this can't pass through the Scottish Parliament as the priority it clearly is."" Meanwhile Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens' education spokesman, welcomed the SNP's adoption of ""half"" of the party's school meals policy. ""Hunger doesn't stop when a child goes to high school though, which is why we have always insisted that free school meals should be provided to all children and young people, at every stage of their education,"" he added. Nicola Sturgeon told delegates Scotland is ""on the cusp"" of making history The annual conference, which is being held virtually because of the pandemic, follows a decisive victory for the SNP in last December's general election in which it won 48 of the 59 available seats. Party activists will also be buoyed by a number of recent opinion polls suggesting a majority of Scots are now in favour of leaving the UK. The UK government's Scottish independence dilemma Why are more Scots supporting independence? Earlier Nicola Sturgeon opened the conference by telling delegates she has ""never been so certain"" that Scotland would become independent. Opposition parties say such a vote would be divisive, and the focus should be recovering from the Covid pandemic. And some within Ms Sturgeon's own party argue a ""Plan B"" is needed if the UK government refuses to agree to another referendum. What's going on with Scottish independence?

"This video can not be played Ethiopia's Tigray conflict: What does it mean for the east Africa region? Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says government forces are now ""fully in control"" of Mekelle, the capital of the northern Tigray region. He said the army had entered the city in the ""last phase"" of the conflict with the Tigray People's Liberation Front - but details are hard to confirm as there is a communications blackout. The TPLF leader vowed to ""fight... to the last"" in a statement to Reuters. Hundreds have reportedly been killed in the conflict and thousands displaced. It began earlier this month after Mr Abiy announced an operation against the TPLF, the regional party, accusing it of attacking the Ethiopian army's northern command HQ in Mekelle. Federal security forces are now searching for the TPLF leaders. Ethiopian soldiers accused of blocking border with Sudan Why Ethiopia may be marching into guerrilla war Crisis has engulfed Ethiopia. Hereâs what it means The BBC managed to briefly speak to one contact in Mekelle who said that federal soldiers were in the city and he had heard sporadic gunshots on Sunday morning. Some residents had earlier fled to the city's outskirts, he added. Meanwhile, the US embassy in neighbouring Eritrea said six explosions were heard in the capital Asmara late on Saturday. Tigrayan forces have previously fired rockets at Eritrea, which they accuse of backing Ethiopian government forces in the weeks-long conflict. It is not clear if the latest incidents in Asmara are linked to the fighting in Tigray. In a statement on Twitter, Mr Abiy saidthe army was in full control,externalof Mekelle and that this ""marks the completion of the [military's] last phase"". ""I am pleased to share that we have completed and ceased the military operations in the Tigray region,"" he said. The army had released thousands of soldiers taken by the TPLF and was in control of the airport and regional offices, Mr Abiy said, adding that the operation had been carried out with ""due care for citizens"". There have been fears for the safety of the 500,000 people living in the city. Mr Abiy's statement said federal forces would ""continue their task of apprehending TPLF criminals and bring them to the court of law"". Confirming details from Tigray is very hard as telephone and internet lines have been down during the conflict. In a text message to Reuters, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael did not directly comment on the situation on the ground, but said of the government forces: ""Their brutality can only add [to] our resolve to fight these invaders to the last."" He added: ""This is about defending our right to self-determination."" Mr Debretsion's whereabouts are unknown. A TPLF statement read out on regional Tigray TV said: ""Fascistic bombings have caused civilian deaths and injuries. The Tigray government has vowed that it would take retaliatory actions against the barbaric bombings"". It also accused the Eritrean government of involvement in the attack on Mekelle. Tigray TV and another station from the region are now off air. Analysts say the TPLF could now be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government. The UN had warned of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacked Mekelle. This video can not be played ""Every precaution will be taken to protect civilians,"" says attorney general Gedion Timothewos It has also expressed concerns about the lack of access for humanitarian workers. The Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday that ""a humanitarian access route"" overseen by the government would be opened, adding they were ""committed to work with UN agencies... to protect civilians and those who need it"". Also on Thursday, Ethiopian troops were deployed along Tigray's border with Sudan, preventing people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees. This video can not be played The BBCâs Anne Soy reports from a refugee camp on the Sudan-Ethiopian border The BBC's Anne Soy, on the Sudanese side of the border, saw at least a dozen members of the Ethiopian military, leading to a marked decrease in the number of people crossing into Sudan. In a meeting on Friday, Mr Abiy told African peace envoys that civilians would be protected. However, there was no mention of potential peace talks and the envoys were not allowed to visit Tigray. The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Some analysts fear the situation could turn into a guerrilla conflict - with the TPLF continuing to mount attacks on government forces even if they take Mekelle. Mr Debretsion has said Tigray forces were ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"". Mekelle, the capital city of the Tigray region. File image Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise the Horn of Africa region. Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed. The TPLF denied involvement. The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which was the dominant political force in the country until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 and introduced far-reaching reforms. When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated. The TPLF said the government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election. In September the party held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal"".

"Vitamin D supplements help keep bones and muscles healthy, particularly during the winter More than 2.5 million vulnerable people in England will be offered free Vitamin D supplements this winter. The vitamin, which helps to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy, will be delivered to people who are clinically extremely vulnerable, and care homes. Skin makes Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight - but the elderly and those with dark skin need topping up. The coronavirus pandemic means many more people than normal have spent time indoors. The groups most at risk are residents in care homes, and people with serious health conditions which mean they have spent extended periods shielding from the virus - a total of 2.7 million people. Should I start taking Vitamin D? Health officials say that even in a normal winter, everyone should take 10 micrograms of Vitamin D a day between October and March - and it's particularly important this year because of coronavirus. Scottish,externalandWelsh,externalgovernments, andNorthern Ireland's Public Health Agency,externalissued similar advice during lockdown. But there is limited evidence that vitamin D protects against or treats Covid-19, although health officials have been asked to go back over the existing research. Millions of people have spent extended periods indoors this year because of Covid-19 All care homes in England will receive enough supplements for their residents, the government says. People on the clinically extremely vulnerable list,externalwill get a letter inviting them to opt in for a supply of Vitamin D tablets to be delivered to their homes. Deliveries will start in January. They'll provide four months' worth of free supplements. ""Vitamin D is important for our bone and muscle health,"" says Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England. ""We advise that everyone, particularly the elderly, those who don't get outside and those with dark skin, take a Vitamin D supplement containing 10 micrograms (400IU) every day. ""This year, the advice is more important than ever with more people spending more time inside, which is why the government will be helping the clinically extremely vulnerable to get Vitamin D."" GP Sarah Jarvis told BBC Breakfast that those who cover up for religious reasons, pale-skinned people and those who are generally unwell are also at higher risk. ""All of those are either going to get less vitamin D or in the case of people of BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) origin may make less of it,"" she said. People who are able to buy a Vitamin D supplement and start taking them now, ahead of a free delivery, are advised to do so.

"Trailing hunting is legal but hunting foxes with dogs has been banned since 2004 The Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA) has suspended all trail hunting on its land.Â The decision was in response to ""recent allegations made to police"" about an online hunting conference, it said. The National Trust has also paused all trail hunting on its land. The LDNPA said licences would remain suspended while ""allegations are being examined by the police and Crown Prosecution Service to determine if any criminal offences have taken place"". ""This will include the suspension of the licence issued to the Blencathra Foxhounds,"" it said. ""We will consider any action we need to take once the investigation is complete.""

"The number of officers patrolling French beaches will double from next week to help stop migrants crossing the Channel, the UK's home secretary has announced. It is part of further measures Priti Patel agreed in a meeting with her French counterpart on Saturday. Officers will be aided by ""enhanced"" surveillance, such as drones and radar, to find smugglers and migrants. Thousands of migrants have reached the UK in small boats this year. The Home Office said 59 people on four boats crossed the Channel on Friday. Migrants wrapped in blankets reach Dover Why can't the UK stop migrants in small boats? Priti Patel vows to stop illegal Channel crossings Ms Patel said that due to increased French patrols and intelligence sharing ""we are already seeing fewer migrants leaving French beaches"". ""The action we have agreed jointly today goes further, doubling the number of police officers on the ground in France, increasing surveillance and introducing new cutting edge technology, representing a further step forward in our shared mission to make Channel crossings completely unviable,"" she said. In announcing the French patrols, the Home Office did not say how many more officers would be deployed. Ms Patel also said there would be ""a new asylum system"" that is ""firm and fair"" and promised there would be new legislation for that next year. But Saturday's announcement was criticised by Bella Sankey, director of humanitarian charity Detention Action. ""It is an extraordinary mark of failure that the home secretary is announcing with such fanfare that she is rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic,"" she said. This video can not be played Patel also promised there would be legislation for a 'new asylum system' that is 'firm and fair' next year ""No amount of massaging the numbers masks her refusal to take the sensible step of creating a safe and legal route to the UK from northern France, thereby preventing crossings and child deaths. ""Instead she throws taxpayers' money away on more of the same measures that stand no chance of having a significant impact on this dangerous state of affairs."" According to figures collated by the BBC about 8,000 migrants in small boats have been taken into the care of Border Force officials, having reached UK shores or been intercepted in the Channel. That is despite Ms Patel's vow in 2019 to make such journeys an ""infrequent phenomenon"". Analysis: Simon Jones, BBC News There have been a number of deals between Britain and France over the past couple of years to try to bring a halt to these crossings. On each occasion, the two countries pledged to work more closely than ever to tackle the issue. But the number of migrants reaching the UK has continued to rise. The home secretary has been facing calls, not least from her fellow Conservative MPs, to get a grip of the issue. Now she's had to put her hands in her pockets to provide more resources for the French. There will now be real pressure on them to deliver results. In October a Kurdish-Iranian family of fivedied attempting to cross the Channel. The small boat they were heading to the UK in capsized in rough conditions just a few kilometres into its journey. There have been nearly 300 border-related deaths in and around the Channel since 1999, according to a recent report by Mael Galisson, from Gisti, a legal service for asylum seekers in France. At Saturday's meeting, Ms Patel and French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin also agreed on steps to better support migrants arriving in France to find appropriate accommodation ""in order to take them out of the hands of criminal gangs"". They agreed on measures to increase border security at ports in northern and western France to target smugglers and avoid migrant crossings threatening freight traffic. Co-operation between French and UK law enforcement had already stopped about 1,100 migrants from making the dangerous crossing and led to 140 arrests since July, the Home Office said.

"The number of people in Aberdeen's ICU has risen but it far from being worst hit Aberdeen is not a Covid hotspot yet the pressure on hospital and intensive care staff is still starting to show. The patient count at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI) is not as high as some of Scotland's worst-hit hospitals but numbers are increasing. We spent less than an hour in ""pod 1"" of ARI's Covid ICU and it was a total reality check on the effect of the second wave of the virus. Eighty-three-year-old Meg Thomson is one of 11 patients being treated there. Meg, 83, says she does not give up easily Against the constant hiss of oxygen and the beeping of monitors, Meg tells me she doesn't know where she contracted the virus or how she ended up in ICU but, with grit and stoicism, she is determined to get better. ""I dinnae give up very easily,"" she says. ""I've got my ups and downs but I feel positive."" In the neighbouring bed, 65-year-old Dot Bright says she started feeling unwell just over a week ago. After deteriorating rapidly, she was admitted to the ICU. ""The night before I was brought in here, I thought I was finished,"" she says ""It's the biggest scare I've had in my life. Take it serious."" Dot says Covid was the biggest scare of her life In the last month, the number of Covid patients in hospital have doubled and the staff in ICU know that means there will be more needing critical care in the next few weeks. Working 12-hour shifts in visors, gloves, gowns and masks is hot and uncomfortable. Every time you enter or leave ""the pod"" the protracted routine of donning and doffing must take place. And that goes for the nurses and doctors as well as domestic staff bringing in equipment or taking the bins away. Chloe Burdett has been an ICU nurse for three years and she says everyone is tired and trying to stay motivated. ""To know that people are so unwell, when we thought we'd gotten over that, it's very difficult to see that again and know it's still out there and it's still a threat to everyone,"" she says. Nurses have to work long shifts in full PPE Helen Paddon, the head nurse for critical care, says it has been the most difficult year of her nursing career. ""The nursing staff are working longer hours than they should do, in full PPE,"" she says. Staff here say they have been lucky to escape the full impact of the second wave felt in other parts of Scotland. But a specialist national unit, which is based in the Aberdeen ICU, means they treat some of the sickest Covid patients in Scotland. The ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) unit, ""pod 2"", has special machines that take on the work of the lungs. It is often the younger people who will be put on ECMO as they are the most likely to survive. ECMO - The Covid patient who got the most intensive care Dr Iain Macleod heads up all the hospital's critical care. He tells me that better treatments this time mean more people can avoid intensive care but those who do come tend to stay for some time. ""What we're seeing this time is more of a slow burn, patients are here for longer, they remain very sick,"" he says. And like all hospitals this time round, other work continues. For the critical care team that means running and staffing two intensive care units, one for Covid patients and one for non-Covid. ""Intensive care is an emotionally-charged environment but this year is like nothing I have ever seen before,"" Dr Macleod says. ""Our team have been working incredibly hard over the last six months and there is no end in sight."" Dr Iain Macleod said fewer people were needing ICU but they were staying for longer Visiting is not allowed in order to limit the number of people in the hospital but I was granted rare access, alongside a camera operator, because the staff felt it was important that people understood just how serious the threat of this virus is. And it is distressing to see. Dot and Meg have turned a corner but there are others in the unit who might not make it. The staff have to deal with that and they have to deal with working in full PPE, getting used to smiling with their eyes as they comfort frightened patients. They also have to deal with their own fears of the virus, their own stresses of seeing people so critically ill, and taking that home at the end of a busy shift to everyday family life. Dot tells me: ""The people in here can't be more helpful. They stand here for four or five hours without a break. They're here with you all the time.""

"Police urged people to leave central London after the protest More than 150 people have been arrested during anti-lockdown protests in London's West End. The group Save Our Rights UK said it held the protest, which started from Marble Arch on Saturday afternoon. The Metropolitan Police said it had been a ""challenging day"" for its officers. It said it made arrests for a number of different offences, including breaching coronavirus restrictions, assaulting a police officer and illegal drugs. Police officers urged protesters to leave the demonstration and return home Police officers were booed and met with chants of ""shame on you"" as protesters, many not wearing face masks, ignored requests to leave. Earlier protesters, including some dressed as Christmas elves, brandished signs reading ""All I want for Christmas is my freedom back"", ""Ditch the face masks"" and ""Stop controlling us"". They had earlier been warned by police that protests were not acceptable exemptions to the ban on gathering under current coronavirus regulations in England. The protest had started at Marble Arch and protesters moved to Oxford Street Groups of police officers were seen running towards protesters in Oxford Circus, Carnaby Street and Regent Street. Traffic was temporarily blocked as officers tried to handcuff people on the ground in the middle of the road. Disorder was reported in central London, including in Oxford Circus, Carnaby Street and Regent Street Protests are not permitted under current coronavirus regulations in England Civil rights groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch have argued that the right to safely protest should be explicitly outlined as an exemption in regulations covering England's tiered restrictions, which are due to come into force next week. The Met said coaches taking protesters into London had earlier been intercepted and those who did not turn back and go home were either arrested or given fines. Ch Supt Stuart Bell, policing commander for the event, said: ""This was a challenging day for Met, City of London and British Transport Police officers and I would like to thank them for the professionalism they have shown throughout the day. ""On Friday, we made it very clear how we would police this event, warning those looking to attend that they risked facing enforcement action if they attended a gathering in London. ""Today's enforcement action is a direct result of those individuals deliberately breaking the law and at times, targeting our officers with aggression and causing disruption to the road network."" The Metropolitan Police said people were arrested for various offences, including breaching coronavirus restrictions Responding to the anti-lockdown protests, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We've seen our police officers yet again do incredible work to ensure that they help to stop the spread of this awful virus. ""The people that are protesting today have been protesting for many months, and we've seen this over successive weekends."" She added: ""We ask everybody to be conscientious - we all know the regulations and the guidance, we have brought these measures in to save lives and to prevent preventable deaths."" It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030.

"Arcadia is ""an object lesson in what happens if you don't stay relevant"", said Lord Rose Breaking up the Arcadia retail empire, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is ""the only way"" forward as it faces collapse, its former chief executive said. Lord Rose, now chairman of Ocado, said ""people will come and pick over the carcass"" but not all the brands and infrastructure are likely to sell. ""If you aren't relevant, you're probably going to die,"" he said. Administrators could be appointed on Monday, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Lord Rose, who was chief executive of Arcadia until it was bought by retail tycoon Sir Philip Green in 2002, said the company had been ""caught out"" by the ""relentless pace of change"" in retail, which was only made worse by the Covid-19 crisis. ""Sadly what will happen is people will come and pick over the carcass,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that there were ""some tastier bits of the carcass"" - such as Topshop - and ""some less tasty bits of the carcass"". ""I just hope that someone will pick up some of the pieces, that some jobs are salvageable,"" he said. Topshop owner Arcadia on brink of collapse Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was The 'king of the High Street's' biggest challenge Arcadia would be the biggest British corporate collapse of the pandemic if it enters voluntary liquidation, analysts said. They said that if a large part of its 500 shops were forced to close, it would hollow out a huge swathe of the UK High Street. But the shops are expected to continue to trade if administrators are called in, as buyers are sought for the company or its individual brands. Lord Rose said he did not want to ""demonise"" Sir Philip, but said the controversial businessman had ""not moved from an analogue world to a digital world fast enough"", blaming that on a likely lack of investment over 10 or 15 years. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? ""It's a very, very tough place out there in the retail high street at the moment,"" said Lord Rose, who also led Marks & Spencer for more than six years. ""There is very little room for manoeuvre, we've got a whole load of pressures in the sector and I'm afraid if you aren't relevant, you're probably going to die."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said that while Topshop is deemed to have some value as a brand, insiders are less optimistic about the appeal of Wallis Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Burton to buyers. Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct and owner of House of Fraser, has been suggested as one possible buyer for some of the brands, he said. According toa report from Sky News,external, Mr Ashley's Frasers Group offered a Â£50m loan to Arcadia on Saturday. But the BBC understands that Arcadia has not yet received a direct approach and a source close to the situation described the offer as a ""non-starter"". If part or all of the company is sold, the proceeds would be likely to end up in the Arcadia pension fund, which is hundreds of millions of pounds in deficit and would have a priority claim on the company's assets. Lord Rose said Arcadia teetering on the brink of collapse was jut one aspect of a ""sector-wide malaise that's been accelerated by the problems with Covid"". There are forecasts of 20,000 shops closing and 250,000 retail jobs being lost, he said. Menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business on Friday and earlier this month fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. ""If we don't get back to normality we're going to have more than 2.5m people unemployed, we're going to have really difficult times on the high street, and that is a real, real problem,"" Lord Rose said. Retail consultant Kate Hardcastle said Arcadia's brands had been ""suffering for years through under-investment"" while paying out large dividends. She told the BBC that store closures could have a ""knock-on effect"" which ""casts a shadow"" on other high street retailers by reducing the overall footfall. The future of the Arcadia brands is in developing an e-commerce presence ""rather than just bricks-and-mortar stores"", Ms Hardcastle said. Arcadia has acknowledged that the pandemic had ""a material impact on trading across our businesses"". Sir Philip had been in talks with potential lenders about borrowing Â£30m to help the business get through Christmas. Those talks collapsed and the company said it was ""working on a number of contingency options to secure the future of the group's brands"". But Arcadia had also been struggling against online competition from companies such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing, as well as high street brands such as Zara which have invested heavily in their digital business. In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn.

"This video can not be played Ethiopia's Tigray conflict: What does it mean for the east Africa region? Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says government forces are now ""fully in control"" of Mekelle, the capital of the northern Tigray region. He said the army had entered the city in the ""last phase"" of the conflict with the Tigray People's Liberation Front - but details are hard to confirm as there is a communications blackout. The TPLF leader vowed to ""fight... to the last"" in a statement to Reuters. Hundreds have reportedly been killed in the conflict and thousands displaced. It began earlier this month after Mr Abiy announced an operation against the TPLF, the regional party, accusing it of attacking the Ethiopian army's northern command HQ in Mekelle. Federal security forces are now searching for the TPLF leaders. Ethiopian soldiers accused of blocking border with Sudan Why Ethiopia may be marching into guerrilla war Crisis has engulfed Ethiopia. Hereâs what it means The BBC managed to briefly speak to one contact in Mekelle who said that federal soldiers were in the city and he had heard sporadic gunshots on Sunday morning. Some residents had earlier fled to the city's outskirts, he added. Meanwhile, the US embassy in neighbouring Eritrea said six explosions were heard in the capital Asmara late on Saturday. Tigrayan forces have previously fired rockets at Eritrea, which they accuse of backing Ethiopian government forces in the weeks-long conflict. It is not clear if the latest incidents in Asmara are linked to the fighting in Tigray. In a statement on Twitter, Mr Abiy saidthe army was in full control,externalof Mekelle and that this ""marks the completion of the [military's] last phase"". ""I am pleased to share that we have completed and ceased the military operations in the Tigray region,"" he said. The army had released thousands of soldiers taken by the TPLF and was in control of the airport and regional offices, Mr Abiy said, adding that the operation had been carried out with ""due care for citizens"". There have been fears for the safety of the 500,000 people living in the city. Mr Abiy's statement said federal forces would ""continue their task of apprehending TPLF criminals and bring them to the court of law"". Confirming details from Tigray is very hard as telephone and internet lines have been down during the conflict. In a text message to Reuters, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael did not directly comment on the situation on the ground, but said of the government forces: ""Their brutality can only add [to] our resolve to fight these invaders to the last."" He added: ""This is about defending our right to self-determination."" Mr Debretsion's whereabouts are unknown. A TPLF statement read out on regional Tigray TV said: ""Fascistic bombings have caused civilian deaths and injuries. The Tigray government has vowed that it would take retaliatory actions against the barbaric bombings"". It also accused the Eritrean government of involvement in the attack on Mekelle. Tigray TV and another station from the region are now off air. Analysts say the TPLF could now be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government. The UN had warned of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacked Mekelle. This video can not be played ""Every precaution will be taken to protect civilians,"" says attorney general Gedion Timothewos It has also expressed concerns about the lack of access for humanitarian workers. The Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday that ""a humanitarian access route"" overseen by the government would be opened, adding they were ""committed to work with UN agencies... to protect civilians and those who need it"". Also on Thursday, Ethiopian troops were deployed along Tigray's border with Sudan, preventing people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees. This video can not be played The BBCâs Anne Soy reports from a refugee camp on the Sudan-Ethiopian border The BBC's Anne Soy, on the Sudanese side of the border, saw at least a dozen members of the Ethiopian military, leading to a marked decrease in the number of people crossing into Sudan. In a meeting on Friday, Mr Abiy told African peace envoys that civilians would be protected. However, there was no mention of potential peace talks and the envoys were not allowed to visit Tigray. The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Some analysts fear the situation could turn into a guerrilla conflict - with the TPLF continuing to mount attacks on government forces even if they take Mekelle. Mr Debretsion has said Tigray forces were ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"". Mekelle, the capital city of the Tigray region. File image Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise the Horn of Africa region. Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed. The TPLF denied involvement. The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which was the dominant political force in the country until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 and introduced far-reaching reforms. When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated. The TPLF said the government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election. In September the party held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal"".

"Mr Thomas said it was unlike any apple he had seen before A new variety of apple has been discovered by a nature lover while he was out running. Archie Thomas, from the Nadder Valley in Wiltshire, came across across a windfall apple on a wooded trackway near his home earlier this month. Experts have confirmed the ""highly unusual"" fruit, which ""tastes quite good"", is a new variety, which Mr Thomas hopes to propagate and name. ""It is unlike any apple I'd seen before,"" he said. Mr Thomas, who works for wild plant and fungi conservation charity Plantlife, said the fruit came from a lone old apple tree in a hedgerow. ""While I am certainly no fruit expert, it immediately struck me as highly unusual, unlike any apple I'd seen before,"" he said. ""Excited by the pale and mottled oddity, I set about trying to get it identified with a view to perhaps one day being able to name it. ""That was the dream, but I did half suspect it would turn out to be something much less exciting than it is."" Horticultural expert Jim Arbury said the apple ""tastes quite good"" Mr Thomas sent examples to the Royal Horticultural Society's fruit identification service at RHS Wisley. The RHS's Jim Arbury said the fruit was not a planted cultivar, but a new variety which Mr Thomas could propagate and name. ""It is a very interesting apple. It is clearly not a planted tree, but a seedling that could be a cross between a cultivated apple and a wild Malus sylvestris, a European crab apple,"" Mr Arbury said. ""It tastes quite good. It's a cooking apple or dual purpose - you can eat it."" Mr Arbury said the tree from which the apples came could be more than 100 years old and was not the result of a dropped modern supermarket apple. Apple trees grown from seed are all different, so cultivated varieties, or cultivars, are propagated by taking cuttings from existing trees and grafting them on to rootstock to ensure the new tree and its apples are the same.

"This video can not be played Students of Iran's Basij paramilitary force rallied in front of the foreign ministry in Tehran Iran's president has blamed Israel for the killing of a top nuclear scientist on Friday, and said it would not slow down the country's nuclear programme. Hassan Rouhani also said Iran would retaliate over Mohsen Fakhrizadeh's killing at a time of its choosing. An Israeli cabinet minister said he had ""no clue"" who was behind the ambush by gunmen on Mr Fakhrizadeh's car. Israel has previously accused the physicist of being key to a covert nuclear weapons programme. Fakhrizadeh was Iran's most renowned nuclear scientist, who headed the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation. His killing threatens to escalate tensions over Iran's nuclear programme with the US and its close ally Israel. What were the motives behind the killing? Country profile: Iran,external Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words President Rouhani said on Saturday his country would respond ""in due course"" but that Fakhrizadeh's killing would not push Iran into making hasty decisions. ""Iran's enemies should know that the people of Iran and officials are braver than to leave this criminal act unanswered,"" he said in a televised cabinet meeting. ""In due time, they will answer for this crime,"" he added. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, pictured in an undated photo, was head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation In an earlier statement, the president accused the ""the mercenaries of the oppressive Zionist regime"" - referring to Israel - of being behind the attack. ""The assassination of martyr Fakhrizadeh shows our enemies' despair and the depth of their hatred... His martyrdom will not slow down our achievements."" Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also called for the ""punishing"" of the perpetrators of the attack ""and those who commanded it"", in a tweet on Saturday. His military adviser, Hossein Dehghan, had earlier vowed to ""strike"" the attackers like thunder. This video can not be played The road near Tehran where gunmen opened fire on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh The New York Times quotes three US officials, including two intelligence officials, as sayingIsrael was behind the attack,external. But Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi said on Saturday that he had ""no clue"" who was behind the killing. Fakhrizadeh's name was specifically mentioned in Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation about Iran's nuclear programme in April 2018. Israeli embassies around the world have been placed on high alert, according to Israel's N12 news website on Saturday. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called on the international community to ""condemn this act of state terror"". News of the killing comes amid fresh concern about the increased amount of enriched uranium that Iran is producing. Enriched uranium is a vital component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. A 2015 deal with six world powers had placed limits on Iran's production of enriched uranium, but since US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, Iran has been deliberately reneging on its agreements. However, it insists its nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. Joe Biden has pledged to re-engage with Iran when he becomes US president in January, despite long-standing opposition from Israel. Trump 'asked about attacking Iran nuclear site' Iran's enriched uranium stockpile '12 times limit' After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? The former head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), John Brennan, said the killing of the scientist was a ""criminal"" and ""highly reckless"" act that risks inflaming conflict in the region. In aseries of tweets,external, he said Fakhrizadeh's death ""risks lethal retaliation and a new round of regional conflict"". Mr Brennan added that he did not know ""whether a foreign government authorised or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh"". UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has urged restraint, while on Saturday a spokesman for Germany's foreign office called on all sides ""to refrain from any steps that could lead to a further escalation of the situation"". ""A few weeks before the new US administration takes office, it is important to preserve the scope for talks with Iran so that the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme can be resolved through negotiations,"" a statement said. These are weeks which matter - the countdown to 20 January when President-elect Biden takes office with a new approach to Iran, including an expected return to the 2015 nuclear deal. This assassination followsthe not-so-secret meeting last week in Saudi Arabiabetween the Saudi crown prince and Israeli prime minister - officially denied by the kingdom. It sent another signal that Mohammed bin Salman and Benjamin Netanyahu see this window as their last best chance in a while to try to inflict a crippling blow on their arch-enemy Iran - a blow to also complicate an already challenging course for a new US team to re-engage with the Islamic Republic. All sides know it's also a moment fraught with risk. Iran's President Rouhani declares Iran is ""too wise to fall into Israel's trap"". An immediate retaliation risks an even greater reply, and a descent into even greater crisis which could imperil any chance of a new start in January. Iran's defence ministry said the leading scientist was seriously wounded after attackers targeted his car and exchanged fire with his bodyguards, in the town of Absard, to the east of Tehran, on Friday. Fakhrizadeh later died from his injuries in hospital. It is not clear what happened to the perpetrators of the attack. Fakhrizadeh has long been spoken about by Western security sources as extremely powerful and instrumental in Iran's nuclear programme. According to secret documents obtained by Israel in 2018, he led a programme to create nuclear weapons. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he identified Fakhrizadeh as the head scientist in the programme, and urged people to ""remember that name"". This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive In 2015,the New York Times compared him to J Robert Oppenheimer,external, the physicist who directed the Manhattan Project that during World War Two produced the first atomic weapons. A professor of physics, Fakhrizadeh is said to have led Project Amad, the alleged covert programme that was established in 1989 to research the potential for building a nuclear bomb. It was shut down in 2003, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), though Mr Netanyahu said the documents retrieved in 2018 showed Fakhrizadeh led a programme which secretly continued Project Amad's work. The IAEA (the United Nations' nuclear watchdog) has long wanted to speak to him as part of its investigations into Iran's nuclear programme. Suspicions that Iran was using the programme as a cover to develop a nuclear bomb prompted the EU, US and UN to impose crippling sanctions in 2010. Since President Trump abandoned the 2015 deal, tensions between the US and Iran have escalated, peaking in January with America's assassination of Gen Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds force.

"Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed as a new health minister to oversee rollout of the Covid vaccine in England. The rollout is expected to begin before Christmas, subject to regulatory approval. Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, will oversee distribution of the vaccine until at least next summer. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""delighted"", adding in a tweet there was ""an enormous task ahead"". Under the interim arrangement, Mr Zahawi will serve as a joint minister between the health department and the business department, where he currently works. His primary focus will be on delivering the vaccine, with most areas of his business portfolio put aside. It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours. In a tweet,external, Mr Zahawi welcomed his new post but said the rollout would be a ""big responsibility and a big operational challenge"". He added that he was ""absolutely committed to making sure we can roll out vaccines quickly - saving lives and livelihoods and helping us #buildbackbetter"". How does the Oxford vaccine compare? How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Mr Zahawi will look after deployment of the vaccine in England only, but will work with the devolved administrations on their chosen approach. Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be responsible for the vaccine's distribution in their relevant nations. Currently, the UK government has placed orders for 100 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, 40 million doses of the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech and five million doses from US firm Moderna. Rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may pose the greatest challenge as it needs to be stored at minus 70C, raising potential difficulties with transport and storage. Nadhim Zahawi moved to the UK from Iraq with his family when he was nine years old In 2000 he co-founded online market research agency YouGov and was its chief executive until he was selected as a Conservative parliamentary candidate in 2010 He was first elected as Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon in May 2010 In 2011 he co-authored a book with fellow MP Matt Hancock, now the health secretary, on the human behaviour behind the banking crash - called ""Masters of Nothing"" In 2018 he became an education minister in Theresa May's government. Under Boris Johnson's premiership he was appointed as a business minister He is married and has three children Last week, the government asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, marking ""a significant first step"" in getting the vaccine ""approved for deployment"". It follows a similar referral to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) earlier this month to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which has been shown to stop more than 90% of people developing Covid-19 symptoms in preliminary trials. On Saturday,the Financial Times reported,externalthat regulatory approval for that vaccine could come as early as next week - and suggested rollout would start within hours of authorisation. Interim data from the trials of the Oxford jab showed an overall efficacy of 70%. The findings from one group of volunteers showed 62% efficacy while another group, who were given a different dose by accident, showed 90% efficacy. The Department of Health and Social Care said the UK would be one of the first countries in the world to receive the vaccine, if it is authorised, with AstraZeneca set to have as many as four million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year and 40 million by the end of March 2021. By Ellie Price, political reporter, BBC News In ministerial terms, it's a sideways move. But Nadhim Zahawi's new job comes with huge public expectation, and therefore the potential for political disaster. The government is only too aware of the bloody nose it has received as a result of the shortcomings of NHS Test and Trace programme and the procurement of PPE at the start of the pandemic. Government scientists have said, if proven to be safe and effective, mass vaccinations will offer a ""much better horizon"" by the spring. Hospitals and other NHS trusts in England say they have been told to get ready to administer jabs from the middle of December. The winter flu vaccine programme will offer some framework for how that will work in practice. Mr Zahawi is seen as a good media performer. He has a business background and helped to set up the polling group YouGov. He'll understand only too well the delicate art of keeping public opinion on side. Mr Zahawi's appointment follows calls from Labour for the government to appoint a vaccine minister, who would provide accountability and avoid repeating mistakes made over PPE procurement and NHS Test and Trace. Shadow health secretary John Ashworth said: ""Only days ago Labour called for a vaccines minister to oversee the huge logistical challenge of widespread vaccination. ""We now need a mass public health campaign urging uptake of the vaccine, alongside ensuring the resources are in place for GPs and other health professionals to rapidly roll this out as soon as possible."" In addition to the vaccine rollout, the prime minister has said mass community testing, as seen in Liverpool, will be offered to all areas in tier three after lockdown ends on 2 December. Earlier this week,Mr Zahawi tweeted,externalthat he was ""extremely disappointed and sad"" that Warwickshire, the county in which his constituency lies, would be placed in the most restricted tier - tier three - after England's national lockdown ends next week. He said he would be pushing for the county of Warwickshire to be considered separately from Coventry and Solihull in all future decisions about restrictions and for the rollout of mass testing - but urged residents ""to continue following the rules to the letter"" in the meantime.

"A spokeswoman said the ""vast majority of petitions received"" would not be affected Thousands more signatures will be required for petitions to be considered for debate in the Senedd. The Senedd's petitions committee has decided the current debate threshold of more than 5,000 signatures should be increased to over 10,000. A committee spokeswoman said it was because of an ""unprecedented increase in the number of petitions"". She said it was also because of a reduction in Senedd debating time during the coronavirus pandemic. Petitions with more than 50 signatures are discussed by the petitions committee. T plates for tourists and a Welsh pound - rejected petitions A-levels: 22,000 sign grade change petition Wales' supermarket rules 'will not be reversed' Recent Senedd debates held because of popular petitions includecalls for Welsh pupils to be taught about black historyand concerns over plans to dump more mud dredged from near a Somerset nuclear power site in to the sea off Cardiff Bay. Almost 68,000 signatures were received for a petition calling for areversal on the rules banning shops selling non-essential items during Wales' recent short firebreak lockdown,external. It is the largest petition ever submitted to the Senedd but therules were not reversedand the issue was debated in Cardiff Bay in the week after the ban had come to an end. Speaking in the Senedd during the debate, the chairwoman of the petitions committee said it was ""on track"" to consider the same number of new petitions during 2020 than it did for the previous three-and-a-half years of this Senedd combined. Janet Finch-Saunders added it was ""clearly the case that increasing numbers of people are engaging with the Senedd and devolved politics through the petitions process"". ""I believe that this can only be a positive thing for our democracy,"" she added. Of the99 petitions currently open,external, none have received more than 10,000 signatures and only six have received more than 5,000. A spokeswoman on behalf of the Senedd's petitions committee, said: ""The coronavirus pandemic - as well as a new Senedd petitions website - has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the number of petitions received, including those with more than 5,000 signatures. ""However, debating time available during plenary is scarce, especially during the current coronavirus pandemic when urgent business is prioritised. ""This makes it difficult for the committee to fulfil the demand for debates and it has therefore decided to increase the threshold above which it will consider referring petitions for a debate to 10,000 signatures for all petitions closing after 1 December 2020."" The spokeswoman added that the committee would ""continue to work hard to consider and scrutinise all petitions with more than 50 signatures, including ensuring they receive a response from the Welsh Government"".

"Arcadia is ""an object lesson in what happens if you don't stay relevant"", said Lord Rose Breaking up the Arcadia retail empire, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is ""the only way"" forward as it faces collapse, its former chief executive said. Lord Rose, now chairman of Ocado, said ""people will come and pick over the carcass"" but not all the brands and infrastructure are likely to sell. ""If you aren't relevant, you're probably going to die,"" he said. Administrators could be appointed on Monday, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Lord Rose, who was chief executive of Arcadia until it was bought by retail tycoon Sir Philip Green in 2002, said the company had been ""caught out"" by the ""relentless pace of change"" in retail, which was only made worse by the Covid-19 crisis. ""Sadly what will happen is people will come and pick over the carcass,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that there were ""some tastier bits of the carcass"" - such as Topshop - and ""some less tasty bits of the carcass"". ""I just hope that someone will pick up some of the pieces, that some jobs are salvageable,"" he said. Topshop owner Arcadia on brink of collapse Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was The 'king of the High Street's' biggest challenge Arcadia would be the biggest British corporate collapse of the pandemic if it enters voluntary liquidation, analysts said. They said that if a large part of its 500 shops were forced to close, it would hollow out a huge swathe of the UK High Street. But the shops are expected to continue to trade if administrators are called in, as buyers are sought for the company or its individual brands. Lord Rose said he did not want to ""demonise"" Sir Philip, but said the controversial businessman had ""not moved from an analogue world to a digital world fast enough"", blaming that on a likely lack of investment over 10 or 15 years. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? ""It's a very, very tough place out there in the retail high street at the moment,"" said Lord Rose, who also led Marks & Spencer for more than six years. ""There is very little room for manoeuvre, we've got a whole load of pressures in the sector and I'm afraid if you aren't relevant, you're probably going to die."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said that while Topshop is deemed to have some value as a brand, insiders are less optimistic about the appeal of Wallis Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Burton to buyers. Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct and owner of House of Fraser, has been suggested as one possible buyer for some of the brands, he said. According toa report from Sky News,external, Mr Ashley's Frasers Group offered a Â£50m loan to Arcadia on Saturday. But the BBC understands that Arcadia has not yet received a direct approach and a source close to the situation described the offer as a ""non-starter"". If part or all of the company is sold, the proceeds would be likely to end up in the Arcadia pension fund, which is hundreds of millions of pounds in deficit and would have a priority claim on the company's assets. Lord Rose said Arcadia teetering on the brink of collapse was jut one aspect of a ""sector-wide malaise that's been accelerated by the problems with Covid"". There are forecasts of 20,000 shops closing and 250,000 retail jobs being lost, he said. Menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business on Friday and earlier this month fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. ""If we don't get back to normality we're going to have more than 2.5m people unemployed, we're going to have really difficult times on the high street, and that is a real, real problem,"" Lord Rose said. Retail consultant Kate Hardcastle said Arcadia's brands had been ""suffering for years through under-investment"" while paying out large dividends. She told the BBC that store closures could have a ""knock-on effect"" which ""casts a shadow"" on other high street retailers by reducing the overall footfall. The future of the Arcadia brands is in developing an e-commerce presence ""rather than just bricks-and-mortar stores"", Ms Hardcastle said. Arcadia has acknowledged that the pandemic had ""a material impact on trading across our businesses"". Sir Philip had been in talks with potential lenders about borrowing Â£30m to help the business get through Christmas. Those talks collapsed and the company said it was ""working on a number of contingency options to secure the future of the group's brands"". But Arcadia had also been struggling against online competition from companies such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing, as well as high street brands such as Zara which have invested heavily in their digital business. In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn.

"This video can not be played John Swinney made the pledge in a speech to the virtual SNP conference The SNP has pledged to expand free school meals to all primary school pupils in Scotland. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said if the party retains power after the Holyrood elections in May, it would fund free breakfasts and lunches for all children in P1-P7. He told the SNP conference that the scheme would also run in the school holidays - not just term time. The Scottish Conservatives announceda similar policy,externalin September. However the Scottish Greens said free school meals should be provided in high school as well as primary school. Currently all pupils in P1 to P3 in Scotland are entitled to free school lunches. They are also available to older children whose parents are in receipt of certain benefits. The SNP's scheme is expected to cost Â£230m a year. It would be implemented from August 2022, making Scotland the first nation in the UK to offer universal free primary school meals. Mr Swinney made the commitment as he warned that Scotland was facing a ""tsunami of child poverty"" if UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak imposes a ""second wave of austerity"". Praising the free school meals campaign led by footballer Marcus Rashford, Mr Swinney said: ""We must recognise that this is not just an issue for the very poorest. ""This is an issue for working families, forced to feed children from foodbanks or go hungry themselves."" How Marcus Rashford campaign changed free school meals for children in England Children who currently qualify for free school meals have been able to receive them during the holidays this year, amid concern about the impact of the pandemic. Meals were distributed in schools that remained opened or through direct cash or voucher payments. Mr Swinney said: ""Hunger doesn't take a holiday and so neither can we. ""Just as we extended free meals through the holidays this year and next, if re-elected we will extend free school meals through every school holidays. All primary school pupils. All classes. All year round."" Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said he was pleased Mr Swinney had decided to ""follow our lead"" on the free school meals policy. But he said there was no reason to wait two years to implement the programme. ""We can deliver this now, so our young people get the benefit as soon as possible,"" he said. ""As the SNP are now supportive of our policy, there is no reason why this can't pass through the Scottish Parliament as the priority it clearly is."" Meanwhile Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens' education spokesman, welcomed the SNP's adoption of ""half"" of the party's school meals policy. ""Hunger doesn't stop when a child goes to high school though, which is why we have always insisted that free school meals should be provided to all children and young people, at every stage of their education,"" he added. Nicola Sturgeon told delegates Scotland is ""on the cusp"" of making history The annual conference, which is being held virtually because of the pandemic, follows a decisive victory for the SNP in last December's general election in which it won 48 of the 59 available seats. Party activists will also be buoyed by a number of recent opinion polls suggesting a majority of Scots are now in favour of leaving the UK. The UK government's Scottish independence dilemma Why are more Scots supporting independence? Earlier Nicola Sturgeon opened the conference by telling delegates she has ""never been so certain"" that Scotland would become independent. Opposition parties say such a vote would be divisive, and the focus should be recovering from the Covid pandemic. And some within Ms Sturgeon's own party argue a ""Plan B"" is needed if the UK government refuses to agree to another referendum. What's going on with Scottish independence?

"Hospitals in England could become ""overwhelmed"" with Covid cases if MPs do not back new restrictions, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said. Many Tory MPs oppose the tougher tier system, which begins on 2 December. Butwriting in the Times,,externalMr Gove said MPs - who will vote on the measures next week - need to ""take responsibility for difficult decisions"". Labour is yet to decide whether it will support the new restrictions. It has warned, however, that areas in tier three will be stretched to ""breaking point"" without further financial support from the Treasury. It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours. Has England's lockdown worked? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? When England's four-week national lockdown ends on Wednesday, regions will be placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. Some MPs say the new system imposes tight restrictions on numerous areas with low cases, and are calling instead for a more localised approach. But Mr Gove has defended the new system, saying that, unless action to slow the spread of coronavirus is taken, the NHS could be ""broken"" and hospitals ""physically overwhelmed"". ""The tiers we had in place before the lockdown had not suppressed [Covid] sufficiently: they were neither strong enough to reduce social contact sufficiently, nor applied widely enough to contain the virus's spread,"" he wrote. He added that, across the UK, about 16,000 beds are filled with Covid-19 patients, compared to a peak in April of almost 20,000 and a low of 740 on 11 September. ""When the country is facing such a national crisis, the truth is that all of us who have been elected to Parliament, not just ministers, must take responsibility for difficult decisions,"" he said. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Irelandhas begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotlandeach area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford saidpubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions- which are not yet finalised - in the run up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith is among those questioning England's approach. On Friday, he asked ""what was the point of lockdown"" if England ends up with tighter restrictions than it had before the four-week national restrictions came into force. What are you allowed to do in each Covid tier? Mass testing a 'distraction' from vaccine rollout Several Conservative MPs have asked to see the data the government based its decision on. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Here in Dorset, we entered lockdown with pretty low figures. We're coming out of it with even lower figures. ""This last week we've gone down by a third. So we're really surprised to find ourselves in tier two."" Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, who represents South Thanet, which has the second highest rate of infection in the UK, said he will vote against the new ""draconian"" tiered restrictions. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think once areas see themselves going in the wrong direction, that actually has a very, very distinct affect on people's behaviour."" ""They almost self-regulate, they actually do take those space, hands, and all of those good things far more seriously."" But epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson, whose advice led to the decision to go into the first lockdown, told Today: ""I know people argue: 'well why are we going into more intensive measures now after lockdown than we were before?' ""And it's because we don't want to repeat the same mistakes made before this current lockdown and allow cases to rise exponentially again coming into Christmas - particularly in the context that we are going to have a relaxation over Christmas, which does pose some risks."" NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Breakfast those who run hospitals are ""worried about the fact that if those rules are too loose and if people go beyond them"" that ""could trigger a third phase"". He said the MPs making policy decisions are ""not epidemiologists, they're not experts about exactly what is the balance between loosening the restrictions and what might then follow - that's for the scientific experts, the epidemiologists"". ""The real problem is January is always the NHS' busiest time of year and therefore it is really important that people not only observe the rules,"" he said. On staffing in hospitals, he said it only takes a ""very, very small amount of sickness in particular areas"" among health workers to result in a ""pretty major problem"". ""If you have a single anaesthetist who is off, then that means 15, 20 other people who are meant to be doing an operation for somebody - that affects their work,"" he said. The new coronavirus tier restrictions will mean 55 million people will be banned from mixing with other households indoors. The tiers areas are in will be reviewed every 14 days, starting 16 December. Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: tier one:the rule of six applies everywhere, indoors and out tier two:the rule of six applies outdoors but there is no household mixing anywhere indoors tier three:can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces like parks, where the rule of six applies Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. People in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds will urge Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the Additional Restrictions Grant (ARG) in tier three areas following concerns the new rules will force some local authorities to stretch the grants further than others. Leaders in Lancashire have written to the PM's interim chief of staffsaying it is ""unfair"" that areas facing four weeks of restrictions under the lockdown received the same amount as they did for seven weeks. The one-off ARG funding equates to Â£20 per person in an area and is designed to help closed businesses that do not directly pay business rates, as well as those that do not have to close but are affected by restrictions. Ms Dodds is due to tell the party's online regional conference - Connected North West - on Saturday afternoon: ""It is completely irresponsible for the government to leave tier three areas in the lurch like this again."" A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said ""a host of other support measures"" have been made available.

"If you walk into a doughnut shop in California, the chances are it's owned by a Cambodian family. That's because of a refugee who built up an empire, and became known as the Donut King, only to lose it all. Ted Ngoy was a high school student in Phnom Penh when he first set eyes on Suganthini Khoeun, the daughter of a high-ranking government official. ""She was so beautiful,"" he remembers. ""You can't find any prettier woman besides her."" All the boys at his school were in love with her, and as a poor half-Chinese boy from a village near the Thai border he had no chance. ""She was powerful, like your royal princess,"" says Ted. And she was heavily chaperoned. But then Ted discovered that the tiny room where he lodged, on the fourth floor of a walk-up apartment block, overlooked Suganthini's villa. And he saw an opportunity. Every evening, he sat by his open window and played the flute. On hearing the music float across the quiet city, Suganthini's mother remarked that whoever was playing must be in love. One night, he saw Suganthini on her balcony, and decided it was time to make his move. He wrote a note, telling her that he lived in the building opposite and was the flute player. He wrapped the note around a stone, and threw it down. His gesture went unreciprocated for days. But then one of Suganthini's servants appeared at his door with a reply. ""The note said, 'I appreciate you blowing the flute. It's so amazing, so touching.' And then we started communicating, bringing back and forth the messages,"" Ted says. ""What happens if I decide to jump into your room?"" Ted wrote one day. Suganthini replied, ""Well be careful, if you don't jump into my room, you'll jump into my mum's room."" She thought Ted was joking, but he was serious. Despite the villa's armed security guards and guard dogs, one rainy night Ted climbed up a coconut tree and over the barbed wire and made his way in through a bathroom window. He took a chance and opened a bedroom door - and there was Suganthini, fast asleep. He woke her up and she was about to scream for help, when she realised it was her classmate. ""What are you doing here?"" she asked. ""Well, it is because I've fallen in love with you,"" Ted replied. ""But what shall we do in the morning? I have to go to school."" ""Don't worry, I will hide under your bed,"" said Ted. And that's what he did. Suganthini smuggled him food at night, and after many days she said she loved him too. They made a blood pact, promising to be forever faithful. He says he hid in her room for 45 days until he was discovered. Listen to Ted Ngoy on Outlook on the BBC World Service(produced by Maryam Maruf) Download the podcast for more extraordinary stories Ted's story is told in a new documentary,The Donut King,external Suganthini's family insisted Ted break it off by telling her he didn't love her. He did as he was told, but then pulled out a knife and stabbed himself, declaring he would rather die than live without her. While he was recovering in hospital, Suganthini also made an attempt on her life. Faced with such determination, her family allowed the young lovers to be together. ""It's a crazy story, but it's true,"" says Ted, now 78. ""I had true love for her."" But he admits he was also aware that conquering Suganthini's heart held out the promise of a better life. They married and started a family, and life was good until civil war broke out in 1970, between the government and the communist Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot. Ted, who spoke four languages, was offered a post as liaison officer in Thailand by Suganthini's brother-in-law, Gen Sak Sutsakhan. Instantly acquiring the rank of Major, Ted and his young family moved to Bangkok, and every month he travelled back to Cambodia to collect the wages for his soldiers. But the situation at home was increasingly dangerous and on his last trip, in April 1975, the capital fell. Ted managed to escape on the last flight out of Phnom Penh but Suganthini's parents were left behind. She later discovered that they were among the first to be executed by the Khmer Rouge. The following month, US President Gerald Ford insisted the US should welcome 130,000 refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia, telling any critics: ""We're a country built by immigrants from all areas of the world, and we've always been a very humanitarian nation."" Ted and Suganthini sold everything they had and arrived in California on one of the first refugee flights, with their three children, an adopted nephew and two nieces. The family were housed in a hastily erected refugee camp on a marine training base, Camp Pendleton. In order to be allowed to leave the camp and find work, they needed an American sponsor, who would find them a job and somewhere to live. For weeks, they watched other families leave, until finally they, too, were sponsored by a pastor from a church in Tustin, Orange County, about 35 miles south of Los Angeles. Ted worked as the church janitor but he soon realised earning $500 a month wouldn't be enough to support his family. With the pastor's permission he went out and got two more jobs, as a sales person from 6pm to 10pm and petrol attendant from 10pm to 6am. Next to the petrol station there was a doughnut shop called DK Donuts. It smelled delicious and when he first tasted one it reminded him of something from home - a fried pastry, also circular, callednom kong. ""It made me homesick,"" says Ted. All night long Ted would watch people buying coffee and doughnuts, and he realised it was a good business. One night he asked the woman at the counter if saving $3,000 would be enough to buy a doughnut shop. She said he would be throwing his money away. Instead, she told him about a training programme run by the doughnut chain, Winchell's. Ted became their first South East Asian trainee. ""I learned to bake, to take care of payroll, cleaning, sales - everything,"" he says. One of the tricks he learned was to bake doughnuts in small batches throughout the day to keep them fresh - and because the smell of baking was the best form of advertising. When he completed his three-month training, Winchell's gave him a shop to run on Balboa Pier, a tourist spot on the Newport peninsula not far from Tustin. Suganthini became the smiling face behind the counter, even though she hardly spoke any English. Ted did a lot of the baking at night, with his youngest son, Chris, collecting a light dusting of flour as he slept beside him in the kitchen. They saved money where they could, even washing and reusing coffee stirrers - until they were reprimanded by Winchell's. When there was an overrun of pink doughnut boxes Ted bought them cut-price, and the pink boxes became his trademark. The family worked 12 to 17 hours a day, with all hands on deck. At the weekend the oldest children, Chet and Savy, then nine and eight, helped out by pouring coffee, packing doughnuts and folding boxes. During the week they went to school, where sometimes they were so hungry they stole snacks from other kids' lunchboxes. In a year Ted had saved enough to put down a deposit on a second doughnut shop, a ""mom-and-pop"" shop called Christy's. Once again Suganthini was the friendly face welcoming customers, and when she became a US citizen she took the name Christy as her own. After a year of running two shops they had saved $40,000 and Ted decided to expand. He bought a bigger doughnut shop, and offered to lease the original Christy's to a family of Cambodian refugees, who had been working in fast food outlets on low wages. He trained them and handed over the keys. Ted began to look for more doughnut shops to buy and lease to fellow refugees. ""Using money to provide for others is a feeling as powerful as any drug,"" he later wrote. Working all hours, Ted and Christy knew very little about what was happening back home in Cambodia, but what they heard was bad. They cried and prayed for the family they had left behind. Under the Khmer Rouge leadership of Pol Pot people were forced to work on communal farms, and those with money or education were tortured and killed. Over four years nearly two million Cambodians were either executed, or died of starvation, disease and overwork. In 1978 Vietnamese troops invaded and in 1979 Pol Pot was overthrown, leading to another wave of Cambodian refugees. Ted's parents and sisters fled across the border to Thailand, and Ted got a call from the US embassy there asking if he would sponsor them to live in the US. Naturally he agreed, and set his sisters up with doughnut shops. More and more relatives came forward for sponsorship. ""Some of them were cousins, uncles, nieces,"" says Ted. ""But many of them were not related, they just lived in the same village or heard of my name. I think there's nothing wrong for them to lie to the embassy because everybody needs a chance to survive. So, I just did it. As many as I could."" Over the years, Ted and Christy sponsored more than 100 families, often hosting them before setting them up with homes, loans, and doughnut shops. Ted encouraged others to do the same. ""It went like fire on the hill, so fast,"" says Ted. The Cambodians worked hard and because the whole family pitched in, they did not have to pay out any wages. It provided a path for refugees to settle and was a profitable business model. Eventually Cambodians owned so many doughnut shops in California that they dominated the market, pushing Winchell's into second place. It's something Ted feels a bit bad about. ""They're a good company and I owe them gratitude,"" Ted says. ""Cambodian people owe them a lot."" By 1985, 10 years after arriving in the US as refugees, Ted and Christy were millionaires, owning around 60 doughnut shops. Ted became known as the Donut King - or Uncle Ted, because of the many Cambodian immigrants he'd sponsored. The couple had flash cars, bought a million-dollar mansion with a pool and an elevator, and went on holidays abroad. ""I achieved my American dream,"" Ted says. ""We were happy - until the gambling came to wreck my life. The gambling is sad, the saddest part of my life."" Ted's downfall was Las Vegas. The first few times he and Christy visited, on early family holidays, everything went well: they watched a magic show, they saw Elvis perform. But on a later trip Ted had a go on the blackjack tables, and soon he was hooked on the glamour and the adrenaline. ""Before I'd never gambled, but like all the compulsive gamblers in the world, first you throw in a couple of bucks, $10, $20. When time goes by it gets into your blood and you just cannot get it out,"" says Ted. Because he was a high roller the casinos put him up in $2,000-a-night suites and offered him VIP tickets to the best shows. He began to disappear off to Las Vegas for days, losing $5,000, $7,000 a game, and neglecting his family and his doughnut empire. ""I did not have time to take care of business, so business was going down. I did not have time to expand. That's a disaster,"" he says. Christy would search for him in the casinos, the children in tow. Ted remembers hiding from her behind the slot machines. Whenever Ted won, the family would rejoice with him. When he lost he would lash out, smashing doors, breaking furniture and frightening the children. Then he would return to Vegas in an attempt to win back what he had lost. ""The more you chase, the more it's gone,"" he says in a new documentary about his rise and fall, called The Donut King. ""It's a devil, it's a monster. It's a monster in me."" Christy always forgave him, but word got around that Ted could no longer be trusted. ""I became a very, very bad man and borrowed money here and there,"" he says. Some of those he borrowed from were the people he had leased doughnut shops to. When he lost their money he would just sign over the shop to them - without telling Christy, whose signature he forged. Ted did try to curb his habit. He joined Gamblers Anonymous but was back at the tables in no time. ""I cry. Everybody cry,"" he said. ""After cry, go back gambling,""he told one interviewer.,external Twice he joined a Buddhist monastery. He shaved his head and spent three months barefoot in Thailand, coming back emaciated and a changed man - or so he thought. But within weeks he was back on a plane to Vegas. ""It's impossible to explain that money had nothing to do with it. I was addicted to a feeling, and money was simply the needle that delivered the toxic dose,"" he writes in his autobiography, also called The Donut King. Eventually he and Christy were left with just one doughnut shop, which they decided to sell. Their youngest son Chris drove them there to pick up the money - but it went horribly wrong. Driving back with $85,000 cash in the boot of the car, they were stopped by the police; they had fallen behind with payments, so the car showed up as stolen. All three were taken to the police station but they were too scared to mention the cash in the boot. When they were released, the cash was gone. ""It's a very very sad story,"" says Ted. In 1993 Ted and Christy moved back to Cambodia. They had lost their beautiful home and their chain of shops, but still had enough money to live comfortably. Ted now had a new passion - politics. Cambodia was having its first democratic elections since the war and he wanted to stand for office to help rebuild his country. Besides, he reasoned, as a politician he would not be able to gamble. ""If I need the vote, I cannot gamble. When people know about the bad reputation, people are not going to vote for me. So I decided to change."" At the height of his success in the US he had been an ardent Republican, and an enthusiastic fundraiser for the party. He had met Richard Nixon, the former president, and Presidents Reagan and George HW Bush. So he named his own political party the Free Development Republican Party. But the name was misleading. It led many voters to assume, incorrectly, that he was against Cambodia's royal family, and he didn't win a seat. He was, however, invited to become a government adviser on commerce and agriculture. Cambodia was poor and under-developed after years of war. Inspired by the economic success of Taiwan, Ted decided to lobby the US for ""most favoured nation"" status, which would open the door to foreign investment. ""I spent about $100,000 of my own money, my time, my everything,"" he says. He lobbied his contacts in the Republican inner circle, including Senator John McCain, and MFN status was granted permanently in 1996. While Ted was immersed in Cambodian politics, Christy flew to the US for the birth of a grandchild. But while she was gone Ted had an affair. Devastated that he had broken their pact, she filed for divorce. By 2002 Ted was broke. He had spent all his money on electioneering and on a failed attempt to introduce a new type of hybridised rice, which he believed would improve yields. Then, after falling out with a powerful political rival he feared for his life and fled to the US. He landed in LA with less than $100 in his pocket - all the money he had left. His family didn't want to see him, and nobody offered him work, not even baking doughnuts. He had lost the respect of his family and community. It was a humbling experience, and the lowest point in his life. ""Many times I try to commit suicide because I hate myself. And then I hate the gambling and then I hate that I treat Christy so badly, treat my children so badly, because of the gambling, so I hate myself,"" he says. He moved from church to church, until an elderly Cambodian woman allowed him to live on the covered porch of her mobile home. ""If I need to shower, I knock on the door, 'Lady can I take a shower?' And she let me in to take a shower. Then when dinner is ready, she knocks on the door and I open the door to have dinner."" On Sundays he would go to the church where her son was the pastor and join in Bible studies. Ted became deeply religious. Still penniless, after nearly four years of exile, Ted flew back to Cambodia. Still homeless, he moved to the coastal town of Kep, on the Gulf of Thailand. He had no way of making a living until a Chinese contact from better days asked him to help out with a real estate deal. Ted negotiated well and got a good commission. More land deals followed and he has now worked his way back to being a millionaire. He remarried and had four more children - the youngest two are still at school. Ted kept a low profile until the LA filmmaker Alice Gu got in touch a couple of years ago. A child of immigrants herself, she had become curious why Californian doughnut shops were so often run by Cambodians, and why there were so many of them. In most of America there's an average of about one doughnut shop for every 30,000 people - in LA, there's one for every 7,000 people. And of the 5,000 independent doughnut shops in California today, around 80% are still Cambodian, she says. ""This story sheds light on refugees in a positive way, about what happens when they're given an opportunity,"" she says. ""Ultimately, this is a story of a guy who came to the country with nothing, and with some hustle, and dreams, and a little luck, really made quite a charmed life for himself."" Which he then threw away. Alice found it hard to persuade Ted to return to California for filming. He had burned a lot of bridges and at the time his children hardly spoke to him. ""He was afraid of being shunned and feeling lonely - but I forced him!"" she says. In the end, filming the documentary was a healing experience for Ted. Although there is still some resentment towards him in the Cambodian community, whose hard-earned cash he gambled away, he is also revered by many. He enjoyed meeting the younger generation of doughnut makers, who are innovating and inventing new flavours. He also apologised to many of those he hurt. Most importantly, the trip allowed him to mend relations with Christy, who has now remarried, and with their grown-up children. ""They forgive me fully. I told them I'm very sorry 1,000 times. Every time I met them I said, 'Sorry son, sorry my daughter, sorry Christy.' ""If you could turn the clock around, I would do that. The past I cannot change, but I learned the heavy way."" Christy has remarried and lives in the US He communicates with them almost every day. ""Everybody's happy to see me now, because I changed from the bad guy to the good guy."" Ted now sees that the same character traits that made him take bold risks in life also made it easy for him to fall prey to gambling. ""It is the purest form of risk-taking, the distilled anxiety and thrill behind every business decision and bold declaration of love,"" he writes in his autobiography. He credits his Christian faith with finally curing his gambling addiction, although he confesses he liked to bet on football games until last year. ""That's why I want to tell the world, 'Do not gamble.' When you hook up with gambling, your life's finished. You will end up destroying the whole family and no more relationship with the world, just finished. Gambling is a devil."" But in the end, he says, he beat it. ""I never back down. Never give up. Never surrender. Even in gambling. It took longer than 40 years. But I still win. At the end, I win.""

"Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed as a new health minister to oversee rollout of the Covid vaccine in England. The rollout is expected to begin before Christmas, subject to regulatory approval. Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, will oversee distribution of the vaccine until at least next summer. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""delighted"", adding in a tweet there was ""an enormous task ahead"". Under the interim arrangement, Mr Zahawi will serve as a joint minister between the health department and the business department, where he currently works. His primary focus will be on delivering the vaccine, with most areas of his business portfolio put aside. It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours. In a tweet,external, Mr Zahawi welcomed his new post but said the rollout would be a ""big responsibility and a big operational challenge"". He added that he was ""absolutely committed to making sure we can roll out vaccines quickly - saving lives and livelihoods and helping us #buildbackbetter"". How does the Oxford vaccine compare? How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Mr Zahawi will look after deployment of the vaccine in England only, but will work with the devolved administrations on their chosen approach. Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be responsible for the vaccine's distribution in their relevant nations. Currently, the UK government has placed orders for 100 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, 40 million doses of the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech and five million doses from US firm Moderna. Rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may pose the greatest challenge as it needs to be stored at minus 70C, raising potential difficulties with transport and storage. Nadhim Zahawi moved to the UK from Iraq with his family when he was nine years old In 2000 he co-founded online market research agency YouGov and was its chief executive until he was selected as a Conservative parliamentary candidate in 2010 He was first elected as Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon in May 2010 In 2011 he co-authored a book with fellow MP Matt Hancock, now the health secretary, on the human behaviour behind the banking crash - called ""Masters of Nothing"" In 2018 he became an education minister in Theresa May's government. Under Boris Johnson's premiership he was appointed as a business minister He is married and has three children Last week, the government asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, marking ""a significant first step"" in getting the vaccine ""approved for deployment"". It follows a similar referral to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) earlier this month to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which has been shown to stop more than 90% of people developing Covid-19 symptoms in preliminary trials. On Saturday,the Financial Times reported,externalthat regulatory approval for that vaccine could come as early as next week - and suggested rollout would start within hours of authorisation. Interim data from the trials of the Oxford jab showed an overall efficacy of 70%. The findings from one group of volunteers showed 62% efficacy while another group, who were given a different dose by accident, showed 90% efficacy. The Department of Health and Social Care said the UK would be one of the first countries in the world to receive the vaccine, if it is authorised, with AstraZeneca set to have as many as four million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year and 40 million by the end of March 2021. By Ellie Price, political reporter, BBC News In ministerial terms, it's a sideways move. But Nadhim Zahawi's new job comes with huge public expectation, and therefore the potential for political disaster. The government is only too aware of the bloody nose it has received as a result of the shortcomings of NHS Test and Trace programme and the procurement of PPE at the start of the pandemic. Government scientists have said, if proven to be safe and effective, mass vaccinations will offer a ""much better horizon"" by the spring. Hospitals and other NHS trusts in England say they have been told to get ready to administer jabs from the middle of December. The winter flu vaccine programme will offer some framework for how that will work in practice. Mr Zahawi is seen as a good media performer. He has a business background and helped to set up the polling group YouGov. He'll understand only too well the delicate art of keeping public opinion on side. Mr Zahawi's appointment follows calls from Labour for the government to appoint a vaccine minister, who would provide accountability and avoid repeating mistakes made over PPE procurement and NHS Test and Trace. Shadow health secretary John Ashworth said: ""Only days ago Labour called for a vaccines minister to oversee the huge logistical challenge of widespread vaccination. ""We now need a mass public health campaign urging uptake of the vaccine, alongside ensuring the resources are in place for GPs and other health professionals to rapidly roll this out as soon as possible."" In addition to the vaccine rollout, the prime minister has said mass community testing, as seen in Liverpool, will be offered to all areas in tier three after lockdown ends on 2 December. Earlier this week,Mr Zahawi tweeted,externalthat he was ""extremely disappointed and sad"" that Warwickshire, the county in which his constituency lies, would be placed in the most restricted tier - tier three - after England's national lockdown ends next week. He said he would be pushing for the county of Warwickshire to be considered separately from Coventry and Solihull in all future decisions about restrictions and for the rollout of mass testing - but urged residents ""to continue following the rules to the letter"" in the meantime.

"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech,the first to be approved in the UK. Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge. The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can befast-tracked for approvalif needed. No corners will be cut, with safety paramount. But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed. Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus. Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Common reactions,externalthat may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has beenlinked to very rare cases of blood clots,external. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients arelisted.,external There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past. That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Guidance,externalsays there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.

You also need to talk to a health professional to check that it is suitable. A protein-based booster vaccine made by Novavax, which works differently to the Pfizer and Moderna jabs, is also available. Moderna is hoping to launch a combinedflu and Covid vaccinein 2025 or 2026, afterthe jab passed a vital part of final-stage scientific checksin June 2024. Pfizer and BioNTech are testing a similar two-in-one mRNA vaccine against flu and Covid. If you have Covid, or think you might, the NHS recommendsdelaying vaccination until you feel better.,external It also advises postponing if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid, and cannot cause positive test results.

"When England went into a national lockdown on 5 November, it left behind a three-tiered system of restrictions designed to keep the virus under control. Now the system is returning - although with stricter rules and more areas in the toughest, third tier. So has the lockdown worked - and why was it necessary in the first place? Between 14 October, when the tiers were introduced, and 5 November when they were replaced, cases continued to rise across the country. The weekly number rose in every region - by half in London, more than three-quarters in the East of England and, in the South East and the West Midlands, it more than doubled. In the North West and North East, though, cases began to level off, rising by only 6% and 10% respectively. It suggests the highest tier may have had some impact - the North West, where cases rose the least, was largely in tier three. But tier two had little effect in most of the country, while in many tier-one areas - particularly in the South East - cases rose quickly. The government's independent advisers, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) concluded: ""Tier-one measures alone are not enough to prevent the epidemic from growing rapidly."" It estimated cases could shrink by a ""modest"" 10% when moving from tier one to tier two. And even for tier three - as it stood before 5 November (less stringent than it will be from 2 December) - it was ""unclear"" whether those restrictions alone would be enough to cause the epidemic to shrink ""at a regional or national level"". Case numbers did fall in some areas under the tier system, at a more local level. For example, in Manchester and Liverpool they fell by about a third and a half respectively. Labour and Conservative MPs have criticised the government for not factoring in the differences in rates within regions when assigning tiers - putting the whole of the North East into tier three, for example. Liverpool was in tier three before the national lockdown began but will now be in tier two This picture of generally rising cases sets the scene for why the government might have felt a second lockdown was necessary. Beyond the over-arching aim of ensuring that numbers falling ill are as low as possible, case numbers need to be reasonably low for the test-and-trace system to have a shot at controlling the epidemic. According to Sage: ""Test and trace, including mass testing, is most effective when prevalence is low. Even the most effective test-and-trace system will have little impact when caseloads are high."" And the lockdown does appear to have turned the tide in most of the country. Cases fell by about a third in the North East and South West, and about a half in the North West and in Yorkshire and the Humber. But case numbers take much longer to fall than they do to rise. One estimate suggested for every day of cases increasing, it could take five days for them to come back down again. You can see this in the figures. Whereas some areas' cases more than doubled while the tier system was in place, the most dramatic falls under lockdown were only half that rate over the same period. In London, the South East and in the East of England, cases remained virtually static - rising at first immediately after lockdown, perhaps because of pre-lockdown socialising, before starting to decline slightly. But the government has judged that there are now enough cases to return the country to restrictions that, while slightly looser than in the lockdown, are tougher within each tier than they were before it. Fears of what a lockdown in the run-up to Christmas might do to already-struggling shops and restaurants are likely to have been in the prime minister's mind. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the new tiers have been based on factors that include numbers of positive tests and the pressures on the NHS. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock sets out England's new coronavirus tier system The government is also looking at the numbers involving people aged over 60 and the rate at which cases are rising or falling. But if you plot every local area on a graph, it's clear the the overall number of cases per 100,000 people is the main deciding factor. The regions with the highest number of cases are generally in tier three, those in the middle in tier two and those with the lowest number of cases are in tier one. That's why, for example, the North East is in tier three and London in tier two, even though the region has had a much bigger fall in cases, comparatively, than the capital. The North East still has almost twice the number of cases that London has. It is thought that there won't be much movement between tiers before Christmas.

"Cosy rooms packed with people chatting, laughing and sharing food and drink are traditional at this time of year. Unfortunately, they are also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. Now, plans for coronavirus restrictions to be eased for Christmas have been scaled back, or abandoned in areas with the toughest restrictions. So, for people still planning to meet others - subject to the rules - here are some of the key things to help avoid giving the unwelcome gift of coronavirus. No-one will be popular for saying this, but the evidence is clear - the larger the group, the greater the risk. If it was summer and we could meet outside, where the virus gets dispersed in fresh air, it would be less of a problem. But it's winter, so everyone's inside. And the more people who are involved, the greater the likelihood that someone may be a carrier of the virus - maybe without realising, as they have no symptoms. A study by Sage,,externalthe government's science advisory panel, concludes that if you double the number of people getting together, the odds of infection increase fourfold. It also matters how many different households are meeting, as this increases the potential for the virus to spread. The rules have changed. Intier four areas(that's London and much of the south-east of England), you can't meet people from other households indoors unless they're part of an existing support bubble. And you aren't allowed to travel to other tiers to meet family and friends. In the other tiers in England, up to three households can meet (subject to social distancing rules), but for Christmas Day only. In Scotland, up to three households (a maximum of eight people, not including children under 12) can only meet on 25 December. In Wales the limit is two households for Christmas Day only. In Northern Ireland, up to three households can meet for one day only between 23-27 December. What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? A modern browser with Javascript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Passing around dishes and bottles, encouraging everyone to tuck in, is one of the most natural instincts at Christmas. But coronavirus can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated. The same applies to board games where everyone's touching the dice and the cards, soSage recommends playing quiz-style games instead,external. It suggests keeping hand sanitiser by the front door and urging everyone arriving to use it. Above all, don't hug granny. ""Elbow bumps or air greetings"" are a safer alternative. Seven things that may be different this Christmas Amid the excitement of reunions, it's perfectly normal for voices to be raised. Add a little alcohol, and maybe have a TV or music on as well, and things can get even noisier. But if someone is infected, the louder they speak, the more virus they release. A lot of research,externalshows that when voices are projected, people emit more tiny droplets of the kind that can carry the coronavirus. So the advice is to avoid singing and dancing. At the very least, try keep those activities quiet or consider wearing masks. Maybe the safest option is to hum Silent Night. Popping in for a quick visit is safer than lingering over dinner for several hours. Researchers say an event's duration has a big impact on the infection risk. In March, more than 50 members of a US choir were confirmed or suspected of being infected, after a two-and-a-half-hour rehearsal session. Scientists reckoned,externalif it had lasted less than an hour, the number of infections would have been reduced by more than half. Prof Cath Noakes, one of the study's authors, says the problem is that tiny particles carrying the virus - known as aerosols - can accumulate in the air: ""There is growing evidence that if you're in a poorly-ventilated space for a long period of time with people who are infected, you may breathe in those aerosols and that might be one of the routes of infection,"" she said. So the recommendation is to plan for shorter events and to try to maximise quality time together. The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A Sage report,externalsays the infection risk can be four times greater without proper ventilation. And in this context, ""ventilation"" doesn't mean having fans blowing the air around, but a flow of air from outside. Open up for 10-20 minutes every hour, the report says. According to Prof Noakes, people must dream up creative new options for Christmas That could range from meeting virtually on Zoom, going for a walk, or even delaying big gatherings until next summer. If you are having a meal indoors, try to minimise contact with others for 7-14 days beforehand. Work out a plan for how to minimise the risks - and maybe put up signs or labels to remind people. Also try to avoid having people from different households sitting opposite each other, because speaking face-to-face is another possible route for transmission. The smaller the home, the harder these measures will be, the Sage advisers acknowledge. And laying on hand sanitiser and paying for additional heating while the windows are open may not be affordable for many people. But any social setting increases the risk of infection, says Prof Noakes, and we will have to compromise and do things in a different way. ""The virus doesn't know it's Christmas,"" she says. ""It's just a virus and it thrives on human contact."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one?

"Arcadia is ""an object lesson in what happens if you don't stay relevant"", said Lord Rose Breaking up the Arcadia retail empire, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is ""the only way"" forward as it faces collapse, its former chief executive said. Lord Rose, now chairman of Ocado, said ""people will come and pick over the carcass"" but not all the brands and infrastructure are likely to sell. ""If you aren't relevant, you're probably going to die,"" he said. Administrators could be appointed on Monday, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Lord Rose, who was chief executive of Arcadia until it was bought by retail tycoon Sir Philip Green in 2002, said the company had been ""caught out"" by the ""relentless pace of change"" in retail, which was only made worse by the Covid-19 crisis. ""Sadly what will happen is people will come and pick over the carcass,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that there were ""some tastier bits of the carcass"" - such as Topshop - and ""some less tasty bits of the carcass"". ""I just hope that someone will pick up some of the pieces, that some jobs are salvageable,"" he said. Topshop owner Arcadia on brink of collapse Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was The 'king of the High Street's' biggest challenge Arcadia would be the biggest British corporate collapse of the pandemic if it enters voluntary liquidation, analysts said. They said that if a large part of its 500 shops were forced to close, it would hollow out a huge swathe of the UK High Street. But the shops are expected to continue to trade if administrators are called in, as buyers are sought for the company or its individual brands. Lord Rose said he did not want to ""demonise"" Sir Philip, but said the controversial businessman had ""not moved from an analogue world to a digital world fast enough"", blaming that on a likely lack of investment over 10 or 15 years. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? ""It's a very, very tough place out there in the retail high street at the moment,"" said Lord Rose, who also led Marks & Spencer for more than six years. ""There is very little room for manoeuvre, we've got a whole load of pressures in the sector and I'm afraid if you aren't relevant, you're probably going to die."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said that while Topshop is deemed to have some value as a brand, insiders are less optimistic about the appeal of Wallis Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Burton to buyers. Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct and owner of House of Fraser, has been suggested as one possible buyer for some of the brands, he said. According toa report from Sky News,external, Mr Ashley's Frasers Group offered a Â£50m loan to Arcadia on Saturday. But the BBC understands that Arcadia has not yet received a direct approach and a source close to the situation described the offer as a ""non-starter"". If part or all of the company is sold, the proceeds would be likely to end up in the Arcadia pension fund, which is hundreds of millions of pounds in deficit and would have a priority claim on the company's assets. Lord Rose said Arcadia teetering on the brink of collapse was jut one aspect of a ""sector-wide malaise that's been accelerated by the problems with Covid"". There are forecasts of 20,000 shops closing and 250,000 retail jobs being lost, he said. Menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business on Friday and earlier this month fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. ""If we don't get back to normality we're going to have more than 2.5m people unemployed, we're going to have really difficult times on the high street, and that is a real, real problem,"" Lord Rose said. Retail consultant Kate Hardcastle said Arcadia's brands had been ""suffering for years through under-investment"" while paying out large dividends. She told the BBC that store closures could have a ""knock-on effect"" which ""casts a shadow"" on other high street retailers by reducing the overall footfall. The future of the Arcadia brands is in developing an e-commerce presence ""rather than just bricks-and-mortar stores"", Ms Hardcastle said. Arcadia has acknowledged that the pandemic had ""a material impact on trading across our businesses"". Sir Philip had been in talks with potential lenders about borrowing Â£30m to help the business get through Christmas. Those talks collapsed and the company said it was ""working on a number of contingency options to secure the future of the group's brands"". But Arcadia had also been struggling against online competition from companies such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing, as well as high street brands such as Zara which have invested heavily in their digital business. In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn.

"If you walk into a doughnut shop in California, the chances are it's owned by a Cambodian family. That's because of a refugee who built up an empire, and became known as the Donut King, only to lose it all. Ted Ngoy was a high school student in Phnom Penh when he first set eyes on Suganthini Khoeun, the daughter of a high-ranking government official. ""She was so beautiful,"" he remembers. ""You can't find any prettier woman besides her."" All the boys at his school were in love with her, and as a poor half-Chinese boy from a village near the Thai border he had no chance. ""She was powerful, like your royal princess,"" says Ted. And she was heavily chaperoned. But then Ted discovered that the tiny room where he lodged, on the fourth floor of a walk-up apartment block, overlooked Suganthini's villa. And he saw an opportunity. Every evening, he sat by his open window and played the flute. On hearing the music float across the quiet city, Suganthini's mother remarked that whoever was playing must be in love. One night, he saw Suganthini on her balcony, and decided it was time to make his move. He wrote a note, telling her that he lived in the building opposite and was the flute player. He wrapped the note around a stone, and threw it down. His gesture went unreciprocated for days. But then one of Suganthini's servants appeared at his door with a reply. ""The note said, 'I appreciate you blowing the flute. It's so amazing, so touching.' And then we started communicating, bringing back and forth the messages,"" Ted says. ""What happens if I decide to jump into your room?"" Ted wrote one day. Suganthini replied, ""Well be careful, if you don't jump into my room, you'll jump into my mum's room."" She thought Ted was joking, but he was serious. Despite the villa's armed security guards and guard dogs, one rainy night Ted climbed up a coconut tree and over the barbed wire and made his way in through a bathroom window. He took a chance and opened a bedroom door - and there was Suganthini, fast asleep. He woke her up and she was about to scream for help, when she realised it was her classmate. ""What are you doing here?"" she asked. ""Well, it is because I've fallen in love with you,"" Ted replied. ""But what shall we do in the morning? I have to go to school."" ""Don't worry, I will hide under your bed,"" said Ted. And that's what he did. Suganthini smuggled him food at night, and after many days she said she loved him too. They made a blood pact, promising to be forever faithful. He says he hid in her room for 45 days until he was discovered. Listen to Ted Ngoy on Outlook on the BBC World Service(produced by Maryam Maruf) Download the podcast for more extraordinary stories Ted's story is told in a new documentary,The Donut King,external Suganthini's family insisted Ted break it off by telling her he didn't love her. He did as he was told, but then pulled out a knife and stabbed himself, declaring he would rather die than live without her. While he was recovering in hospital, Suganthini also made an attempt on her life. Faced with such determination, her family allowed the young lovers to be together. ""It's a crazy story, but it's true,"" says Ted, now 78. ""I had true love for her."" But he admits he was also aware that conquering Suganthini's heart held out the promise of a better life. They married and started a family, and life was good until civil war broke out in 1970, between the government and the communist Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot. Ted, who spoke four languages, was offered a post as liaison officer in Thailand by Suganthini's brother-in-law, Gen Sak Sutsakhan. Instantly acquiring the rank of Major, Ted and his young family moved to Bangkok, and every month he travelled back to Cambodia to collect the wages for his soldiers. But the situation at home was increasingly dangerous and on his last trip, in April 1975, the capital fell. Ted managed to escape on the last flight out of Phnom Penh but Suganthini's parents were left behind. She later discovered that they were among the first to be executed by the Khmer Rouge. The following month, US President Gerald Ford insisted the US should welcome 130,000 refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia, telling any critics: ""We're a country built by immigrants from all areas of the world, and we've always been a very humanitarian nation."" Ted and Suganthini sold everything they had and arrived in California on one of the first refugee flights, with their three children, an adopted nephew and two nieces. The family were housed in a hastily erected refugee camp on a marine training base, Camp Pendleton. In order to be allowed to leave the camp and find work, they needed an American sponsor, who would find them a job and somewhere to live. For weeks, they watched other families leave, until finally they, too, were sponsored by a pastor from a church in Tustin, Orange County, about 35 miles south of Los Angeles. Ted worked as the church janitor but he soon realised earning $500 a month wouldn't be enough to support his family. With the pastor's permission he went out and got two more jobs, as a sales person from 6pm to 10pm and petrol attendant from 10pm to 6am. Next to the petrol station there was a doughnut shop called DK Donuts. It smelled delicious and when he first tasted one it reminded him of something from home - a fried pastry, also circular, callednom kong. ""It made me homesick,"" says Ted. All night long Ted would watch people buying coffee and doughnuts, and he realised it was a good business. One night he asked the woman at the counter if saving $3,000 would be enough to buy a doughnut shop. She said he would be throwing his money away. Instead, she told him about a training programme run by the doughnut chain, Winchell's. Ted became their first South East Asian trainee. ""I learned to bake, to take care of payroll, cleaning, sales - everything,"" he says. One of the tricks he learned was to bake doughnuts in small batches throughout the day to keep them fresh - and because the smell of baking was the best form of advertising. When he completed his three-month training, Winchell's gave him a shop to run on Balboa Pier, a tourist spot on the Newport peninsula not far from Tustin. Suganthini became the smiling face behind the counter, even though she hardly spoke any English. Ted did a lot of the baking at night, with his youngest son, Chris, collecting a light dusting of flour as he slept beside him in the kitchen. They saved money where they could, even washing and reusing coffee stirrers - until they were reprimanded by Winchell's. When there was an overrun of pink doughnut boxes Ted bought them cut-price, and the pink boxes became his trademark. The family worked 12 to 17 hours a day, with all hands on deck. At the weekend the oldest children, Chet and Savy, then nine and eight, helped out by pouring coffee, packing doughnuts and folding boxes. During the week they went to school, where sometimes they were so hungry they stole snacks from other kids' lunchboxes. In a year Ted had saved enough to put down a deposit on a second doughnut shop, a ""mom-and-pop"" shop called Christy's. Once again Suganthini was the friendly face welcoming customers, and when she became a US citizen she took the name Christy as her own. After a year of running two shops they had saved $40,000 and Ted decided to expand. He bought a bigger doughnut shop, and offered to lease the original Christy's to a family of Cambodian refugees, who had been working in fast food outlets on low wages. He trained them and handed over the keys. Ted began to look for more doughnut shops to buy and lease to fellow refugees. ""Using money to provide for others is a feeling as powerful as any drug,"" he later wrote. Working all hours, Ted and Christy knew very little about what was happening back home in Cambodia, but what they heard was bad. They cried and prayed for the family they had left behind. Under the Khmer Rouge leadership of Pol Pot people were forced to work on communal farms, and those with money or education were tortured and killed. Over four years nearly two million Cambodians were either executed, or died of starvation, disease and overwork. In 1978 Vietnamese troops invaded and in 1979 Pol Pot was overthrown, leading to another wave of Cambodian refugees. Ted's parents and sisters fled across the border to Thailand, and Ted got a call from the US embassy there asking if he would sponsor them to live in the US. Naturally he agreed, and set his sisters up with doughnut shops. More and more relatives came forward for sponsorship. ""Some of them were cousins, uncles, nieces,"" says Ted. ""But many of them were not related, they just lived in the same village or heard of my name. I think there's nothing wrong for them to lie to the embassy because everybody needs a chance to survive. So, I just did it. As many as I could."" Over the years, Ted and Christy sponsored more than 100 families, often hosting them before setting them up with homes, loans, and doughnut shops. Ted encouraged others to do the same. ""It went like fire on the hill, so fast,"" says Ted. The Cambodians worked hard and because the whole family pitched in, they did not have to pay out any wages. It provided a path for refugees to settle and was a profitable business model. Eventually Cambodians owned so many doughnut shops in California that they dominated the market, pushing Winchell's into second place. It's something Ted feels a bit bad about. ""They're a good company and I owe them gratitude,"" Ted says. ""Cambodian people owe them a lot."" By 1985, 10 years after arriving in the US as refugees, Ted and Christy were millionaires, owning around 60 doughnut shops. Ted became known as the Donut King - or Uncle Ted, because of the many Cambodian immigrants he'd sponsored. The couple had flash cars, bought a million-dollar mansion with a pool and an elevator, and went on holidays abroad. ""I achieved my American dream,"" Ted says. ""We were happy - until the gambling came to wreck my life. The gambling is sad, the saddest part of my life."" Ted's downfall was Las Vegas. The first few times he and Christy visited, on early family holidays, everything went well: they watched a magic show, they saw Elvis perform. But on a later trip Ted had a go on the blackjack tables, and soon he was hooked on the glamour and the adrenaline. ""Before I'd never gambled, but like all the compulsive gamblers in the world, first you throw in a couple of bucks, $10, $20. When time goes by it gets into your blood and you just cannot get it out,"" says Ted. Because he was a high roller the casinos put him up in $2,000-a-night suites and offered him VIP tickets to the best shows. He began to disappear off to Las Vegas for days, losing $5,000, $7,000 a game, and neglecting his family and his doughnut empire. ""I did not have time to take care of business, so business was going down. I did not have time to expand. That's a disaster,"" he says. Christy would search for him in the casinos, the children in tow. Ted remembers hiding from her behind the slot machines. Whenever Ted won, the family would rejoice with him. When he lost he would lash out, smashing doors, breaking furniture and frightening the children. Then he would return to Vegas in an attempt to win back what he had lost. ""The more you chase, the more it's gone,"" he says in a new documentary about his rise and fall, called The Donut King. ""It's a devil, it's a monster. It's a monster in me."" Christy always forgave him, but word got around that Ted could no longer be trusted. ""I became a very, very bad man and borrowed money here and there,"" he says. Some of those he borrowed from were the people he had leased doughnut shops to. When he lost their money he would just sign over the shop to them - without telling Christy, whose signature he forged. Ted did try to curb his habit. He joined Gamblers Anonymous but was back at the tables in no time. ""I cry. Everybody cry,"" he said. ""After cry, go back gambling,""he told one interviewer.,external Twice he joined a Buddhist monastery. He shaved his head and spent three months barefoot in Thailand, coming back emaciated and a changed man - or so he thought. But within weeks he was back on a plane to Vegas. ""It's impossible to explain that money had nothing to do with it. I was addicted to a feeling, and money was simply the needle that delivered the toxic dose,"" he writes in his autobiography, also called The Donut King. Eventually he and Christy were left with just one doughnut shop, which they decided to sell. Their youngest son Chris drove them there to pick up the money - but it went horribly wrong. Driving back with $85,000 cash in the boot of the car, they were stopped by the police; they had fallen behind with payments, so the car showed up as stolen. All three were taken to the police station but they were too scared to mention the cash in the boot. When they were released, the cash was gone. ""It's a very very sad story,"" says Ted. In 1993 Ted and Christy moved back to Cambodia. They had lost their beautiful home and their chain of shops, but still had enough money to live comfortably. Ted now had a new passion - politics. Cambodia was having its first democratic elections since the war and he wanted to stand for office to help rebuild his country. Besides, he reasoned, as a politician he would not be able to gamble. ""If I need the vote, I cannot gamble. When people know about the bad reputation, people are not going to vote for me. So I decided to change."" At the height of his success in the US he had been an ardent Republican, and an enthusiastic fundraiser for the party. He had met Richard Nixon, the former president, and Presidents Reagan and George HW Bush. So he named his own political party the Free Development Republican Party. But the name was misleading. It led many voters to assume, incorrectly, that he was against Cambodia's royal family, and he didn't win a seat. He was, however, invited to become a government adviser on commerce and agriculture. Cambodia was poor and under-developed after years of war. Inspired by the economic success of Taiwan, Ted decided to lobby the US for ""most favoured nation"" status, which would open the door to foreign investment. ""I spent about $100,000 of my own money, my time, my everything,"" he says. He lobbied his contacts in the Republican inner circle, including Senator John McCain, and MFN status was granted permanently in 1996. While Ted was immersed in Cambodian politics, Christy flew to the US for the birth of a grandchild. But while she was gone Ted had an affair. Devastated that he had broken their pact, she filed for divorce. By 2002 Ted was broke. He had spent all his money on electioneering and on a failed attempt to introduce a new type of hybridised rice, which he believed would improve yields. Then, after falling out with a powerful political rival he feared for his life and fled to the US. He landed in LA with less than $100 in his pocket - all the money he had left. His family didn't want to see him, and nobody offered him work, not even baking doughnuts. He had lost the respect of his family and community. It was a humbling experience, and the lowest point in his life. ""Many times I try to commit suicide because I hate myself. And then I hate the gambling and then I hate that I treat Christy so badly, treat my children so badly, because of the gambling, so I hate myself,"" he says. He moved from church to church, until an elderly Cambodian woman allowed him to live on the covered porch of her mobile home. ""If I need to shower, I knock on the door, 'Lady can I take a shower?' And she let me in to take a shower. Then when dinner is ready, she knocks on the door and I open the door to have dinner."" On Sundays he would go to the church where her son was the pastor and join in Bible studies. Ted became deeply religious. Still penniless, after nearly four years of exile, Ted flew back to Cambodia. Still homeless, he moved to the coastal town of Kep, on the Gulf of Thailand. He had no way of making a living until a Chinese contact from better days asked him to help out with a real estate deal. Ted negotiated well and got a good commission. More land deals followed and he has now worked his way back to being a millionaire. He remarried and had four more children - the youngest two are still at school. Ted kept a low profile until the LA filmmaker Alice Gu got in touch a couple of years ago. A child of immigrants herself, she had become curious why Californian doughnut shops were so often run by Cambodians, and why there were so many of them. In most of America there's an average of about one doughnut shop for every 30,000 people - in LA, there's one for every 7,000 people. And of the 5,000 independent doughnut shops in California today, around 80% are still Cambodian, she says. ""This story sheds light on refugees in a positive way, about what happens when they're given an opportunity,"" she says. ""Ultimately, this is a story of a guy who came to the country with nothing, and with some hustle, and dreams, and a little luck, really made quite a charmed life for himself."" Which he then threw away. Alice found it hard to persuade Ted to return to California for filming. He had burned a lot of bridges and at the time his children hardly spoke to him. ""He was afraid of being shunned and feeling lonely - but I forced him!"" she says. In the end, filming the documentary was a healing experience for Ted. Although there is still some resentment towards him in the Cambodian community, whose hard-earned cash he gambled away, he is also revered by many. He enjoyed meeting the younger generation of doughnut makers, who are innovating and inventing new flavours. He also apologised to many of those he hurt. Most importantly, the trip allowed him to mend relations with Christy, who has now remarried, and with their grown-up children. ""They forgive me fully. I told them I'm very sorry 1,000 times. Every time I met them I said, 'Sorry son, sorry my daughter, sorry Christy.' ""If you could turn the clock around, I would do that. The past I cannot change, but I learned the heavy way."" Christy has remarried and lives in the US He communicates with them almost every day. ""Everybody's happy to see me now, because I changed from the bad guy to the good guy."" Ted now sees that the same character traits that made him take bold risks in life also made it easy for him to fall prey to gambling. ""It is the purest form of risk-taking, the distilled anxiety and thrill behind every business decision and bold declaration of love,"" he writes in his autobiography. He credits his Christian faith with finally curing his gambling addiction, although he confesses he liked to bet on football games until last year. ""That's why I want to tell the world, 'Do not gamble.' When you hook up with gambling, your life's finished. You will end up destroying the whole family and no more relationship with the world, just finished. Gambling is a devil."" But in the end, he says, he beat it. ""I never back down. Never give up. Never surrender. Even in gambling. It took longer than 40 years. But I still win. At the end, I win.""

"This video can not be played John Swinney made the pledge in a speech to the virtual SNP conference The SNP has pledged to expand free school meals to all primary school pupils in Scotland. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said if the party retains power after the Holyrood elections in May, it would fund free breakfasts and lunches for all children in P1-P7. He told the SNP conference that the scheme would also run in the school holidays - not just term time. The Scottish Conservatives announceda similar policy,externalin September. However the Scottish Greens said free school meals should be provided in high school as well as primary school. Currently all pupils in P1 to P3 in Scotland are entitled to free school lunches. They are also available to older children whose parents are in receipt of certain benefits. The SNP's scheme is expected to cost Â£230m a year. It would be implemented from August 2022, making Scotland the first nation in the UK to offer universal free primary school meals. Mr Swinney made the commitment as he warned that Scotland was facing a ""tsunami of child poverty"" if UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak imposes a ""second wave of austerity"". Praising the free school meals campaign led by footballer Marcus Rashford, Mr Swinney said: ""We must recognise that this is not just an issue for the very poorest. ""This is an issue for working families, forced to feed children from foodbanks or go hungry themselves."" How Marcus Rashford campaign changed free school meals for children in England Children who currently qualify for free school meals have been able to receive them during the holidays this year, amid concern about the impact of the pandemic. Meals were distributed in schools that remained opened or through direct cash or voucher payments. Mr Swinney said: ""Hunger doesn't take a holiday and so neither can we. ""Just as we extended free meals through the holidays this year and next, if re-elected we will extend free school meals through every school holidays. All primary school pupils. All classes. All year round."" Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said he was pleased Mr Swinney had decided to ""follow our lead"" on the free school meals policy. But he said there was no reason to wait two years to implement the programme. ""We can deliver this now, so our young people get the benefit as soon as possible,"" he said. ""As the SNP are now supportive of our policy, there is no reason why this can't pass through the Scottish Parliament as the priority it clearly is."" Meanwhile Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens' education spokesman, welcomed the SNP's adoption of ""half"" of the party's school meals policy. ""Hunger doesn't stop when a child goes to high school though, which is why we have always insisted that free school meals should be provided to all children and young people, at every stage of their education,"" he added. Nicola Sturgeon told delegates Scotland is ""on the cusp"" of making history The annual conference, which is being held virtually because of the pandemic, follows a decisive victory for the SNP in last December's general election in which it won 48 of the 59 available seats. Party activists will also be buoyed by a number of recent opinion polls suggesting a majority of Scots are now in favour of leaving the UK. The UK government's Scottish independence dilemma Why are more Scots supporting independence? Earlier Nicola Sturgeon opened the conference by telling delegates she has ""never been so certain"" that Scotland would become independent. Opposition parties say such a vote would be divisive, and the focus should be recovering from the Covid pandemic.

"The plant has pinkish-white flowers in summer A rare plant has reappeared after more than a century in hiding. The pinkish-flowered plant, known as grass-poly, was found growing on the banks of an old farmland pond in Norfolk. The mystery species ""came back from the dead"" after seeds submerged in the mud were disturbed during work to restore the pond. And scientists say conservation efforts could lead to the return of other long-forgotten botanical gems. Carl Sayer, a professor at University College London (UCL), stumbled on the plant when he went to survey the pond at Heydon shortly after the first national lockdown ended. Treasure trove of new plants revealed Having never seen anything like it before, he quickly snapped a picture, which he sent to local botanist Dr Jo Parmenter. She identified it as grass-poly, one of the rarest plants in the UK. ""It's really quite beautiful,"" says Prof Sayer. ""We only found a handful of these plants in the pond but we're hoping to cultivate this population and keep it going and expand it now we know it's there."" Grass-poly is a short, annual plant, growing up to 20cm in height Dr Jo Parmenter was thrilled to see the photo of the plant. ""I never ever expected to see it in Norfolk; it was quite extraordinary,"" she says. ""I saw a photo and straight away I thought, I know what you are."" The last confirmed record for grass-poly (Lythrum hyssopifolia) in Norfolk dates to more than a century ago. Elsewhere in the UK, the plant is found in a few isolated populations growing around lakes and on muddy open ground. At Heydon, the seeds of the plant remained buried in the mud, like a ""time capsule"".  When willows were pulled out to restore the pond, this disturbed the soil and let in light, allowing the seeds to germinate. ""There's no oxygen, it's very dark, and it's perfect for preserving seeds,"" says Prof Sayer, who is part of UCL's Pond Restoration Research Group. The discovery shows plants believed extinct can be brought ""back to life"" with good conservation, he added. 'Ghost pond' being restored. Before... ..And after Centuries ago, there were thousands of ponds in Norfolk, but many have been neglected, becoming what are known as ""ghost ponds"". There may be other populations of the plant in Norfolk that have so far been overlooked, says UCL researcher Helen Greaves. ""Could further pond restorations bring back more plants?"" she asks. ""Either way, finding this elegant little plant may provide an important and unexpected new focus for our Norfolk Ponds Project."" Dr Parmenter says this has been an ""amazing"" year for plants, with many unusual discoveries. She puts that down partly to the pandemic, with more people going out on local walks. ""I think it's taught us to appreciate the things local to us, as well as the glamorous and exotic,"" she says. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Students of Iran's Basij paramilitary force rallied in front of the foreign ministry in Tehran Iran's president has blamed Israel for the killing of a top nuclear scientist on Friday, and said it would not slow down the country's nuclear programme. Hassan Rouhani also said Iran would retaliate over Mohsen Fakhrizadeh's killing at a time of its choosing. An Israeli cabinet minister said he had ""no clue"" who was behind the ambush by gunmen on Mr Fakhrizadeh's car. Israel has previously accused the physicist of being key to a covert nuclear weapons programme. Fakhrizadeh was Iran's most renowned nuclear scientist, who headed the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation. His killing threatens to escalate tensions over Iran's nuclear programme with the US and its close ally Israel. What were the motives behind the killing? Country profile: Iran,external Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words President Rouhani said on Saturday his country would respond ""in due course"" but that Fakhrizadeh's killing would not push Iran into making hasty decisions. ""Iran's enemies should know that the people of Iran and officials are braver than to leave this criminal act unanswered,"" he said in a televised cabinet meeting. ""In due time, they will answer for this crime,"" he added. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, pictured in an undated photo, was head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation In an earlier statement, the president accused the ""the mercenaries of the oppressive Zionist regime"" - referring to Israel - of being behind the attack. ""The assassination of martyr Fakhrizadeh shows our enemies' despair and the depth of their hatred... His martyrdom will not slow down our achievements."" Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also called for the ""punishing"" of the perpetrators of the attack ""and those who commanded it"", in a tweet on Saturday. His military adviser, Hossein Dehghan, had earlier vowed to ""strike"" the attackers like thunder. This video can not be played The road near Tehran where gunmen opened fire on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh The New York Times quotes three US officials, including two intelligence officials, as sayingIsrael was behind the attack,external. But Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi said on Saturday that he had ""no clue"" who was behind the killing. Fakhrizadeh's name was specifically mentioned in Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation about Iran's nuclear programme in April 2018. Israeli embassies around the world have been placed on high alert, according to Israel's N12 news website on Saturday. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called on the international community to ""condemn this act of state terror"". News of the killing comes amid fresh concern about the increased amount of enriched uranium that Iran is producing. Enriched uranium is a vital component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. A 2015 deal with six world powers had placed limits on Iran's production of enriched uranium, but since US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, Iran has been deliberately reneging on its agreements. However, it insists its nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. Joe Biden has pledged to re-engage with Iran when he becomes US president in January, despite long-standing opposition from Israel. Trump 'asked about attacking Iran nuclear site' Iran's enriched uranium stockpile '12 times limit' After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? The former head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), John Brennan, said the killing of the scientist was a ""criminal"" and ""highly reckless"" act that risks inflaming conflict in the region. In aseries of tweets,external, he said Fakhrizadeh's death ""risks lethal retaliation and a new round of regional conflict"". Mr Brennan added that he did not know ""whether a foreign government authorised or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh"". UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has urged restraint, while on Saturday a spokesman for Germany's foreign office called on all sides ""to refrain from any steps that could lead to a further escalation of the situation"". ""A few weeks before the new US administration takes office, it is important to preserve the scope for talks with Iran so that the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme can be resolved through negotiations,"" a statement said. These are weeks which matter - the countdown to 20 January when President-elect Biden takes office with a new approach to Iran, including an expected return to the 2015 nuclear deal. This assassination followsthe not-so-secret meeting last week in Saudi Arabiabetween the Saudi crown prince and Israeli prime minister - officially denied by the kingdom. It sent another signal that Mohammed bin Salman and Benjamin Netanyahu see this window as their last best chance in a while to try to inflict a crippling blow on their arch-enemy Iran - a blow to also complicate an already challenging course for a new US team to re-engage with the Islamic Republic. All sides know it's also a moment fraught with risk. Iran's President Rouhani declares Iran is ""too wise to fall into Israel's trap"". An immediate retaliation risks an even greater reply, and a descent into even greater crisis which could imperil any chance of a new start in January. Iran's defence ministry said the leading scientist was seriously wounded after attackers targeted his car and exchanged fire with his bodyguards, in the town of Absard, to the east of Tehran, on Friday. Fakhrizadeh later died from his injuries in hospital. It is not clear what happened to the perpetrators of the attack. Fakhrizadeh has long been spoken about by Western security sources as extremely powerful and instrumental in Iran's nuclear programme. According to secret documents obtained by Israel in 2018, he led a programme to create nuclear weapons. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he identified Fakhrizadeh as the head scientist in the programme, and urged people to ""remember that name"". This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive In 2015,the New York Times compared him to J Robert Oppenheimer,external, the physicist who directed the Manhattan Project that during World War Two produced the first atomic weapons. A professor of physics, Fakhrizadeh is said to have led Project Amad, the alleged covert programme that was established in 1989 to research the potential for building a nuclear bomb. It was shut down in 2003, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), though Mr Netanyahu said the documents retrieved in 2018 showed Fakhrizadeh led a programme which secretly continued Project Amad's work. The IAEA (the United Nations' nuclear watchdog) has long wanted to speak to him as part of its investigations into Iran's nuclear programme. Suspicions that Iran was using the programme as a cover to develop a nuclear bomb prompted the EU, US and UN to impose crippling sanctions in 2010. Since President Trump abandoned the 2015 deal, tensions between the US and Iran have escalated, peaking in January with America's assassination of Gen Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds force.

"The University of Surrey will drop entry requirements by one grade for most students applying for undergraduate courses next year. Grades will be lowered to ""relieve the pressure and anxiety"" for students, who have had their learning disrupted by the pandemic across two academic years. It is the second institution to make the move within a week. The government said it will publish plans ""shortly"" on how it will manage disruption to exam pupils in England. Lizzie Burrows, director of recruitment and admissions at the University of Surrey, said: ""We are taking this action now to relieve the pressure and anxiety facing this year's applicants, as they experience ongoing disruption and uncertainty surrounding exams and assessment of their learning. ""By taking this step, we can provide one additional element of certainty and reassurance that these students will be protected from unfair disadvantage as a result of the impact of the pandemic."" Regulated courses such as veterinary medicine, foundation year courses, four-year integrated masters programmes and audition-based performance courses will be exempt from the grade reduction, the university said. Earlier this month, the University of Birmingham became the first higher education institution to reduce entry requirements in recognition of the impact of the pandemic. For each university course there is an expected threshold in terms of A-level grades, and now Surrey is saying it will accept one grade lower in one subject this year. So a student applying to study chemistry will only have to reach two Bs and a C at A-level, whereas in previous years it would have been three Bs. This move by a large university may be an early sign of how flexible universities will be with this year's applicants. The University of Birmingham has already said it will also be dropping requirements by one grade in one subject. A-level exams in England are expected to go ahead, and ministers will be under pressure to find a way of recognising that some students have had learning more disrupted than others. That could prove difficult but a more forgiving approach by universities could compensate. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Plans are being prepared to minimise disruption on roads and railways resulting from an expected surge in travel around Christmas. Across the UK, up to three households will be allowed to stay together in a ""Christmas bubble"" from 23-27 December. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said 500 miles of roadworks had been cleared on motorways and A-roads to ease any congestion as a result. And, he added, there are plans to run longer trains on the rail network. Mr Shapps said rules may also be eased to allow more types of coaches to run. ""We recognise that people will want to be with their friends and family over Christmas,"" he said. ""For those that choose to form a Christmas bubble, we're lifting travel restrictions across the UK for five days."" Further details will be published next week, once the picture on passenger demand is clearer. Christmas Covid rules: Who are you allowed to see? Caution urged over household mixing Covid Christmas: 'Avoid board games and sleepovers' The government will be monitoring demand for road and rail travel using ticket booking websites and journey planning services such as Google Maps to try to get a grasp on the public's travel plans ahead of time and increase capacity accordingly. The expectation is that the start and end of the five-day travel window will be very busy. The chairman of Network Rail, Sir Peter Hendy, has been asked by the government to assess the winter preparation plans of all transport operators. Â This video can not be played Grant Shapps: People will have to ""think about the routes they are taking"" Earlier this week, the transport secretary urged people to book tickets well in advance where possible, and prepare for restrictions on passenger numbers. Referring to domestic travel during the festive period, Mr Shapps urged those travelling on public transport to pre-book tickets as the capacity of services remains reduced to allow for social distancing and as a result of staff self-isolating. Some advance fares, such as for Avanti West Coast, which operates trains on the West Coast Main Line,go on sale on Tuesday.,external These cheaper tickets are usually available 12 weeks in advance, but their release has been delayed during the pandemic due to short-notice timetable changes. Mr Shapps also highlightedNetwork Rail's plans for a series of upgrades and routine maintenance,externalacross Britain between 23 December to 4 January. He told the BBC: ""I would appeal to people to think very carefully about their travel plans and consider where they are going to travel and look at the various alternatives available."" People who live in areas placed in the highest tier of restrictions in England, tier three, should avoid leaving their region entirely, he said. The majority of the network has also been cleared of engineering works in a bid to avoid disruption. Those that are scheduled for the festive period will be reviewed if passenger demand is high. But government sources say it is unlikely that the major works on the East Coast Main Line and London King's Cross will be altered.

"This video can not be played School holiday Christmas decision will be reached ""as soon as we can"" Discussions have been taking place about whether the Christmas school holidays could be extended in Scotland. It has been suggested that the dates could be standardised across the country, with all schools closing on 18 December and reopening on 11 January. Holiday dates vary between different council areas, with most schools due to return between the 5 and 7 January. The proposal is designed to limit the spread of Covid after families get together for Christmas. The issue was discussed at the Scottish government's education recovery group, but no decisions have yet been made. The group brings together a number of stakeholders in the education sector, including unions, councils and the government. Latest updates on Covid in Scotland What are the rules for forming bubbles at Christmas? Keeping level 4 schools open 'is vital for pupils' A document from Thursday's meeting wasleaked to the Daily Record newspaper.,external The memo says the government is considering a national extension to the holidays, with schools either remaining closed or introducing remote learning for a temporary period. At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the Scottish government was very conscious that parents, teachers and pupils wanted to know what was going to happen. The length of Christmas holidays is being discussed by the education recovery group ""We will make sure that we reach a view based on the advice from that expert recovery group, and make sure that we reach a view as soon as we can so that people do have advance notice,"" she said. ""We want to give people as much notice as possible if there is to be any change at all, but at this point that decision hasn't been reached."" Ms Freeman said it would be wrong to ""overly speculate or jump to conclusions"" just because they were looking at the issue. ""The deputy first minister (John Swinney) and his colleagues will be working through what they think is the best way for schools to enter the Christmas break and come out of the Christmas break - and that applies to colleges and universities as well,"" she added. There are a number of important issues to be discussed about changing the holiday dates. First of all parents will want clarity - changes to the dates could mean people having to arrange childcare or take time off work. Secondly, if schools return a few days later than planned in January, some secondary schools may want to change prelim dates. Thirdly, councils are protective of their role in the education system. They would want to ensure any standardisation of dates in an emergency does not set a precedent. And there is, of course, also the question of whether an extended school holiday would by itself make any meaningful difference to the efforts to control coronavirus. The BBC understands councils will discuss the matter again on Friday. It is expected that the education recovery group will meet on Wednesday to discuss the potential impact on exams, and that a decision could be made on the holiday extension next week. While many schools are already due to close on 18 December, others are set to remain open until 23 December. The dates for returning to school in January also vary. The memo says that extending the holidays would act as a break following the relaxation of rules over the festive period. However, concerns are raised over the time needed to set up the remote learning, and the potential impact caused by the loss of emergency childcare which had previously been provided by school staff. School holidays have traditionally varied in different council areas across Scotland, but the start of the autumn term was standardised in August asschools reopened for the first time since March. Scottish Greens co-leader Alison Johnstone told the BBC's daily briefing programme that parents and pupils needed clarity on extending the Christmas school holidays. ""We have learned about this today through a leak to a newspaper so I think transparency and clarity are key here,"" she said. The Scottish Conservatives' education spokesman Jamie Greene said any further ""watering down"" of pupils' time in class would need to be ""properly catered for at home"". He added: ""Every child should have access to proper IT equipment and learning materials to ensure they don't fall behind with their studies.""

"Vitamin D supplements are recommended by public health officials during the lockdown There are mounting questions about whether vitamin D can help fight coronavirus. The Scientific Advisory Commission on Nutrition and the health watchdog theNational Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have done a rapid review of the evidence,external. With more people staying indoors during the pandemic, some may have been deprived of vitamin D. Normally, many of us get it by spending time outside. Our skin makes it when exposed to the sun. The NHS says,externalpeople should consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if they are spending a lot of time indoors. Free winter Vitamin D for vulnerable in England Scottish,externalandWelsh,externalgovernments andNorthern Ireland's Public Health Agency,externalissued similar advice during lockdown. Before the pandemic, people in the UK were already advised to consider taking supplements from October to March. Public Health England recommends vitamin D throughout the year if: you are not often outdoors you live in a care home you usually wear clothes that cover up most of your skin when outside People with dark skin may also not be getting enough, even if they spend time outdoors, and should consider an all-year-round supplement. There is evidence that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) peoplehave a higher risk of getting seriously ill with coronavirus. Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. A lack of it can lead to a bone deformity illness called rickets in children, and a similar bone weakness condition called osteomalacia in adults. There are also suggestions that vitamin D boosts the immune system and helps fight off infections. Some studies suggest adequate vitamin D levels help,externalwhen we have common colds and flu, for example. But evidence from research is inconsistent. TheScientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN),externalsays studies on using vitamin D for treating or preventing chest infections showed insufficient evidence to recommend it for this. A review of research by NICE,externalsuggests there is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to specifically prevent or treat coronavirus. But experts think that it may have some broader health benefits during the pandemic to keep people as nutritionally fit as possible. Some researchers have suggested thatvitamin D deficiency might be linked with poorer outcomes,externalif someone catches coronavirus. But other underlying risk factors, such as heart disease, are common in these patients too, making ithard to draw conclusions,external. Prof Jon Rhodes, Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the University of Liverpool, says vitamin D has anti-inflammatory effects, and some research suggests it may dampen down the body's immune response to viruses. This could be relevant in very ill coronavirus patients, where severe lung damage can result from an inflammatory state in response to the virus, he says, although much more research is needed. No. Although vitamin D supplements are very safe, taking more than the recommended amount every day can be dangerous in the long run. If you choose to take vitamin D supplements: Children aged one to 10 should not have more than 50 micrograms a day Infants (under 12 months) should not have more than 25 micrograms a day Adults should not have more than 100 micrograms a day, with the recommended amount 10 micrograms a day A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health UK LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Higher doses may sometimes be recommended by a doctor for patients with proven vitamin D deficiency. Some people with certain medical conditions, such as kidney problems, cannot safely take vitamin D. Vitamin D supplements are widely available from supermarkets and chemists. They may be just vitamin D or part of a multivitamin tablet. The ingredient listed on the label of most Vitamin D supplements is D3, the one made by your skin. Vitamin D2 is produced by plants. Vitamin drops are available for babies. Some cereals are fortified with vitamin D Although eating a well-balanced diet can help ensure the normal functioning of the immune system, no individual nutrient, food or supplement is going to ""boost"" it beyond normal levels. It's difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone. Eating a well-balanced diet is important for good health and is advisable even outside a pandemic. It can include vitamin D-rich foods like oily fish and eggs. Some breakfast cereals, margarines and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin D. Although you cannot overdose on vitamin D through exposure to sunlight, strong sun burns skin so you need to balance making vitamin D with being safe in the sun. Cover up or protect your skin with sunscreen to prevent burning and damage. The advice is: breastfed babies from birth to one year old should be given a daily supplement of 8.5 to 10 micrograms of vitamin D to make sure they get enough formula-fed babies should not be given a supplement until they are having less than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day, because formula contains vitamin D children aged one to four should be given a daily supplement of 10 micrograms The dose for adults (10 micrograms a day) applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women.  A higher dose may be recommended for pregnant women with dark skin or with high-risk pregnancies.

"Despite fears over jobs and the economy, people have continued buying new homes While it may sound ""somewhat implausible"", Welsh house prices have risen recently despite the pandemic, according to the Principality. The building society puts it partly down to people looking for bigger homes with more space as they adjust to the ""new normal"" of working from home. Rises are set to continue in 2021, according tohouse price index Zoopla,external. It predicts sale values will increase by 2% in Wales, compared to 1% across England. The Principality's chief risk officer Mike Jones said fears over jobs and the economy may make first-time buyers reluctant to ""put a first step on the ladder"". UK house prices 'in first annual fall for eight years' Gwynedd second homes 'crisis' prompts 20-miles march But overall, he believesthe furlough extensionand schemessuch as mortgage deferralsare two factors keeping the sector buoyant. ""It is also potentially the desire for a lifestyle change for some who, during lockdown, have realised that it is possible to work from home, avoiding the necessity to travel to work on a daily basis,"" he added. ""The demand for larger homes with additional space, including outdoor areas, has consequently risen however, and with little new supply coming to the market, prices also rose rapidly."" Areas such as Abersoch in Gwynedd saw house prices jump When Wales' first lockdown ended in June, house prices rose by 3% across Wales' 22 local authority areas to Â£196,165. The Principality's house price index for July to September showed sales rose by 2.2% compared to the quarter before - however, they were down by 58% on the same period in 2019. In September, six local authority areas reached a new record average price - Bridgend (Â£190,948), Cardiff (Â£247,030), Carmarthenshire (Â£172,708), Gwynedd (Â£198,279), Newport (Â£213,660) and Powys (Â£222,992). Apart from Cardiff, they are all among the council areas with the highest proportion of detached or semi-detached homes, indicating to the Principality the rise is being driven by people looking for spacious homes suited to lockdown living. The highest increase was in Gwynedd, where house prices rose by 14.6%, with the price of an average detached home rising from Â£250,000 to Â£280,000 - this was pushed up by the highest sale of the year for Â£1.2m. House prices are predicted to continue rising in 2021 Mr Jones added: ""Covid is likely to have dented consumer confidence and fears over job security may mean that many prospective buyers will be reluctant to either put a first foot on the housing ladder, or indeed take a step up."" However, he said help-to-buy schemes and the creation of affordable homes ""gave cause for optimism"" looking ahead. Zoopla predicts Wales will record the strongest house price growth of all UK areas next year, partly due to pent-up demand because of a longer lockdown earlier in 2020. Director of research and insight Richard Donnell called it a ""rollercoaster year"" that was ending on a strong note, with house price growth hitting a three-year high and set to increase further. ""There are some challenges ahead as the country battles the impacts of the pandemic on the economy and day-to-day life,"" he added. ""The impact on the housing market is less than in previous downturns as sales volumes have already fallen in recent years and affordability levels are far from over-stretched."" Monmouthshire Building Society's chief operating officer Dawn Gunter called it an ""unpredictable year"" but agreed coronavirus had changed how many people view their home. ""Lockdowns have also meant members have spent more time than usual at home, with the home becoming both a personal and professional space,"" she said. ""Lots of people took the time to consider what the future looks like, how their home environment supports a positive work-life balance, whilst also considering its location and surroundings."" She also said the building society had seen ""a surge in first-time buyers"", adding: ""We know the average age of a first-time buyer is now in their 30s, so 2020 may have been the target year to buy a first home for many.""

"UK house prices were 0.1% lower in June than the same month a year ago - the first annual fall since December 2012, according to the Nationwide. The building society also said property values had dropped by 1.4% compared with May as the coronavirus lockdown hit the housing market. Sales plummeted and viewings halted when the sector was effectively frozen. The Nationwide said the magnitude of the shock to the economy made a house price fall unsurprising. It said the outlook for the housing market was ""highly uncertain"" in the coming months. The housing market, as with the rest of the economy, has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The lockdown meant activity slowed sharply, with sales at half the levels of a year earlier. Viewings, sales and moves have now resumed in much of the UK, but buyers and sellers face fresh unease about job and income prospects, prompting some to rethink plans over property. The Nationwide, which bases its figures on its own mortgage lending, said that house prices, on an annual basis, dropped from a 1.8% rise in May to a 0.1% fall in June as the effects of the shutdown were felt. The typical home was now worth Â£216,403, it said. This will be welcomed by first-time buyers hoping for a consistent fall in house prices, although restrictions by lenders mean mortgages have become more difficult to secure. ""With lockdown measures due to be eased in the weeks ahead, housing market activity is likely to edge higher in the near term, albeit remaining below pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless, the medium-term outlook for the housing market remains highly uncertain,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. He said that government measures to support the economy and jobs would dilute the potential impact of the pandemic on the housing market. Prices in April, May and June were lower than the previous three months in Wales (down 2.2%) and Northern Ireland (down 0.5%) compared with rises in Scotland (up 2.5%) and England (up 0.4%), the Nationwide said. These figures can be relatively volatile owing to the relative lack of data in some areas. Commentators said the rest of the year could be a test for the housing market. ""The property market was never going to get through such a profound economic shock without taking a material hit,"" said Andrew Montlake, managing director at mortgage broker Coreco. ""The second half of 2020 is going to be the real test for the property market, as government support for workers is slowly removed and we see a rise in unemployment. The government and Treasury are going to be tested like never before as they seek to keep people in jobs, which will clearly be pivotal to the future direction of house prices.""

"Activists marched from Nefyn to Caernarfon Activists who claim Gwynedd is facing a second homes ""crisis"" have marched 20 miles (32km) after a recent increase in house prices. About 60 people marched from Nefyn, on the Llyn Peninsula, to Caernarfon on Saturday. Nefyn Town Council said house prices in the area had gone ""through the roof"" in recent months. The Welsh Government said it recognised the challenges around second homes and was monitoring the law closely. Second-home owners 'leaving locals sofa-surfing' Second-home owners 'use loophole' to claim grants According to Gwynedd council's housing department, 811 new houses are needed each year to meet local demand. But it says 830 existing properties each year are those that qualify for the higher rate of land transaction tax, including second homes and buy-to-let properties. Abersoch in Gwynedd is well known as the ""second home capital"" of north Wales Rhys Tudur, who sits on Nefyn Town Council, called on the Welsh Government to devolve the land transaction tax to local authorities, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. He said: ""We are being priced out of the very communities we were raised. It's been made impossible, thanks to the hike in house prices. ""From what we can see day to day, our communities are being swept away under our noses and the Welsh language is being dismantled and depleted to a great extent, and it's heart-breaking to see the inaction of the government so far."" Elfed Wyn Jones, chairman of the Gwynedd and Anglesey committee of pressure group Cymdeithas yr Iaith, said: ""There's an urgent crisis in the functioning of the housing and property market - and whole communities are losing a large proportion of their homes."" The Welsh Government said: ""We recognise the challenges second and empty homes can present to the supply of affordable housing in some communities in Wales. ""We're on target to deliver 20,000 new affordable homes this Senedd term, and Wales remains the only UK nation to have given local authorities powers to charge higher levels of council tax on both long-term empty and second homes.

"Hospitals in England could become ""overwhelmed"" with Covid cases if MPs do not back new restrictions, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said. Many Tory MPs oppose the tougher tier system, which begins on 2 December. Butwriting in the Times,,externalMr Gove said MPs - who will vote on the measures next week - need to ""take responsibility for difficult decisions"". Labour is yet to decide whether it will support the new restrictions. It has warned, however, that areas in tier three will be stretched to ""breaking point"" without further financial support from the Treasury. It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours. Has England's lockdown worked? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? When England's four-week national lockdown ends on Wednesday, regions will be placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. Some MPs say the new system imposes tight restrictions on numerous areas with low cases, and are calling instead for a more localised approach. But Mr Gove has defended the new system, saying that, unless action to slow the spread of coronavirus is taken, the NHS could be ""broken"" and hospitals ""physically overwhelmed"". ""The tiers we had in place before the lockdown had not suppressed [Covid] sufficiently: they were neither strong enough to reduce social contact sufficiently, nor applied widely enough to contain the virus's spread,"" he wrote. He added that, across the UK, about 16,000 beds are filled with Covid-19 patients, compared to a peak in April of almost 20,000 and a low of 740 on 11 September. ""When the country is facing such a national crisis, the truth is that all of us who have been elected to Parliament, not just ministers, must take responsibility for difficult decisions,"" he said. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Irelandhas begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotlandeach area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford saidpubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions- which are not yet finalised - in the run up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith is among those questioning England's approach. On Friday, he asked ""what was the point of lockdown"" if England ends up with tighter restrictions than it had before the four-week national restrictions came into force. What are you allowed to do in each Covid tier? Mass testing a 'distraction' from vaccine rollout Several Conservative MPs have asked to see the data the government based its decision on. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Here in Dorset, we entered lockdown with pretty low figures. We're coming out of it with even lower figures. ""This last week we've gone down by a third. So we're really surprised to find ourselves in tier two."" Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, who represents South Thanet, which has the second highest rate of infection in the UK, said he will vote against the new ""draconian"" tiered restrictions. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think once areas see themselves going in the wrong direction, that actually has a very, very distinct affect on people's behaviour."" ""They almost self-regulate, they actually do take those space, hands, and all of those good things far more seriously."" But epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson, whose advice led to the decision to go into the first lockdown, told Today: ""I know people argue: 'well why are we going into more intensive measures now after lockdown than we were before?' ""And it's because we don't want to repeat the same mistakes made before this current lockdown and allow cases to rise exponentially again coming into Christmas - particularly in the context that we are going to have a relaxation over Christmas, which does pose some risks."" NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Breakfast those who run hospitals are ""worried about the fact that if those rules are too loose and if people go beyond them"" that ""could trigger a third phase"". He said the MPs making policy decisions are ""not epidemiologists, they're not experts about exactly what is the balance between loosening the restrictions and what might then follow - that's for the scientific experts, the epidemiologists"". ""The real problem is January is always the NHS' busiest time of year and therefore it is really important that people not only observe the rules,"" he said. On staffing in hospitals, he said it only takes a ""very, very small amount of sickness in particular areas"" among health workers to result in a ""pretty major problem"". ""If you have a single anaesthetist who is off, then that means 15, 20 other people who are meant to be doing an operation for somebody - that affects their work,"" he said. The new coronavirus tier restrictions will mean 55 million people will be banned from mixing with other households indoors. The tiers areas are in will be reviewed every 14 days, starting 16 December. Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: tier one:the rule of six applies everywhere, indoors and out tier two:the rule of six applies outdoors but there is no household mixing anywhere indoors tier three:can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces like parks, where the rule of six applies Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. People in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds will urge Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the Additional Restrictions Grant (ARG) in tier three areas following concerns the new rules will force some local authorities to stretch the grants further than others. Leaders in Lancashire have written to the PM's interim chief of staffsaying it is ""unfair"" that areas facing four weeks of restrictions under the lockdown received the same amount as they did for seven weeks. The one-off ARG funding equates to Â£20 per person in an area and is designed to help closed businesses that do not directly pay business rates, as well as those that do not have to close but are affected by restrictions. Ms Dodds is due to tell the party's online regional conference - Connected North West - on Saturday afternoon: ""It is completely irresponsible for the government to leave tier three areas in the lurch like this again."" A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said ""a host of other support measures"" have been made available.

"Drinkers visiting pubs in tier two regions will have to leave when they finish eating, under new restrictions being introduced from 2 December, No 10 has confirmed. Under the post-lockdown guidance, pubs in those high risk areas can only open if they function as a restaurant. And alcohol can only be served as part of a ""substantial meal"". Pubs and restaurants are currently closed across England, apart from for takeaways. What are you allowed to do in each tier? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? Has England's lockdown worked? The prime minister's official spokesman, asked how long drinkers can stay in a pub after buying a meal, said: ""We've been clear that, in tier two I believe, that you need to have a substantial meal if ordering any alcohol and it remains the case that the guidance says that once the meal is finished, it is at that point [you have to leave]."" People can currently meet in Wales for a drink When the current lockdown ends, the rules will change according to where you live. In tier two regions, pubs and restaurants must shut at 23:00 GMT, with last orders an hour earlier. You can only socialise inside with people you live with, or those in your support bubble if you live alone. Groups of up to six can meet outside, but social distancing must be adhered to. In tier three, very high risk areas, you cannot mix with anyone outside your household either indoors or in pub gardens or private gardens. Hospitality venues - such as bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants - must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services. In tier one, medium level, people can meet inside or outside in groups of up to six. Most of England is in tier two or three, however, with only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly in tier one. 'Rules have changed in the middle of the game' Stricter measures for pubs, restaurants and bars willcome into force in Waleson 4 December, it was announced on Friday. Northern Ireland is currently in a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, with cafes, coffee shops, pubs, bars and restaurants closed, except for takeaways and deliveries. And in Scotland, the rules on pubs and restaurants depend where your region is placed in the four-tier system.

"It's satellites that have tracked the loss of ice in the Antarctic and the Arctic There is going to be a gap of several years in our ability to measure the thickness of ice at the top and bottom of the world, scientists are warning. The only two satellites dedicated to observing the poles are almost certain to die before replacements are flown. This could leave us blind to some important changes in the Arctic and the Antarctic as the climate warms. The researchers have raised their concerns with the European Commission and the European Space Agency. A letter detailing the problem,external- and possible solutions - was sent to leading EC and Esa officials this week; and although the US space agency (Nasa) has not formally been addressed, it has been made aware of the correspondence. 'Dog kennel' satellite blasts off on ocean mission New Sentinels to check the pulse of Earth Greenland and Antarctica ice loss accelerating At issue is the longevity of the European CryoSat-2 and American IceSat-2 missions. These spacecraft carry instruments called altimeters that gauge the shape and elevation of ice surfaces. They've been critical in recording the loss of sea-ice volume and the declining mass of glaciers. Artwork: CryoSat-2 (top) and IceSat-2 (bottom) will hopefully last until mid-decade What's unique about the satellites is their orbits around the Earth. They fly to 88 degrees North and South from the equator, which means they see the entire Arctic and Antarctic regions, bar a small circle about 430km in diameter at the poles themselves. In contrast, most other satellites don't usually go above 83 degrees. As a consequence, they miss, for example, a great swathe of the central Arctic Ocean and its frozen floes. The worry is that CryoSat-2 and IceSat-2 will have been decommissioned long before any follow-ups get launched. CryoSat-2 is already way beyond its design life. It was put in space in 2010 with the expectation it would work for at least 3.5 years. Engineers think they can keep it operating until perhaps 2024, but battery degradation and a fuel leak suggest not for much longer. IceSat-2 was launched in 2018 with a design life of three years, but with the hope - and expectation - it can operate productively deep into the decade (see footnote). The satellites' orbits leave only a very small hole in their measurements at the poles ""Without successful mitigation, there will be a gap of between two and five years in our polar satellite altimetry capability,"" the scientists' letter states. ""This gap will introduce a decisive break in the long-term records of ice sheet and sea-ice thickness change and polar oceanography and this, in turn, will degrade our capacity to assess and improve climate model projections."" The only satellite replacement currently in prospect is the EC/Esa mission codenamed Cristal. It will be like Cryosat, although with much greater capability thanks to a dual-frequency radar altimeter. Industry has started work on the spacecraft but it won't launch until 2027/28, maybe even later because full funding to make this date a reality is not yet in place. Dr Josef Aschbacher, the director of Earth observation at Esa, said his agency was working as fast as it could to plug the gap. ""This is a concern; we recognise it,"" he told the BBC. ""We've put plans in motion to build Cristal as quick as we can. Despite Covid, despite heavy workloads and video conferences by everyone - we have gone through the evaluation... and Cristal was kicked off in early September."" An option for Europe? The Americans flew a stop-gap laser altimeter on aeroplanes Just over 10% of the near-600 signatories to the letter are American scientists. Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, the head of science at Nasa, is not being sent the letter because it is primarily aimed at European funders - and most of the signatories are European. Nonetheless, Dr Zurbuchen is aware of the letter and its contents. He said he was hopeful any polar gap could be plugged or minimised. ""I think there are multiple options at this moment in time that we can deploy to that end, in partnership or otherwise,"" he commented. Arctic sea-ice shrinks to near record low extent 'The sea-ice is dying': Historic Arctic trip ends 'Doomsday Glacier' vulnerability seen in new maps One of those solutions in Europe would be to run a version of Nasa's IceBridge project. This was an airborne platform that the US agency operated in the eight years between the end of the very first IceSat mission in 2010 and the launch of IceSat-2 in 2018. An aeroplane flew a laser altimeter over the Arctic and the Antarctic to gather some limited data-sets that could eventually be used to tie the two IceSat missions together. There are many who think a European ""CryoBridge"" is the most affordable and near-term option to mitigate the empty years between CryoSat-2 and Cristal. The cost of manufacture of the airborne radar altimeter could be accomplished for perhaps â¬5m (Â£4.5m), scientists believe, but its design and fabrication would likely take two years. Such a project would therefore have to get under way relatively soon. It would, of course, also need an operational budget. The signatories to the letter sent to the EC and Esa include leading scientists using CryoSat and IceSat data, the president of the International Glaciology Society, and lead authors on the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which prepares the authoritative state-of-the-climate reports for world governments. This article was updated to clarify the fuel situation on IceSat-2.

"Three men had photos taken next to the football legend's open coffin A funeral worker who took a photo next to the open coffin of Argentine football icon Diego Maradona has asked fans for forgiveness. Claudio FernÃ¡ndez was pictured standing next to Maradona's body, alongside his son, who made a thumbs-up gesture. A third man appeared in his own photo. Maradona died at his home in Tigre, near Buenos Aires, on Wednesday. The images surfaced online as Maradona's body lay in repose at the presidential palace, provoking outrage. The footballer's lawyer, MatÃ­as Morla, has vowed to take action against ""the scoundrel"" responsible for the photos. Mr Fernandez told Radio 10 on Friday that the decision to take the photo was ""something instantaneous"". Maradona obituary - a flawed football genius Huge crowds bid farewell to Maradona ""My son, like every kid, raised his thumb and they took the photo,"" he said. ""I know that many people have been offended, they have taken it badly."" Mr FernÃ¡ndez said he had received death threats. ""They say they are going to kill us, break our heads,"" he told the radio station. There has been a huge outpouring of grief in Argentina following the footballer's death The Sepelios Pinier funeral parlour said the three men were ""outsourced employees"" who had helped carry the coffin. Manager of the parlour, MatÃ­as PicÃ³n, toldthe TN news channel,externalthat the company was ""devastated"" by the images. He said his company had organised funeral services for other members of the Maradona family. ""The family has total confidence in us, that's why we are so affected,"" he said.

"The No campaign message (L) is: ""Help by all means but not like this""; the Yes campaign poster reads: ""Drinking water contaminated, child poisoned and commodities firm liable"" Swiss voters decide on Sunday on a law that would make Swiss businesses financially and legally liable for human rights violations or environmental damage. The law would affect their supply chains anywhere in the world. Switzerland may be a small country, but its business reach is long. Companies such as NestlÃ©, Syngenta, Glencore or Novartis source products all over the world and Switzerland is a world centre for commodity trading. A third of all commodities consumed worldwide are traded by companies based in Switzerland. Corporate responsibility is a priority for multinationals and companies such as NestlÃ© say they scrutinise their supply chains from start to finish to ensure fair working practices, and to prevent child labour or environmental damage. The new law seeks to enforce these standards, allowing victims of alleged human rights violations or environmental damage to sue Swiss companies in Swiss courts. The companies would have to prove they had taken all necessary measures to prevent any harm. A third of the world's commodities are traded by Swiss-based companies such as Glencore, which is also one of the world's biggest miners ""Many companies do the right thing already,"" says campaigner Andreas Missbach, ""but in cases where they don't then [under this new law] victims of a subsidiary of a Swiss company abroad could sue the Swiss parent company for damages."" He points specifically to the extractive industry as an area of concern. Mines in Latin America that supply Swiss companies are, he claims, causing serious harm. ""Communities are mistreated, people are put off their land, water poisoned, and we have this with companies that are headquartered in Switzerland."" Global trading hub for oil and petroleum, metals, minerals, agricultural products, sugar, cotton, cereals and oilseed Employs 35,000 people and generated annual revenue of 25bn Swiss Francs (Â£21bn; â¬23bn) in 2017 There are 550 commodities trading companies in Switzerland Source: Swiss Foreign Affairs Department,external Most are very wary of the proposed new law, particularly because they believe it will put Switzerland on a different and more radical path than the rest of Europe, and therefore put Swiss businesses at a disadvantage. Erich Herzog of Swiss business federation Economiesuisse argues it's not the right moment to introduce strict, and in his view experimental, new laws. ""It would put Swiss companies already weakened by the pandemic in great difficulties. Switzerland is a very small country. We shouldn't be a petri dish where there is no guarantee those experiments will result in a positive outcome."" He believes this sort of decision has to be made on an international level and there is political backing for that point of view. Switzerland moves to close bribery loophole The Swiss city with the world's highest minimum wage Swiss firmly reject end to free movement with EU Swiss search for owner of gold haul left on train The Swiss government and both houses of parliament have rejected the new law, promising instead to introduce new rules requiring companies to strengthen checks on their overseas operations, and to tie Switzerland to responsible business laws being considered by the European Union. ""This proposal goes too far, it's too radical,"" said Swiss Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter. The government, she said, was especially worried about the law's provision to make Swiss companies liable for the actions of their independent suppliers. But some Swiss business leaders are in favour of the initiative. Thomas Rauber, the CEO of an investment firm, believes it could be a positive move. ""It would send a signal to the world that Switzerland is a liberal and economically stable country, where you can do business with a clear framework, in a society that upholds human rights. Our economy is not successful if it's only about profits."" Traditionally, yes. If urged by both government and business leaders to reject a proposal because it's financially risky, Swiss voters tend to toe the line. Moves to crack down on money laundering were resisted for many years, and the Swiss clung fiercely to banking secrecy despite the reputational damage to their banking sector. But the responsible business initiative seems to have garnered support from wide swathes of Swiss society, from left and right, urban and rural, and from Church groups. This video can not be played How a Swiss referendum denied women the right to vote in 1959 Opinion polls show a majority of voters may say yes to the new law. Far from being too radical, says campaigner Nina Burgharz, the polls show the political class is out of touch. ""Social reality has changed,"" she says. ""We had a huge development in the last 10, 20 years, and sometimes I have the feeling that our politicians just close their eyes and they don't see what is actually going on. This initiative is really just a way to conform that social reality into our law."" In the run-up to the vote, the gap in the opinion polls has narrowed and the result will be tight. Switzerland is in the grip of a bitter coronavirus winter, with all its accompanying economic woes. But the fact that Switzerland is voting on such a law at all is a reflection of changing attitudes. So too is the other proposal on Sunday's ballot paper: to forbid Swiss financial institutions from investing in any form of arms production, from nuclear weapons all the way down to bullets.

"This video can not be played Students of Iran's Basij paramilitary force rallied in front of the foreign ministry in Tehran Iran's president has blamed Israel for the killing of a top nuclear scientist on Friday, and said it would not slow down the country's nuclear programme. Hassan Rouhani also said Iran would retaliate over Mohsen Fakhrizadeh's killing at a time of its choosing. An Israeli cabinet minister said he had ""no clue"" who was behind the ambush by gunmen on Mr Fakhrizadeh's car. Israel has previously accused the physicist of being key to a covert nuclear weapons programme. Fakhrizadeh was Iran's most renowned nuclear scientist, who headed the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation. His killing threatens to escalate tensions over Iran's nuclear programme with the US and its close ally Israel. What were the motives behind the killing? Country profile: Iran,external Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words President Rouhani said on Saturday his country would respond ""in due course"" but that Fakhrizadeh's killing would not push Iran into making hasty decisions. ""Iran's enemies should know that the people of Iran and officials are braver than to leave this criminal act unanswered,"" he said in a televised cabinet meeting. ""In due time, they will answer for this crime,"" he added. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, pictured in an undated photo, was head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation In an earlier statement, the president accused the ""the mercenaries of the oppressive Zionist regime"" - referring to Israel - of being behind the attack. ""The assassination of martyr Fakhrizadeh shows our enemies' despair and the depth of their hatred... His martyrdom will not slow down our achievements."" Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also called for the ""punishing"" of the perpetrators of the attack ""and those who commanded it"", in a tweet on Saturday. His military adviser, Hossein Dehghan, had earlier vowed to ""strike"" the attackers like thunder. This video can not be played The road near Tehran where gunmen opened fire on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh The New York Times quotes three US officials, including two intelligence officials, as sayingIsrael was behind the attack,external. But Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi said on Saturday that he had ""no clue"" who was behind the killing. Fakhrizadeh's name was specifically mentioned in Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation about Iran's nuclear programme in April 2018. Israeli embassies around the world have been placed on high alert, according to Israel's N12 news website on Saturday. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called on the international community to ""condemn this act of state terror"". News of the killing comes amid fresh concern about the increased amount of enriched uranium that Iran is producing. Enriched uranium is a vital component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. A 2015 deal with six world powers had placed limits on Iran's production of enriched uranium, but since US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, Iran has been deliberately reneging on its agreements. However, it insists its nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. Joe Biden has pledged to re-engage with Iran when he becomes US president in January, despite long-standing opposition from Israel. Trump 'asked about attacking Iran nuclear site' Iran's enriched uranium stockpile '12 times limit' After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? The former head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), John Brennan, said the killing of the scientist was a ""criminal"" and ""highly reckless"" act that risks inflaming conflict in the region. In aseries of tweets,external, he said Fakhrizadeh's death ""risks lethal retaliation and a new round of regional conflict"". Mr Brennan added that he did not know ""whether a foreign government authorised or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh"". UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has urged restraint, while on Saturday a spokesman for Germany's foreign office called on all sides ""to refrain from any steps that could lead to a further escalation of the situation"". ""A few weeks before the new US administration takes office, it is important to preserve the scope for talks with Iran so that the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme can be resolved through negotiations,"" a statement said. These are weeks which matter - the countdown to 20 January when President-elect Biden takes office with a new approach to Iran, including an expected return to the 2015 nuclear deal. This assassination followsthe not-so-secret meeting last week in Saudi Arabiabetween the Saudi crown prince and Israeli prime minister - officially denied by the kingdom. It sent another signal that Mohammed bin Salman and Benjamin Netanyahu see this window as their last best chance in a while to try to inflict a crippling blow on their arch-enemy Iran - a blow to also complicate an already challenging course for a new US team to re-engage with the Islamic Republic. All sides know it's also a moment fraught with risk. Iran's President Rouhani declares Iran is ""too wise to fall into Israel's trap"". An immediate retaliation risks an even greater reply, and a descent into even greater crisis which could imperil any chance of a new start in January. Iran's defence ministry said the leading scientist was seriously wounded after attackers targeted his car and exchanged fire with his bodyguards, in the town of Absard, to the east of Tehran, on Friday. Fakhrizadeh later died from his injuries in hospital. It is not clear what happened to the perpetrators of the attack. Fakhrizadeh has long been spoken about by Western security sources as extremely powerful and instrumental in Iran's nuclear programme. According to secret documents obtained by Israel in 2018, he led a programme to create nuclear weapons. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he identified Fakhrizadeh as the head scientist in the programme, and urged people to ""remember that name"". This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive In 2015,the New York Times compared him to J Robert Oppenheimer,external, the physicist who directed the Manhattan Project that during World War Two produced the first atomic weapons. A professor of physics, Fakhrizadeh is said to have led Project Amad, the alleged covert programme that was established in 1989 to research the potential for building a nuclear bomb. It was shut down in 2003, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), though Mr Netanyahu said the documents retrieved in 2018 showed Fakhrizadeh led a programme which secretly continued Project Amad's work. The IAEA (the United Nations' nuclear watchdog) has long wanted to speak to him as part of its investigations into Iran's nuclear programme. Suspicions that Iran was using the programme as a cover to develop a nuclear bomb prompted the EU, US and UN to impose crippling sanctions in 2010. Since President Trump abandoned the 2015 deal, tensions between the US and Iran have escalated, peaking in January with America's assassination of Gen Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds force.

"NHS Test and Trace incorrectly told 1,311 people they had tested positive Hundreds of people have been wrongly told they have coronavirus by NHS Test and Trace after a laboratory error. More than 1,300 people who gave samples between 19 and 23 November received positive results, when the tests were actually void. All of those affected will be told to take another test, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Duncan Larcombe, whose daughter received the wrong result, said it was ""more than an inconvenient mistake"". The PR company director, from Maidstone, Kent, said his two children, aged 14 and nine, were both sent home from school to self-isolate and he was unable to work. He said his 14-year-old daughter had not left her bedroom for four days, with meals being left outside her door, until the family learned the result was void on Thursday. ""We were taking it very seriously,"" he said. Mr Larcombe, a former royal editor at the Sun newspaper, said the mistake ""brings into question for me whether or not this testing system is competent"". ""The entire economy is relying on the competence of the testing laboratories and if they are not doing their job they need to be held to account,"" he said. DHSC said it was an ""isolated incident"" caused by an ""issue with a batch of testing chemicals"" which had affected tests taken across the UK. It is ""being fully investigated to ensure this does not happen again,"" the department said. Mr Larcombe's daughter has now received a negative result after taking a second test on Thursday. ""Given that [the government] have just decided to put the whole of Kent in tier 3, you just wonder, is their modelling flawed,"" he said. Asked if the 1,311 incorrect results would affect regional figures for infection rates, which are represented as the number of cases per 100,000 people, DHSC issued a statement saying: ""Any impact on regional figures would be minimal, but in any event this incident was taken into account when the tiering discussions took place.""

"This video can not be played The road near Tehran where gunmen opened fire on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Iran's most senior nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh has been assassinated near the capital Tehran, the country's defence ministry has confirmed. Fakhrizadeh died in hospital after an attack in Absard, in Damavand county. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, has condemned the killing ""as an act of state terror"". Western intelligence agencies believe Fakhrizadeh was behind a covert Iranian nuclear weapons programme. ""If Iran ever chose to weaponise (enrichment), Fakhrizadeh would be known as the father of the Iranian bomb,"" one Western diplomat told Reuters news agency in 2014. Iran insists its nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. But news of the killing comes amid fresh concern about the increased amount of enriched uranium that the country is producing.

Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, pictured in an undated photo, was head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation Between 2010 and 2012, four Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated and Iran has accused Israel of complicity in the killings. Fakhrizadeh's name was specifically mentioned in Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation about Iran's nuclear programme in April 2018. There has been no comment from Israel on the news of the assassination. The Pentagon has also declined to comment, according to Reuters. In a statement on Friday, Iran's defence ministry said: ""Armed terrorists targeted a vehicle carrying Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, head of the ministry's research and innovation organisation. ""After a clash between the terrorists and his bodyguards, Mr Fakhrizadeh was severely injured and rushed to hospital. ""Unfortunately, the medical team's efforts to save him were unsuccessful and minutes ago he passed away."" Iranian media reports said the attackers opened fire on the scientist in his car. Fars news agency earlier reported there was a car explosion in Absard town, with witnesses reporting that ""three to four individuals, who are said to have been terrorists, were killed"". By Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent As head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation, Fakhrizadeh was clearly still a key player. Hence Benjamin Netanyahu's warning, two years ago, to ""remember his name"". Since Iran started breaching its commitments under the terms of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the country has moved ahead rapidly, building stockpiles of low-enriched uranium and enriching to a purity above the level permitted under the deal. Iranian officials have always said such moves are reversible, but developments in research and development are harder to eradicate. ""We cannot go backwards,"" Iran's former ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said recently. If Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was the key player Israel alleges, then his death could represent someone's effort to put the brakes on Iran's forward momentum. With the US president-elect, Joe Biden, talking about taking Washington back into the deal with Iran, the assassination could also be aimed at complicating any future negotiations. ""Terrorists murdered an eminent Iranian scientist today,""Iran's foreign minister said in a tweet,external.

Referring to domestic travel during the festive period, Mr Shapps urged those travelling on public transport to pre-book tickets as the capacity of services remains reduced to allow for social distancing and as a result of staff self-isolating. Some advance fares, such as for Avanti West Coast, which operates trains on the West Coast Main Line,go on sale on Tuesday.,external These cheaper tickets are usually available 12 weeks in advance, but their release has been delayed during the pandemic due to short-notice timetable changes. Mr Shapps also highlightedNetwork Rail's plans for a series of upgrades and routine maintenance,externalacross Britain between 23 December to 4 January. He told the BBC: ""I would appeal to people to think very carefully about their travel plans and consider where they are going to travel and look at the various alternatives available."" People who live in areas placed in the highest tier of restrictions in England, tier three, should avoid leaving their region entirely, he said. The majority of the network has also been cleared of engineering works in a bid to avoid disruption. Those that are scheduled for the festive period will be reviewed if passenger demand is high.

The chairman of Network Rail, Sir Peter Hendy, has been asked by the government to assess the winter preparation plans of all transport operators. Â This video can not be played Grant Shapps: People will have to ""think about the routes they are taking"" Earlier this week, the transport secretary urged people to book tickets well in advance where possible, and prepare for restrictions on passenger numbers. Referring to domestic travel during the festive period, Mr Shapps urged those travelling on public transport to pre-book tickets as the capacity of services remains reduced to allow for social distancing and as a result of staff self-isolating. Some advance fares, such as for Avanti West Coast, which operates trains on the West Coast Main Line,go on sale on Tuesday.,external These cheaper tickets are usually available 12 weeks in advance, but their release has been delayed during the pandemic due to short-notice timetable changes. Mr Shapps also highlightedNetwork Rail's plans for a series of upgrades and routine maintenance,externalacross Britain between 23 December to 4 January. He told the BBC: ""I would appeal to people to think very carefully about their travel plans and consider where they are going to travel and look at the various alternatives available."" People who live in areas placed in the highest tier of restrictions in England, tier three, should avoid leaving their region entirely, he said. The majority of the network has also been cleared of engineering works in a bid to avoid disruption. Those that are scheduled for the festive period will be reviewed if passenger demand is high. But government sources say it is unlikely that the major works on the East Coast Main Line and London King's Cross will be altered.

"Christopher Wilson admitted having sex with a woman who was reporting a crime at Launceston Police Station A police constable is facing a prison sentence after having sex with a crime victim in a disabled toilet at his station. PC Christopher Wilson, 43, invited the woman to the toilet via text on 2 December, Exeter Crown Court was told. He told her sex inside the police station in Launceston, Cornwall, was ""the naughty bit which makes it more exciting"". Wilson, of Saltash, East Cornwall, admitted misconduct in a public office. The woman was reporting a crime when Wilson approached her, asking if she wanted to ""get with a man in uniform"". She followed him into the unisex disabled toilet where they engaged in sexual activity, the court heard. Judge Timothy Rose told Wilson he was likely to be sent straight to jail when he returned for sentencing in January. ""Obviously, the court will consider other options but I don't want to mislead you. You must come back realising that prison is very high on the agenda,"" he said. Mr James le Grys, prosecuting, said messages were found in which Wilson discussed sex with another woman. He also sent sexual messages to the woman after she left the police station, the court heard. Susannah Stevens, defending, said Wilson had not expected the woman to follow him into the toilet but accepted acting improperly when she did. Wilson remains suspended from duty with Devon and Cornwall Police.
