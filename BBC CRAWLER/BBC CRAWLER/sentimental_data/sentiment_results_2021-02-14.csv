"People travelling to England from 33 high-risk countries may face suspended flights and long queues at the border, Heathrow Airport has said. The airport said ""good progress"" had been made on a ""number of issues"" with the government's hotel quarantine plan, which comes into force on Monday. But it said it was concerned about whether UK Border Force could ""cope"". The government said it was working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arose. From Monday, British and Irish citizens and UK residents arriving in England froma ""red list"" country,externalwill have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels for 10 days to try to stop new coronavirus variants entering the country. They will have to pay Â£1,750 for their stay, which covers the cost of the hotel, transport and testing, and book it in advance using agovernment portal,external. Those who fail to quarantine in such hotels face fines of Â£5,000 to Â£10,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years. The ""red list"" mainly consists of countries in South America and Africa, as well as Portugal. How England's hotel quarantine will differ from Australia's Hotel quarantine site taken down after launch What are the new rules and fines for foreign travel? Heathrow Airport said it had been ""working hard"" with the government to make sure the plan works. However, in a statement it said ""queues at the border in recent days of almost five hours are totally unacceptable"". ""Ministers need to ensure there is adequate resource and effective processes at the border to avoid compromising the safety of passengers and those working at the airport, which could necessitate the suspension of some arriving flights,"" it added. The airport is one of five in England where people requiring hotel quarantine can enter the UK and is expected to receive the largest number of passengers. The other four are Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield. Regulations for the hotel quarantine measures, which come into force from 04:00 GMT on Monday,have been published,external. But on Friday the Immigration Services Union said its officials hadyet to receive guidance on how the system would work. The union said officials still did not know what levels of checks they should be conducting on travellers. It also raised concerns about the safety of security halls. And the GMB union has warned that ""rushed"" government plans are not thorough enough to make sure workers on the front line in quarantine hotels are protected. The union said security guards were one of the occupations worst hit by Covid deaths, adding that it wanted to meet employers to develop a strategy to better protect workers.

Beckie Morris said travellers should not be used as ""guinea pigs"" Meanwhile, a family returning to the UK after four years living in Abu Dhabi said travellers should not be used as ""guinea pigs"", amid confusion over hotel quarantine rules. Beckie Morris, 30, planned to repatriate to the UK with husband Matthew and their five-week-old daughter, but they now face a quarantine bill of thousands of pounds if they do. The new mother said there was ""no information"" on the government website about what to do with young children. She said: ""We'd have to arrange all the formula. I don't know what we do about sterilising bottles, or nappies or washing their clothes - there's all this unknown. I tried to reach out, and I know it's still really early days, but there's just no information. ""They haven't really laid out what actually happens when you get to that hotel and I don't think that's going to be known until the first person goes in there. ""People shouldn't be used as guinea pigs - especially not paying that amount, that is an extortionate amount of money."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Every essential check - from pre-departure testing to the passenger locator form - will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK. ""We are working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arise and ensure the new process runs as smoothly as possible, and we are clear the safety of all staff and passengers is a priority.""

"Takeaway firm Deliveroo and 300 restaurant groups are urging the government to run Eat Out to Help Out again when restaurants finally reopen. They said the discount scheme, which gave 50% off meals in August, would boost demand for ailing restaurants. They also said other urgent support was needed to stop ""viable"" hospitality firms failing despite optimism about the vaccination programme. It came as one worried pub boss called for pubs to be reopened by April. Young & Co's Patrick Dardis accused the government of a ""lack of respect"" for the sector and of basing the decision to close pubs on ""unproven"" science - a claim which experts dispute. In a letter to the prime minister, Deliveroo and partners including Itsu and Pizza Hut said that with all restaurant businesses closed, many were ""under immense financial pressure"". ""Even when they are able to reopen to customers, restrictions around mixing of households and social distancing measures mean that a return to trading at full capacity will remain dependent on the successful vaccine rollout,"" they wrote. They said continued government support was ""critical"" to protect jobs, adding: ""The withdrawal of support too early or too suddenly risks viable businesses failing just as the light at the end of the tunnel is becoming clearer."" They said the Eat Out to Help Out scheme had helped restaurants ""survive"" in 2020 and should be run again ""when it is safe to do so"". Eat Out to Help Out: Diners claim 100 million meals Pubs plead for reopening date after sales halve The scheme - which gave discounts of up to Â£10 per diner on food and soft drinks from Mondays to Wednesdays - was used 100 million times in August. The impact was felt after the scheme ended too. ""The boost the scheme provided not only helped protect restaurants from closure but also showed customers the work we have done to make sure they are safe and can get back to enjoying great food,"" the letter said. It also called for support measures including: Extending the 5% VAT rate - reduced from 20% last year - on restaurant food until at least the end of 2021 Extending business rates relief for the retail and restaurant sectors for a further financial year Maintaining the furlough scheme as long as is necessary Supporting businesses to manage their rental arrears And prioritising hospitality staff for small-site rapid testing and vaccination In a separate letter to the prime minister, Young's & Co's Mr Dardis accused the government of a ""lack of interest and respect"" regarding the plight of pubs. He said major pub chief executives, including himself, were quitting an industry forum set up by small business minister Paul Scully. He declined to name the executives. He added that the industry needed a ""road map"" to reopening with social distancing restrictions in place, but that these should only be in place for a few months. Questioning the science behind the current pub restrictions, he said: ""We are shocked and appalled that the government is basing its decisions to keep the great British pub closed on unproven and unfounded statistics."" A government spokesman said: ""We are deeply disappointed that some pub leaders have decided to step back from meetings with ministers. ""As we plan our way out of restrictions, we will continue to engage relentlessly with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic, and our door remains firmly open,"" he said. Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said talk of reopening pubs by April was premature. ""What the executives of pubs need to know is that failure to get it right equals back to square one. And back to square one equals much more pain economically, much more hardship."" He added: ""Whichever way you want to cut it, you drink alcohol to relax and have a bonhomie with your friends. ""One of the consequences of relaxing is that you drop your guard,"" he said. Dr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor at the University of Leicester, agreed. The consultant virologist said: ""Opening pubs will bring more people into closer contact with each other - this will allow the virus to spread - we already know and understand this concept.""

"A screengrab from a video called Ask the Experts Activists have been targeting people with fears about vaccines in a social media blitz. In an experiment, BBC Panorama showed a panel one video filled with falsehoods to see how it affected their willingness to get a jab. In a sleepy suburb of Norwich, 83-year-old Rosemary opens a WhatsApp message from a relative. It contains a video called Ask the Experts. The clip features people with impressive medical and scientific titles based in the UK, US, Spain and Sweden. Some allege, contrary to the evidence, that Covid-19 vaccines are unsafe, that they can alter a person's DNA - and even that the pandemic is somehow not real. Rosemary is frightened - and suddenly unsure about whether she'll get vaccinated. ""It sounded so real and the people were so plausible and they were named as clinicians and doctors,"" she says. With the majority of the elderly and at-risk groups having had their jabs, the next big challenge for the government is to vaccinate everyone else in the UK. Most people say they want a jab, but the latest anti-vaccine tactics deployed by a committed minority seek to exploit people's nervousness. Rosemary and her husband Donald were concerned about the video they received via WhatsApp Rosemary is just one of millions exposed to tactics used by anti-vaccine activists - a loose collection of people who make a variety of claims about vaccines, including suggesting they are dangerous and a form of state control. Over the course of 27 minutes, the Ask the Experts video relentlessly introduces 33 people, many brandishing their credentials, often sitting in what look like medical consultation rooms. They confidently and calmly repeat similar messages - although many of the claims are misleading or just plain untrue. Rosemary was left shocked as these people - who looked similar to the doctors she would usually turn to for sound advice -  said that Covid-19 was ""not a real medical pandemic"", that vaccines alter your DNA, that they cause infertility and that they're part of a deliberate global plan to hurt people. No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked Will I get side effects from the vaccine? She's not alone in being scared by the video. One London council has issued a warning after the Ask The Experts video started circulating in Asian and black communities. These groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus - and there are indications that some ethnic minority groups have a higher level of reluctance when it comes to Covid-19 vaccines. ""The fact that they are targeting it at those communities will mean that there will be people who die as a result of not having the vaccine,"" says Westminster council leader Rachael Robathan. Fears low BAME vaccine uptake will 'cause deaths' 'How my foot became anti-vaccine propaganda' Despite being removed from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, it's been claimed that Ask the Experts has been seen more than 250,000 times. It's gone viral on WhatsApp and its producers have been asking for donations via PayPal. The video is just one part of an online anti-vaccine blitz. Exclusive research by BBC Monitoring has found a huge increase in followers of social media accounts promoting anti-vaccine material during the pandemic. These aren't accounts asking legitimate medical questions - but people and organisations who've already made up their minds against vaccinations, and are manufacturing evidence or twisting facts to support their conclusions. On Instagram, the number of followers of major anti-vaccination accounts increased nearly five-fold in 2020, to more than four million. On Facebook, the top anti-vaccination pages grew by 19% in the last year and followers of Twitter accounts sharing anti-vaccine claims almost trebled. The increases came alongside a huge overall surge in people seeking out health information online due to the pandemic. But the raw numbers still mean false anti-vaccine claims are reaching millions more than ever before. How do the misinformation and conspiracy theories pushed by the video affect the views of people who have legitimate questions about vaccines? I ran a test for BBC Panorama. Our team assembled a panel of eight people from across the country who were unsure about having a Covid-19 vaccine. Logging on to a Zoom call on a January evening, they view the Ask the Experts video as we observe their reactions. Six of the eight people who volunteered to watch the anti-vaccine film Our experiment happens under the watchful eye of Dr Liam Smeeth, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who's also a GP. Rob - a 27-year-old volunteer radio DJ in Norfolk who's spending the latest lockdown trying to raise people's spirits with music - questions the speed of vaccine trials. It's a concern shared by 20-year-old law student Phoebe, who has other worries. ""Every time I search about the Covid vaccine and fertility, it literally changes, so often it's quite overwhelming,"" she says. Experts say that the coronavirus vaccines have gone through the same rigorous process as other vaccines - and there's no biological mechanism by which it could affect fertility. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? The unfounded claims about vaccines and fertility After expressing their concerns, the panel begins watching Ask the Experts. I didn't tell them what the video was about - and reactions vary. Eddie, a 76-year-old from Northumberland, furrows his brow in front of a backdrop of watercolours he's painted during lockdown. ""I thought at first 'Are these actors? Is this just a sham?'"" he says. ""And as I went on, I realised that they were real."" Another person in the video appears wearing a white lab coat, pictured in what looks like a hospital. Matt - a 31-year-old who works in IT - nods along, listening attentively. ""I feel I could trust some of them,"" he says, eyes glued to the screen. But the footage turns off others. As one of the people in the video argues, with an air of authority, that this is ""not a real medical pandemic"", Russell from Norwich puts his head in his hands. He was ill with coronavirus last year. ""Blimey! It's like being hit over the head a number of times. For half-an-hour,"" he says. ""I feel like I'm being brainwashed."" Phoebe, the law student, also senses she's being fed misinformation. She crumples her face in disgust. ""If these people are saying the virus isn't real, I'm less inclined to believe what they say about the vaccine being dangerous,"" she says. However, after watching the video half of the group says they are more worried about having a Covid-19 vaccine than before. ""It's being rushed, and there hasn't been too much information,"" says decorator Steven from Inverness, who has had cancer. ""I do agree with all that part of it."" Shaun, who's a chef, was also swayed. ""The video says what I've had in the back of my mind,"" he says, running his hand through his hair as he tries to make sense of what he has just watched. Dr Smeeth's main fear, that the video would amplify people's pre-existing fears, has materialised. He wants any doctor or professional promoting false claims to face disciplinary action. ""I would certainly be very pro them being investigated and any evidence of harm being looked at,"" he says, ""and them being stopped from using their title."" We have one more question - in the face of bad health information, can accurate advice from a respected expert increase trust in science? One by one, Dr Smeeth tackles the concerns raised by the panel. The vaccine doesn't change your DNA, he explains. It has been through animal trials, and there's no biological mechanism by which it would affect your fertility, he adds. After the discussion, all our volunteers say they're leaning towards having the vaccine. And some are even enthusiastic. ""I will definitely have it now,"" says Eddie, the painter from Northumberland, chuckling as he logs off. Back in Norwich, once Rosemary also realised that many of the claims made in the video were false, she made her decision. Rosemary and Donald met 60 years ago out dancing. During the pandemic they have made do, dancing the cha cha cha in their garage ""I'm so relieved to be getting the vaccine,"" she told me as her husband Donald prepared to visit their local GP. Panorama contacted all 33 people in the video. Eleven responded - four defended the video's contents, five said if we referred to them as anti-vaccine they'd take legal action, and one made no comment. Another acknowledged the virus is real and causes diseases and deaths, but said the measures to manage the pandemic are disproportionate. Panorama invited Oracle Films, which produced the video, to comment. The filmmakers chose not to. After Panorama contacted PayPal about the request for donations, its account was taken down. Facebook - which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram - removed a number of the pages and posts flagged by Panorama. The company says it continues to step up its enforcement policies about harmful misinformation and actively points people towards credible information. Twitter gave us a similar statement and said it's prioritising the removal of Covid-19 content that could potentially cause harm. But the Ask the Experts video is still in circulation on WhatsApp - one of thousands of videos and posts by anti-vaccine activists, who are still fighting to scare people away with false claims.

"Two of the highest death rates in Wales are in the Rhondda Cynon Taf local authority area Poverty and health inequality are behind the high Covid death rates in the south Wales valleys, a public health boss has said. InRhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) the rate is 340.3 deaths per 100,000 population- the third highest in the UK. But, Cwm Taf Morgannwg's director for public health said the rate had been predictable. The Welsh Government said an ""unprecedented series of interventions"" was made to protect people's health. Kelechi Nnoaham, director for public health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg, said the issues that led the problem ""we've known about for years"" and this result could have been foreseen. ""It is fundamentally about poverty and health inequalities,"" Dr Nnoaham said. ""If someone had pulled any one of us up in February 2020 and said, 'There's a pandemic coming, can you fast forward one year and assess which communities would have the most severe hit from this pandemic?', you could almost predict the picture we're seeing now with a reasonable degree of accuracy."" Two of the highest death rates in Wales are in the RCT local authority area. Tonyrefail West has seen 53 deaths, which puts its rate at 515.7 deaths per 100,000 people, and in Penrhiwceiber there have been 26 deaths - a mortality rate of 436.9 per 100,000 population. ""We have known it's poverty and health inequality for several years,"" Dr Nnoaham said. ""The question is what have we done? To what extent have we been successful in removing those vulnerabilities?"" Previous attempts to tackle poverty and the associated health inequalities have been ""tokenistic"" and have not done enough to remedy the root cause of the problems, he added. ""For many years... we have talked about the fact there's a lot of poverty in the Welsh valleys but we haven't done enough,"" he said. ""We've got to do more, there's such urgency now that we can't keep talking about health inequalities as if they're something academic."" Beyond the figures, communities are mourning. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Weekly Covid death figures show another fall 'Hope but no complacency' after valleys Covid drop Rev Peter Lewis, a vicar in Abercynon, says at the height of the pandemic, he was doing around 10 Covid-related funerals a week, but now it is closer to three a week. The clergy in the area are having training to deal with the trauma and grief they expect to be dealing with in the months and years to come. School children have been invited to make wooden hearts for Valentine's Day to hang on a memorial tree at St Gwynno's Church in Abercynon. Rev Lewis said the tree was a ""small contribution to mark that we're a community in loss."" He said though the events have led to the community becoming more resilient. One foodshare scheme, set up by Rhondda MS Leanne Wood, of Plaid Cymru, to redistribute food from supermarkets has seen demand increase over the pandemic. According to its volunteers it is not an exaggeration to say everyone in the Rhondda knows someone who has died of Covid. Janet Slade Jones, one of the volunteers, has been helping out her neighbours since March but she says the last year has been dreadful. Volunteers like Janet Slade Jones have been helping ensure their neighbours have enough food ""I've been to more than 10 funerals this year"", she said. Fellow foodshare volunteer Trish Denning, a retired teacher, said: ""It's really scary."" ""A lot of the time I feel in a state of shock when I look at the statistics but you are aware of the population of RCT as an ex-mining valleys. We have a lot of health issues."" Leanne Wood MS said jobs should be the priority to help reduce poverty and health inequality. Ms Wood said: ""The numbers of people who are employed with good jobs in this constituency is way too low. ""Not enough attention has been paid by UK Government, Welsh Government and the local authority in terms of that all important job creation so that's something that's going to have to change"". A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Coronavirus is the biggest single global public health crisis the world has faced in more than a generation and has had a significant impact on every aspect of our lives. ""That's why we've mobilised all our resources to respond to the pandemic, launching an unprecedented series of interventions to protect people's health, wellbeing and livelihoods. We will continue to do all we can to support everyone in Wales in the weeks and months ahead."" Politics Wales is on at 10:00 GMT on BBC One, Sunday 14 February.

They said continued government support was ""critical"" to protect jobs, adding: ""The withdrawal of support too early or too suddenly risks viable businesses failing just as the light at the end of the tunnel is becoming clearer."" They said the Eat Out to Help Out scheme had helped restaurants ""survive"" in 2020 and should be run again ""when it is safe to do so"". Eat Out to Help Out: Diners claim 100 million meals Pubs plead for reopening date after sales halve The scheme - which gave discounts of up to Â£10 per diner on food and soft drinks from Mondays to Wednesdays - was used 100 million times in August. The impact was felt after the scheme ended too. ""The boost the scheme provided not only helped protect restaurants from closure but also showed customers the work we have done to make sure they are safe and can get back to enjoying great food,"" the letter said. It also called for support measures including: Extending the 5% VAT rate - reduced from 20% last year - on restaurant food until at least the end of 2021 Extending business rates relief for the retail and restaurant sectors for a further financial year Maintaining the furlough scheme as long as is necessary Supporting businesses to manage their rental arrears And prioritising hospitality staff for small-site rapid testing and vaccination In a separate letter to the prime minister, Young's & Co's Mr Dardis accused the government of a ""lack of interest and respect"" regarding the plight of pubs. He said major pub chief executives, including himself, were quitting an industry forum set up by small business minister Paul Scully. He declined to name the executives. He added that the industry needed a ""road map"" to reopening with social distancing restrictions in place, but that these should only be in place for a few months. Questioning the science behind the current pub restrictions, he said: ""We are shocked and appalled that the government is basing its decisions to keep the great British pub closed on unproven and unfounded statistics."" A government spokesman said: ""We are deeply disappointed that some pub leaders have decided to step back from meetings with ministers. ""As we plan our way out of restrictions, we will continue to engage relentlessly with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic, and our door remains firmly open,"" he said. Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said talk of reopening pubs by April was premature. ""What the executives of pubs need to know is that failure to get it right equals back to square one. And back to square one equals much more pain economically, much more hardship."" He added: ""Whichever way you want to cut it, you drink alcohol to relax and have a bonhomie with your friends. ""One of the consequences of relaxing is that you drop your guard,"" he said. Dr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor at the University of Leicester, agreed. The consultant virologist said: ""Opening pubs will bring more people into closer contact with each other - this will allow the virus to spread - we already know and understand this concept.""

"A screengrab from a video called Ask the Experts Activists have been targeting people with fears about vaccines in a social media blitz. In an experiment, BBC Panorama showed a panel one video filled with falsehoods to see how it affected their willingness to get a jab. In a sleepy suburb of Norwich, 83-year-old Rosemary opens a WhatsApp message from a relative. It contains a video called Ask the Experts. The clip features people with impressive medical and scientific titles based in the UK, US, Spain and Sweden. Some allege, contrary to the evidence, that Covid-19 vaccines are unsafe, that they can alter a person's DNA - and even that the pandemic is somehow not real. Rosemary is frightened - and suddenly unsure about whether she'll get vaccinated. ""It sounded so real and the people were so plausible and they were named as clinicians and doctors,"" she says. With the majority of the elderly and at-risk groups having had their jabs, the next big challenge for the government is to vaccinate everyone else in the UK. Most people say they want a jab, but the latest anti-vaccine tactics deployed by a committed minority seek to exploit people's nervousness. Rosemary and her husband Donald were concerned about the video they received via WhatsApp Rosemary is just one of millions exposed to tactics used by anti-vaccine activists - a loose collection of people who make a variety of claims about vaccines, including suggesting they are dangerous and a form of state control. Over the course of 27 minutes, the Ask the Experts video relentlessly introduces 33 people, many brandishing their credentials, often sitting in what look like medical consultation rooms. They confidently and calmly repeat similar messages - although many of the claims are misleading or just plain untrue. Rosemary was left shocked as these people - who looked similar to the doctors she would usually turn to for sound advice -  said that Covid-19 was ""not a real medical pandemic"", that vaccines alter your DNA, that they cause infertility and that they're part of a deliberate global plan to hurt people. No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked Will I get side effects from the vaccine? She's not alone in being scared by the video. One London council has issued a warning after the Ask The Experts video started circulating in Asian and black communities. These groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus - and there are indications that some ethnic minority groups have a higher level of reluctance when it comes to Covid-19 vaccines. ""The fact that they are targeting it at those communities will mean that there will be people who die as a result of not having the vaccine,"" says Westminster council leader Rachael Robathan. Fears low BAME vaccine uptake will 'cause deaths' 'How my foot became anti-vaccine propaganda' Despite being removed from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, it's been claimed that Ask the Experts has been seen more than 250,000 times. It's gone viral on WhatsApp and its producers have been asking for donations via PayPal. The video is just one part of an online anti-vaccine blitz. Exclusive research by BBC Monitoring has found a huge increase in followers of social media accounts promoting anti-vaccine material during the pandemic. These aren't accounts asking legitimate medical questions - but people and organisations who've already made up their minds against vaccinations, and are manufacturing evidence or twisting facts to support their conclusions. On Instagram, the number of followers of major anti-vaccination accounts increased nearly five-fold in 2020, to more than four million. On Facebook, the top anti-vaccination pages grew by 19% in the last year and followers of Twitter accounts sharing anti-vaccine claims almost trebled. The increases came alongside a huge overall surge in people seeking out health information online due to the pandemic. But the raw numbers still mean false anti-vaccine claims are reaching millions more than ever before. How do the misinformation and conspiracy theories pushed by the video affect the views of people who have legitimate questions about vaccines? I ran a test for BBC Panorama. Our team assembled a panel of eight people from across the country who were unsure about having a Covid-19 vaccine. Logging on to a Zoom call on a January evening, they view the Ask the Experts video as we observe their reactions. Six of the eight people who volunteered to watch the anti-vaccine film Our experiment happens under the watchful eye of Dr Liam Smeeth, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who's also a GP. Rob - a 27-year-old volunteer radio DJ in Norfolk who's spending the latest lockdown trying to raise people's spirits with music - questions the speed of vaccine trials. It's a concern shared by 20-year-old law student Phoebe, who has other worries. ""Every time I search about the Covid vaccine and fertility, it literally changes, so often it's quite overwhelming,"" she says. Experts say that the coronavirus vaccines have gone through the same rigorous process as other vaccines - and there's no biological mechanism by which it could affect fertility. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? The unfounded claims about vaccines and fertility After expressing their concerns, the panel begins watching Ask the Experts. I didn't tell them what the video was about - and reactions vary. Eddie, a 76-year-old from Northumberland, furrows his brow in front of a backdrop of watercolours he's painted during lockdown. ""I thought at first 'Are these actors? Is this just a sham?'"" he says. ""And as I went on, I realised that they were real."" Another person in the video appears wearing a white lab coat, pictured in what looks like a hospital. Matt - a 31-year-old who works in IT - nods along, listening attentively. ""I feel I could trust some of them,"" he says, eyes glued to the screen. But the footage turns off others. As one of the people in the video argues, with an air of authority, that this is ""not a real medical pandemic"", Russell from Norwich puts his head in his hands. He was ill with coronavirus last year. ""Blimey! It's like being hit over the head a number of times. For half-an-hour,"" he says. ""I feel like I'm being brainwashed."" Phoebe, the law student, also senses she's being fed misinformation. She crumples her face in disgust. ""If these people are saying the virus isn't real, I'm less inclined to believe what they say about the vaccine being dangerous,"" she says. However, after watching the video half of the group says they are more worried about having a Covid-19 vaccine than before. ""It's being rushed, and there hasn't been too much information,"" says decorator Steven from Inverness, who has had cancer. ""I do agree with all that part of it."" Shaun, who's a chef, was also swayed. ""The video says what I've had in the back of my mind,"" he says, running his hand through his hair as he tries to make sense of what he has just watched. Dr Smeeth's main fear, that the video would amplify people's pre-existing fears, has materialised. He wants any doctor or professional promoting false claims to face disciplinary action. ""I would certainly be very pro them being investigated and any evidence of harm being looked at,"" he says, ""and them being stopped from using their title."" We have one more question - in the face of bad health information, can accurate advice from a respected expert increase trust in science? One by one, Dr Smeeth tackles the concerns raised by the panel. The vaccine doesn't change your DNA, he explains. It has been through animal trials, and there's no biological mechanism by which it would affect your fertility, he adds. After the discussion, all our volunteers say they're leaning towards having the vaccine. And some are even enthusiastic. ""I will definitely have it now,"" says Eddie, the painter from Northumberland, chuckling as he logs off. Back in Norwich, once Rosemary also realised that many of the claims made in the video were false, she made her decision. Rosemary and Donald met 60 years ago out dancing. During the pandemic they have made do, dancing the cha cha cha in their garage ""I'm so relieved to be getting the vaccine,"" she told me as her husband Donald prepared to visit their local GP. Panorama contacted all 33 people in the video. Eleven responded - four defended the video's contents, five said if we referred to them as anti-vaccine they'd take legal action, and one made no comment. Another acknowledged the virus is real and causes diseases and deaths, but said the measures to manage the pandemic are disproportionate. Panorama invited Oracle Films, which produced the video, to comment. The filmmakers chose not to. After Panorama contacted PayPal about the request for donations, its account was taken down. Facebook - which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram - removed a number of the pages and posts flagged by Panorama. The company says it continues to step up its enforcement policies about harmful misinformation and actively points people towards credible information. Twitter gave us a similar statement and said it's prioritising the removal of Covid-19 content that could potentially cause harm. But the Ask the Experts video is still in circulation on WhatsApp - one of thousands of videos and posts by anti-vaccine activists, who are still fighting to scare people away with false claims.

"Ebola is spread through close physical contact with infected people Guinea has officially declared that it is dealing with an Ebola epidemic after the deaths of at least three people from the virus. They - and four others - fell ill with diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding after attending the burial of a nurse. Newly developed vaccines will be acquired through the World Health Organization (WHO), officials said. Between 2013 and 2016 more than 11,000 people died in the West Africa Ebola epidemic, which began in Guinea. Why Ebola is so dangerous First Ebola case linked to bat play In response to that epidemic, which mainly affected Guinea and its neighbours Liberia and Sierra Leone, several vaccines were trialled, which have since been successfully used to fight outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""The WHO is on full alert and is in contact with the manufacturer [of a vaccine] to ensure the necessary doses are made available as quickly as possible to help fight back,"" the AFP news agency quotes Alfred George Ki-Zerbo, the WHO representative in Guinea, as saying. An Ebola vaccine wasfirst trialled over four months in 2015 in Guinea- and drugs that can increase the survival rate of patients have also been developed in recent years. A nurse who worked a health centre in GouekÃ©, near the south-eastern city of NzÃ©rÃ©korÃ©, died on 28 January and her funeral was held four days later. This video can not be played Some simple techniques can help prevent spread of Ebola. Community funerals, where people help wash the body of the person who has died, can be a key way of spreading Ebola in the earlier stages of an outbreak. The bodies of victims are particularly toxic. The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Ebola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. Bushmeat - non-domesticated forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the Ebola virus. It then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. All those infected at the funeral of the nurse were over the age of 25, health officials say. Following a crisis meeting on Sunday, the health ministry said all cases had been isolated, contact tracing was ongoing and a treatment centre was to be set up in GouekÃ©. This new outbreak is in roughly the same area where the epidemic began in December 2013. Given the cross border trade between Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and their relatively weak healthcare systems, there is concern the outbreak could spread. Liberia's President George Weah has put the health authorities on heightened alert. The BBC's Umaru Fofana in Sierra Leone says there is far more fear of Ebola in the country than Covid-19. He says the existence of new vaccines does provide some sense of relief -there is a global emergency stockpile of 500,000, made available through Gavi,external, the international vaccine alliance. The three countries have a joint population of 22.5 million, prompting concerns that manufacturers would have little time to produce more if needed at a time when Covid vaccines are their preoccupation, our reporter says. Experts say containment is key to fighting the disease. During the 2015 trial in Guinea - 100 patients were identified and then close contacts were either vaccinated immediately, or three weeks later. In the 2,014 close contacts who were vaccinated immediately there were no subsequent cases of Ebola. Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola Patients tend to die from dehydration and multiple organ failure From Ebola survivor to trainee doctor First Ebola case linked to bat play Is this the tree where Ebola started?

"More than 15 million people in the UK have now had their first coronavirus vaccine, in what Boris Johnson described as a ""significant milestone"". The PM hailed the ""extraordinary feat"", reached just over two months after thefirst jab was given on 8 December. It comes as the government is expected to announce on Monday it has met its pledge to offer a jab to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK. The rollout is now beingexpanded to over-65sand the clinically vulnerable. In a video,Mr Johnson praised,externala ""truly national, UK-wide effort"", adding that in England the jab had been offered to all those in thetop four priority groups,external. Wales has also met the target. But ""no-one is resting on their laurels,"" Mr Johnson said. ""We've still got a long way to go to. And there will undoubtedly be bumps in the road. But after all we've achieved, I know we can go forward with great confidence."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Will I get side effects from the vaccine? Sunday'sdaily coronavirus figures,externalshow 15,062,189 people have now received an initial vaccine dose - after 505,362 first jabs were given out on Saturday. A further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, taking the death toll by that measure to 117,166. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. There were 10,972 new cases reported, bringing the total number of recorded infections to 4,038,078. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the 15 million milestone was a ""remarkable shared achievement"" - reached 10 weeks after the first vaccine was administered in the UK. ""The NHS vaccination programme is the biggest and fastest in Europe - and in the health service's history - and that is down to the skill, care, and downright hard work of our fantastic staff, supported by local communities, volunteers and the armed forces,"" he said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it meant one in every four adults was now ""starting to receive protection from this dreadful disease"". But he cautioned: ""There is so much more to do and I urge anyone eligible to step forward and take up their appointment. The vaccine is our route to freedom - we will beat this virus jab by jab."" So far the vaccination programme has been aimed at thetop four priority groups,external, including NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, over-70s, and people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable. These groups have accounted for 88% of the UK's Covid-19 deaths so far,according to the Department of Health and Social Care,externaland are estimated by the JCVI to be some 15 million people. A small number of the 15 million to receive a jab will have been outside these priority groups. Ruth Rankine, director of the NHS Confederation's PCN Network of GP practices, paid tribute to the ""incredible accomplishment"" but added that ""until everyone is protected, no one is protected"". ""There is still work to do to administer first doses to all the remaining people from the first four cohorts, as well as moving down the cohorts until everyone has at least been offered a jab, not to mention beginning the work of administering second doses,"" she said. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said ministers needed to ""lock in the gains of vaccination"" and introduce further measures to reduce the spread of the disease. This included increased financial support for those who have to self-isolate, updated guidance on masks and help to make workplaces Covid secure. It is undeniable the vaccine programme has overall been a success - only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have done more jabs per head. But as well as pushing ahead with the under-70s, efforts need to continue to reach out to those not yet vaccinated in these first groups. There have been reports of housebound patients still waiting, while some have questioned whether enough has been done to reach out to those who have concerns and have not taken up the offer. The fear is uptake may be lowest in some of the most vulnerable communities and that risks widening health inequalities. People will also ask what this means for unlocking. Those offered the jab account for around five in six deaths but just over half of hospitalisations. That leaves a lot of vulnerable at risk - and with the numbers in hospital still above the peak in the first wave, the NHS isn't yet out of the woods. From Monday, the vaccination programme enters a new phase, with over-65s and the clinically vulnerable being invited to book a jab. The JCVI defines clinically vulnerable people as those with conditions including chronic respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and severe asthma. Some regions have already started vaccinating people aged 65 to 69, with NHS England having previously said that people in this age group could get a vaccine if GPs had supplies. This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab: ""You can't get ahead of the evidence"" Earlier, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabrejected calls from MPs in his party to put a date on when England's lockdown measures will be eased, saying the government will be ""cautious"". On Saturday, the prime minister said he was""optimistic"" he will be able to set out plans later this month for a ""cautious"" easing of England's lockdown, citing ""huge progress"" made with the vaccine rollout. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? The UK is currently administering doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and the one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. A third vaccine, made by US company Moderna, has been approved but supplies are not expected to be available until spring. The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use. Its vaccination rate isthe third highest in the world, behind only Israel and the UAE.

"This video can not be played Rachael Prigmore has two sons, who were both born prematurely and spent time in neonatal units. Rachael Prigmore has twice faced the experience of giving birth to a baby prematurely and having to watch, with hope and fear, as her children spent weeks in neonatal care. The 35-year-old from Bexleyheath, south-east London, said the time was ""heart-breaking"" for her and her partner - but they were also faced with the additional financial pressures brought on by a child coming early. She has joined with charities and MPs calling for the government to bring in pay and leave for parents who have babies in neonatal care, to stop future parents feeling ""cheated out of time"" with their new arrival. May: Parents of sick and premature babies should get more leave Parents of premature babies face a further trauma of PTSD The tiny premature baby who fought off coronavirus Over 100,000 babies are cared for in neonatal units in the UK every year, either because they are born prematurely - before 37 weeks - or because they are born at full term but sick. This means around one in seven babies born in the UK are admitted to a neonatal unit each year. Charities such as Bliss, which supports families of babies born prematurely or sick, have been campaigning for the government to provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave for parents of babies who need that neonatal care, amounting to around Â£160 a week. They say the support would stop families' parental leave being eaten into when their children are in hospital and make sure they can afford to be with them when they are needed most. Campaigners celebrated when, in March 2020,the chancellor included the pledge in his Budget. But Rishi Sunak'sred book,externaldoesn't allocate the annual Â£15m spend on the policy until 2023 at the earliest, and legislation to bring it in has not emerged. So, almost a year after the promise was made - with new parents facing the added extra pressures of the pandemic - there is no start date in sight. In 2016, Rachael had her first child, Jack, at 31 weeks, weighing just 3lb 14oz, and she said it was ""a complete shock to the system"". She added: ""I wasn't even aware of what neonatal care was, and although I got a chance to look around the unit, it was a very frightening time."" Jack was in the unit for five weeks and Rachael had to start her maternity leave early, seeing her normal pay significantly cut. Her partner carried on working while their baby boy was getting treatment. ""We knew we were having a baby so had been saving, but when my maternity pay kicked in so early, it had a massive impact financially, while at the same time as you are trying to juggle everything else that is going on,"" said Rachael. ""My partner was entitled to two weeks paternity leave, but we didn't want to use it straight away so we could wait until Jack came home. But that meant he was having to get the train every morning, come straight to hospital at night, and then start all over."" When their second son, Joshua, arrived in June 2020, Rachael had only reached 28 weeks, and was facing another stressful time with her tiny 2lb 10oz on the neonatal unit - and with the addition of coronavirus restrictions to contend with. Joshua was born at just 28 weeks ""The hospital was 45 minutes away, we couldn't have visitors, we were having to travel back and forth, and it was an absolute nightmare,"" said Rachael. ""Again, we were trying to keep my partner's paternity leave on hold, but he was also trying to work, look after my other son, keep the house running... it was absolutely crazy times."" The costs were adding up, from hospital parking charges upwards of Â£60 a week through to just being able to grab a quick coffee to keep going. But what also worried Rachael was the knowledge she was using up maternity leave, and would have to return to work sooner than she wanted to. Rachael said: ""You are worrying about your child as it is when they are in the neonatal unit, but also at the back of your head you are thinking it is eating into your time and all these plans you had. ""You know you are going to go back to work at some point but you feel you haven't had time to enjoy your child."" Both of Rachael's boys are now at home, happy and healthy - but she still feels the effect. ""I felt rushed both times,"" she said. ""I felt I had only just got them home when I went back to work and they still looked like new-born babies. I feel we were cheated out of our time."" Both Jack and Joshua (pictured with Rachael) are doing well at home Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones has been campaigning in Parliament for the extra support of neonatal leave and pay to be brought forward. Not only is she the vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Premature and Sick Babies, but she went through the experience herself when her son Sullivan spent five days in neonatal care after being born in 2019. ""It was so challenging for us and for me to go through as a first time mother, but we had a really good support network and my husband's employer was really good,"" she said. ""Unfortunately many, many families aren't as lucky. ""I have heard from friends and others who didn't have that support, who had to go back to work immediately with all their parental leave swallowed up."" Ms Davis-Jones said she had met Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss the issue, as well as business ministers, but while there have been positive noises, action is not coming fast enough. ""Coronavirus has shown when there is political will, things can happen quickly,"" said the MP. She made a direct appeal to Boris Johnson, who is a new father himself, adding: ""This is time these families will never get back. Some babies never even make it home and this is the only time they will have with them. It is a lifeline."" Alex Davies-Jones with her son, Sullivan Head of policy and campaigns for Bliss, Josie Anderson, also appealed to the government ""not to lose sight"" of their promise and to bring in the measures as soon as possible. Research from the charity found two-fifths of mothers wanted to take more time away from work because of neonatal care, but couldn't afford to, while two-thirds of fathers and partners had to return to work before their baby had even left hospital. Ms Anderson said: ""For families it is an enormous issue. It stops hands-on care, which leads to best outcomes for babies, and there is a financial element to that is impacting how involved families are able to be, making them lose out on valuable time bonding with their baby."" A spokeswoman from the government's business department, said: ""Having a premature or sick baby can be an incredibly difficult time for parents, especially when juggling work commitments. ""As part of our manifesto commitment to make workplaces fairer, we will be legislating to introduce neonatal leave and pay as soon as parliamentary time allows.""

"Takeaway firm Deliveroo and 300 restaurant groups are urging the government to run Eat Out to Help Out again when restaurants finally reopen. They said the discount scheme, which gave 50% off meals in August, would boost demand for ailing restaurants. They also said other urgent support was needed to stop ""viable"" hospitality firms failing despite optimism about the vaccination programme. It came as one worried pub boss called for pubs to be reopened by April. Young & Co's Patrick Dardis accused the government of a ""lack of respect"" for the sector and of basing the decision to close pubs on ""unproven"" science - a claim which experts dispute. In a letter to the prime minister, Deliveroo and partners including Itsu and Pizza Hut said that with all restaurant businesses closed, many were ""under immense financial pressure"". ""Even when they are able to reopen to customers, restrictions around mixing of households and social distancing measures mean that a return to trading at full capacity will remain dependent on the successful vaccine rollout,"" they wrote. They said continued government support was ""critical"" to protect jobs, adding: ""The withdrawal of support too early or too suddenly risks viable businesses failing just as the light at the end of the tunnel is becoming clearer."" They said the Eat Out to Help Out scheme had helped restaurants ""survive"" in 2020 and should be run again ""when it is safe to do so"". Eat Out to Help Out: Diners claim 100 million meals Pubs plead for reopening date after sales halve The scheme - which gave discounts of up to Â£10 per diner on food and soft drinks from Mondays to Wednesdays - was used 100 million times in August. The impact was felt after the scheme ended too. ""The boost the scheme provided not only helped protect restaurants from closure but also showed customers the work we have done to make sure they are safe and can get back to enjoying great food,"" the letter said. It also called for support measures including: Extending the 5% VAT rate - reduced from 20% last year - on restaurant food until at least the end of 2021 Extending business rates relief for the retail and restaurant sectors for a further financial year Maintaining the furlough scheme as long as is necessary Supporting businesses to manage their rental arrears And prioritising hospitality staff for small-site rapid testing and vaccination In a separate letter to the prime minister, Young's & Co's Mr Dardis accused the government of a ""lack of interest and respect"" regarding the plight of pubs. He said major pub chief executives, including himself, were quitting an industry forum set up by small business minister Paul Scully. He declined to name the executives. He added that the industry needed a ""road map"" to reopening with social distancing restrictions in place, but that these should only be in place for a few months. Questioning the science behind the current pub restrictions, he said: ""We are shocked and appalled that the government is basing its decisions to keep the great British pub closed on unproven and unfounded statistics."" A government spokesman said: ""We are deeply disappointed that some pub leaders have decided to step back from meetings with ministers. ""As we plan our way out of restrictions, we will continue to engage relentlessly with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic, and our door remains firmly open,"" he said. Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said talk of reopening pubs by April was premature. ""What the executives of pubs need to know is that failure to get it right equals back to square one. And back to square one equals much more pain economically, much more hardship."" He added: ""Whichever way you want to cut it, you drink alcohol to relax and have a bonhomie with your friends. ""One of the consequences of relaxing is that you drop your guard,"" he said. Dr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor at the University of Leicester, agreed. The consultant virologist said: ""Opening pubs will bring more people into closer contact with each other - this will allow the virus to spread - we already know and understand this concept.""

But Dr Tom Black said he was hopeful primary schools could reopen then. The executive has agreed that schools in Northern Ireland will remainclosed at least until 8 March. ""Opening schools has an increase of between 0.3 and 0.6 in the R number, so we couldn't do that at the moment,"" said Dr Black, speaking on BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme.

This video can not be played Scottish government: Closing travel quarantine loophole is 'critical' Scotland's transport secretary has said it is ""absolutely critical"" the UK closes a loophole as new quarantine regulations are set to come into force. From 04:00 GMT on Mondayall international arrivals in Scotlandmust self-isolate in hotels for 10 days. But in England the rules only apply to arrivals from 33""red list"" countries,external. The different approaches being taken by the UK and Scottish governments have raised concerns that people arriving at English airports and ferry terminals will then travel on to Scotland. Michael Matheson has asked for Scotland-bound travellers arriving at English airports to be offered quarantine facilities in England but said ""as yet, we are still waiting for the UK government to give us agreement on that"". Passengers required to self-isolate in hotels will have to pay the Â£1,750 cost of their managed quarantine, which could encourage people to avoid this by choosing English airports - even if Scotland is their final destination. The Scottish Conservatives accused Scottish ministers of ""stoking a row"" to distract attention from the ""mess"" they had made of their own quarantine plans. Labour, meanwhile, said the Scottish government was ""clueless"" about how it would make the new rules work. Read more. Lebanon began vaccinating its citizens on Sunday It's been a busy day with updates from around the world - so here's a reminder of the key global developments: Sunday'sdaily coronavirus figures,externalshow 15,062,189 people have now received an initial dose of the vaccine - after 505,362 first jabs were given out on Saturday. 537,715 people have received their second inoculation. So far the vaccination programme has been aimed at thetop four priority groups,external, including NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, over-70s, and people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable. From Monday, the vaccine rollout is beingexpanded to include over-65sand others considered clinically vulnerable The latest government data also reveals that a further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, taking the UK death toll to 117,166. More than 23,000 patients with coronavirus are in hospital, with nearly 3,000 on mechanical ventilators.  Takeaway firm Deliveroo and 300 restaurant groups are urging the government to run Eat Out to Help Out once again when restaurants are allowed to reopen. They said the discount scheme, which encouraged people to eat out with discounts of up to Â£10 per diner in August 2020, would boost demand for ailing restaurants. They also said other urgent support was needed to stop ""viable"" hospitality firms failing - and called on the government to extend the VAT reduction on restaurant food until at least the end of 2021.

A further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, while 10,972 new cases were also reported. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, said it was ""fantastic"" that more than 15 million vaccines had been administered and the NHS was ""incredibly proud"" of the achievement. ""I have to tell you this is an extraordinary logistical effort right the way across the NHS"" he said. ""Yet again when the nation needed the NHS to deliver - we have delivered."" However, he said caution needed to be exercised over lifting restrictions. People ""shouldn't make the assumption"" that lockdown could be eased just because many of the eldest in the UK population had received their first jab. And he said the NHS would need more funding and staff if there was to be an annual Covid booster.    Analysis Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is undeniable the vaccine programme has overall been a success - only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have done more jabs per head of the population. But, as well as pushing ahead with the under-70s, we mustn't forget those not yet vaccinated in the most vulnerable groups. There have been reports of housebound patients still waiting for their jab . And some have questioned whether enough has been done to reach out to those who have concerns about vaccination, and have not taken up the offer. The fear is that vaccination uptake may be lowest in some of the most vulnerable communities - and that risks widening health inequalities. There are still a lot of vulnerable at risk - and, with the numbers in hospital still above the peak in the first wave, the NHS isn't yet out of the woods. Henk Angenent (front) has just passed the halfway stage A former champion speed skater is racing across the northern Netherlands, aiming to finish the route of a rare marathon event before a coronavirus curfew comes into force later today. Henk Angenent has battled broken ice and a recurring knee injury. The 53-year-old has just moved beyond the halfway point of the 200km (124 mile) course. He was the last winner of the Elfstedentocht - a race last held in 1997 and keenly followed by millions of fans. Ice conditions were initially seen as favourable for a new edition this year, but officials said the race could not proceed due to coronavirus restrictions. Politicians and health experts have welcomed the news that at least 15 million people in the UK have had their first coronavirus jab. NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens has hailed it as ""an important milestone"" and said the UK vaccine programme was ""the biggest and fastest in Europe"". He paid tribute to the ""skill, care and downright hard work"" of NHS staff.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK has reached a ""significant milestone"" in the coronavirus vaccination rollout, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says. In a tweet,he writes,external: ""This country has achieved an extraordinary feat - administering a total of 15 million jabs into the arms of some of the most vulnerable people in the country."" In a video alongside the tweet he adds that everyone in the top four vaccination priority groups in England has now been offered a Covid jab, marking a major step towards the government reaching its 15 February target. The PM says he will set out full details tomorrow of the progress the UK has made in vaccinating the priority groups. Announcing the latest vaccination figure on Twitter,Nadhim Zahawi writes,external: ""15,000,000! Amazing team. ""We will not rest till we offer the vaccine to the whole of phase 1, the 1-9 categories of the most vulnerable and all over 50s by end April, and then all adults."" At least 15m people in UK have had their first coronavirus jab, Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawai says. The
government said it would offer at least one vaccine dose to everyone in the top
four priority groups in the UK by 15 February. That is:  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) estimates there are about 15 million people in these four groups. But, as
far as we know, the government never explicitly put a 15 million figure on its promise. The government is
only supplying regular data about the number of people vaccinated, so there is no
breakdown of how many people in the top four priority groups have been offered a vaccine or how many have rejected an offer of a vaccine. As we reported earlier, the government has said it is prepared to discuss with other countries how a so-called ""vaccine passport"" might allow people to travel abroad on holiday - by showing they have had a jab to protect against Covid 19. Conservative backbencher David Davis says he has few reservations about vaccination passports being used to travel between countries - but he insists they should not be needed to obtain entry to a shop or an entertainment venue at home. Speaking to Radio 4's World This Weekend, Davis says the idea of domestic passports runs ""completely contrary to history and traditions"" of the UK. ""We're a free country, [we've] never had to show papers to do things,"" he says. He adds this measure would amount to ""effective discrimination between different groups of people"" and that it would ""create two classes of society, saying to people that unless you're in this category you can't enjoy theatre or football"". He warns that it would involve ""a restriction to people's freedom that would last a long time... it wouldn't be abolished"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data
on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before
deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools; followed by
outdoor mixing; non-essential shops; then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs â who have been close to the prime
minister in recent years â are urging Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when
the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and
having to reimpose restrictions in a matter of weeks. Thatâs why ministers are
being cautious at the moment â and why the foreign secretary said it would be
wrong to set an arbitrary date. The pandemic means that Valentine's Day is very different from last year, when coronavirus had only just reached the UK. Following nearly a year of social distancing, lockdowns and limited opportunities to socialise in person, some couples have been thinking about how to make the day special even though they are apart. Others will be trying to find some time for romance while cooped up at home with young children. The BBC has beenasking people how they are celebrating this year, including LondonersDeep Bajwa, 37 andBhavin Bhagalia, 39, who say this Valentine's will be a day for the family and their children are in charge of planning the festivities.  Deep Bajwa says her children have planned their day We've also been looking at how restaurants - usually booked up with Valentine's dates - haveadapted their offeringsthis year. Eateries from local cafes to Michelin-starred restaurants are packaging up special dinners as a treat, in a bid to keep customers coming back when the pandemic is over. For Ruth Smith, who lives in East Molesey, near London, it's an opportunity for a fancy meal on Valentine's Day without being surrounded by loved-up couples. She will be getting a three-course meal kit from her local cafe, choosing from twice-baked cheese souffle with fennel and apple salad, individual beef Wellington, vanilla panna cotta with cardamom, and rose infused streusel. ""It means I'm really looking forward to Valentine's Day rather than kind of thinking, oh I'm going to be on my own and really not concerned at all this year,"" she says. Read more here.

Henk Angenent (front) has just passed the halfway stage A former champion speed skater is racing across the northern Netherlands, aiming to finish the route of a rare marathon event before a coronavirus curfew comes into force later today. Henk Angenent has battled broken ice and a recurring knee injury. The 53-year-old has just moved beyond the halfway point of the 200km (124 mile) course. He was the last winner of the Elfstedentocht - a race last held in 1997 and keenly followed by millions of fans. Ice conditions were initially seen as favourable for a new edition this year, but officials said the race could not proceed due to coronavirus restrictions. Politicians and health experts have welcomed the news that at least 15 million people in the UK have had their first coronavirus jab. NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens has hailed it as ""an important milestone"" and said the UK vaccine programme was ""the biggest and fastest in Europe"". He paid tribute to the ""skill, care and downright hard work"" of NHS staff.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK has reached a ""significant milestone"" in the coronavirus vaccination rollout, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says. In a tweet,he writes,external: ""This country has achieved an extraordinary feat - administering a total of 15 million jabs into the arms of some of the most vulnerable people in the country."" In a video alongside the tweet he adds that everyone in the top four vaccination priority groups in England has now been offered a Covid jab, marking a major step towards the government reaching its 15 February target. The PM says he will set out full details tomorrow of the progress the UK has made in vaccinating the priority groups. Announcing the latest vaccination figure on Twitter,Nadhim Zahawi writes,external: ""15,000,000! Amazing team. ""We will not rest till we offer the vaccine to the whole of phase 1, the 1-9 categories of the most vulnerable and all over 50s by end April, and then all adults."" At least 15m people in UK have had their first coronavirus jab, Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawai says. The
government said it would offer at least one vaccine dose to everyone in the top
four priority groups in the UK by 15 February. That is:  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) estimates there are about 15 million people in these four groups. But, as
far as we know, the government never explicitly put a 15 million figure on its promise. The government is
only supplying regular data about the number of people vaccinated, so there is no
breakdown of how many people in the top four priority groups have been offered a vaccine or how many have rejected an offer of a vaccine. As we reported earlier, the government has said it is prepared to discuss with other countries how a so-called ""vaccine passport"" might allow people to travel abroad on holiday - by showing they have had a jab to protect against Covid 19. Conservative backbencher David Davis says he has few reservations about vaccination passports being used to travel between countries - but he insists they should not be needed to obtain entry to a shop or an entertainment venue at home. Speaking to Radio 4's World This Weekend, Davis says the idea of domestic passports runs ""completely contrary to history and traditions"" of the UK. ""We're a free country, [we've] never had to show papers to do things,"" he says. He adds this measure would amount to ""effective discrimination between different groups of people"" and that it would ""create two classes of society, saying to people that unless you're in this category you can't enjoy theatre or football"". He warns that it would involve ""a restriction to people's freedom that would last a long time... it wouldn't be abolished"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data
on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before
deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools; followed by
outdoor mixing; non-essential shops; then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs â who have been close to the prime
minister in recent years â are urging Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when
the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and
having to reimpose restrictions in a matter of weeks. Thatâs why ministers are
being cautious at the moment â and why the foreign secretary said it would be
wrong to set an arbitrary date. The pandemic means that Valentine's Day is very different from last year, when coronavirus had only just reached the UK. Following nearly a year of social distancing, lockdowns and limited opportunities to socialise in person, some couples have been thinking about how to make the day special even though they are apart. Others will be trying to find some time for romance while cooped up at home with young children. The BBC has beenasking people how they are celebrating this year, including LondonersDeep Bajwa, 37 andBhavin Bhagalia, 39, who say this Valentine's will be a day for the family and their children are in charge of planning the festivities.  Deep Bajwa says her children have planned their day We've also been looking at how restaurants - usually booked up with Valentine's dates - haveadapted their offeringsthis year. Eateries from local cafes to Michelin-starred restaurants are packaging up special dinners as a treat, in a bid to keep customers coming back when the pandemic is over. For Ruth Smith, who lives in East Molesey, near London, it's an opportunity for a fancy meal on Valentine's Day without being surrounded by loved-up couples. She will be getting a three-course meal kit from her local cafe, choosing from twice-baked cheese souffle with fennel and apple salad, individual beef Wellington, vanilla panna cotta with cardamom, and rose infused streusel. ""It means I'm really looking forward to Valentine's Day rather than kind of thinking, oh I'm going to be on my own and really not concerned at all this year,"" she says. Read more here.

"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab: ""You can't get ahead of the evidence"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has rejected calls from Conservative MPs to put a date on when England's lockdown measures will be eased, saying the government will be ""cautious"". The lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) said all restrictions must be lifted by the end of April. Mr Raab told the BBC he was ""confident"" in the vaccine rollout, but added: ""You can't get ahead of the evidence."" So far 14.5 million people have had at least one dose of the vaccine. Mr Raab said that the government was ""on track"" to hit its target of offering the vaccine to 15 million people from the top four priority groups by Monday. UK reports 13,308 cases on Saturday Covid jabs extended to all over-65s from Monday 'Optimistic' PM plots 'cautious' lockdown easing The CRG has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say there will be no justification for Covid laws once the top nine priority groups have been vaccinated - which the government is planning to have done by May. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We share all of the ambition and the desire to get out of this lockdown. We want to do it responsibly and safely and therefore it's got to be based on the evidence,"" adding, ""You can't get ahead of the evidence of the impact of the vaccine on the transmission."" He said the R-rate was between 0.7 and 1 and, as of Friday, the seven-day totals for admissions, cases and fatalities were down by between a fifth and a quarter respectively. But developments needed to be monitored ""in real time"", making it difficult to give guarantees or be precise about an end of April or beginning of May date for easing, he said. This video can not be played Mark Harper: ""It's not arbitrary at all, it's completely tied to the rollout of the vaccination programme"" Mr Johnson said on Saturday he planneda ""cautious"" reopening- the road map for which will be unveiled on 22 February, with restrictions on outdoor recreation expected to be among the first to be relaxed. The CRG - which was formed in November to oppose a third lockdown and says it has the backing of 63 MPs for its letter - said the prime minister should set out a plan for ""a return to normal life"" from 8 March. Newscast: Meet the Covid Recovery Group That is three weeks after Monday's target date for vaccinating 15 million of the most vulnerable - the same length of time the vaccineis believed to need to start taking effect- and the date pencilled in by the government for schools reopening. The top four priority groups, targeted for vaccination by 15 February include: Older residents in care homes and staff Health and social care workers Everyone over the age of 70 Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus The vaccine rollout has already beenofficially extended to people outside these groups, with invitations going out in England to people aged 65 to 69 and younger people who are in an at-risk group. Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools, followed by outdoor mixing, non-essential shops then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs - who have been close to the prime minister in recent years - are urging Mr Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and having to re-impose restrictions in a matter of weeks. That's why ministers are being cautious at the moment - and why the foreign secretary said it would be wrong to set an arbitrary date. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? The CRG called for pubs and restaurants to open by Easter in a ""Covid-secure"" and ""commercially viable"" way, saying two-thirds of the people in the top nine priority groups should have had a first vaccine dose by then. And by the end of the April, when all the priority groups should have had one jab of vaccine, they say all lockdown laws should be removed. The group says the burden of proof should be on ministers to show restrictions are necessary. Scientists and medics have urged caution, saying there is still potential for another surge in cases. Dr Shondipon Laha, a member of the Intensive Care Society, dismissed the idea that Covid-19 could end up being seen on the same level as the flu -something that has been suggested by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Mr Johnson. ""It's not just deadlier, it's more debilitating. So we're expecting to see significant numbers of patients who have had Covid who need intense rehabilitation."" ""We know that every patient that comes to an intensive care unit that needs ventilation loses muscle mass at 2-3% per day,"" Dr Laha said, adding that many such patients cannot stand and have problems with their long-term memories. Dr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, said the variations of coronavirus were becoming more infectious and more dangerous, also dismissing suggestions it could be treated the same as flu. She said restrictions should be lifted ""very gently"", and that, in the future, ""short, sharp"" lockdowns should be introduced for a few days to target smaller, localised outbreaks -similar to those being used in Australia.

"This video can not be played Rachael Prigmore has two sons, who were both born prematurely and spent time in neonatal units. Rachael Prigmore has twice faced the experience of giving birth to a baby prematurely and having to watch, with hope and fear, as her children spent weeks in neonatal care. The 35-year-old from Bexleyheath, south-east London, said the time was ""heart-breaking"" for her and her partner - but they were also faced with the additional financial pressures brought on by a child coming early. She has joined with charities and MPs calling for the government to bring in pay and leave for parents who have babies in neonatal care, to stop future parents feeling ""cheated out of time"" with their new arrival. May: Parents of sick and premature babies should get more leave Parents of premature babies face a further trauma of PTSD The tiny premature baby who fought off coronavirus Over 100,000 babies are cared for in neonatal units in the UK every year, either because they are born prematurely - before 37 weeks - or because they are born at full term but sick. This means around one in seven babies born in the UK are admitted to a neonatal unit each year. Charities such as Bliss, which supports families of babies born prematurely or sick, have been campaigning for the government to provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave for parents of babies who need that neonatal care, amounting to around Â£160 a week. They say the support would stop families' parental leave being eaten into when their children are in hospital and make sure they can afford to be with them when they are needed most. Campaigners celebrated when, in March 2020,the chancellor included the pledge in his Budget. But Rishi Sunak'sred book,externaldoesn't allocate the annual Â£15m spend on the policy until 2023 at the earliest, and legislation to bring it in has not emerged. So, almost a year after the promise was made - with new parents facing the added extra pressures of the pandemic - there is no start date in sight. In 2016, Rachael had her first child, Jack, at 31 weeks, weighing just 3lb 14oz, and she said it was ""a complete shock to the system"". She added: ""I wasn't even aware of what neonatal care was, and although I got a chance to look around the unit, it was a very frightening time."" Jack was in the unit for five weeks and Rachael had to start her maternity leave early, seeing her normal pay significantly cut. Her partner carried on working while their baby boy was getting treatment. ""We knew we were having a baby so had been saving, but when my maternity pay kicked in so early, it had a massive impact financially, while at the same time as you are trying to juggle everything else that is going on,"" said Rachael. ""My partner was entitled to two weeks paternity leave, but we didn't want to use it straight away so we could wait until Jack came home. But that meant he was having to get the train every morning, come straight to hospital at night, and then start all over."" When their second son, Joshua, arrived in June 2020, Rachael had only reached 28 weeks, and was facing another stressful time with her tiny 2lb 10oz on the neonatal unit - and with the addition of coronavirus restrictions to contend with. Joshua was born at just 28 weeks ""The hospital was 45 minutes away, we couldn't have visitors, we were having to travel back and forth, and it was an absolute nightmare,"" said Rachael. ""Again, we were trying to keep my partner's paternity leave on hold, but he was also trying to work, look after my other son, keep the house running... it was absolutely crazy times."" The costs were adding up, from hospital parking charges upwards of Â£60 a week through to just being able to grab a quick coffee to keep going. But what also worried Rachael was the knowledge she was using up maternity leave, and would have to return to work sooner than she wanted to. Rachael said: ""You are worrying about your child as it is when they are in the neonatal unit, but also at the back of your head you are thinking it is eating into your time and all these plans you had. ""You know you are going to go back to work at some point but you feel you haven't had time to enjoy your child."" Both of Rachael's boys are now at home, happy and healthy - but she still feels the effect. ""I felt rushed both times,"" she said. ""I felt I had only just got them home when I went back to work and they still looked like new-born babies. I feel we were cheated out of our time."" Both Jack and Joshua (pictured with Rachael) are doing well at home Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones has been campaigning in Parliament for the extra support of neonatal leave and pay to be brought forward. Not only is she the vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Premature and Sick Babies, but she went through the experience herself when her son Sullivan spent five days in neonatal care after being born in 2019. ""It was so challenging for us and for me to go through as a first time mother, but we had a really good support network and my husband's employer was really good,"" she said. ""Unfortunately many, many families aren't as lucky. ""I have heard from friends and others who didn't have that support, who had to go back to work immediately with all their parental leave swallowed up."" Ms Davis-Jones said she had met Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss the issue, as well as business ministers, but while there have been positive noises, action is not coming fast enough. ""Coronavirus has shown when there is political will, things can happen quickly,"" said the MP. She made a direct appeal to Boris Johnson, who is a new father himself, adding: ""This is time these families will never get back. Some babies never even make it home and this is the only time they will have with them. It is a lifeline."" Alex Davies-Jones with her son, Sullivan Head of policy and campaigns for Bliss, Josie Anderson, also appealed to the government ""not to lose sight"" of their promise and to bring in the measures as soon as possible. Research from the charity found two-fifths of mothers wanted to take more time away from work because of neonatal care, but couldn't afford to, while two-thirds of fathers and partners had to return to work before their baby had even left hospital. Ms Anderson said: ""For families it is an enormous issue. It stops hands-on care, which leads to best outcomes for babies, and there is a financial element to that is impacting how involved families are able to be, making them lose out on valuable time bonding with their baby."" A spokeswoman from the government's business department, said: ""Having a premature or sick baby can be an incredibly difficult time for parents, especially when juggling work commitments. ""As part of our manifesto commitment to make workplaces fairer, we will be legislating to introduce neonatal leave and pay as soon as parliamentary time allows.""

"New Zealand has kept cases and deaths from Covid-19 low New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ordered the country's biggest city Auckland to go into lockdown after the discovery of three new local cases of Covid-19. The measures will last three days and require residents to stay at home. Ms Ardern said the country was going ""hard and early"" after the cases were identified. New Zealand has won widespread praise for its handling of the pandemic, going months without community transmission. The country closed its borders entirely to almost all non-citizens or residents early on in the pandemic, aiming to eliminate the virus. New Zealand, with a population of five million, has recorded just over 2,300 cases of Covid and 25 deaths. The measures in Auckland require its 1.7 million residents to stay at home except for essential shopping and work. Schools and non-essential shops will close, and entry in and out of the city restricted. Ms Ardern said three days should allow the government to get more information and get more testing done, and would also help determine if there was any community transmission. ""New cases of Covid-19 in the community was something none of us wanted to happen,"" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff said, adding the restrictions were the ""best way to stamp out the virus"". This video can not be played New Zealand band Six60 are playing to up to 30,000 fans: ""People are shoulder to shoulder, singing along"" The rest of the country moves to a higher level of alert, with schools and businesses remaining open but people encouraged to find alternative ways of working if possible. The lockdown forced the postponement of two races in sailing's America's Cup,external, one of the few major sporting events with no restrictions on spectators. The three community cases were announced earlier on Sunday - a mother, father and daughter from South Auckland. It is unclear how the three contracted Covid. The mother works in the laundry department for an airline catering facility, while New Zealand media said the father was a self-employed tradesman. New Zealand's Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said his team was ""working under the assumption that it is one of the new variants"". He added that the initial focus on investigations was the mother's workplace ""because of its obvious connections to the border"". Opposition leader Judith Collins urged New Zealanders to follow the advice of health officials. But she called for border workers to be vaccinated, saying: ""If this proves to be another border failure that is unacceptable. Our border should be rock-solid by now.""

"Ebola is spread through close physical contact with infected people Guinea has officially declared that it is dealing with an Ebola epidemic after the deaths of at least three people from the virus. They - and four others - fell ill with diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding after attending the burial of a nurse. Newly developed vaccines will be acquired through the World Health Organization (WHO), officials said. Between 2013 and 2016 more than 11,000 people died in the West Africa Ebola epidemic, which began in Guinea. Why Ebola is so dangerous First Ebola case linked to bat play In response to that epidemic, which mainly affected Guinea and its neighbours Liberia and Sierra Leone, several vaccines were trialled, which have since been successfully used to fight outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""The WHO is on full alert and is in contact with the manufacturer [of a vaccine] to ensure the necessary doses are made available as quickly as possible to help fight back,"" the AFP news agency quotes Alfred George Ki-Zerbo, the WHO representative in Guinea, as saying. An Ebola vaccine wasfirst trialled over four months in 2015 in Guinea- and drugs that can increase the survival rate of patients have also been developed in recent years. A nurse who worked a health centre in GouekÃ©, near the south-eastern city of NzÃ©rÃ©korÃ©, died on 28 January and her funeral was held four days later. This video can not be played Some simple techniques can help prevent spread of Ebola. Community funerals, where people help wash the body of the person who has died, can be a key way of spreading Ebola in the earlier stages of an outbreak. The bodies of victims are particularly toxic. The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Ebola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. Bushmeat - non-domesticated forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the Ebola virus. It then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. All those infected at the funeral of the nurse were over the age of 25, health officials say. Following a crisis meeting on Sunday, the health ministry said all cases had been isolated, contact tracing was ongoing and a treatment centre was to be set up in GouekÃ©. This new outbreak is in roughly the same area where the epidemic began in December 2013. Given the cross border trade between Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and their relatively weak healthcare systems, there is concern the outbreak could spread. Liberia's President George Weah has put the health authorities on heightened alert. The BBC's Umaru Fofana in Sierra Leone says there is far more fear of Ebola in the country than Covid-19. He says the existence of new vaccines does provide some sense of relief -there is a global emergency stockpile of 500,000, made available through Gavi,external, the international vaccine alliance. The three countries have a joint population of 22.5 million, prompting concerns that manufacturers would have little time to produce more if needed at a time when Covid vaccines are their preoccupation, our reporter says. Experts say containment is key to fighting the disease. During the 2015 trial in Guinea - 100 patients were identified and then close contacts were either vaccinated immediately, or three weeks later. In the 2,014 close contacts who were vaccinated immediately there were no subsequent cases of Ebola. Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola Patients tend to die from dehydration and multiple organ failure From Ebola survivor to trainee doctor First Ebola case linked to bat play Is this the tree where Ebola started?

"Plaid leader says demand for independence has risen, but Lord Elis-Thomas urges caution The level of support for independence in Wales is similar to that in Scotland's a decade ago, Plaid Cymru's leader has claimed. Adam Price told theBBC's Andrew Marr Show""more and more"" people were supporting the idea because of the state of the economy and the level of inequality in Welsh society. Mr Price said independence would put Wales ""on a better path"". But Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas said a referendum now would not be ""wise"". Mr Price said: ""We are not going to be able to put Wales on a better path, on a better trajectory, without independence. ""The level of support for independence now in Wales is where it was in Scotland 10 years ago. ""A few short years after that, Scotland came within touching distance of voting yes in the independence referendum."" With the prospect of Scotland holding another independence referendum ""in the near future"" and ""Northern Ireland cooperating more with the Republic"", Wales' Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism Lord Elis-Thomas said he did not think it would be ""wise"" to hold a referendum in Wales ""at the moment"". But he added there was a ""great need"" to ""strengthen"" devolution in Wales. Speaking onBBC Radio Cymru's Dewi Llwyd ar Fore Sul, Lord Elis-Thomas said the pandemic had made it obvious that ""the United Kingdom is a country of four nations"" and there was a need to ""intensify"" those arrangements. ""I don't know if it is wise to hold a referendum on independence here in Wales at the moment but it's obvious that the discussion on devolution for Wales is not going to subside,"" he said.

It would be a ""big ask"" to reopen secondary schools in Northern Ireland on 8 March, the chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in NI has said. But Dr Tom Black said he was hopeful primary schools could reopen then. The executive has agreed that schools in Northern Ireland will remainclosed at least until 8 March. ""Opening schools has an increase of between 0.3 and 0.6 in the R number, so we couldn't do that at the moment,"" said Dr Black, speaking on BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme. He said the reopening of primary schools was more likely because ""we know the transmission infection in younger children is much lower"". Stormontministers will meet on Thursday to discuss whether to extend NI's current lockdownbeyond 5 March or begin the process of lifting restrictions from then. Read more.  This video can not be played Scottish government: Closing travel quarantine loophole is 'critical' Scotland's transport secretary has said it is ""absolutely critical"" the UK closes a loophole as new quarantine regulations are set to come into force. From 04:00 GMT on Mondayall international arrivals in Scotlandmust self-isolate in hotels for 10 days. But in England the rules only apply to arrivals from 33""red list"" countries,external. The different approaches being taken by the UK and Scottish governments have raised concerns that people arriving at English airports and ferry terminals will then travel on to Scotland. Michael Matheson has asked for Scotland-bound travellers arriving at English airports to be offered quarantine facilities in England but said ""as yet, we are still waiting for the UK government to give us agreement on that"". Passengers required to self-isolate in hotels will have to pay the Â£1,750 cost of their managed quarantine, which could encourage people to avoid this by choosing English airports - even if Scotland is their final destination. The Scottish Conservatives accused Scottish ministers of ""stoking a row"" to distract attention from the ""mess"" they had made of their own quarantine plans. Labour, meanwhile, said the Scottish government was ""clueless"" about how it would make the new rules work. Read more. Lebanon began vaccinating its citizens on Sunday It's been a busy day with updates from around the world - so here's a reminder of the key global developments: Sunday'sdaily coronavirus figures,externalshow 15,062,189 people have now received an initial dose of the vaccine - after 505,362 first jabs were given out on Saturday. 537,715 people have received their second inoculation. So far the vaccination programme has been aimed at thetop four priority groups,external, including NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, over-70s, and people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable. From Monday, the vaccine rollout is beingexpanded to include over-65sand others considered clinically vulnerable The latest government data also reveals that a further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, taking the UK death toll to 117,166. More than 23,000 patients with coronavirus are in hospital, with nearly 3,000 on mechanical ventilators.  Takeaway firm Deliveroo and 300 restaurant groups are urging the government to run Eat Out to Help Out once again when restaurants are allowed to reopen. They said the discount scheme, which encouraged people to eat out with discounts of up to Â£10 per diner in August 2020, would boost demand for ailing restaurants. They also said other urgent support was needed to stop ""viable"" hospitality firms failing - and called on the government to extend the VAT reduction on restaurant food until at least the end of 2021. In a letter to the prime minister, Deliveroo and partners, including Itsu and Pizza Hut, said many restaurants were ""under immense financial pressure"". ""Even when they are able to reopen to customers, restrictions around mixing of households and social distancing measures mean that a return to trading at full capacity will remain dependent on the successful vaccine rollout,"" the letter stated. They said the Eat Out to Help Out scheme had helped restaurants ""survive"" in 2020 and should be run again ""when it is safe to do so"". Read more. A further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, while 10,972 new cases were also reported. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, said it was ""fantastic"" that more than 15 million vaccines had been administered and the NHS was ""incredibly proud"" of the achievement. ""I have to tell you this is an extraordinary logistical effort right the way across the NHS"" he said. ""Yet again when the nation needed the NHS to deliver - we have delivered."" However, he said caution needed to be exercised over lifting restrictions. People ""shouldn't make the assumption"" that lockdown could be eased just because many of the eldest in the UK population had received their first jab. And he said the NHS would need more funding and staff if there was to be an annual Covid booster.    Analysis Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is undeniable the vaccine programme has overall been a success - only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have done more jabs per head of the population. But, as well as pushing ahead with the under-70s, we mustn't forget those not yet vaccinated in the most vulnerable groups. There have been reports of housebound patients still waiting for their jab . And some have questioned whether enough has been done to reach out to those who have concerns about vaccination, and have not taken up the offer. The fear is that vaccination uptake may be lowest in some of the most vulnerable communities - and that risks widening health inequalities. There are still a lot of vulnerable at risk - and, with the numbers in hospital still above the peak in the first wave, the NHS isn't yet out of the woods. Henk Angenent (front) has just passed the halfway stage A former champion speed skater is racing across the northern Netherlands, aiming to finish the route of a rare marathon event before a coronavirus curfew comes into force later today. Henk Angenent has battled broken ice and a recurring knee injury. The 53-year-old has just moved beyond the halfway point of the 200km (124 mile) course. He was the last winner of the Elfstedentocht - a race last held in 1997 and keenly followed by millions of fans. Ice conditions were initially seen as favourable for a new edition this year, but officials said the race could not proceed due to coronavirus restrictions. Politicians and health experts have welcomed the news that at least 15 million people in the UK have had their first coronavirus jab. NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens has hailed it as ""an important milestone"" and said the UK vaccine programme was ""the biggest and fastest in Europe"".

The UK has reached a ""significant milestone"" in the coronavirus vaccination rollout, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says. In a tweet,he writes,external: ""This country has achieved an extraordinary feat - administering a total of 15 million jabs into the arms of some of the most vulnerable people in the country."" In a video alongside the tweet he adds that everyone in the top four vaccination priority groups in England has now been offered a Covid jab, marking a major step towards the government reaching its 15 February target. The PM says he will set out full details tomorrow of the progress the UK has made in vaccinating the priority groups. Announcing the latest vaccination figure on Twitter,Nadhim Zahawi writes,external: ""15,000,000! Amazing team. ""We will not rest till we offer the vaccine to the whole of phase 1, the 1-9 categories of the most vulnerable and all over 50s by end April, and then all adults."" At least 15m people in UK have had their first coronavirus jab, Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawai says. The
government said it would offer at least one vaccine dose to everyone in the top
four priority groups in the UK by 15 February. That is:  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) estimates there are about 15 million people in these four groups. But, as
far as we know, the government never explicitly put a 15 million figure on its promise. The government is
only supplying regular data about the number of people vaccinated, so there is no
breakdown of how many people in the top four priority groups have been offered a vaccine or how many have rejected an offer of a vaccine. As we reported earlier, the government has said it is prepared to discuss with other countries how a so-called ""vaccine passport"" might allow people to travel abroad on holiday - by showing they have had a jab to protect against Covid 19. Conservative backbencher David Davis says he has few reservations about vaccination passports being used to travel between countries - but he insists they should not be needed to obtain entry to a shop or an entertainment venue at home. Speaking to Radio 4's World This Weekend, Davis says the idea of domestic passports runs ""completely contrary to history and traditions"" of the UK. ""We're a free country, [we've] never had to show papers to do things,"" he says. He adds this measure would amount to ""effective discrimination between different groups of people"" and that it would ""create two classes of society, saying to people that unless you're in this category you can't enjoy theatre or football"". He warns that it would involve ""a restriction to people's freedom that would last a long time... it wouldn't be abolished"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data
on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before
deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools; followed by
outdoor mixing; non-essential shops; then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs â who have been close to the prime
minister in recent years â are urging Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when
the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and
having to reimpose restrictions in a matter of weeks. Thatâs why ministers are
being cautious at the moment â and why the foreign secretary said it would be
wrong to set an arbitrary date. The pandemic means that Valentine's Day is very different from last year, when coronavirus had only just reached the UK. Following nearly a year of social distancing, lockdowns and limited opportunities to socialise in person, some couples have been thinking about how to make the day special even though they are apart. Others will be trying to find some time for romance while cooped up at home with young children. The BBC has beenasking people how they are celebrating this year, including LondonersDeep Bajwa, 37 andBhavin Bhagalia, 39, who say this Valentine's will be a day for the family and their children are in charge of planning the festivities.  Deep Bajwa says her children have planned their day We've also been looking at how restaurants - usually booked up with Valentine's dates - haveadapted their offeringsthis year. Eateries from local cafes to Michelin-starred restaurants are packaging up special dinners as a treat, in a bid to keep customers coming back when the pandemic is over. For Ruth Smith, who lives in East Molesey, near London, it's an opportunity for a fancy meal on Valentine's Day without being surrounded by loved-up couples. She will be getting a three-course meal kit from her local cafe, choosing from twice-baked cheese souffle with fennel and apple salad, individual beef Wellington, vanilla panna cotta with cardamom, and rose infused streusel. ""It means I'm really looking forward to Valentine's Day rather than kind of thinking, oh I'm going to be on my own and really not concerned at all this year,"" she says. Read more here.

The UK has reached a ""significant milestone"" in the coronavirus vaccination rollout, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says. In a tweet,he writes,external: ""This country has achieved an extraordinary feat - administering a total of 15 million jabs into the arms of some of the most vulnerable people in the country."" In a video alongside the tweet he adds that everyone in the top four vaccination priority groups in England has now been offered a Covid jab, marking a major step towards the government reaching its 15 February target. The PM says he will set out full details tomorrow of the progress the UK has made in vaccinating the priority groups. Announcing the latest vaccination figure on Twitter,Nadhim Zahawi writes,external: ""15,000,000! Amazing team. ""We will not rest till we offer the vaccine to the whole of phase 1, the 1-9 categories of the most vulnerable and all over 50s by end April, and then all adults."" At least 15m people in UK have had their first coronavirus jab, Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawai says. The
government said it would offer at least one vaccine dose to everyone in the top
four priority groups in the UK by 15 February. That is:  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) estimates there are about 15 million people in these four groups. But, as
far as we know, the government never explicitly put a 15 million figure on its promise. The government is
only supplying regular data about the number of people vaccinated, so there is no
breakdown of how many people in the top four priority groups have been offered a vaccine or how many have rejected an offer of a vaccine. As we reported earlier, the government has said it is prepared to discuss with other countries how a so-called ""vaccine passport"" might allow people to travel abroad on holiday - by showing they have had a jab to protect against Covid 19. Conservative backbencher David Davis says he has few reservations about vaccination passports being used to travel between countries - but he insists they should not be needed to obtain entry to a shop or an entertainment venue at home. Speaking to Radio 4's World This Weekend, Davis says the idea of domestic passports runs ""completely contrary to history and traditions"" of the UK. ""We're a free country, [we've] never had to show papers to do things,"" he says. He adds this measure would amount to ""effective discrimination between different groups of people"" and that it would ""create two classes of society, saying to people that unless you're in this category you can't enjoy theatre or football"". He warns that it would involve ""a restriction to people's freedom that would last a long time... it wouldn't be abolished"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data
on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before
deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools; followed by
outdoor mixing; non-essential shops; then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs â who have been close to the prime
minister in recent years â are urging Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when
the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and
having to reimpose restrictions in a matter of weeks. Thatâs why ministers are
being cautious at the moment â and why the foreign secretary said it would be
wrong to set an arbitrary date. The pandemic means that Valentine's Day is very different from last year, when coronavirus had only just reached the UK. Following nearly a year of social distancing, lockdowns and limited opportunities to socialise in person, some couples have been thinking about how to make the day special even though they are apart. Others will be trying to find some time for romance while cooped up at home with young children. The BBC has beenasking people how they are celebrating this year, including LondonersDeep Bajwa, 37 andBhavin Bhagalia, 39, who say this Valentine's will be a day for the family and their children are in charge of planning the festivities.  Deep Bajwa says her children have planned their day We've also been looking at how restaurants - usually booked up with Valentine's dates - haveadapted their offeringsthis year. Eateries from local cafes to Michelin-starred restaurants are packaging up special dinners as a treat, in a bid to keep customers coming back when the pandemic is over. For Ruth Smith, who lives in East Molesey, near London, it's an opportunity for a fancy meal on Valentine's Day without being surrounded by loved-up couples. She will be getting a three-course meal kit from her local cafe, choosing from twice-baked cheese souffle with fennel and apple salad, individual beef Wellington, vanilla panna cotta with cardamom, and rose infused streusel. ""It means I'm really looking forward to Valentine's Day rather than kind of thinking, oh I'm going to be on my own and really not concerned at all this year,"" she says. Read more here.

"More than 15 million people in the UK have now had their first coronavirus vaccine, in what Boris Johnson described as a ""significant milestone"". The PM hailed the ""extraordinary feat"", reached just over two months after thefirst jab was given on 8 December. It comes as the government is expected to announce on Monday it has met its pledge to offer a jab to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK. The rollout is now beingexpanded to over-65sand the clinically vulnerable. In a video,Mr Johnson praised,externala ""truly national, UK-wide effort"", adding that in England the jab had been offered to all those in thetop four priority groups,external. Wales has also met the target. But ""no-one is resting on their laurels,"" Mr Johnson said. ""We've still got a long way to go to. And there will undoubtedly be bumps in the road. But after all we've achieved, I know we can go forward with great confidence."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Will I get side effects from the vaccine? Sunday'sdaily coronavirus figures,externalshow 15,062,189 people have now received an initial vaccine dose - after 505,362 first jabs were given out on Saturday. A further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, taking the death toll by that measure to 117,166. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. There were 10,972 new cases reported, bringing the total number of recorded infections to 4,038,078. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the 15 million milestone was a ""remarkable shared achievement"" - reached 10 weeks after the first vaccine was administered in the UK. ""The NHS vaccination programme is the biggest and fastest in Europe - and in the health service's history - and that is down to the skill, care, and downright hard work of our fantastic staff, supported by local communities, volunteers and the armed forces,"" he said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it meant one in every four adults was now ""starting to receive protection from this dreadful disease"". But he cautioned: ""There is so much more to do and I urge anyone eligible to step forward and take up their appointment. The vaccine is our route to freedom - we will beat this virus jab by jab."" So far the vaccination programme has been aimed at thetop four priority groups,external, including NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, over-70s, and people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable. These groups have accounted for 88% of the UK's Covid-19 deaths so far,according to the Department of Health and Social Care,externaland are estimated by the JCVI to be some 15 million people. A small number of the 15 million to receive a jab will have been outside these priority groups. Ruth Rankine, director of the NHS Confederation's PCN Network of GP practices, paid tribute to the ""incredible accomplishment"" but added that ""until everyone is protected, no one is protected"". ""There is still work to do to administer first doses to all the remaining people from the first four cohorts, as well as moving down the cohorts until everyone has at least been offered a jab, not to mention beginning the work of administering second doses,"" she said. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said ministers needed to ""lock in the gains of vaccination"" and introduce further measures to reduce the spread of the disease. This included increased financial support for those who have to self-isolate, updated guidance on masks and help to make workplaces Covid secure. It is undeniable the vaccine programme has overall been a success - only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have done more jabs per head. But as well as pushing ahead with the under-70s, efforts need to continue to reach out to those not yet vaccinated in these first groups. There have been reports of housebound patients still waiting, while some have questioned whether enough has been done to reach out to those who have concerns and have not taken up the offer. The fear is uptake may be lowest in some of the most vulnerable communities and that risks widening health inequalities. People will also ask what this means for unlocking. Those offered the jab account for around five in six deaths but just over half of hospitalisations. That leaves a lot of vulnerable at risk - and with the numbers in hospital still above the peak in the first wave, the NHS isn't yet out of the woods. From Monday, the vaccination programme enters a new phase, with over-65s and the clinically vulnerable being invited to book a jab. The JCVI defines clinically vulnerable people as those with conditions including chronic respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and severe asthma. Some regions have already started vaccinating people aged 65 to 69, with NHS England having previously said that people in this age group could get a vaccine if GPs had supplies.

On Saturday, the prime minister said he was""optimistic"" he will be able to set out plans later this month for a ""cautious"" easing of England's lockdown, citing ""huge progress"" made with the vaccine rollout. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? The UK is currently administering doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and the one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. A third vaccine, made by US company Moderna, has been approved but supplies are not expected to be available until spring. The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use. Its vaccination rate isthe third highest in the world, behind only Israel and the UAE.

"Bill Caldwell's children said he loved being in the Navy and joined as soon as he was old enough A postcard sent by a Royal Navy recruit during World War Two has been delivered to his childhood home in Liverpool after 77 years. Bill Caldwell was 18 and in his first week of training at HMS Raleigh in Torpoint, Cornwall, when he wrote saying he was ""in blue at last"". Mr Caldwell's adult children have seen the postcard for the first time after it was delivered on Friday. Royal Mail said it was likely it had been reposted recently. Mr Caldwell's children said their father, who died 25 years ago and did not write many letters, tried to join the Navy at 15 but had to wait until he was 18. ""It was the most surreal thing on a Friday night to suddenly read a postcard that dad had written 77 years ago when he was training to be a sailor in the Navy,"" said daughter Joanna Creamer. The front of the postcard shows a picture of the HMS Raleigh figurehead with recruits marching by The postcard is postmarked 1943 and bears another stamp saying: ""Post early in the day."" It was sent to Mr Caldwell's ""uncle Fred"", who his children said lived with his parents in their family home. Relatives still live in the house which is how his children, who live in Bristol and Surrey, were alerted to its arrival. In the postcard, Mr Caldwell wrote: ""Well I am in blue at last. I did not think it would be like this - you don't get much time for yourself, do you? ""But I like it alright. ""I will write a letter to you all when I get half a chance so will you hold on a bit? I have 19 weeks here yet. ""Give my love to everyone. Love, Bill."" Mr Caldwell's son Tony said his father was ""understated"" and it was ""wonderful"" to receive the postcard, which he thought said ""so much between the lines"". ""It seems it's not quite the Boy's Own story [he] thought [he] was letting [himself] in for,"" he said. A Royal Mail spokesperson said it was ""difficult to speculate"" on what happened to the postcard but it was ""likely it was put back into the postal system by someone recently, rather than being lost or stuck somewhere in the network"".

"Plaid leader says demand for independence has risen, but Lord Elis-Thomas urges caution The level of support for independence in Wales is similar to that in Scotland's a decade ago, Plaid Cymru's leader has claimed. Adam Price told theBBC's Andrew Marr Show""more and more"" people were supporting the idea because of the state of the economy and the level of inequality in Welsh society. Mr Price said independence would put Wales ""on a better path"". But Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas said a referendum now would not be ""wise"". Mr Price said: ""We are not going to be able to put Wales on a better path, on a better trajectory, without independence. ""The level of support for independence now in Wales is where it was in Scotland 10 years ago. ""A few short years after that, Scotland came within touching distance of voting yes in the independence referendum."" With the prospect of Scotland holding another independence referendum ""in the near future"" and ""Northern Ireland cooperating more with the Republic"", Wales' Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism Lord Elis-Thomas said he did not think it would be ""wise"" to hold a referendum in Wales ""at the moment"". But he added there was a ""great need"" to ""strengthen"" devolution in Wales. Speaking onBBC Radio Cymru's Dewi Llwyd ar Fore Sul, Lord Elis-Thomas said the pandemic had made it obvious that ""the United Kingdom is a country of four nations"" and there was a need to ""intensify"" those arrangements. ""I don't know if it is wise to hold a referendum on independence here in Wales at the moment but it's obvious that the discussion on devolution for Wales is not going to subside,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Renters: Eviction ban in England extended until March The ban on evictions in England is to be extended until the end of March, the government has announced. It means eviction notices - which could have started again on 22 February - cannot be served for another six weeks. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said it would ensure renters remained protected ""during this difficult time"". The eviction ban had already been extended from 11 January when it was originally due to expire. Mr Jenrick said the ban on the enforcement of evictions by bailiffs would continue ""in all but the most serious cases"". He added that the government had taken unprecedented action to support renters during the Covid pandemic, and that measures had struck ""the right balance between protecting tenants and enabling landlords to exercise their right to justice"". Eviction bans in England and Wales are extended Christmas 'truce' for renters facing eviction But Labour, charities and landlords groups said the measures did not go far enough. Shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said: ""Last minute decisions and half-measures from the government are putting people's homes at risk. ""Ministers promised nobody would lose their home because of coronavirus, but the current ban isn't working. ""The government should give people security in their homes, by strengthening and extending the ban for the period [virus] restrictions are in place."" Huge sums of money have been pumped into the economy to stop mass unemployment and keep the economy afloat. But the government has stopped short of direct financial support for tenants in rent arrears, and landlords losing income. While I'm told some within Whitehall are receptive to the idea of emergency grants or loans, the policy has met significant resistance - and there's little sign Westminster will follow Wales and Scotland's lead. But there is concern from groups representing tenants and landlords that a rent debt crisis is mounting - which will, in the end, see many people forced from their homes. Mortgage holidays and mediation have helped many get by for the time being - but some argue that a longer-term policy is needed. Banning evictions for another six weeks may bring some temporary relief, but as one frustrated Conservative MP put it to me: ""This can't go on forever."" Shelter said its research showed almost 445,000 private renting adults in England had fallen behind on their rent or been served with some kind of eviction notice in the last month. The housing and homelessness charity's chief executive Polly Neate said the extension would ""keep people safe for now"", but warned it was ""not an answer to the evictions crisis"". ""Renters are still are being served with eviction notices every day and our helpline is flooded with calls from those desperately worried about paying their rent,"" she said. ""Before the ban is lifted, the government must give renters a real way out of debt. That means a lifeline of emergency grants to help pay off 'Covid arrears' so people can avoid the terrifying risk of eviction altogether."" Meanwhile, National Residential Landlords Association chief executive Ben Beadle warned the announcement was storing up future problems. He said 800,000 private renters had built up arrears since the ban came into force, which they would struggle to ever pay off. ""It will lead eventually to them having to leave their home and face serious damage to their credit scores,"" he said, as he called for further financial support to combat ""the debt crisis renters and landlords are now facing"". Housing is a devolved issue, andWalesandScotlandhave already extended their bans to the end of March. In Northern Ireland, landlords are required to give tenants 12 weeks' notice to quit, before moving to eviction proceedings. The rules were extended to March in anticipation of the second wave of the Covid pandemic. Evictions were first banned at the start of the first lockdown in March, with ministers also extending the notice period landlords must give tenants to end their tenancy from three to six months. Courts beganto clear the backlog of repossession cases in September, starting with the most serious cases, such as those involving domestic violence or anti-social behaviour. But the housing secretary then called a so-called ""Christmas truce"", meaning bailiffs were not allowed to enforce possession orders between 11 December and 11 January.

"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab: ""You can't get ahead of the evidence"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has rejected calls from Conservative MPs to put a date on when England's lockdown measures will be eased, saying the government will be ""cautious"". The lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) said all restrictions must be lifted by the end of April. Mr Raab told the BBC he was ""confident"" in the vaccine rollout, but added: ""You can't get ahead of the evidence."" So far 14.5 million people have had at least one dose of the vaccine. Mr Raab said that the government was ""on track"" to hit its target of offering the vaccine to 15 million people from the top four priority groups by Monday. UK reports 13,308 cases on Saturday Covid jabs extended to all over-65s from Monday 'Optimistic' PM plots 'cautious' lockdown easing The CRG has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say there will be no justification for Covid laws once the top nine priority groups have been vaccinated - which the government is planning to have done by May. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We share all of the ambition and the desire to get out of this lockdown. We want to do it responsibly and safely and therefore it's got to be based on the evidence,"" adding, ""You can't get ahead of the evidence of the impact of the vaccine on the transmission."" He said the R-rate was between 0.7 and 1 and, as of Friday, the seven-day totals for admissions, cases and fatalities were down by between a fifth and a quarter respectively. But developments needed to be monitored ""in real time"", making it difficult to give guarantees or be precise about an end of April or beginning of May date for easing, he said. This video can not be played Mark Harper: ""It's not arbitrary at all, it's completely tied to the rollout of the vaccination programme"" Mr Johnson said on Saturday he planneda ""cautious"" reopening- the road map for which will be unveiled on 22 February, with restrictions on outdoor recreation expected to be among the first to be relaxed. The CRG - which was formed in November to oppose a third lockdown and says it has the backing of 63 MPs for its letter - said the prime minister should set out a plan for ""a return to normal life"" from 8 March. Newscast: Meet the Covid Recovery Group That is three weeks after Monday's target date for vaccinating 15 million of the most vulnerable - the same length of time the vaccineis believed to need to start taking effect- and the date pencilled in by the government for schools reopening. The top four priority groups, targeted for vaccination by 15 February include: Older residents in care homes and staff Health and social care workers Everyone over the age of 70 Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus The vaccine rollout has already beenofficially extended to people outside these groups, with invitations going out in England to people aged 65 to 69 and younger people who are in an at-risk group. Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools, followed by outdoor mixing, non-essential shops then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs - who have been close to the prime minister in recent years - are urging Mr Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and having to re-impose restrictions in a matter of weeks. That's why ministers are being cautious at the moment - and why the foreign secretary said it would be wrong to set an arbitrary date. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? The CRG called for pubs and restaurants to open by Easter in a ""Covid-secure"" and ""commercially viable"" way, saying two-thirds of the people in the top nine priority groups should have had a first vaccine dose by then. And by the end of the April, when all the priority groups should have had one jab of vaccine, they say all lockdown laws should be removed. The group says the burden of proof should be on ministers to show restrictions are necessary. Scientists and medics have urged caution, saying there is still potential for another surge in cases. Dr Shondipon Laha, a member of the Intensive Care Society, dismissed the idea that Covid-19 could end up being seen on the same level as the flu -something that has been suggested by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Mr Johnson. ""It's not just deadlier, it's more debilitating. So we're expecting to see significant numbers of patients who have had Covid who need intense rehabilitation."" ""We know that every patient that comes to an intensive care unit that needs ventilation loses muscle mass at 2-3% per day,"" Dr Laha said, adding that many such patients cannot stand and have problems with their long-term memories. Dr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, said the variations of coronavirus were becoming more infectious and more dangerous, also dismissing suggestions it could be treated the same as flu. She said restrictions should be lifted ""very gently"", and that, in the future, ""short, sharp"" lockdowns should be introduced for a few days to target smaller, localised outbreaks -similar to those being used in Australia.

"Two of the highest death rates in Wales are in the Rhondda Cynon Taf local authority area Poverty and health inequality are behind the high Covid death rates in the south Wales valleys, a public health boss has said. InRhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) the rate is 340.3 deaths per 100,000 population- the third highest in the UK. But, Cwm Taf Morgannwg's director for public health said the rate had been predictable. The Welsh Government said an ""unprecedented series of interventions"" was made to protect people's health. Kelechi Nnoaham, director for public health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg, said the issues that led the problem ""we've known about for years"" and this result could have been foreseen. ""It is fundamentally about poverty and health inequalities,"" Dr Nnoaham said. ""If someone had pulled any one of us up in February 2020 and said, 'There's a pandemic coming, can you fast forward one year and assess which communities would have the most severe hit from this pandemic?', you could almost predict the picture we're seeing now with a reasonable degree of accuracy."" Two of the highest death rates in Wales are in the RCT local authority area. Tonyrefail West has seen 53 deaths, which puts its rate at 515.7 deaths per 100,000 people, and in Penrhiwceiber there have been 26 deaths - a mortality rate of 436.9 per 100,000 population. ""We have known it's poverty and health inequality for several years,"" Dr Nnoaham said. ""The question is what have we done? To what extent have we been successful in removing those vulnerabilities?"" Previous attempts to tackle poverty and the associated health inequalities have been ""tokenistic"" and have not done enough to remedy the root cause of the problems, he added. ""For many years... we have talked about the fact there's a lot of poverty in the Welsh valleys but we haven't done enough,"" he said. ""We've got to do more, there's such urgency now that we can't keep talking about health inequalities as if they're something academic."" Beyond the figures, communities are mourning. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Weekly Covid death figures show another fall 'Hope but no complacency' after valleys Covid drop Rev Peter Lewis, a vicar in Abercynon, says at the height of the pandemic, he was doing around 10 Covid-related funerals a week, but now it is closer to three a week. The clergy in the area are having training to deal with the trauma and grief they expect to be dealing with in the months and years to come. School children have been invited to make wooden hearts for Valentine's Day to hang on a memorial tree at St Gwynno's Church in Abercynon. Rev Lewis said the tree was a ""small contribution to mark that we're a community in loss."" He said though the events have led to the community becoming more resilient. One foodshare scheme, set up by Rhondda MS Leanne Wood, of Plaid Cymru, to redistribute food from supermarkets has seen demand increase over the pandemic. According to its volunteers it is not an exaggeration to say everyone in the Rhondda knows someone who has died of Covid. Janet Slade Jones, one of the volunteers, has been helping out her neighbours since March but she says the last year has been dreadful. Volunteers like Janet Slade Jones have been helping ensure their neighbours have enough food ""I've been to more than 10 funerals this year"", she said. Fellow foodshare volunteer Trish Denning, a retired teacher, said: ""It's really scary."" ""A lot of the time I feel in a state of shock when I look at the statistics but you are aware of the population of RCT as an ex-mining valleys. We have a lot of health issues."" Leanne Wood MS said jobs should be the priority to help reduce poverty and health inequality. Ms Wood said: ""The numbers of people who are employed with good jobs in this constituency is way too low. ""Not enough attention has been paid by UK Government, Welsh Government and the local authority in terms of that all important job creation so that's something that's going to have to change"". A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Coronavirus is the biggest single global public health crisis the world has faced in more than a generation and has had a significant impact on every aspect of our lives. ""That's why we've mobilised all our resources to respond to the pandemic, launching an unprecedented series of interventions to protect people's health, wellbeing and livelihoods. We will continue to do all we can to support everyone in Wales in the weeks and months ahead."" Politics Wales is on at 10:00 GMT on BBC One, Sunday 14 February.

"New Zealand has kept cases and deaths from Covid-19 low New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ordered the country's biggest city Auckland to go into lockdown after the discovery of three new local cases of Covid-19. The measures will last three days and require residents to stay at home. Ms Ardern said the country was going ""hard and early"" after the cases were identified. New Zealand has won widespread praise for its handling of the pandemic, going months without community transmission. The country closed its borders entirely to almost all non-citizens or residents early on in the pandemic, aiming to eliminate the virus. New Zealand, with a population of five million, has recorded just over 2,300 cases of Covid and 25 deaths. The measures in Auckland require its 1.7 million residents to stay at home except for essential shopping and work. Schools and non-essential shops will close, and entry in and out of the city restricted. Ms Ardern said three days should allow the government to get more information and get more testing done, and would also help determine if there was any community transmission. ""New cases of Covid-19 in the community was something none of us wanted to happen,"" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff said, adding the restrictions were the ""best way to stamp out the virus"". This video can not be played New Zealand band Six60 are playing to up to 30,000 fans: ""People are shoulder to shoulder, singing along"" The rest of the country moves to a higher level of alert, with schools and businesses remaining open but people encouraged to find alternative ways of working if possible. The lockdown forced the postponement of two races in sailing's America's Cup,external, one of the few major sporting events with no restrictions on spectators. The three community cases were announced earlier on Sunday - a mother, father and daughter from South Auckland. It is unclear how the three contracted Covid. The mother works in the laundry department for an airline catering facility, while New Zealand media said the father was a self-employed tradesman. New Zealand's Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said his team was ""working under the assumption that it is one of the new variants"". He added that the initial focus on investigations was the mother's workplace ""because of its obvious connections to the border"". Opposition leader Judith Collins urged New Zealanders to follow the advice of health officials. But she called for border workers to be vaccinated, saying: ""If this proves to be another border failure that is unacceptable. Our border should be rock-solid by now.""

"Joe Root, who scored 218 and 40 in the first Test, managed only six before falling to Axar Patel Second Test, Chennai (day two) India 329(Rohit 161, Pujara 67, Pant 58*, Moeen 4-128)& 54-1 England 134(Foakes 42*, Ashwin 5-43) India lead by 249 runs Scorecard England's batting crumbled in the Chennai dust as India moved on course for an emphatic win in the second Test. With the ball biting, fizzing and spitting off a rapidly deteriorating pitch, England had few answers against India's skilful spinners, slipping to 52-5 in response to the hosts' 329. Ben Foakes provided admirable resistance with an unbeaten 42, saving a follow-on that probably would not have been enforced, before England were bowled out for 134. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin ended with 5-43, while debutant left-arm spinner Axar Patel and pace bowler Ishant Sharma claimed two wickets apiece. Rohit Sharma, who made a sparkling 161 on day one, survived a stumping chance on 20 and overturned an lbw decision on 22 to end the second day 25 not out, taking India to 54-1 and a lead of 249. For all of the debate over the suitability of the pitch, India have now scored 383 runs in 113.5 overs for the loss of 11 wickets. You might as well play on a beach - Aggers on the Chennai pitch TMS podcast: India tighten grip after 15 wickets fall on day two Much will be made of the pitch and the question of when the exploitation of home advantage is taken to such a degree that it compromises the integrity of the contest. On one hand, extreme conditions are part of the rich tapestry of Test cricket and overcoming them is the challenge of playing away from home. Is it any more difficult for England in Chennai than it was for India when they weredismantled in English conditionsat Lord's in 2018? On the other, should the surface - and therefore the toss - dictate the outcome to this extent? This pitch has offered excessive encouragement for the spinners, even for the subcontinent. Whatever the rights and wrongs, the conditions provide context for the state of the match and it would be harsh to view this as another instalment in England's historical struggles in Asia. In this extreme environment, India's batsmen are more adept at scoring runs, their bowlers more relentless in exploiting the assistance. Yes, India won the toss, but they have also had Rohit's beautiful batting and Ashwin's mesmeric bowling, which England have not come close to matching. Even if India tailored the conditions following their chastening227-run defeatin the first Test, they have still outplayed England for two days in the Chennai sun. From 300-6 overnight, Rishabh Pant belted two straight sixes before running out of partners on 58 not out. After Rory Burns was lbw to the third ball of the England innings, playing all around a straight one from Ishant, the spinners got to work. Ashwin, with his subtle variations, had a sweeping Dom Sibley caught off the back of the bat, a tortured Dan Lawrence held a short leg and bowled Ben Stokes with a near-unplayable dipper that turned sharply to take off stump. In between, the accurate Axar struck the biggest blow by having captain Joe Root top-edge one of his trademark sweeps. It was only Foakes who delayed the India march and, when the tail was mopped up, Rohit picked up where he left off on Saturday to swiftly extend the lead. While this might seem like a brutal reality check for England after a superb performance in the first Test, they can still take heart from the performances of two of their most inexperienced players. Despite doing little wrong in his previous five Tests, Foakes is only playing because Jos Buttler has been rested, yet once again showed his class behind the stumps and his composure with the bat. Faultless with the gloves on day one, he began day two with a lightning stumping to remove Axar, then would later arrive at the crease with England floundering. With precise footwork and a solid defence, he was rarely troubled, steadying with Ollie Pope, who was equally unflustered for 22. After Pope was caught down the leg side off fast bowler Mohammed Siraj's first ball in a Test in India, Foakes marshalled the lower order to end undefeated. A rare blemish came when he missed the clear stumping chance as Rohit charged at Moeen Ali. Stone, in his second Test, impressed with his pace on day one. When England wanted to wrap up the India tail on Sunday morning, he was asked to rough up Kuldeep Yadav and Siraj, both of whom were both caught behind in the space of three balls to leave Stone with 3-47. Former England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social:""England have got to just fight. You never know, someone could do something remarkable. ""It looks like England will lose this game but try and take something into the next Test. Don't get too demoralised."" England assistant coach Graham Thorpe:""It's incredibly challenging on that surface for us. They have a skilled spin attack and it was a very good toss to win. ""There are some balls in the pitch that you might not be able to do too much about. In terms of commenting on the suitability of the pitch for a Test, that's for someone above me to say. ""We need something very, very special to happen tomorrow and somebody do something amazing with the bat. We knew we were going to have some tough times and the important thing is the dressing room doesn't get too affected by today."" England wicketkeeper Ben Foakes on Channel 4:""It was an incredibly tough day. The pitch was playing a few tricks. I just tried to stick to my game plan. ""We have to apply ourselves in the second innings, back our defence and try to put pressure on the bowlers."" India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin:""In the seven days of Test cricket we have played so far England have competed really well. I haven't seen them complaining about the conditions. ""There are conditions that will challenge you, whether it's with spin or with seam. If the ball is moving around at 145-150km/h off the deck, that has to be more challenging than someone bowling at 85-90km/h when the ball is spinning."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""There will be questions asked, in the wider game, about the suitability of this pitch for Test cricket. ""If cricket was played on this pitch all the time then there would be no need for five days."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played 'It feels like we're part of history' Up to 80,000 NI people who received a shielding letter as they are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to Covid-19 can now book a vaccination appointment. Appointments can be made online,externalfor vaccinations at seven centres. Online appointments are available for this weekend, with telephone booking available from next week. The news comes as the Department of Health reported another nine coronavirus-related deaths on Friday, bringing its death total to 1,975. There were 407 new cases recorded. There are 488 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland. It comes as the number of Covid-19-related deaths registered fell for a second week, according to Northern Ireland's statistics agency. The virus was listed on the death certificates of 126 people in the week to 5 February. Health Minister Robin Swann said the vaccination appointment announcement would be ""very welcome to all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and have been looking forward to getting vaccinated"". ""A start has already been made on the CEV category and offering booked appointments will help to accelerate this,"" he added. ""I would again appeal to everyone to be patient - whether that's waiting on the line to book your vaccination appointment by telephone or waiting your turn in the vaccination programme."" The system will be open to all those who received a shielding letter. Vaccine row 'political penalty kick for unionists' EU backtracks on vaccine export controls for NI They will have to bring that letter with them to the vaccination centre to prove their eligibility and will receive the Pfizer vaccine. Patricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme, said people should not panic if they cannot find their shielding letter. ""This is going to be open for a while, there's plenty of appointments. ""For some individuals, they will be called by their GPs, so they may in fact find that their GP is calling them forward - but we're going to issue further advice on this next week."" Earlier, referring to vaccinations, NI's chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show he was ""confident that we will have completed over-70s and clinically extremely vulnerable through February and perhaps into early March"". About 401,966 vaccines have been administered to date, with 373,414 of them being first doses and the remaining 28,552 being second doses, according to the Department of Health. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) has recorded a fall of 11 Covid-19-related deaths on the previous week's toll of 137. It is also the second time the number has fallensince the record high of 182 reported on 22 January. It brings the agency's total of coronavirus-related registered deaths to 2,574. The Department of Health's total for the same date, based on a positive test result being recorded, was 1,923. Nisra's figures are higher than that recorded by the department because it records all mentions of the virus on death certificates, even though it may or may not have been confirmed by way of a test. On the agency's measure, there have been 1,676 Covid-19-related deaths in hospital, including the deaths of 224 care home residents. Are NI's Covid trends turning in right direction? Is Northern Ireland exiting the Covid-19 peak? Taking that figure, and the 737 who died in care homes, it means care home residents now account for fewer than two-fifths (36.8%) of all virus-related deaths. Virus-related deaths were also recorded in hospices (0.5%) and other residential locations (7.2%). Deaths in care homes and hospitals involved 174 separate establishments. People aged 75 and over account for more than three-quarters of all Covid-19-related registered deaths (77.2%) between 19 March 2020 and 5 February 2021. The Antrim and Newtownabbey (9.9%), and Mid-Ulster (7.7%) local government districts have now recorded higher proportions of all coronavirus-related deaths, compared with their share of all deaths in Northern Ireland (8.3% and 6.4% respectively). The provisional number of deaths from all causes for the week ending 5 February was 462. That is 25 more than the previous week, and 125 more than the five-year average for the time of year, which is 337. On Friday, the Republic of Ireland recorded a further 21 deaths linked to Covid-19, bringing its total to 3,865. There have been 207,720 cases of the virus after the Irish department of health was notified of an additional 921 cases. There are 959 Covid-19 inpatients in the Republic, with 173 in intensive care.

"This video can not be played Renters: Eviction ban in England extended until March The ban on evictions in England is to be extended until the end of March, the government has announced. It means eviction notices - which could have started again on 22 February - cannot be served for another six weeks. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said it would ensure renters remained protected ""during this difficult time"". The eviction ban had already been extended from 11 January when it was originally due to expire. Mr Jenrick said the ban on the enforcement of evictions by bailiffs would continue ""in all but the most serious cases"". He added that the government had taken unprecedented action to support renters during the Covid pandemic, and that measures had struck ""the right balance between protecting tenants and enabling landlords to exercise their right to justice"". Eviction bans in England and Wales are extended Christmas 'truce' for renters facing eviction But Labour, charities and landlords groups said the measures did not go far enough. Shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said: ""Last minute decisions and half-measures from the government are putting people's homes at risk. ""Ministers promised nobody would lose their home because of coronavirus, but the current ban isn't working. ""The government should give people security in their homes, by strengthening and extending the ban for the period [virus] restrictions are in place."" Huge sums of money have been pumped into the economy to stop mass unemployment and keep the economy afloat. But the government has stopped short of direct financial support for tenants in rent arrears, and landlords losing income. While I'm told some within Whitehall are receptive to the idea of emergency grants or loans, the policy has met significant resistance - and there's little sign Westminster will follow Wales and Scotland's lead. But there is concern from groups representing tenants and landlords that a rent debt crisis is mounting - which will, in the end, see many people forced from their homes. Mortgage holidays and mediation have helped many get by for the time being - but some argue that a longer-term policy is needed. Banning evictions for another six weeks may bring some temporary relief, but as one frustrated Conservative MP put it to me: ""This can't go on forever."" Shelter said its research showed almost 445,000 private renting adults in England had fallen behind on their rent or been served with some kind of eviction notice in the last month. The housing and homelessness charity's chief executive Polly Neate said the extension would ""keep people safe for now"", but warned it was ""not an answer to the evictions crisis"". ""Renters are still are being served with eviction notices every day and our helpline is flooded with calls from those desperately worried about paying their rent,"" she said. ""Before the ban is lifted, the government must give renters a real way out of debt. That means a lifeline of emergency grants to help pay off 'Covid arrears' so people can avoid the terrifying risk of eviction altogether."" Meanwhile, National Residential Landlords Association chief executive Ben Beadle warned the announcement was storing up future problems. He said 800,000 private renters had built up arrears since the ban came into force, which they would struggle to ever pay off. ""It will lead eventually to them having to leave their home and face serious damage to their credit scores,"" he said, as he called for further financial support to combat ""the debt crisis renters and landlords are now facing"". Housing is a devolved issue, andWalesandScotlandhave already extended their bans to the end of March. In Northern Ireland, landlords are required to give tenants 12 weeks' notice to quit, before moving to eviction proceedings. The rules were extended to March in anticipation of the second wave of the Covid pandemic. Evictions were first banned at the start of the first lockdown in March, with ministers also extending the notice period landlords must give tenants to end their tenancy from three to six months. Courts beganto clear the backlog of repossession cases in September, starting with the most serious cases, such as those involving domestic violence or anti-social behaviour. But the housing secretary then called a so-called ""Christmas truce"", meaning bailiffs were not allowed to enforce possession orders between 11 December and 11 January.

"Joe Root, who scored 218 and 40 in the first Test, managed only six before falling to Axar Patel Second Test, Chennai (day two) India 329(Rohit 161, Pujara 67, Pant 58*, Moeen 4-128)& 54-1 England 134(Foakes 42*, Ashwin 5-43) India lead by 249 runs Scorecard England's batting crumbled in the Chennai dust as India moved on course for an emphatic win in the second Test. With the ball biting, fizzing and spitting off a rapidly deteriorating pitch, England had few answers against India's skilful spinners, slipping to 52-5 in response to the hosts' 329. Ben Foakes provided admirable resistance with an unbeaten 42, saving a follow-on that probably would not have been enforced, before England were bowled out for 134. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin ended with 5-43, while debutant left-arm spinner Axar Patel and pace bowler Ishant Sharma claimed two wickets apiece. Rohit Sharma, who made a sparkling 161 on day one, survived a stumping chance on 20 and overturned an lbw decision on 22 to end the second day 25 not out, taking India to 54-1 and a lead of 249. For all of the debate over the suitability of the pitch, India have now scored 383 runs in 113.5 overs for the loss of 11 wickets. You might as well play on a beach - Aggers on the Chennai pitch TMS podcast: India tighten grip after 15 wickets fall on day two Much will be made of the pitch and the question of when the exploitation of home advantage is taken to such a degree that it compromises the integrity of the contest. On one hand, extreme conditions are part of the rich tapestry of Test cricket and overcoming them is the challenge of playing away from home. Is it any more difficult for England in Chennai than it was for India when they weredismantled in English conditionsat Lord's in 2018? On the other, should the surface - and therefore the toss - dictate the outcome to this extent? This pitch has offered excessive encouragement for the spinners, even for the subcontinent. Whatever the rights and wrongs, the conditions provide context for the state of the match and it would be harsh to view this as another instalment in England's historical struggles in Asia. In this extreme environment, India's batsmen are more adept at scoring runs, their bowlers more relentless in exploiting the assistance. Yes, India won the toss, but they have also had Rohit's beautiful batting and Ashwin's mesmeric bowling, which England have not come close to matching. Even if India tailored the conditions following their chastening227-run defeatin the first Test, they have still outplayed England for two days in the Chennai sun. From 300-6 overnight, Rishabh Pant belted two straight sixes before running out of partners on 58 not out. After Rory Burns was lbw to the third ball of the England innings, playing all around a straight one from Ishant, the spinners got to work. Ashwin, with his subtle variations, had a sweeping Dom Sibley caught off the back of the bat, a tortured Dan Lawrence held a short leg and bowled Ben Stokes with a near-unplayable dipper that turned sharply to take off stump. In between, the accurate Axar struck the biggest blow by having captain Joe Root top-edge one of his trademark sweeps. It was only Foakes who delayed the India march and, when the tail was mopped up, Rohit picked up where he left off on Saturday to swiftly extend the lead. While this might seem like a brutal reality check for England after a superb performance in the first Test, they can still take heart from the performances of two of their most inexperienced players. Despite doing little wrong in his previous five Tests, Foakes is only playing because Jos Buttler has been rested, yet once again showed his class behind the stumps and his composure with the bat. Faultless with the gloves on day one, he began day two with a lightning stumping to remove Axar, then would later arrive at the crease with England floundering. With precise footwork and a solid defence, he was rarely troubled, steadying with Ollie Pope, who was equally unflustered for 22. After Pope was caught down the leg side off fast bowler Mohammed Siraj's first ball in a Test in India, Foakes marshalled the lower order to end undefeated. A rare blemish came when he missed the clear stumping chance as Rohit charged at Moeen Ali. Stone, in his second Test, impressed with his pace on day one. When England wanted to wrap up the India tail on Sunday morning, he was asked to rough up Kuldeep Yadav and Siraj, both of whom were both caught behind in the space of three balls to leave Stone with 3-47. Former England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social:""England have got to just fight. You never know, someone could do something remarkable. ""It looks like England will lose this game but try and take something into the next Test. Don't get too demoralised."" England assistant coach Graham Thorpe:""It's incredibly challenging on that surface for us. They have a skilled spin attack and it was a very good toss to win. ""There are some balls in the pitch that you might not be able to do too much about. In terms of commenting on the suitability of the pitch for a Test, that's for someone above me to say. ""We need something very, very special to happen tomorrow and somebody do something amazing with the bat. We knew we were going to have some tough times and the important thing is the dressing room doesn't get too affected by today."" England wicketkeeper Ben Foakes on Channel 4:""It was an incredibly tough day. The pitch was playing a few tricks. I just tried to stick to my game plan. ""We have to apply ourselves in the second innings, back our defence and try to put pressure on the bowlers."" India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin:""In the seven days of Test cricket we have played so far England have competed really well. I haven't seen them complaining about the conditions. ""There are conditions that will challenge you, whether it's with spin or with seam. If the ball is moving around at 145-150km/h off the deck, that has to be more challenging than someone bowling at 85-90km/h when the ball is spinning."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""There will be questions asked, in the wider game, about the suitability of this pitch for Test cricket. ""If cricket was played on this pitch all the time then there would be no need for five days."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It would be a ""big ask"" to reopen secondary schools in Northern Ireland on 8 March, the chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in NI has said. But Dr Tom Black said he was hopeful primary schools could reopen then. The executive has agreed that schools in Northern Ireland will remainclosed at least until 8 March. ""Opening schools has an increase of between 0.3 and 0.6 in the R number, so we couldn't do that at the moment,"" said Dr Black, speaking on BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme. He said the reopening of primary schools was more likely because ""we know the transmission infection in younger children is much lower"".

This video can not be played Scottish government: Closing travel quarantine loophole is 'critical' Scotland's transport secretary has said it is ""absolutely critical"" the UK closes a loophole as new quarantine regulations are set to come into force. From 04:00 GMT on Mondayall international arrivals in Scotlandmust self-isolate in hotels for 10 days. But in England the rules only apply to arrivals from 33""red list"" countries,external. The different approaches being taken by the UK and Scottish governments have raised concerns that people arriving at English airports and ferry terminals will then travel on to Scotland. Michael Matheson has asked for Scotland-bound travellers arriving at English airports to be offered quarantine facilities in England but said ""as yet, we are still waiting for the UK government to give us agreement on that"". Passengers required to self-isolate in hotels will have to pay the Â£1,750 cost of their managed quarantine, which could encourage people to avoid this by choosing English airports - even if Scotland is their final destination. The Scottish Conservatives accused Scottish ministers of ""stoking a row"" to distract attention from the ""mess"" they had made of their own quarantine plans. Labour, meanwhile, said the Scottish government was ""clueless"" about how it would make the new rules work. Read more. Lebanon began vaccinating its citizens on Sunday It's been a busy day with updates from around the world - so here's a reminder of the key global developments: Sunday'sdaily coronavirus figures,externalshow 15,062,189 people have now received an initial dose of the vaccine - after 505,362 first jabs were given out on Saturday. 537,715 people have received their second inoculation. So far the vaccination programme has been aimed at thetop four priority groups,external, including NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, over-70s, and people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable. From Monday, the vaccine rollout is beingexpanded to include over-65sand others considered clinically vulnerable The latest government data also reveals that a further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, taking the UK death toll to 117,166. More than 23,000 patients with coronavirus are in hospital, with nearly 3,000 on mechanical ventilators.  Takeaway firm Deliveroo and 300 restaurant groups are urging the government to run Eat Out to Help Out once again when restaurants are allowed to reopen. They said the discount scheme, which encouraged people to eat out with discounts of up to Â£10 per diner in August 2020, would boost demand for ailing restaurants. They also said other urgent support was needed to stop ""viable"" hospitality firms failing - and called on the government to extend the VAT reduction on restaurant food until at least the end of 2021. In a letter to the prime minister, Deliveroo and partners, including Itsu and Pizza Hut, said many restaurants were ""under immense financial pressure"". ""Even when they are able to reopen to customers, restrictions around mixing of households and social distancing measures mean that a return to trading at full capacity will remain dependent on the successful vaccine rollout,"" the letter stated. They said the Eat Out to Help Out scheme had helped restaurants ""survive"" in 2020 and should be run again ""when it is safe to do so"". Read more. A further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, while 10,972 new cases were also reported. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, said it was ""fantastic"" that more than 15 million vaccines had been administered and the NHS was ""incredibly proud"" of the achievement. ""I have to tell you this is an extraordinary logistical effort right the way across the NHS"" he said. ""Yet again when the nation needed the NHS to deliver - we have delivered."" However, he said caution needed to be exercised over lifting restrictions. People ""shouldn't make the assumption"" that lockdown could be eased just because many of the eldest in the UK population had received their first jab. And he said the NHS would need more funding and staff if there was to be an annual Covid booster.    Analysis Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is undeniable the vaccine programme has overall been a success - only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have done more jabs per head of the population. But, as well as pushing ahead with the under-70s, we mustn't forget those not yet vaccinated in the most vulnerable groups. There have been reports of housebound patients still waiting for their jab . And some have questioned whether enough has been done to reach out to those who have concerns about vaccination, and have not taken up the offer. The fear is that vaccination uptake may be lowest in some of the most vulnerable communities - and that risks widening health inequalities. There are still a lot of vulnerable at risk - and, with the numbers in hospital still above the peak in the first wave, the NHS isn't yet out of the woods. Henk Angenent (front) has just passed the halfway stage A former champion speed skater is racing across the northern Netherlands, aiming to finish the route of a rare marathon event before a coronavirus curfew comes into force later today. Henk Angenent has battled broken ice and a recurring knee injury. The 53-year-old has just moved beyond the halfway point of the 200km (124 mile) course. He was the last winner of the Elfstedentocht - a race last held in 1997 and keenly followed by millions of fans. Ice conditions were initially seen as favourable for a new edition this year, but officials said the race could not proceed due to coronavirus restrictions. Politicians and health experts have welcomed the news that at least 15 million people in the UK have had their first coronavirus jab. NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens has hailed it as ""an important milestone"" and said the UK vaccine programme was ""the biggest and fastest in Europe"". He paid tribute to the ""skill, care and downright hard work"" of NHS staff.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK has reached a ""significant milestone"" in the coronavirus vaccination rollout, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says. In a tweet,he writes,external: ""This country has achieved an extraordinary feat - administering a total of 15 million jabs into the arms of some of the most vulnerable people in the country."" In a video alongside the tweet he adds that everyone in the top four vaccination priority groups in England has now been offered a Covid jab, marking a major step towards the government reaching its 15 February target. The PM says he will set out full details tomorrow of the progress the UK has made in vaccinating the priority groups. Announcing the latest vaccination figure on Twitter,Nadhim Zahawi writes,external: ""15,000,000! Amazing team. ""We will not rest till we offer the vaccine to the whole of phase 1, the 1-9 categories of the most vulnerable and all over 50s by end April, and then all adults."" At least 15m people in UK have had their first coronavirus jab, Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawai says. The
government said it would offer at least one vaccine dose to everyone in the top
four priority groups in the UK by 15 February. That is:  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) estimates there are about 15 million people in these four groups. But, as
far as we know, the government never explicitly put a 15 million figure on its promise. The government is
only supplying regular data about the number of people vaccinated, so there is no
breakdown of how many people in the top four priority groups have been offered a vaccine or how many have rejected an offer of a vaccine. As we reported earlier, the government has said it is prepared to discuss with other countries how a so-called ""vaccine passport"" might allow people to travel abroad on holiday - by showing they have had a jab to protect against Covid 19. Conservative backbencher David Davis says he has few reservations about vaccination passports being used to travel between countries - but he insists they should not be needed to obtain entry to a shop or an entertainment venue at home. Speaking to Radio 4's World This Weekend, Davis says the idea of domestic passports runs ""completely contrary to history and traditions"" of the UK. ""We're a free country, [we've] never had to show papers to do things,"" he says. He adds this measure would amount to ""effective discrimination between different groups of people"" and that it would ""create two classes of society, saying to people that unless you're in this category you can't enjoy theatre or football"". He warns that it would involve ""a restriction to people's freedom that would last a long time... it wouldn't be abolished"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data
on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before
deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools; followed by
outdoor mixing; non-essential shops; then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs â who have been close to the prime
minister in recent years â are urging Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when
the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and
having to reimpose restrictions in a matter of weeks. Thatâs why ministers are
being cautious at the moment â and why the foreign secretary said it would be
wrong to set an arbitrary date. The pandemic means that Valentine's Day is very different from last year, when coronavirus had only just reached the UK. Following nearly a year of social distancing, lockdowns and limited opportunities to socialise in person, some couples have been thinking about how to make the day special even though they are apart. Others will be trying to find some time for romance while cooped up at home with young children. The BBC has beenasking people how they are celebrating this year, including LondonersDeep Bajwa, 37 andBhavin Bhagalia, 39, who say this Valentine's will be a day for the family and their children are in charge of planning the festivities.  Deep Bajwa says her children have planned their day We've also been looking at how restaurants - usually booked up with Valentine's dates - haveadapted their offeringsthis year. Eateries from local cafes to Michelin-starred restaurants are packaging up special dinners as a treat, in a bid to keep customers coming back when the pandemic is over. For Ruth Smith, who lives in East Molesey, near London, it's an opportunity for a fancy meal on Valentine's Day without being surrounded by loved-up couples. She will be getting a three-course meal kit from her local cafe, choosing from twice-baked cheese souffle with fennel and apple salad, individual beef Wellington, vanilla panna cotta with cardamom, and rose infused streusel. ""It means I'm really looking forward to Valentine's Day rather than kind of thinking, oh I'm going to be on my own and really not concerned at all this year,"" she says. Read more here.

The PM says he will set out full details tomorrow of the progress the UK has made in vaccinating the priority groups. Announcing the latest vaccination figure on Twitter,Nadhim Zahawi writes,external: ""15,000,000! Amazing team. ""We will not rest till we offer the vaccine to the whole of phase 1, the 1-9 categories of the most vulnerable and all over 50s by end April, and then all adults."" At least 15m people in UK have had their first coronavirus jab, Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawai says. The
government said it would offer at least one vaccine dose to everyone in the top
four priority groups in the UK by 15 February. That is:  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) estimates there are about 15 million people in these four groups. But, as
far as we know, the government never explicitly put a 15 million figure on its promise. The government is
only supplying regular data about the number of people vaccinated, so there is no
breakdown of how many people in the top four priority groups have been offered a vaccine or how many have rejected an offer of a vaccine. As we reported earlier, the government has said it is prepared to discuss with other countries how a so-called ""vaccine passport"" might allow people to travel abroad on holiday - by showing they have had a jab to protect against Covid 19. Conservative backbencher David Davis says he has few reservations about vaccination passports being used to travel between countries - but he insists they should not be needed to obtain entry to a shop or an entertainment venue at home. Speaking to Radio 4's World This Weekend, Davis says the idea of domestic passports runs ""completely contrary to history and traditions"" of the UK. ""We're a free country, [we've] never had to show papers to do things,"" he says. He adds this measure would amount to ""effective discrimination between different groups of people"" and that it would ""create two classes of society, saying to people that unless you're in this category you can't enjoy theatre or football"". He warns that it would involve ""a restriction to people's freedom that would last a long time... it wouldn't be abolished"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data
on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before
deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools; followed by
outdoor mixing; non-essential shops; then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs â who have been close to the prime
minister in recent years â are urging Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when
the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and
having to reimpose restrictions in a matter of weeks. Thatâs why ministers are
being cautious at the moment â and why the foreign secretary said it would be
wrong to set an arbitrary date. The pandemic means that Valentine's Day is very different from last year, when coronavirus had only just reached the UK. Following nearly a year of social distancing, lockdowns and limited opportunities to socialise in person, some couples have been thinking about how to make the day special even though they are apart. Others will be trying to find some time for romance while cooped up at home with young children. The BBC has beenasking people how they are celebrating this year, including LondonersDeep Bajwa, 37 andBhavin Bhagalia, 39, who say this Valentine's will be a day for the family and their children are in charge of planning the festivities.  Deep Bajwa says her children have planned their day We've also been looking at how restaurants - usually booked up with Valentine's dates - haveadapted their offeringsthis year. Eateries from local cafes to Michelin-starred restaurants are packaging up special dinners as a treat, in a bid to keep customers coming back when the pandemic is over. For Ruth Smith, who lives in East Molesey, near London, it's an opportunity for a fancy meal on Valentine's Day without being surrounded by loved-up couples. She will be getting a three-course meal kit from her local cafe, choosing from twice-baked cheese souffle with fennel and apple salad, individual beef Wellington, vanilla panna cotta with cardamom, and rose infused streusel. ""It means I'm really looking forward to Valentine's Day rather than kind of thinking, oh I'm going to be on my own and really not concerned at all this year,"" she says. Read more here.

"Donald Trump has been acquitted of a single impeachment charge that he incited a mob to storm the US Capitol. So what did the president say prior to the violence? On 6 January, thousands of Trump supporters gathered at a ""Save America"" rally organised to challenge the result of last November's presidential election. They listened as Mr Trump spoke to them on the National Mall, near the White House in Washington DC. In a 70-minute address, Mr Trump exhorted them to march on Congress where politicians had met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's win. The attack began moments after he took the applause. Those words have now played a central part in his second impeachment, which lawmakers voted in favour of last month. So what did he say? Here are five key quotes, followed by some legal analysis from Professor Garrett Epps of the University of Baltimore. What verdict means for Trump, Biden and America Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded This was three minutes into his speech. It was a false assertion that Democrats used as the starting point for the incitement charge - not just because he said it on this day but for weeks before. This quote appears in the article of impeachment, the charge that was backed by the House of Representatives, lower chamber of Congress. In the months preceding the Joint Session, President Trump repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials. Shortly before the Joint Session commenced, President Trump, addressed a crowd at the Ellipse in Washington, DC. There, he reiterated false claims that ""we won this election, and we won it by a landslide"". The article has been sent to the Senate, where Mr Trump's trial will begin on Tuesday. Here Trump was echoing the slogan of the movement to fight Mr Biden's election victory, which was started a day after the result was declared. It soon gathered pace on social media and led to rallies across the US. The largest one yet was the one Mr Trump addressed on 6 January. The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy This was Mr Trump saying in the clearest terms yet that he will never accept Mr Biden's win. Referring to himself and his supporters collectively, Mr Trump said there would be no concession. He went on: ""You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore."" This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters At one point, Mr Trump said the Biden presidency had to be challenged. ""You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can't let that happen."" This is the longest quote from Mr Trump's speech that appears in the article of impeachment. It could also be the one that his lawyers will find hardest to defend in the trial. He also wilfully made statements that, in context, encouraged - and foreseeably resulted in - lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ""if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore"". However, Mr Trump's lawyers have argued his use of the word ""fight"" was figurative, which has long been accepted in public discourse. This was the part of Mr Trump's speech that his defenders have seized on to show that he never incited the crowd. He said: ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."" The language was very different from other sections, which borrowed more from combat or war. Indeed, Mr Trump's lawyers have suggested they will highlight his use of the word ""peacefully"" in the trial. The president used ""we"" but he didn't join them as his supporters took the short walk from the rally to Congress. He said: ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them."" Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? What is incitement under the law? Incitement is not a crime under the First Amendment unless it meets certain criteria. First of all, it has to be intended to cause violence (and you infer that intent from the circumstances). It also has to be likely to cause violence. If I go downtown and I say to two drunks standing in front of a bank, ""let's rob this bank right now"", I haven't really incited anybody, because it's not very likely they'll rob the bank. If I say let's meet here tomorrow and rip things up, I'm not inciting because - in the words of the Supreme Court - where there is time for better counsels to prevail, the remedy for speech is more speech. The speech has to be likely to cause - and this is very important - imminent violent action. If this was a court of law, does Trump cross the line? It's quite rare that somebody can be convicted of incitement. In applying that to the president's speech at the rally, it's an agonisingly close case. It's pretty goddamn imminent because he's telling people to march to the Capitol and I will march with you. There wouldn't be any time for better counsels to prevail because you're just going to leave the Ellipse and walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. He said we have to fight and show strength, but he also said we're very peacefully and patriotically going to ask, so he's covering himself. In the end, I think it's a jury question. I'm not sure he's entitled to a dismissal of charges as a matter of law. There's some discussion that government leaders have more leeway, but I don't know how that would play out. He clearly knew there were people in that crowd who were ready to and intended to be violent, and he certainly did nothing to discourage that. He not only did nothing to discourage it, he strongly hinted it should happen.

"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab: ""You can't get ahead of the evidence"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has rejected calls from Conservative MPs to put a date on when England's lockdown measures will be eased, saying the government will be ""cautious"". The lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) said all restrictions must be lifted by the end of April. Mr Raab told the BBC he was ""confident"" in the vaccine rollout, but added: ""You can't get ahead of the evidence."" So far 14.5 million people have had at least one dose of the vaccine. Mr Raab said that the government was ""on track"" to hit its target of offering the vaccine to 15 million people from the top four priority groups by Monday. UK reports 13,308 cases on Saturday Covid jabs extended to all over-65s from Monday 'Optimistic' PM plots 'cautious' lockdown easing The CRG has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say there will be no justification for Covid laws once the top nine priority groups have been vaccinated - which the government is planning to have done by May. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We share all of the ambition and the desire to get out of this lockdown. We want to do it responsibly and safely and therefore it's got to be based on the evidence,"" adding, ""You can't get ahead of the evidence of the impact of the vaccine on the transmission."" He said the R-rate was between 0.7 and 1 and, as of Friday, the seven-day totals for admissions, cases and fatalities were down by between a fifth and a quarter respectively. But developments needed to be monitored ""in real time"", making it difficult to give guarantees or be precise about an end of April or beginning of May date for easing, he said. This video can not be played Mark Harper: ""It's not arbitrary at all, it's completely tied to the rollout of the vaccination programme"" Mr Johnson said on Saturday he planneda ""cautious"" reopening- the road map for which will be unveiled on 22 February, with restrictions on outdoor recreation expected to be among the first to be relaxed. The CRG - which was formed in November to oppose a third lockdown and says it has the backing of 63 MPs for its letter - said the prime minister should set out a plan for ""a return to normal life"" from 8 March. Newscast: Meet the Covid Recovery Group That is three weeks after Monday's target date for vaccinating 15 million of the most vulnerable - the same length of time the vaccineis believed to need to start taking effect- and the date pencilled in by the government for schools reopening. The top four priority groups, targeted for vaccination by 15 February include: Older residents in care homes and staff Health and social care workers Everyone over the age of 70 Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus The vaccine rollout has already beenofficially extended to people outside these groups, with invitations going out in England to people aged 65 to 69 and younger people who are in an at-risk group. Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools, followed by outdoor mixing, non-essential shops then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs - who have been close to the prime minister in recent years - are urging Mr Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and having to re-impose restrictions in a matter of weeks. That's why ministers are being cautious at the moment - and why the foreign secretary said it would be wrong to set an arbitrary date. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? The CRG called for pubs and restaurants to open by Easter in a ""Covid-secure"" and ""commercially viable"" way, saying two-thirds of the people in the top nine priority groups should have had a first vaccine dose by then. And by the end of the April, when all the priority groups should have had one jab of vaccine, they say all lockdown laws should be removed. The group says the burden of proof should be on ministers to show restrictions are necessary. Scientists and medics have urged caution, saying there is still potential for another surge in cases. Dr Shondipon Laha, a member of the Intensive Care Society, dismissed the idea that Covid-19 could end up being seen on the same level as the flu -something that has been suggested by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Mr Johnson. ""It's not just deadlier, it's more debilitating. So we're expecting to see significant numbers of patients who have had Covid who need intense rehabilitation."" ""We know that every patient that comes to an intensive care unit that needs ventilation loses muscle mass at 2-3% per day,"" Dr Laha said, adding that many such patients cannot stand and have problems with their long-term memories. Dr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, said the variations of coronavirus were becoming more infectious and more dangerous, also dismissing suggestions it could be treated the same as flu. She said restrictions should be lifted ""very gently"", and that, in the future, ""short, sharp"" lockdowns should be introduced for a few days to target smaller, localised outbreaks -similar to those being used in Australia.

"Chris Harrison has been the host of The Bachelor since 2002 The long-time host of hit US dating show The Bachelor has said he is stepping aside after widespread criticism of his comments on race. Chris Harrison drew ire after he excused behaviour of a current cast member that some said was racist, saying he was not the ""woke police"". ""By excusing historical racism, I defended it,"" the 49-year-old host said in an Instagram post announcement. This current season is the first to feature a black lead. The show revolves around a single bachelor selecting a potential spouse from a pool of hopefuls. In June 2020, fans of the ABC show petitioned for it to address the unequal treatment of cast members of colour. At the forefront of that initiative was Rachel Lindsay, who at the time was the only black lead to have ever served on The Bachelor's sister show, The Bachelorette. First black man cast in hit US reality dating show The show responded with a promise to address their race issues by casting more people of colour. They announced the first black lead, Matt James, as the next Bachelor on 12 June 2020, following the protests over George Floyd's death. First black Bachelor, Matt James When pictures surfaced of current contestant Rachael Kirkonnell at an Old South fraternity formal at a former slave plantation in 2018, she drew immediate criticism from fans. Ms Kirkonnell has since apologised. In an interview with Mrs Lindsey on Extra TV, Mr Harrison defended Ms Kirkonnell, a current front-runner who has yet to be eliminated from the show. ""I saw a picture of her at a sorority party five years ago and that's it,"" said Mr Harrison. Ms Lindsay reminded him the photo had been taken in 2018, which ""wasn't a good look"". ""Well, Rachel, is it a good look in 2018? Or, is it not a good look in 2021? Because there's a big difference,"" said Mr Harrison. To this, Mrs Lindsay pushed back and said: ""It's not a good look ever."" ""I am not the woke police,"" he replied, a phrase he reiterated several times throughout the interview. After the interview went live on Tuesday, a petition for the network to fire him went viral. By Saturday morning, it had amassed 38,000 signatures. Mrs Lindsay, who met her now-husband on the show, addressed her 13-minute interview with Mr Harrison on a podcast she hosts on Friday. ""During that conversation, he talked over me and at me, during that conversation,"" she said. ""He never gave me room to talk. And he never gave me room to share my perspective. He wasn't trying to hear it. He was just trying to be heard."" Rachel Lindsay and Bryan Abasolo Over the next few days, fans pressured former cast members to speak out. Ben Higgins and Joelle Fletcher, both good friends of Mr Harrison and considered frontrunners to succeed him should he eventually retire, condemned his words. ""Chris' statements were harmful. They were not helpful,"" Mr Higgins wrote on Instagram. The momentum snowballed as the entire cast from this season posted a joint statement standing by Mrs Lindsey. Although Mr Harrison issued an initial apology on Thursday it was not satisfactory for many members of Bachelor Nation, the self-proclaimed name given to fans of the show, and the number of people petitioning for his firing grew. After two days of silence, he announced on Saturday he would be taking a step back ""for a period of time"".

""Opening schools has an increase of between 0.3 and 0.6 in the R number, so we couldn't do that at the moment,"" said Dr Black, speaking on BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme.

The different approaches being taken by the UK and Scottish governments have raised concerns that people arriving at English airports and ferry terminals will then travel on to Scotland. Michael Matheson has asked for Scotland-bound travellers arriving at English airports to be offered quarantine facilities in England but said ""as yet, we are still waiting for the UK government to give us agreement on that"". Passengers required to self-isolate in hotels will have to pay the Â£1,750 cost of their managed quarantine, which could encourage people to avoid this by choosing English airports - even if Scotland is their final destination. The Scottish Conservatives accused Scottish ministers of ""stoking a row"" to distract attention from the ""mess"" they had made of their own quarantine plans. Labour, meanwhile, said the Scottish government was ""clueless"" about how it would make the new rules work. Read more. Lebanon began vaccinating its citizens on Sunday It's been a busy day with updates from around the world - so here's a reminder of the key global developments: Sunday'sdaily coronavirus figures,externalshow 15,062,189 people have now received an initial dose of the vaccine - after 505,362 first jabs were given out on Saturday. 537,715 people have received their second inoculation. So far the vaccination programme has been aimed at thetop four priority groups,external, including NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, over-70s, and people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable. From Monday, the vaccine rollout is beingexpanded to include over-65sand others considered clinically vulnerable The latest government data also reveals that a further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, taking the UK death toll to 117,166. More than 23,000 patients with coronavirus are in hospital, with nearly 3,000 on mechanical ventilators.  Takeaway firm Deliveroo and 300 restaurant groups are urging the government to run Eat Out to Help Out once again when restaurants are allowed to reopen. They said the discount scheme, which encouraged people to eat out with discounts of up to Â£10 per diner in August 2020, would boost demand for ailing restaurants. They also said other urgent support was needed to stop ""viable"" hospitality firms failing - and called on the government to extend the VAT reduction on restaurant food until at least the end of 2021. In a letter to the prime minister, Deliveroo and partners, including Itsu and Pizza Hut, said many restaurants were ""under immense financial pressure"". ""Even when they are able to reopen to customers, restrictions around mixing of households and social distancing measures mean that a return to trading at full capacity will remain dependent on the successful vaccine rollout,"" the letter stated. They said the Eat Out to Help Out scheme had helped restaurants ""survive"" in 2020 and should be run again ""when it is safe to do so"". Read more. A further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, while 10,972 new cases were also reported. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, said it was ""fantastic"" that more than 15 million vaccines had been administered and the NHS was ""incredibly proud"" of the achievement. ""I have to tell you this is an extraordinary logistical effort right the way across the NHS"" he said. ""Yet again when the nation needed the NHS to deliver - we have delivered."" However, he said caution needed to be exercised over lifting restrictions. People ""shouldn't make the assumption"" that lockdown could be eased just because many of the eldest in the UK population had received their first jab. And he said the NHS would need more funding and staff if there was to be an annual Covid booster.    Analysis Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is undeniable the vaccine programme has overall been a success - only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have done more jabs per head of the population. But, as well as pushing ahead with the under-70s, we mustn't forget those not yet vaccinated in the most vulnerable groups. There have been reports of housebound patients still waiting for their jab . And some have questioned whether enough has been done to reach out to those who have concerns about vaccination, and have not taken up the offer. The fear is that vaccination uptake may be lowest in some of the most vulnerable communities - and that risks widening health inequalities. There are still a lot of vulnerable at risk - and, with the numbers in hospital still above the peak in the first wave, the NHS isn't yet out of the woods. Henk Angenent (front) has just passed the halfway stage A former champion speed skater is racing across the northern Netherlands, aiming to finish the route of a rare marathon event before a coronavirus curfew comes into force later today. Henk Angenent has battled broken ice and a recurring knee injury. The 53-year-old has just moved beyond the halfway point of the 200km (124 mile) course. He was the last winner of the Elfstedentocht - a race last held in 1997 and keenly followed by millions of fans. Ice conditions were initially seen as favourable for a new edition this year, but officials said the race could not proceed due to coronavirus restrictions. Politicians and health experts have welcomed the news that at least 15 million people in the UK have had their first coronavirus jab. NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens has hailed it as ""an important milestone"" and said the UK vaccine programme was ""the biggest and fastest in Europe"". He paid tribute to the ""skill, care and downright hard work"" of NHS staff.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK has reached a ""significant milestone"" in the coronavirus vaccination rollout, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says. In a tweet,he writes,external: ""This country has achieved an extraordinary feat - administering a total of 15 million jabs into the arms of some of the most vulnerable people in the country."" In a video alongside the tweet he adds that everyone in the top four vaccination priority groups in England has now been offered a Covid jab, marking a major step towards the government reaching its 15 February target. The PM says he will set out full details tomorrow of the progress the UK has made in vaccinating the priority groups. Announcing the latest vaccination figure on Twitter,Nadhim Zahawi writes,external: ""15,000,000! Amazing team. ""We will not rest till we offer the vaccine to the whole of phase 1, the 1-9 categories of the most vulnerable and all over 50s by end April, and then all adults."" At least 15m people in UK have had their first coronavirus jab, Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawai says. The
government said it would offer at least one vaccine dose to everyone in the top
four priority groups in the UK by 15 February. That is:  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) estimates there are about 15 million people in these four groups. But, as
far as we know, the government never explicitly put a 15 million figure on its promise. The government is
only supplying regular data about the number of people vaccinated, so there is no
breakdown of how many people in the top four priority groups have been offered a vaccine or how many have rejected an offer of a vaccine. As we reported earlier, the government has said it is prepared to discuss with other countries how a so-called ""vaccine passport"" might allow people to travel abroad on holiday - by showing they have had a jab to protect against Covid 19. Conservative backbencher David Davis says he has few reservations about vaccination passports being used to travel between countries - but he insists they should not be needed to obtain entry to a shop or an entertainment venue at home. Speaking to Radio 4's World This Weekend, Davis says the idea of domestic passports runs ""completely contrary to history and traditions"" of the UK. ""We're a free country, [we've] never had to show papers to do things,"" he says. He adds this measure would amount to ""effective discrimination between different groups of people"" and that it would ""create two classes of society, saying to people that unless you're in this category you can't enjoy theatre or football"". He warns that it would involve ""a restriction to people's freedom that would last a long time... it wouldn't be abolished"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data
on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before
deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools; followed by
outdoor mixing; non-essential shops; then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs â who have been close to the prime
minister in recent years â are urging Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when
the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and
having to reimpose restrictions in a matter of weeks. Thatâs why ministers are
being cautious at the moment â and why the foreign secretary said it would be
wrong to set an arbitrary date. The pandemic means that Valentine's Day is very different from last year, when coronavirus had only just reached the UK. Following nearly a year of social distancing, lockdowns and limited opportunities to socialise in person, some couples have been thinking about how to make the day special even though they are apart. Others will be trying to find some time for romance while cooped up at home with young children. The BBC has beenasking people how they are celebrating this year, including LondonersDeep Bajwa, 37 andBhavin Bhagalia, 39, who say this Valentine's will be a day for the family and their children are in charge of planning the festivities.  Deep Bajwa says her children have planned their day We've also been looking at how restaurants - usually booked up with Valentine's dates - haveadapted their offeringsthis year. Eateries from local cafes to Michelin-starred restaurants are packaging up special dinners as a treat, in a bid to keep customers coming back when the pandemic is over. For Ruth Smith, who lives in East Molesey, near London, it's an opportunity for a fancy meal on Valentine's Day without being surrounded by loved-up couples. She will be getting a three-course meal kit from her local cafe, choosing from twice-baked cheese souffle with fennel and apple salad, individual beef Wellington, vanilla panna cotta with cardamom, and rose infused streusel. ""It means I'm really looking forward to Valentine's Day rather than kind of thinking, oh I'm going to be on my own and really not concerned at all this year,"" she says. Read more here.

"New Zealand has kept cases and deaths from Covid-19 low New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ordered the country's biggest city Auckland to go into lockdown after the discovery of three new local cases of Covid-19. The measures will last three days and require residents to stay at home. Ms Ardern said the country was going ""hard and early"" after the cases were identified. New Zealand has won widespread praise for its handling of the pandemic, going months without community transmission. The country closed its borders entirely to almost all non-citizens or residents early on in the pandemic, aiming to eliminate the virus. New Zealand, with a population of five million, has recorded just over 2,300 cases of Covid and 25 deaths. The measures in Auckland require its 1.7 million residents to stay at home except for essential shopping and work. Schools and non-essential shops will close, and entry in and out of the city restricted. Ms Ardern said three days should allow the government to get more information and get more testing done, and would also help determine if there was any community transmission. ""New cases of Covid-19 in the community was something none of us wanted to happen,"" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff said, adding the restrictions were the ""best way to stamp out the virus"". This video can not be played New Zealand band Six60 are playing to up to 30,000 fans: ""People are shoulder to shoulder, singing along"" The rest of the country moves to a higher level of alert, with schools and businesses remaining open but people encouraged to find alternative ways of working if possible. The lockdown forced the postponement of two races in sailing's America's Cup,external, one of the few major sporting events with no restrictions on spectators. The three community cases were announced earlier on Sunday - a mother, father and daughter from South Auckland. It is unclear how the three contracted Covid. The mother works in the laundry department for an airline catering facility, while New Zealand media said the father was a self-employed tradesman. New Zealand's Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said his team was ""working under the assumption that it is one of the new variants"". He added that the initial focus on investigations was the mother's workplace ""because of its obvious connections to the border"". Opposition leader Judith Collins urged New Zealanders to follow the advice of health officials. But she called for border workers to be vaccinated, saying: ""If this proves to be another border failure that is unacceptable. Our border should be rock-solid by now.""

"Chris Harrison has been the host of The Bachelor since 2002 The long-time host of hit US dating show The Bachelor has said he is stepping aside after widespread criticism of his comments on race. Chris Harrison drew ire after he excused behaviour of a current cast member that some said was racist, saying he was not the ""woke police"". ""By excusing historical racism, I defended it,"" the 49-year-old host said in an Instagram post announcement. This current season is the first to feature a black lead. The show revolves around a single bachelor selecting a potential spouse from a pool of hopefuls. In June 2020, fans of the ABC show petitioned for it to address the unequal treatment of cast members of colour. At the forefront of that initiative was Rachel Lindsay, who at the time was the only black lead to have ever served on The Bachelor's sister show, The Bachelorette. First black man cast in hit US reality dating show The show responded with a promise to address their race issues by casting more people of colour. They announced the first black lead, Matt James, as the next Bachelor on 12 June 2020, following the protests over George Floyd's death. First black Bachelor, Matt James When pictures surfaced of current contestant Rachael Kirkonnell at an Old South fraternity formal at a former slave plantation in 2018, she drew immediate criticism from fans. Ms Kirkonnell has since apologised. In an interview with Mrs Lindsey on Extra TV, Mr Harrison defended Ms Kirkonnell, a current front-runner who has yet to be eliminated from the show. ""I saw a picture of her at a sorority party five years ago and that's it,"" said Mr Harrison. Ms Lindsay reminded him the photo had been taken in 2018, which ""wasn't a good look"". ""Well, Rachel, is it a good look in 2018? Or, is it not a good look in 2021? Because there's a big difference,"" said Mr Harrison. To this, Mrs Lindsay pushed back and said: ""It's not a good look ever."" ""I am not the woke police,"" he replied, a phrase he reiterated several times throughout the interview. After the interview went live on Tuesday, a petition for the network to fire him went viral. By Saturday morning, it had amassed 38,000 signatures. Mrs Lindsay, who met her now-husband on the show, addressed her 13-minute interview with Mr Harrison on a podcast she hosts on Friday. ""During that conversation, he talked over me and at me, during that conversation,"" she said. ""He never gave me room to talk. And he never gave me room to share my perspective. He wasn't trying to hear it. He was just trying to be heard."" Rachel Lindsay and Bryan Abasolo Over the next few days, fans pressured former cast members to speak out. Ben Higgins and Joelle Fletcher, both good friends of Mr Harrison and considered frontrunners to succeed him should he eventually retire, condemned his words. ""Chris' statements were harmful. They were not helpful,"" Mr Higgins wrote on Instagram. The momentum snowballed as the entire cast from this season posted a joint statement standing by Mrs Lindsey. Although Mr Harrison issued an initial apology on Thursday it was not satisfactory for many members of Bachelor Nation, the self-proclaimed name given to fans of the show, and the number of people petitioning for his firing grew. After two days of silence, he announced on Saturday he would be taking a step back ""for a period of time"". ""To the Black community, to the BIPOC community: I am so sorry.My words were harmful,external,"" he said on Instagram. Mr James' season is just over halfway and has already been filmed, so Mr Harrison will not be absent from viewers' screens just yet.
