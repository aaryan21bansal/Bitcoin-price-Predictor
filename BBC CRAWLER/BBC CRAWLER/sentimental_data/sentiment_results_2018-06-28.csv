"This video can not be played Police describe how the shooting at the newspaper office ended A gunman has opened fire at a local newspaper office in Maryland, killing five people and injuring others in what police said was a ""targeted attack"". Staff at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis said the attacker, armed with a shotgun and smoke grenades, shot through a glass door into the newsroom. US media have named a suspect held by police as Jarrod Ramos. He is reported to have unsuccessfully sued the newspaper group in 2012 for defamation. Police have not confirmed a motive. They said a white male suspect in his late 30s was taken into custody at the scene of the shooting and was being questioned. Investigators were said to be looking into ""violent"" threats that had been made against the Capital Gazette via social media. ""This was a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette,"" said William Krampf, deputy chief of Anne Arundel County Police. He added that the gunman ""entered the building with a shotgun and looked for his victims as he walked through the lower level"". County executive Steve Schuh told CNN that the suspect was hiding under a desk in the building when police officers arrived ""within 60 seconds"" of receiving news of the incident. He said there was ""no exchange of fire"". Journalists describe terrifying gun attack Reality Check: Are journalists increasingly under attack?

He added that more than 170 people had been escorted safely from the building, which houses other businesses. Staff at the Capital Gazette's titles were left reeling from the shooting, but vowed to put out an edition on Friday. ""There is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while you're under your desk and then hear the gunman reload,"" tweeted reporter Phil Davis. Mr Davis described the shooting at the newspaper's office in Annapolis, just east of Washington DC, as being ""like a war zone"". He said that people were still hiding under their desks when the gunman stopped shooting. ""I don't know why. I don't know why he stopped,"" he told the Baltimore Sun. Chase Cook, a reporter, tweeted: ""I can tell you this: We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow.""

"Mrs May left the summit on Friday morning Forcing the UK to leave EU security pacts after Brexit risks the safety of EU and UK citizens, Theresa May has warned European leaders. The UK says EU negotiators are blocking agreement on tracking terrorists and sharing information after March 2019. The EU says as a ""third country"" the UK cannot have the same access to schemes. The EU's chief negotiator said they wanted an ""ambitious"" deal on trade and security but it must be based on ""our  values and principles"". Michel Barnier also warned that ""huge and serious divergence remains"" in Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU and urged the UK to bring forward ""workable and realistic proposals"" for their future relationship. ""The time is short and I am ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday,"" he said. Theresa May addressed fellow leaders at a dinner on Thursday night, during the final European Council meeting before October, when both sides hope they will have reached agreement on the UK's withdrawal and a blueprint for its future relationship with the EU. The talks, which stretched into the early hours of Friday, were dominated by the issue of migration, amid a threat from Italy to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not get more help. EU reaches migration deal in crunch talks Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress Brexit date could be delayed, says Blair Mrs May left Brussels on Friday morning and Brexit will be discussed by the remaining EU leaders without her. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthe prime minister had hoped to use the dinner to persuade them it was time to adopt a more flexible approach in negotiations. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte had threatened to veto the summit's agenda if Italy did not get help According to UK officials, Mrs May said EU leaders should tell their negotiators to allow the UK to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System. Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced. ""We would no longer be able to share real-time alerts for wanted persons, including serious criminals,"" she said. ""We would be able to respond less swiftly to alerts for missing people on either side of the Channel and reunite them with their loved ones. ""Our collective ability to map terrorist networks across Europe and bring those responsible to justice would be reduced. ""That is not what I want and I do not believe it is what you want either,"" the prime minister said. She urged them to ""consider what is in the best interests of the safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiators a mandate that will allow us to achieve this crucial objective."" This video can not be played Belgian PM Charles Michel gave Mrs May his team's shirt ahead of the World Cup clash on Thursday But the vice president of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness, said the focus should be on resolving the question about what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, not security co-operation. She told BBC Newsnight: ""I am curious as to why this issue would be thrown on the table or why even a veiled threat is necessary"". ""It may not be a helpful move"". And Mr Barnier said the EU wanted an ""EU-UK ambitious partnership, on trade as well as security"" but added: ""We have to base this partnership on our values and principles, respecting also the UK red lines."" Earlier this month he said the UK would be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit - which allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. He argued it could not remain a part of it, because the UK wanted to leave the European Court of Justice and free movement rules. After ten hours of talks about migration on Thursday night, EU leaders said that new migrant centres could be set up in EU countries on a ""voluntary"" basis. Mrs May welcomed the ""positive conclusions"" reached. She said much of the agreement was ""around what the UK has been encouraging for some time, which is taking more action upstream in countries of origin so that we can ensure that people aren't having to make and aren't making these very dangerous journeys.""

"Brexit is not the main event in Brussels Brussels is hot and sticky. Brexit is not the main event. And the prime minister does not have an enormous amount that is new to say until she has cracked her cabinet's heads together next week, after which, Number 10 promises that they'll give out a lot more detail. But it feels like a familiar and frustrating routine on all sides. Eight times Theresa May has arrived at a Brussels summit as prime minister. And it feels like, on each occasion, her counterparts have urged her to provide proper detail of what she wants life outside the EU to be like. Brexit talks to move faster, says May Merkel: Defining moment for EU on migration MPs demand five days to debate Brexit deal It's a broken record and its scratches give everyone earache. But this was the summit by which the deal was more or less meant to be done. The political agreement is scheduled to be done in October, and the UK - by its own admission - is still discussing different options. With only four months left to untangle 40 years of cooperation, the frustration around the continent is more obvious than ever. The Irish leader Leo Varadkar even suggested to the BBC that the UK still refuses to understand the fundamentals - that departure has to mean fewer benefits for Britain. This video can not be played Brexit: No cherry picking, no cake-and-eat-it, says Leo Varadkar He told me that the UK government still has to grasp the ""basics"" that it would ""not be a relationship of equals"". Theresa May of course acknowledges that the partnership will be different but, politically, she is a million miles away from being able to agree with such a statement, even if she were willing. Instead the UK is eager for the EU to become more flexible. To move away from what the government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission. At dinner on Thursday night there's a chance for her to persuade the other leaders to loosen that approach. Only they can tell their negotiators to ease up on their red lines. In return for that request, she'll promise tonight that the UK will be able to agree on its blueprint for the future relationship between the UK and EU, at a meeting of her cabinet next week. With almost daily skirmishes at home - that could prove optimistic. The UK feels lonely and frustrated here today. The migration crisis dominates the agenda, Brexit feels an annoyance, not a priority. But unblocking the process here, means cooling the Tory wars at home. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told me that the EU could not go on dealing with a split cabinet. To make progress here, the prime minister needs first to make a deal at home. By anyone's definition, this is not a fun summit for the UK.

"This video can not be played David Sheppard: 'My teenage years were coated in shame' Current and former members of the Mormon Church are calling for an end to the practice of asking children as young as eight intimate and sexual questions during annual interviews by church officials. ""I suffered with a lot of guilt, because I did things we weren't supposed to do,"" 27-year-old David Sheppard told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""They teach us masturbation is just below murder, and I felt like I was some sort of sexual deviant or pervert for doing it."" Mr Sheppard, from London, was brought up within the Mormon Church. From the age of 12 he was interviewed alone in a room by a bishop for what is known as a ""worthiness interview"". The Mormon Church is divided into wards, similar to parishes, with the bishop being the spiritual head of a local ward. The worthiness interviews, the church says, are designed to prepare children and teenagers spiritually and ensure they are obeying the commandments. They often start around a child's eighth birthday, when Mormon children are baptised, and then again at the age of 12. They are meant to be carried out at least annually thereafter into adulthood. France brings back national service Anger as model poses nude at Western Wall Rebel Wilson must repay defamation win The most controversial element of the interviews relates to something known as ""the law of chastity"", though some bishops choose not to ask questions about sex. In the Mormon Church - officially known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - sex outside of marriage, pornography and masturbation are banned. Mr Sheppard says between the ages of 16 and 19 he had ""a few girlfriends"" with whom he had intimate relationships, without having sex. ""I decided to confess to what I had been doing and it resulted in six hours of interrogation,"" he adds. ""They asked questions like, 'Did you touch her?' and 'Did you make her orgasm?'. ""They even tried to get me to give up the names of the girls so that she could be dealt with. ""At one point during the interview I felt sick from anxiety and asked to leave and go to the toilet but they wouldn't let me do that. ""I felt as though I had a total loss of control."" Mr Sheppard in Germany in 2011, while doing missionary work The interviews are conducted in a closed room, one-on-one with an older male bishop, unless the child or teenager requests another person to be present. They have caused controversy in the US, and now in the UK - where the church says there are 190,000 believers - a campaign to stop the practice is gaining ground. ""As a person, the bishop was a good man,"" says Mr Sheppard. ""He was just doing what he was told to do, but I think the interviews should be consented to by the child, and they should have someone else in the room. ""The bishops aren't even trained to do this sort of thing."" The Victoria Derbyshire programme has also heard first-hand accounts of a woman who says that as a teenage girl she was told not to use contraception, and a man who says a bishop spoke to him about ""praying the gay away"". The Mormon Church said it ""condemns any inappropriate behaviour regardless of where or when it occurs"". It added: ""Local church leaders are provided with instructions regarding youth interviews and are expected to review and follow them. ""A caring, responsible spiritual leader plays a significant role in the development of a young person by reinforcing the teaching of parents and offering spiritual guidance."" The church said their guidebook makes clear that children under 12 ""are not asked about chastity, and parents are invited to be with their child"". Stephen Blomfield, from Bedford, was on the church's Stake High Council until 2011 and is still a member of the Mormon Church. He did not conduct interviews but acted as an advisor to people who did. But he also now believes the interviews must be scrapped. ""At my first youth programme aged 12 or 13,"" he says, ""we were told kissing was bad, and touching was bad. ""So I adopted huge feelings of guilt, because I had already kissed girls."" Masturbation and pornography, he adds, were described as ""satanic"". The Mormon Church has an estimated 12 million members worldwide Mr Blomfield - whose father was a bishop - says, in his experience in the 1980s and 90s, how intrusive the questions were during interviews depended on the bishop. ""Some leaders asked really explicit questions... whereas others never asked unless you confessed first. ""The interviews could be really embarrassing, exposing and stressful."" Mr Blomfield now has children of his own, but says he has informed his local church they will not be interviewing them. ""If they want to, they need to discuss it with me first or make sure I'm present. ""I'm of the opinion the interviews should be scrapped. ""They've been around since the religion began, but they should have never been set up. ""They're intrusive and ask private questions, and I think they're the reason some Mormons can suffer shame- because they can't live up to the standards set.""

"People enjoy the heatwave in Brighton, where temperatures topped 26C All four nations of the UK have seen temperatures hit 30C for the first time in five years, as Britain swelters in another hottest day of the year. Highs of 30C and over were recorded in England, Wales and - for the first time since 2013 - Scotland and Northern Ireland, BBC Weather said. The mercury reached 32.6 in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, on Thursday - setting a new record high for 2018. The hot weather is forecast to continue for most of Britain into next week. Science Centre roof 'melts' as Scotland nears June record Heatwave puts pressure on water supplies How hot is it where you are? It is the fourth day in a row that the UK has seen its hottest day of the year so far, as temperatures have increased since Monday. The Met Office hasextended its heat warning,,externalwhich covers parts of England, to last until next Monday. In the north-west of England, there is an 80% chance of heatwave conditions, it said. Green Park in central London, as the UK enjoyed its fourth hottest day of the year in a row In Glasgow, a temperature of 31Cwas recordedat 15:00 BST, not quite breaking the longstanding June record for Scotland of 32.2C, last seen in 1893. There are reports of two roads melting in the heat, with poor conditions on the A920 between Huntly in Aberdeenshire and Dufftown in Moray, while gritters have been sent to the A916 in Fife. BBC Weather forecaster Billy Payne said Friday would not be as hot but temperatures could reach 29C, most likely in the west of Northern Ireland, western Wales and southern England. The hot weather is expected to continue for England and Wales on Saturday, he said, while Scotland and Northern Ireland would cool off. On Sunday, there is a chance of showers and thunderstorms in south-west England, south Wales and possibly Northern Ireland, and temperatures around London could top 30C again. Public Health England has urged,externalpeople to look out for the most at risk during the hot weather. Meanwhile, the RSPCA is urging pet owners to take particular care of their animals in the heat. In the two weeks to 24 June, they received 625 calls about animals in the high temperatures, mostly dogs in hot cars. And some rail commuters have faced a week of misery after speed limits were imposed to cope with the high temperatures affecting tracks. Services on the London Waterloo to New Malden line will continue to be affected by a temporary speed limit from 11:00 BST on Friday. How hot is it where you are?

"Repeated contact with the same doctor can be beneficial in many ways Patients who see the same doctor again and again have lower death rates, a study suggests. The benefits applied to visits to GPs and specialists and were seen across different cultures and health systems. University of Exeter researchers said the human aspect of medical practice was ""potentially life-saving"" but had been neglected. GPs' leaders said they recognised the value of patients seeing ""their own"" doctor. Because of intense workforce pressures, however, this could mean waiting even longer for an appointment, the Royal College of GPs said. Continuity of care is known to be particularly beneficial for patients with chronic conditions, long-term mental health issues and complex needs. NHS offers smartphone GP appointments Satisfaction with GP services at record low What will the NHS look like at 100 years old? The study, published in BMJ Open, analysed the results of 22 studies in nine countries, including England, France, US, Canada and South Korea. Eighteen of the studies indicated that contact with the same doctor over an average of two years meant fewer deaths over the periods studied, compared with other patients. The researchers said continuity of care was important and should be given a higher priority in healthcare planning. Prof Philip Evans, from the University of Exeter Medical School, said: ""Continuity of care happens when a patient and a doctor see each other repeatedly and get to know each other. ""This leads to better communication, patient satisfaction, adherence to medical advice and much lower use of hospital services."" Sir Denis Pereira Gray, from St Leonard's GP practice in Exeter, who also worked on the study, said: ""Patients have long known that it matters which doctor they see and how well they can communicate with them. ""Until now, arranging for patients to see the doctor of their choice has been considered a matter of convenience or courtesy. ""Now, it is clear it is about the quality of medical practice and is literally 'a matter of life and death'."" Prof Kamila Hawthorne, vice-chair of the Royal College of GPs (RCGP), said many practices were trying out different approaches such as patients being assigned a team of healthcare professionals, including a GP, who had access to their records and could build relationships with them. She said: ""Balancing continuity of care with timely access to GP services is a huge challenge for general practice. And ultimately the answer is more GPs and more resources for the profession."" NHS England has pledged Â£2.4bn extra a year for general practice and 5,000 more GPs by 2020. The RCGP said these must be delivered to safeguard the future of general practice and patient care.

Residents have rallied round after the blaze near Saddleworth Moor spread across seven square miles, in six different areas, since Sunday night. A local fish and chip shop is offering free meals, while pupils off school because of the fire have delivered cards, gifts and food. Stalybridge MP Jonathan Reynolds said: ""The Blitz spirit... has been amazing."" Moorland 'needed controlled burning' Soldiers help tackle moorlands fire What the moorland fire means for wildlife Military assistance was requested to help battle the blaze, with about 100 firefighters on moorland above Stalybridge. Tony Hunter, assistant chief fire officer at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS), said the blaze was currently under control but may flare up again. He said: ""The fire is contained at the moment, but we only need a change of wind direction to see the fire increase. We are working hard to keep on top of the blaze."" Donations of drinks and food parcels have been flooding in to Stalybridge Fire Station He said there had been a ""significant effect"" on the blaze in the past 24 hours and work was continuing with the help of the Army. GMFRS said it has made ""good progress"" and there are now five separate areas of fire, reduced from seven. Scottish soldiers from the 100-strong A Company of the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, joined firefighters to tackle the fire.

"This video can not be played Grenfell firefighter Charles Batterbee tells of blazing debris falling from the block One of the first firefighters to enter Grenfell Tower has told how he clung to his colleague as he dangled out of a window trying to put out rising flames. Charles Batterbee and Daniel Brown had extinguished the source of the fire in flat 16's kitchen only to notice fire on the outside of the high-rise. Mr Batterbee said he held Mr Brown's legs as he leant out of the burnt window frame to push his hose upwards. ""I'm holding on to him for dear life,"" he told the Grenfell public inquiry. ""I'm digging my hips into the [kitchen] counter so we don't both go together,"" he added. Meanwhile, he said burning debris was falling past the fourth floor window of the flat they were in. ""It just rained fire,"" he said. At the time he thought the fire was ""jumping multiple floors"", the inquiry heard. ""It didn't slow, it got worse,"" he said. He also told the hearing that the heat in the kitchen was something he had never experienced before in training or operationally. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal What happened at Grenfell Tower Visual guide to the fire The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast with Eddie Mair: Thursday As Mr Batterbee was giving evidence, the government released new figures showing it has identified almost 300 privately-owned tower blocks with unsafe Grenfell-style cladding. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said tests had identified a further 156 residential high-rises with aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, which is unlikely to meet current building regulations, taking the total of privately-owned blocks with that material to 297. In a written statement,external, he said remediation work had begun on 21 of them but the government wanted to speed it up, and has created a taskforce to oversee that work. In further evidence, Mr Batterbee told the hearing that after leaving the tower, he headed to the incident commander to debrief him and saw the full force of the fire for the first time. ""I looked up at the side of the tower and I'll never get over that shock,"" he said, suddenly overcome with emotion. On the ground, it was organised chaos, he said, with debris falling and the pump revving - ""it was hell"". Mr Batterbee, who joined the London Fire Brigade in 2010, earlier broke down in tears when thermal imaging footage of him going into flat 16 was first shown. The chairman ordered that they take a break to let Mr Batterbee compose himself. In a written statement, Mr Batterbee said there were ""no words to describe how powerless"" he felt when he was on the phone to a trapped resident. He said the fire had been ""life-changing and potentially career-changing in a way I can never really describe"". ""I don't really think that there are any words to really capture this horrific event - this was the worst thing that I have ever experienced and witnessed."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? His crewmate Mr Brown, who has been a firefighter in north Kensington for 26 years, has begun giving evidence. He said he could recall a time when Grenfell Tower had an integrated alarm system and a concierge, which meant residents would evacuate when the alarm was triggered. Asked whether he had received training to carry out a mass evacuation, he said: ""We don't do evacuation. We do assist and rescue."" He said they couldn't lead residents to a ""free for all"" when they did not know whether the way out was safe. The public inquiry into the tower block fire in west London, which caused 72 deaths, is currently examining what happened when the blaze broke out on 14 June last year. It hascome under criticism from the Fire Brigades Unionthis week, which said questions put to watch manager Michael Dowden, who led the firefighting response in the first hour, had been ""absurd"".

"British defence giant BAE Systems has won a multi-billion pound contract from the Australian government to build nine new warships, marking a significant victory for British military exports. BAE beat Italian and Spanish rivals to win a large slice of the Â£19.6bn ($25.7bn; A$35bn) spending programme. The ships will be based on anti-submarine frigates that BAE is building for the UK's Royal Navy. However, the new warships will be built in Australia by a local workforce. BAE's Australian arm said the construction of the ships locally would make a significant contribution to Australia's economy ""creating thousands of jobs, supporting new industries and boosting the national supply chain for decades to come"". ""We are proud to have been selected as preferred tenderer to provide the Royal Australian Navy with a world-class ship, equipped with the latest technologies and designed specifically to meet its needs,"" BAE Systems Australia chief executive, Gabby Costigan said. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the deal was also an ""enormous boost"" for the UK economy and reflected the government's strategy to ""build on our close relationships with allies like Australia"" as the UK prepares to leave the EU. It is the first export of a British design for new-build frigates since the 1970s, the UK government said. The ships to be built will be based on BAE Systems' Type 26 frigate, and will be called the ""Hunter class"". Production in Australia is expected to commence in 2020. The Hunter class ships will be built in Adelaide, South Australia, by government-owned ASC Shipbuilding and the programme is expected to create at least 5,000 local jobs across about 30 years. ""The Hunter class will provide the Australian Defence Force with the highest levels of lethality and deterrence our major surface combatants need in periods of global uncertainty,"" the Australian government said. The ships will be fitted with long-range anti-missile defence systems. The Type 26 currently being built for the Royal Navy forms the basis of the design sold to the Australian government While the overall budget is Â£19.6bn, only a part of that will come to BAE Systems for the design and build of the frigates. BAE Systems chief executive Charles Woodburn said: ""I am proud that our world class anti-submarine warfare design and our approach to transferring technology and skills to the nations in which we work is expected to contribute to the development of an enduring world-class naval shipbuilding industry in Australia."" Italy's Fincantieri SpA and Spain's Navantia also bid for the contract. BAE's shipyards on the Clyde in Glasgow are unlikely to see a significant boost to jobs. Gary Cook of the GMB union criticised the deal, saying: ""The inconvenient truth is that we're not exporting ships, only manufacturing jobs that should be going to British shipbuilding communities. ""And had the UK government and BAE invested in the promised frigate factory at Scotstoun, those frigates could easily be built here. ""Instead, there is a rubble pile where that factory should be, while 4,000 jobs and significant prosperity will be enjoyed in Australia and not the UK."" Nevertheless, defence analysts said the deal represented a significant success for British naval exports. ""It is the deal of the century,"" said Francis Tusa, editor of industry newsletter Defence Analysis. The UK has had an ""abysmal"" export record for warship sales for the past five decades, he said. But this represented ""a massive sea-change"". Canada, which is also planning to order warships later this year, might be influenced by Australia's decision, he added. Selling the design overseas will help spread the costs of design and production of many elements of the frigate, potentially bringing down the cost of the Type 26 to the Royal Navy significantly, according to Mr Tusa. However, it was not only BAE Systems who would benefit from the deal, he said. Small and medium-sized UK companies would be likely to win orders for some of the technology required on the Australian ships. Firms that are already supplying the UK government's order of the Type 26 would be in a strong position to also supply Australian orders. The design success of the Global Combat Ship, otherwise known as the Type 26, is a breakthrough for BAE Systems. Over several decades, it has struggled to turn the Royal Navy's requirements into a design that other countries want to buy, or are willing to pay for. Orders from other navies used to mean manufacturing at UK yards. But now, other countries want to get the economic benefit of their military spending, so they insist on building themselves. The hull can be the relatively cheap bit of building a complex warship, so there may be benefits to British arms exporters in selling weapons systems that fit into the Australian frigates. However, this looks like a design which was heavily subsidised by the UK taxpayer, being sold overseas, and wholly to the benefit of BAE Systems.  It appears that the UK taxpayer sees none of the direct payback or royalties from that investment. Independent defence analyst Paul Beaver said the appeal of the Type 26 design is that it is modular. ""We are supplying the technology behind the hull, other nations will put their engines, their weapons systems into it. It's designed in a way that it can cope with that. ""You don't have to buy a certain type of missile or gun. You can buy a raft of different ones which will be very attractive."" He said he believed the agreement would turn out to be part of a wider deal on defence procurement between the UK and Australia.

"Mrs May left the summit on Friday morning Forcing the UK to leave EU security pacts after Brexit risks the safety of EU and UK citizens, Theresa May has warned European leaders. The UK says EU negotiators are blocking agreement on tracking terrorists and sharing information after March 2019. The EU says as a ""third country"" the UK cannot have the same access to schemes. The EU's chief negotiator said they wanted an ""ambitious"" deal on trade and security but it must be based on ""our  values and principles"". Michel Barnier also warned that ""huge and serious divergence remains"" in Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU and urged the UK to bring forward ""workable and realistic proposals"" for their future relationship. ""The time is short and I am ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday,"" he said. Theresa May addressed fellow leaders at a dinner on Thursday night, during the final European Council meeting before October, when both sides hope they will have reached agreement on the UK's withdrawal and a blueprint for its future relationship with the EU. The talks, which stretched into the early hours of Friday, were dominated by the issue of migration, amid a threat from Italy to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not get more help. EU reaches migration deal in crunch talks Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress Brexit date could be delayed, says Blair Mrs May left Brussels on Friday morning and Brexit will be discussed by the remaining EU leaders without her. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthe prime minister had hoped to use the dinner to persuade them it was time to adopt a more flexible approach in negotiations. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte had threatened to veto the summit's agenda if Italy did not get help According to UK officials, Mrs May said EU leaders should tell their negotiators to allow the UK to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System. Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced. ""We would no longer be able to share real-time alerts for wanted persons, including serious criminals,"" she said. ""We would be able to respond less swiftly to alerts for missing people on either side of the Channel and reunite them with their loved ones. ""Our collective ability to map terrorist networks across Europe and bring those responsible to justice would be reduced. ""That is not what I want and I do not believe it is what you want either,"" the prime minister said. She urged them to ""consider what is in the best interests of the safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiators a mandate that will allow us to achieve this crucial objective."" This video can not be played Belgian PM Charles Michel gave Mrs May his team's shirt ahead of the World Cup clash on Thursday But the vice president of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness, said the focus should be on resolving the question about what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, not security co-operation. She told BBC Newsnight: ""I am curious as to why this issue would be thrown on the table or why even a veiled threat is necessary"". ""It may not be a helpful move"". And Mr Barnier said the EU wanted an ""EU-UK ambitious partnership, on trade as well as security"" but added: ""We have to base this partnership on our values and principles, respecting also the UK red lines."" Earlier this month he said the UK would be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit - which allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. He argued it could not remain a part of it, because the UK wanted to leave the European Court of Justice and free movement rules. After ten hours of talks about migration on Thursday night, EU leaders said that new migrant centres could be set up in EU countries on a ""voluntary"" basis. Mrs May welcomed the ""positive conclusions"" reached. She said much of the agreement was ""around what the UK has been encouraging for some time, which is taking more action upstream in countries of origin so that we can ensure that people aren't having to make and aren't making these very dangerous journeys.""

Iyamu, 51, formerly of Bermondsey, was convicted of five counts of arranging or facilitating travel for sexual exploitation at Birmingham Crown Court. Jurors also found her guilty of perverting the course of justice. The rituals saw the women forced to eat chicken hearts, drink blood containing worms, and have powder rubbed into cuts, the court heard. This video can not be played ""Kiki"" was one of Josephine Iyamu's victims Iyamu is the first person to be convicted under Modern Slavery Act laws passed in 2015, allowing prosecutions of British citizens for overseas sexual trafficking. She was born in Liberia, but became a British citizen in 2009 having been allowed to stay in the UK due to her nursing qualifications. Her husband, 60-year-old Efe Ali-Imaghodor, was acquitted of doing acts intending to pervert the course of justice. Iyamu declared a modest income of around Â£14,500 in 2016/17 from her work as an NHS agency nurse, the court heard. But after her arrest last year investigators found she was able to afford to spend thousands on air travel and a large home in Benin City, Nigeria. Iyamu had a large home in Benin City in Nigeria Prosecutor Simon Davis said by performing rituals Iyamu gained psychological control over the women. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Iyamu had ""enlisted the help of a voodoo priest"" to put the women through a ""juju"" ceremony which was ""designed to exert control"" over them. The victims and their families were threatened with serious harm if they broke their oath to Iyamu, according to the NCA. The court heard Iyamu was ""willing to put the women at risk of serious injury and or death as they made their journey from Nigeria to Europe"". They were too afraid to challenge her or fail to pay her back tens of thousands of Euros she charged them to be trafficked into Germany, the court was told. Opening the case, Mr Davis said: ""The debts incurred by the women were enforced through fear. ""Each of the women were put through what is known to some as a voodoo ceremony."" Iyamu will be sentenced on Wednesday. 'Kiki' was one of Iyamu's victims.

"Host Karamo Brown (left) said he was moved by viewers' complaints about accessibility Karamo Brown, a host on the hugely successful makeover show Queer Eye, has added his voice to a social media debate urging Netflix to improve its subtitles for deaf and hard-of-hearing watchers. Fans of the show took to Twitter to complain about the service misrepresenting, censoring and simplifying dialogue from a variety of shows. Tweets by Rogan Shannon, a deaf Netflix fan, in which he demanded that the service explain why it was not captioning word for word, have been shared thousands of times in recent days. Mr Shannon says new Netflix series have ""a lot of errors and issues with their captions"" His tweets claim the subtitles censor profanity and edit dialogue for brevity. Others accused the service of failing to caption foreign language inserts and correcting distinct dialects into Standard English. Mr Brown, the Queer Eye cast member who focuses on culture, said reading fan comments had broken his heart. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Subtitles are created in different ways by different broadcasters, with many employing outside subtitling firms. They can be written manually and time-coded to audio, or are generated using dictation software or audio recognition. Why is Queer Eye connecting so much with viewers? Queer Eye would 'love' to do UK version Who are Queer Eye's Fab Five hosts Gemma Rayner-Jones, 31, from Canterbury in England, uses subtitles to help her to concentrate when watching shows online because of a cognitive impairment. Because she is able to hear and notice the differences, she has been tracking and complaining about inaccuracies in Netflix's subtitles for about two years. Ms Rayner-Jones began to keep track of some of her complaints this year, after finding they were not being fixed She estimates that she has submitted about 150 complaints in that time, and says she has not had a response. ""Everyone should be getting the same experience,"" she told the BBC. ""It seems a shame to have a system to report faults there to placate people, but they don't seem to be doing anything about it."" The sign language lawyer who became a social media star Disabled music fans face ticketing barriers Deaf Eritrean twins break fashion barriers She wants Netflix to be more transparent about how it handles complaints, so that users can check in whether action has been taken. Student Chrissy Marshall, 18, studies film at the University of California and runs a YouTube account trying to raise awareness about deaf culture, accessibility and sign language. She was one of many who took to Twitter to complain about inaccuracies in Queer Eye's subtitling. For her, online streaming still remains one of the best entertainment options available. ""I don't watch cable or normal TV because captioning is always messed up or lagging. As for movie-going in theatres, the experience normally sucks,"" she told the BBC. Chrissy Marshall says she finds it offensive when she can lip-read differences with captions ""Netflix is what I use as a primary source for streaming because typically it is the most accessible, but even the most accessible has its issues. ""Captioning as a job is not to 'clean up' language, it's to provide accessibility, full accessibility. ""We don't care if it's a bad word, vulgar, or maybe inappropriate, if hearing people get to know what is being said, we deserve to know as well."" This is not an issue isolated to Netflix itself. While regulations are in place for closed captioning (user-activated) subtitles on typical television services, many on-demand services still lag behind. One YouTube vlogger, Rikki Poynter, has dedicated years to working on accessibility on the platform, lobbying it to improve its automatic subtitle service using the hashtag #NoMoreCRAPtions. In the US, the Federal Communications Commission has strict regulations which specify that captions ""must match the spoken words in the dialogue and convey background noises and other sounds to the fullest extent possible"" - but it only requires the regulations on shows on television, which means that Netflix-exclusive original series may not qualify. The National Association of the Deaf sued and made a four-year agreement with Netflix in 2012, where it committed to ensuring all its programmes were subtitled. Although the four-year decree has now run out, on Thursday the group told the BBC it was ""disappointed that Netflix appears not to be providing captioning at the level that was promised"" and said it hoped it would ensure it was using verbatim and accurate captions. In the UK, Action on Hearing Loss has spent three years on a Subtitle It! campaign aiming to get the UK government to extend regulation to captioning of video-on-demand content. Helping deaf refugees learn sign language Deaf model shares cinema frustration Deaf mum sues concert promoter Dr Roger Wicks, the group's director of policy and campaigns, told the BBC that any attempt by providers to summarise or edit language on subtitles was a ""very bad approach"" which could lead to people who were deaf or hard-of-hearing feeling ""alienated or patronised"". ""Subtitles are a replacement for speech, they're meant to be verbatim so people have full access,"" he told the BBC. ""Any attempt to summarise is offering a second-class service. I think this is well-intentioned, but it's getting it wrong."" He told the BBC his group intended to contact Netflix over the issue. Mr Shannon, whose widely-shared tweets helped spark the debate, wants the company to change and check the way it subtitles its shows. ""I'd like to see more oversight on captioning agencies, more strict procedures for checking the captions,"" he told the BBC. ""I'd also like to see those who are doing the hiring, such as Netflix, to check that all the files that they get are accurate, and not just assume they did everything right. ""I'm aware that it's time consuming, but this will continue to be a problem if there are no checks and balances. Accessibility really matters."" Deaf and hard of hearing people have been saying for years that subtitles just aren't good enough - whether on traditional TV or streaming platforms like Netflix - and it's wonderful that the clamour for change has led to a commitment this time around. I'm hard of hearing and I watch all my on-screen entertainment with subtitles. In many ways streaming has made that easier - if I watched live TV I'd be missing loads of what was going on. If you've ever watched a news channel with the sound off in the gym, you'll know what I mean - whole sentences are missed, random words pop up... But when things are scripted and pre-packaged, in my view there's no reason to miss things out. An estimated nine million people in the UK have a hearing impairment of some kind - more than live in London. Many of us completely depend on the subtitlers to get the meaning across. And many hearing people watch subtitles on their phone when they have no headphones, or for all sorts of other reasons. Programme-makers must realise subtitle users are part of your audience - don't sell them short. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? A key European Union summit may end without a deal to resolve a row over ways to tackle irregular migration. Italy - the entry point of thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - says it will veto a joint statement over the entire agenda if no solution is found. Leaders were talking into the early hours of Friday to find a compromise. Italy wants other countries to share the burden. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the issue could be a defining moment for the EU. Mrs Merkel is under pressure to come up with a deal to prevent new arrivals. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, has given her until this weekend. Otherwise he has said he will start turning away migrants from the border in his home state. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The migrant flows also include refugees fleeing the Syrian war and other conflicts, urgently seeking asylum. It is not a crisis on the scale of 2015, when thousands were coming ashore daily on the Greek islands. The European Council - the EU's strategic leadership - says the numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their peak in October 2015. Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migrant mutiny The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? But this month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently the German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight. The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take a share of the migrants on board. Malta said that Norway had now also agreed to take some migrants from the Lifeline. The Dublin principle - that asylum seekers should stay in the country where they enter the EU - has broken down. Italy and Greece, who receive the most, are demanding that their neighbours share the burden. This video can not be played Belgian PM gives UK PM his team's shirt ahead of World Cup clash on Thursday evening There was a lighter note, as the summit got under way in Brussels. Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel presented UK Prime Minister Theresa May with a Belgian football shirt ahead of the two countries' World Cup clash. It bore the number of Belgian star Eden Hazard. By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor Hardened Eurosceptics might love to think the EU's in trouble, but as leaders gather in Brussels for their summer summit on Thursday, dedicated Europhiles are also sounding the alarm. ""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size."" It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread. Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden. Read more from Katya Italy's new populist government has made getting an EU-wide deal on immigration and asylum a priority. The issue played a major role in the Italian election, catapulting nationalist League leader Matteo Salvini into power. But it is a powerful election issue EU-wide. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? How do EU governments see the summit? Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Brexit talks to move faster, May says Austria's right-wing government takes over the EU's rotating presidency next month and it has a hardline stance on irregular migrants. So do its Visegrad Group neighbours: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. That group rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. Italy is the main destination for migrants rescued from overloaded boats off Libya Much of the attention is on the German chancellor, because her interior minister has threatened to start blocking migrants at the border if they have already registered in another EU country. Without his party, the CSU, she would lose her parliamentary majority. European Council President Donald Tusk told the leaders in his pre-summit letter""the stakes are very high and time is short"",external. He warned that the EU's problems with migration policy were giving ammunition to populists, who ""offer simple answers to the most complicated questions"". 1. 'Regional disembarkation platforms' This is an Austrian-Danish proposal, aimed at breaking the business model of the people-smuggling gangs. In the draft summit conclusions, it is seen as a way to speed up the processing of asylum claims and stopping illegal economic migrants. Pros? They could deter migrants from putting to sea in overloaded boats. Gangs might then be less able to profit from migrants' desperation. Cons? Getting North African countries to host such centres could be very difficult. Morocco again on Thursday rejected the idea. Close co-ordination with UN agencies will be needed, to prevent them becoming crowded, dangerous camps. Greece says emergency action is necessary to ""decongest"" some of its islands 2. Beefing up EU border agency Frontex The European Commission says this would make it a genuine border police force.The force is to be boosted from the current 1,300 (with 1,500 in reserve) to 10,000 by 2027,external. Pros? The force could intervene more rapidly, nipping migrant emergencies in the bud, preventing any repetition of the 2015 chaos. Cons? Solidarity has been lacking among the 28 member states. Frontex still lacks some important resources that were pledged. EU police risk usurping the role of national border guards - a sensitive issue. This video can not be played Migrant crisis: EU border force Frontex explained 3. More co-operation with transit and migrants' home countries This would allow more failed asylum seekers to be sent back; the ""return"" rate currently is just 36.6%, the Commission says. Pros? There has been effective EU co-operation with Turkey: a 2016 deal led to a drastic drop in migrants taking the Balkan route. The EU naval mission off Libya works closely with the Libyan coastguard to stop people-smuggling. Cons? Conditions are dire in Libyan migrant holding centres. Turkey is still short of â¬3bn (Â£2.6bn; $3.5bn), pledged by the EU for Syrian refugees. Tackling poverty in Africa, from which many migrants are fleeing, requires generous EU funding. There is an EU Trust Fund for Africa, but it is short of â¬1.2bn in pledged funds. Malta allows migrant ship to dock The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers?

Highs of 30C and over were recorded in England, Wales and - for the first time since 2013 - Scotland and Northern Ireland, BBC Weather said. The mercury reached 32.6 in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, on Thursday - setting a new record high for 2018. The hot weather is forecast to continue for most of Britain into next week. Science Centre roof 'melts' as Scotland nears June record Heatwave puts pressure on water supplies How hot is it where you are? It is the fourth day in a row that the UK has seen its hottest day of the year so far, as temperatures have increased since Monday. The Met Office hasextended its heat warning,,externalwhich covers parts of England, to last until next Monday. In the north-west of England, there is an 80% chance of heatwave conditions, it said. Green Park in central London, as the UK enjoyed its fourth hottest day of the year in a row In Glasgow, a temperature of 31Cwas recordedat 15:00 BST, not quite breaking the longstanding June record for Scotland of 32.2C, last seen in 1893. There are reports of two roads melting in the heat, with poor conditions on the A920 between Huntly in Aberdeenshire and Dufftown in Moray, while gritters have been sent to the A916 in Fife. BBC Weather forecaster Billy Payne said Friday would not be as hot but temperatures could reach 29C, most likely in the west of Northern Ireland, western Wales and southern England. The hot weather is expected to continue for England and Wales on Saturday, he said, while Scotland and Northern Ireland would cool off. On Sunday, there is a chance of showers and thunderstorms in south-west England, south Wales and possibly Northern Ireland, and temperatures around London could top 30C again. Public Health England has urged,externalpeople to look out for the most at risk during the hot weather. Meanwhile, the RSPCA is urging pet owners to take particular care of their animals in the heat.

"Teachers leaving the profession outnumber new recruits, the figures suggest The number of teachers working in state-funded schools in England has fallen to its lowest level since 2013, official statistics show. Last year, 451,900 full time equivalent teachers were working in English state schools, compared with 457,000 in 2016. Teacher numbers have not been lower since 2013, according tofigures published on Thursday by the Department for Education,external. The government said recruiting more teachers was a top priority. Until last year, teacher numbers had been rising steadily. In 2011, there were 440,000 teachers in English schools, reaching 449,000 by 2013, and 457,000 by 2016 - but last year the number fell sharply. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the largest teachers' union, the NEU, said the statistics would make ""grim reading"" for Education Secretary Damian Hinds. She said qualified teachers leaving the profession outnumbered new recruits. ""We are losing teachers too quickly, undoubtedly because the government is burning them out with an excessive workload and they can earn more and have a better work-life balance in another profession."" Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, said parents would be particularly concerned that the teacher shortage coincided with evidence of increasing class sizes. Separate government figures, also published on Thursday,,externalshow the number of pupils in England's schools continues to rise, with secondary schools affected for the fourth year in a row. There are now 66,000 more children in England's schools, compared with last year. Some of the increase is in primaries but most of it is in secondaries, where overall numbers have risen 35,400 as the baby boom of the early 2000s makes the transition. The figures suggest the staffing crisis means teachers increasingly lack university-level qualifications in the subjects they teach, with more than a third of physics teachers and almost a quarter of chemistry teachers without a relevant higher education qualification in the subjects. A spokesman for the Department for Education pointed out that an additional 32,000 trainee teachers had been recruited last year. ""Teacher recruitment will always be challenging in a strong economy with record numbers of jobs,"" he said. ""But we know there is more to do, which is why the education secretary has made it his top priority to make sure teaching remains an attractive and fulfilling profession."" Mr Hindshas already promised to cut teachers' workload and to reduce their ""bureaucratic burden"". Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders' union NAHT, said ministers had until recently failed to heed warnings about staffing. He urged ministers ""to address the root causes of the problem, which sees too few new recruits entering the system and too many experienced hands leaving prematurely"". ""Paying teachers' properly for the essential work they do, not overloading them with work, and giving them access to proper professional development throughout their careers are the key steps that the government needs to take. And they need to do it fast,"" said Mr Whiteman.

She was born in Liberia, but became a British citizen in 2009 having been allowed to stay in the UK due to her nursing qualifications. Her husband, 60-year-old Efe Ali-Imaghodor, was acquitted of doing acts intending to pervert the course of justice. Iyamu declared a modest income of around Â£14,500 in 2016/17 from her work as an NHS agency nurse, the court heard. But after her arrest last year investigators found she was able to afford to spend thousands on air travel and a large home in Benin City, Nigeria. Iyamu had a large home in Benin City in Nigeria Prosecutor Simon Davis said by performing rituals Iyamu gained psychological control over the women. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Iyamu had ""enlisted the help of a voodoo priest"" to put the women through a ""juju"" ceremony which was ""designed to exert control"" over them. The victims and their families were threatened with serious harm if they broke their oath to Iyamu, according to the NCA. The court heard Iyamu was ""willing to put the women at risk of serious injury and or death as they made their journey from Nigeria to Europe"". They were too afraid to challenge her or fail to pay her back tens of thousands of Euros she charged them to be trafficked into Germany, the court was told. Opening the case, Mr Davis said: ""The debts incurred by the women were enforced through fear. ""Each of the women were put through what is known to some as a voodoo ceremony."" Iyamu will be sentenced on Wednesday. 'Kiki' was one of Iyamu's victims.

"More than a million married and civil partnered couples are still eligible for a tax break but have yet to claim it, HM Revenue and Customs has said. The Marriage Allowance is worth up to Â£238 a year, and backdated payments of up to Â£662 could also be available. There was criticism that the allowance, aimed at couples with one major source of income, was not easy to claim. However, the government said that the new online application took fewer than 10 minutes to complete. So far, about three million couples have successfully applied for the allowance. Financial secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride said: ""This is a really important tax relief and reflects the social importance of marriages and civil partnerships. I'd urge those that haven't yet managed to claim the money to do so right away."" HMRC has organised several advertising campaigns to persuade people toapply for Marriage Allowance,,externalbut has been frustrated by the lack of take-up. Partners must either be married, or in a civil partnership One partner needs to be earning at least Â£11,850 a year, and paying tax at the basic rate of 20%. If he or she is earning over Â£46,350 (Â£43,430 in Scotland) they are not eligible The other partner must be earning less than Â£11,850 in 2018-19, meaning they pay no tax If the above conditions are satisfied, the partner not paying tax can transfer 10% of his or her tax allowance to a partner, so saving Â£238 in this tax year Back-claims can be made for previous years New Scottish tax system comes into force Thousands face fine for late tax returns LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played Grenfell firefighter Charles Batterbee tells of blazing debris falling from the block One of the first firefighters to enter Grenfell Tower has told how he clung to his colleague as he dangled out of a window trying to put out rising flames. Charles Batterbee and Daniel Brown had extinguished the source of the fire in flat 16's kitchen only to notice fire on the outside of the high-rise. Mr Batterbee said he held Mr Brown's legs as he leant out of the burnt window frame to push his hose upwards. ""I'm holding on to him for dear life,"" he told the Grenfell public inquiry. ""I'm digging my hips into the [kitchen] counter so we don't both go together,"" he added. Meanwhile, he said burning debris was falling past the fourth floor window of the flat they were in. ""It just rained fire,"" he said. At the time he thought the fire was ""jumping multiple floors"", the inquiry heard. ""It didn't slow, it got worse,"" he said. He also told the hearing that the heat in the kitchen was something he had never experienced before in training or operationally. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal What happened at Grenfell Tower Visual guide to the fire The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast with Eddie Mair: Thursday As Mr Batterbee was giving evidence, the government released new figures showing it has identified almost 300 privately-owned tower blocks with unsafe Grenfell-style cladding. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said tests had identified a further 156 residential high-rises with aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, which is unlikely to meet current building regulations, taking the total of privately-owned blocks with that material to 297. In a written statement,external, he said remediation work had begun on 21 of them but the government wanted to speed it up, and has created a taskforce to oversee that work. In further evidence, Mr Batterbee told the hearing that after leaving the tower, he headed to the incident commander to debrief him and saw the full force of the fire for the first time. ""I looked up at the side of the tower and I'll never get over that shock,"" he said, suddenly overcome with emotion. On the ground, it was organised chaos, he said, with debris falling and the pump revving - ""it was hell"". Mr Batterbee, who joined the London Fire Brigade in 2010, earlier broke down in tears when thermal imaging footage of him going into flat 16 was first shown. The chairman ordered that they take a break to let Mr Batterbee compose himself. In a written statement, Mr Batterbee said there were ""no words to describe how powerless"" he felt when he was on the phone to a trapped resident. He said the fire had been ""life-changing and potentially career-changing in a way I can never really describe"". ""I don't really think that there are any words to really capture this horrific event - this was the worst thing that I have ever experienced and witnessed."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? His crewmate Mr Brown, who has been a firefighter in north Kensington for 26 years, has begun giving evidence. He said he could recall a time when Grenfell Tower had an integrated alarm system and a concierge, which meant residents would evacuate when the alarm was triggered. Asked whether he had received training to carry out a mass evacuation, he said: ""We don't do evacuation. We do assist and rescue."" He said they couldn't lead residents to a ""free for all"" when they did not know whether the way out was safe. The public inquiry into the tower block fire in west London, which caused 72 deaths, is currently examining what happened when the blaze broke out on 14 June last year. It hascome under criticism from the Fire Brigades Unionthis week, which said questions put to watch manager Michael Dowden, who led the firefighting response in the first hour, had been ""absurd"". Mr Dowden appeared to be under considerable strain during his three days of evidence.

"Host Karamo Brown (left) said he was moved by viewers' complaints about accessibility Karamo Brown, a host on the hugely successful makeover show Queer Eye, has added his voice to a social media debate urging Netflix to improve its subtitles for deaf and hard-of-hearing watchers. Fans of the show took to Twitter to complain about the service misrepresenting, censoring and simplifying dialogue from a variety of shows. Tweets by Rogan Shannon, a deaf Netflix fan, in which he demanded that the service explain why it was not captioning word for word, have been shared thousands of times in recent days. Mr Shannon says new Netflix series have ""a lot of errors and issues with their captions"" His tweets claim the subtitles censor profanity and edit dialogue for brevity. Others accused the service of failing to caption foreign language inserts and correcting distinct dialects into Standard English. Mr Brown, the Queer Eye cast member who focuses on culture, said reading fan comments had broken his heart. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Subtitles are created in different ways by different broadcasters, with many employing outside subtitling firms. They can be written manually and time-coded to audio, or are generated using dictation software or audio recognition. Why is Queer Eye connecting so much with viewers? Queer Eye would 'love' to do UK version Who are Queer Eye's Fab Five hosts Gemma Rayner-Jones, 31, from Canterbury in England, uses subtitles to help her to concentrate when watching shows online because of a cognitive impairment. Because she is able to hear and notice the differences, she has been tracking and complaining about inaccuracies in Netflix's subtitles for about two years. Ms Rayner-Jones began to keep track of some of her complaints this year, after finding they were not being fixed She estimates that she has submitted about 150 complaints in that time, and says she has not had a response. ""Everyone should be getting the same experience,"" she told the BBC. ""It seems a shame to have a system to report faults there to placate people, but they don't seem to be doing anything about it."" The sign language lawyer who became a social media star Disabled music fans face ticketing barriers Deaf Eritrean twins break fashion barriers She wants Netflix to be more transparent about how it handles complaints, so that users can check in whether action has been taken. Student Chrissy Marshall, 18, studies film at the University of California and runs a YouTube account trying to raise awareness about deaf culture, accessibility and sign language. She was one of many who took to Twitter to complain about inaccuracies in Queer Eye's subtitling. For her, online streaming still remains one of the best entertainment options available. ""I don't watch cable or normal TV because captioning is always messed up or lagging. As for movie-going in theatres, the experience normally sucks,"" she told the BBC. Chrissy Marshall says she finds it offensive when she can lip-read differences with captions ""Netflix is what I use as a primary source for streaming because typically it is the most accessible, but even the most accessible has its issues. ""Captioning as a job is not to 'clean up' language, it's to provide accessibility, full accessibility. ""We don't care if it's a bad word, vulgar, or maybe inappropriate, if hearing people get to know what is being said, we deserve to know as well."" This is not an issue isolated to Netflix itself. While regulations are in place for closed captioning (user-activated) subtitles on typical television services, many on-demand services still lag behind. One YouTube vlogger, Rikki Poynter, has dedicated years to working on accessibility on the platform, lobbying it to improve its automatic subtitle service using the hashtag #NoMoreCRAPtions. In the US, the Federal Communications Commission has strict regulations which specify that captions ""must match the spoken words in the dialogue and convey background noises and other sounds to the fullest extent possible"" - but it only requires the regulations on shows on television, which means that Netflix-exclusive original series may not qualify. The National Association of the Deaf sued and made a four-year agreement with Netflix in 2012, where it committed to ensuring all its programmes were subtitled. Although the four-year decree has now run out, on Thursday the group told the BBC it was ""disappointed that Netflix appears not to be providing captioning at the level that was promised"" and said it hoped it would ensure it was using verbatim and accurate captions. In the UK, Action on Hearing Loss has spent three years on a Subtitle It! campaign aiming to get the UK government to extend regulation to captioning of video-on-demand content. Helping deaf refugees learn sign language Deaf model shares cinema frustration Deaf mum sues concert promoter Dr Roger Wicks, the group's director of policy and campaigns, told the BBC that any attempt by providers to summarise or edit language on subtitles was a ""very bad approach"" which could lead to people who were deaf or hard-of-hearing feeling ""alienated or patronised"". ""Subtitles are a replacement for speech, they're meant to be verbatim so people have full access,"" he told the BBC. ""Any attempt to summarise is offering a second-class service. I think this is well-intentioned, but it's getting it wrong."" He told the BBC his group intended to contact Netflix over the issue. Mr Shannon, whose widely-shared tweets helped spark the debate, wants the company to change and check the way it subtitles its shows. ""I'd like to see more oversight on captioning agencies, more strict procedures for checking the captions,"" he told the BBC. ""I'd also like to see those who are doing the hiring, such as Netflix, to check that all the files that they get are accurate, and not just assume they did everything right. ""I'm aware that it's time consuming, but this will continue to be a problem if there are no checks and balances. Accessibility really matters."" Deaf and hard of hearing people have been saying for years that subtitles just aren't good enough - whether on traditional TV or streaming platforms like Netflix - and it's wonderful that the clamour for change has led to a commitment this time around. I'm hard of hearing and I watch all my on-screen entertainment with subtitles. In many ways streaming has made that easier - if I watched live TV I'd be missing loads of what was going on. If you've ever watched a news channel with the sound off in the gym, you'll know what I mean - whole sentences are missed, random words pop up... But when things are scripted and pre-packaged, in my view there's no reason to miss things out. An estimated nine million people in the UK have a hearing impairment of some kind - more than live in London. Many of us completely depend on the subtitlers to get the meaning across. And many hearing people watch subtitles on their phone when they have no headphones, or for all sorts of other reasons. Programme-makers must realise subtitle users are part of your audience - don't sell them short. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews can pray A Belgian artist has faced a backlash in Israel after posing nude in front of one of Judaism's most sacred sites. Marisa Papen posted the image of herself reclining naked on a rooftop overlooking the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The rabbi of the site described the incident as ""grave and lamentable"". Last year, Ms Papen was briefly detained after taking naked photos at an ancient Egyptian temple in Luxor. On her website, the young model describes her way of life as ""a naked form of freedom where masks are torn off and thrown in the ocean"". Many of her publicly posted images are nude modelling shots taken all over the world. In a blog post on Saturday entitled ""The Wall of Shame"", the model said her experiences in Egypt had made her want ""to push the bounderies [sic] of religion and politics even further... [by] showing my personal religion in a world where freedom is becoming a very luxurious thing"". Marisa Papen has faced a backlash for her provocative images She said her three-day visit to Israel had coincided with the 70th anniversary of its founding, and the controversial opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem in May. Photos from the trip showed the model in the Dead Sea and straddling an Israeli flagpole. But the most provocative image was of Ms Papen posing naked in view of the Western Wall. It is a remnant from the time of the biblical second Jewish temple and the most sacred place where Jewish people can pray. Jewish religious authorities were quick to condemn the photograph. The Rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinovich, told Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper: ""This is an embarrassing incident, grave and lamentable, which offends the sanctity of the site and the feelings of those who visit the holy places."" Responding to the controversy in a Facebook post on Thursday, Ms Papen wrote: ""I am perplexed with the fact that people who believe a God created our bodies (yes, including boobs and our private parts) could think skin is offensive"". This video can not be played Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz explains why Jerusalem's Western Wall is so important to the Jewish faith Some of those commenting online accused Ms Papen of anti-Semitism and of deliberately excluding the Dome of the Rock and religious sites sacred to Muslims, just out of shot, to protect Muslim sensitivities. However, the model insisted that this was not the case. ""It was just way better artistically,"" she told The Times of Israel. A separate photo from the shoot does in fact show Ms Papen naked, looking out at the Dome of the Rock. The model's trip to Egypt in September also sparked outrage, after she was photographed naked for a sunglasses advertising campaign from inside the conservative Muslim-majority country. Ms Papen did not have permission from the country's authorities to take the images, and she later said that she and her cameraman had to bribe a policeman who interrupted their shoot at the pyramids in Cairo. Describing the negative response of two passers-by, she said: ""We tried to explain them that we were making art with the highest respect for Egyptian culture, but they could not see a connection between nudity and art. In their eyes it was porn, or something like that."" Their problems increased in a temple in the historic southern city of Luxor, where they were stopped by police and spent a night in an Egyptian prison before being released.

"Ed Sheeran's stadium tour has been halted by trees Ed Sheeran's European promoters have been forced to move an open-air show as 104 trees were at risk. The concert was to take place in a large car park in Dusseldorf in July, but local conservationists stopped a licence being granted. FKP Scorpio released a statement saying the shows would be moved to an arena in a nearby city. An extra date will also have to be added to the tour to accommodate the smaller size of the venue. The shows, due to accommodate 80,000 fans a night, were going to take place in the car park of a new exhibition centre. They were moved as the gigs would have led to trees being cut down, despite promises from the council to plant more. ""The artist and organisers want to give fans clarity as quickly as possible,"" the statement reads. Ed Sheeran: 'I worried about being fat' How Ed Sheeran is tackling ticket touts Ed Sheeran calls in newt experts ""Ed Sheeran doesn't want to disappoint his fans, and within his tour schedule an additional date has now been cleared, which allows the move to the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen."" The company also said refunds would be offered to fans who did not want to travel to the new venue. This is not the first time the two shows have been moved. They were originally scheduled to take place at Essen-Mulheim airport, but organisers had different environmental issues there too. This time it wasn't trees, but the local bird population of skylarks that stopped the shows. They are an endangered species and were nesting on the site, meaning the concerts would have put their lives at risk.

"England play Belgium in the World Cup on Thursday. Both are definitely going through to the next round, but which country comes first and second will decide who they play. If they draw, it will be difficult to separate them. Fortunately,Fifa has rules,externalto distinguish between two or more teams with the same number of points, the same goal difference and the same number of goals scored. The first of these favours the winning team when the two played each other in the group stage. But if this game was a draw, these criteria are applied in the following order until the tie is broken: goal difference in games between the relevant teams (this is clearly only relevant only when three or more teams have the same number of points) goals scored in games between the relevant teams disciplinary points - one for a yellow card, three for two yellow cards resulting in a red card, four for a straight red card and five for a straight red card given to a player who already has a yellow card drawing of lots by the Fifa organising committee The tie-breaker on discipline was introduced after the2014 World Cup,external, presumably to make it less likely that lots would have to be drawn. There was something of an outcry against the drawing of lots after it was used to decide whether Mali or Guinea would qualify for the quarter-finals of the African Cup of Nations in 2015. The two countries drew all three of their group games 1-1 and there was no provision for fair play to be taken into account. At a local hotel, the president of the Malian football federation, Baba Diarra, and the financial director of Guinea's sports ministry, Amara Dabo, faced a bowl with two balls in it and were asked to choose one each. Mali went first and found in its ball a number three, indicating that they would come third in the group and be eliminated. The other ball had a two in it. If lots were to be drawn at the World Cup, Fifa has said that the balls would be drawn by a member of the World Cup organising committee who would not be from one of the relevant countries. It would take place at 23:00 local time (21:00 BST) in the press conference room at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. In an event open to the media, the committee member would choose between balls containing the names of the countries involved. The first country drawn would get the higher ranking in the group. This would be slightly different to the last time lots had to be drawn in the World Cup, which was in the 1990 tournament in Italy, when they were needed to decide whether the Netherlands or the Republic of Ireland would qualify in second or third place. At that tournament, four of the six third-place teams qualified. Niall Quinn scored Ireland's equaliser against the Netherlands, which meant lots needed to be drawn At a ceremony in Rome run by a youthful-looking Sepp Blatter,a flickery film of which you can watch online,external, ""Monique"" was asked to pick first between two yellow balls, which had the names of the countries in, and then between two red balls, one of which had a number two and the other a three. The Netherlands were drawn first, followed by the number three, which meant they had to play West Germany, while Ireland played Romania. The rankings were clearly important, with Ireland going on to beat Romania on penalties and progress to the quarter-finals, while the Netherlands lost 2-1 to the eventual champions, West Germany.

"This video can not be played Theresa May arrives at the European Council summit in Brussels Theresa May has said both the UK and EU want to work towards a future Brexit deal ""at a faster pace"", after being warned that time is running out. The UK PM said ""very good progress"" had been made on a withdrawal agreement. She will brief EU leaders at a summit for the last time before October, when both sides hope a deal will be done on the UK's March 2019 departure. But the European Commission president suggested UK cabinet splits were making things more difficult. Arriving at the summit in Brussels, Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""I don't have to lecture Theresa May, but I would like our British friends to make clear their position. ""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that."" Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Merkel: Defining moment for EU on migration Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress Brexit date could be delayed, says Blair Asked if talks could end in no deal, Mr Juncker said: ""We are preparing for different scenarios - on the proper withdrawal agreement but, in parallel, we are working on the no deal."" The prime minister, who has been under pressure at home within her own party, has called her cabinet together for what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting at Chequers on 6 July to agree the UK's blueprint for its future relations with the EU. Arriving in Brussels, Mrs May said she was looking forward to ""securing our strong future partnership"" which she said was in the interests of both the EU and UK . ""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that."" She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"". Mrs May said it was in everyone's interests that a new partnership on economic and security matters be agreed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Cabinet divisions over the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end, have yet to be resolved, as have arguments over the future movement of goods and people across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

With less than nine months to go before the UK's scheduled exit, businesses have issued warnings about the impact on jobs of leaving the EU without an agreement. The prime minister has been holding a number of face-to-face meetings with European counterparts on day one of the two-day summit, which is focused on the migration challenges facing Europe and eurozone reform. This video can not be played Is the EU punishing the UK? The remaining 27 EU leaders are due to discuss Brexit on their own on Friday morning, by which point Mrs May is expected to have left Brussels. On the eve of the summit, Mr Varadkar said he wanted ""detailed proposals"" from the UK on how it would honour the ""clear commitments"" made in December about the Irish border and citizens' rights. By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg The UK is eager for the EU to become more flexible. To move away from what the government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission. At dinner on Thursday night there's a chance for her to persuade the other leaders to loosen that approach. Only they can tell their negotiators to ease up on their red lines. In return for that request, she'll promise that the UK will be able to agree on its blueprint for the future relationship between the UK and EU, at a meeting of her cabinet next week. With almost daily skirmishes at home - that could prove optimistic. Read Laura's full blog ""Time is running out for the withdrawal agreement to be concluded satisfactorily by the October European Council,"" he said. ""I expect EU leaders to send a strong message to the UK that negotiations with the taskforce need to intensify."" The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier has said ""serious divergences"" remain over the question of backstop arrangements for the Irish border if neither of the UK's proposed customs proposals are deemed workable. Elsewhere, Mrs May will seek to show solidarity with the rest of Europe in their efforts to deal with illegal migrant flows across the Mediterranean from Africa and the Middle East. The issue has divided Europe for more than two years but tensions have increased since the election of a populist government in Italy, which has pledged to crack down on unlawful migration, and growing political uncertainty in Germany amid a backlash against Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policies. This video can not be played Brexit: No cherry picking, no cake-and-eat-it, says Leo Varadkar Mrs May is expected to stress the need to tackle the problem of people smuggling at its source, citing the success of a project in Nigeria where once the dangers of crossing the Mediterranean were explained to people, their attitudes to illegal working in the UK changed. On security, the prime minister will call for collective action against misinformation, cyber warfare and money laundering by ""hostile states"" such as Russia. One example of this, she will say, is the UK's sharing of details of Russian intelligence officers expelled after the attacks on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury with EU allies. The working dinner coincided with England's final World Cup group game against Belgium, whose prime minister Charles Michel was also present. The UK's permanent representative in Brussels couldn't say how much of the match Mrs May, who on Wednesday ordered St George's flags to be flown above No 10 for remaining England games, would see.

"This video can not be played Grenfell firefighter Charles Batterbee tells of blazing debris falling from the block One of the first firefighters to enter Grenfell Tower has told how he clung to his colleague as he dangled out of a window trying to put out rising flames. Charles Batterbee and Daniel Brown had extinguished the source of the fire in flat 16's kitchen only to notice fire on the outside of the high-rise. Mr Batterbee said he held Mr Brown's legs as he leant out of the burnt window frame to push his hose upwards. ""I'm holding on to him for dear life,"" he told the Grenfell public inquiry. ""I'm digging my hips into the [kitchen] counter so we don't both go together,"" he added. Meanwhile, he said burning debris was falling past the fourth floor window of the flat they were in. ""It just rained fire,"" he said. At the time he thought the fire was ""jumping multiple floors"", the inquiry heard. ""It didn't slow, it got worse,"" he said. He also told the hearing that the heat in the kitchen was something he had never experienced before in training or operationally. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal What happened at Grenfell Tower Visual guide to the fire The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast with Eddie Mair: Thursday As Mr Batterbee was giving evidence, the government released new figures showing it has identified almost 300 privately-owned tower blocks with unsafe Grenfell-style cladding. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said tests had identified a further 156 residential high-rises with aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, which is unlikely to meet current building regulations, taking the total of privately-owned blocks with that material to 297. In a written statement,external, he said remediation work had begun on 21 of them but the government wanted to speed it up, and has created a taskforce to oversee that work. In further evidence, Mr Batterbee told the hearing that after leaving the tower, he headed to the incident commander to debrief him and saw the full force of the fire for the first time. ""I looked up at the side of the tower and I'll never get over that shock,"" he said, suddenly overcome with emotion. On the ground, it was organised chaos, he said, with debris falling and the pump revving - ""it was hell"". Mr Batterbee, who joined the London Fire Brigade in 2010, earlier broke down in tears when thermal imaging footage of him going into flat 16 was first shown. The chairman ordered that they take a break to let Mr Batterbee compose himself. In a written statement, Mr Batterbee said there were ""no words to describe how powerless"" he felt when he was on the phone to a trapped resident. He said the fire had been ""life-changing and potentially career-changing in a way I can never really describe"". ""I don't really think that there are any words to really capture this horrific event - this was the worst thing that I have ever experienced and witnessed."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? His crewmate Mr Brown, who has been a firefighter in north Kensington for 26 years, has begun giving evidence. He said he could recall a time when Grenfell Tower had an integrated alarm system and a concierge, which meant residents would evacuate when the alarm was triggered. Asked whether he had received training to carry out a mass evacuation, he said: ""We don't do evacuation. We do assist and rescue."" He said they couldn't lead residents to a ""free for all"" when they did not know whether the way out was safe. The public inquiry into the tower block fire in west London, which caused 72 deaths, is currently examining what happened when the blaze broke out on 14 June last year. It hascome under criticism from the Fire Brigades Unionthis week, which said questions put to watch manager Michael Dowden, who led the firefighting response in the first hour, had been ""absurd"". Mr Dowden appeared to be under considerable strain during his three days of evidence.

FKP Scorpio released a statement saying the shows would be moved to an arena in a nearby city. An extra date will also have to be added to the tour to accommodate the smaller size of the venue. The shows, due to accommodate 80,000 fans a night, were going to take place in the car park of a new exhibition centre. They were moved as the gigs would have led to trees being cut down, despite promises from the council to plant more. ""The artist and organisers want to give fans clarity as quickly as possible,"" the statement reads. Ed Sheeran: 'I worried about being fat' How Ed Sheeran is tackling ticket touts Ed Sheeran calls in newt experts ""Ed Sheeran doesn't want to disappoint his fans, and within his tour schedule an additional date has now been cleared, which allows the move to the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen."" The company also said refunds would be offered to fans who did not want to travel to the new venue. This is not the first time the two shows have been moved. They were originally scheduled to take place at Essen-Mulheim airport, but organisers had different environmental issues there too. This time it wasn't trees, but the local bird population of skylarks that stopped the shows. They are an endangered species and were nesting on the site, meaning the concerts would have put their lives at risk.

"The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews are permitted to pray The Duke of Cambridge has visited Jerusalem's most sacred religious sites and his great-grandmother's grave on the final day of his official tour. He laid flowers at the tomb of Princess Alice - the Duke of Edinburgh's mother - at the Church of Mary Magdalene. Also on his itinerary was the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, a site that is sacred to Jews and Muslims. He then went to the adjacent Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews are permitted to pray. Prince William's tour ended at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is widely regarded as Christianity's holiest place. Many Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected on the site. It is shared by the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Egyptian Copt and Ethiopian Orthodox denominations of Christianity. It is the final day of the duke's Middle East tour Prince William spoke with Western Wall chief Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch and British chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis during his visit The duke began his morning on the Mount of Olives, taking in a view of Jerusalem's Old City. There, he visited the Church of Mary Magdalene, a Russian Orthodox church and Princess Alice's final resting place. In keeping with Russian Orthodox tradition, Prince William took bread and salt at the entrance of the church. Inside, he laid flowers picked from the garden of Philip Hall - Britain's Consul General in Jerusalem - in the princess's crypt. The duke laid flowers at the tomb of his great-grandmother, Princess Alice Archimandrite Roman, head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, recited a ""prayer for the repose of Princess Alice's soul"" and the duke bowed his head with his eyes closed. After the visit, Father Roman said: ""He said he found it profoundly moving. ""He was certainly moved to learn more about his family history and pay his respects to his great-grandmother in such a holy place."" In pictures: Prince William's Middle East tour William meets Palestinian leader Abbas Prince William meets Eurovision winner Prince in first royal visit to West Bank He said he shared a ""little joke"" with the prince. ""When I was showing him the family tree with the Russian links, I told the prince that I'd read somewhere that someone once asked Prince Philip if he had ever been to Russia, and that he had said: 'They murdered half my bloody family, so maybe I'll go, maybe not'. ""The prince laughed and said: 'He would say that'."" The duke visited the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque at the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif The duke went on to tour the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque at the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif. He was shown around the area by Dr Mustafa Abu Sway, a professor of philosophy and Islamic studies at the city's Al-Quds University, and they spoke about the historical significance of the site. Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif sits on an elevated plaza, which was the site of both of Judaism's ancient temples, above the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Muslims believe it was the site of the Prophet Muhammad's ascent to heaven in the 7th Century. In Judaism it is where Abraham was instructed by God to sacrifice his son as a test of faith. Prince William began his morning on the Mount of Olives, taking in a view of Jerusalem's Old City During his visit to the Western Wall, Prince William - who was wearing a kippah, or religious head-covering, as a mark of respect - approached the landmark and placed a written prayer in a crack in the ancient wall, as is tradition. British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, who accompanied the prince, said: ""Today we experienced a moment of history which will live long in the memory of Jews around the world. ""The Western Wall stands at the epicentre of our faith. To see the future monarch come to pay his respects was a remarkable gesture of friendship and a sign of the duke's regard for the sanctity of Jerusalem."" The Western Wall is a remnant of the retaining wall which surrounded the second Jewish temple at the time of King Herod. By Jonny Dymond, royal correspondent, in Jerusalem Prince William visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem's Old City After four days of criss-crossing Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories, there was time for a little sightseeing. But on an official visit, every step is weighed up against what has come before and what will follow. The three sites Prince William visited each inspire devotion from the three great Abrahamic faiths - Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif has been a flashpoint for protests and conflagration. Today the compound was an oasis of calm and beauty in amidst the bustle of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Western Wall, a remnant from the time of the Second Temple of the Jews was busier. But there is an intensity to the moment you reach the Wall, and close your eyes, and touch the stone, that brings a peace of its own. And inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre the Prince got a taste of some of the swirling chaos that the disputatious church lives and thrives upon. In the space of just a few hours, like so many millions before him, the prince saw and must have felt the religious pull of Jerusalem, the reason that for so many centuries it has been coveted and fought over. Much to mull over on the flight back to Britain. The Duke of Cambridge's five-day visit to Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan began on Sunday. Since arriving on his current leg of the tour, he has met Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and its President Reuven Rivlin, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Princess Alice was married to Prince Andrew of Greece and is remembered for saving the life of a Jewish family in Athens during the Holocaust by sheltering them in her home from the Nazis. This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge's great-grandmother, Princess Alice, helped to save Jews during World War Two On Tuesday, the duke met relatives of the late Rachel Cohen, who was hidden from the Gestapo by his great-grandmother. Princess Alice, who was a nun for many years, was first laid to rest at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, when she died in 1969. But it was at her request that she was interred, in 1988, at the Russian Orthodox church on the Mount of Olives, near her aunt Elizabeth, the Grand Duchess of Russia. On Wednesday, Prince William became the first royal family member to make an official visit to the Palestinian territories in the occupied West Bank. While there he expressed hope for ""lasting peace"" between Israelis and Palestinians.

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? A key European Union summit may end without a deal to resolve a row over ways to tackle irregular migration. Italy - the entry point of thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - says it will veto a joint statement over the entire agenda if no solution is found. Leaders were talking into the early hours of Friday to find a compromise. Italy wants other countries to share the burden. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the issue could be a defining moment for the EU. Mrs Merkel is under pressure to come up with a deal to prevent new arrivals. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, has given her until this weekend. Otherwise he has said he will start turning away migrants from the border in his home state. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The migrant flows also include refugees fleeing the Syrian war and other conflicts, urgently seeking asylum. It is not a crisis on the scale of 2015, when thousands were coming ashore daily on the Greek islands. The European Council - the EU's strategic leadership - says the numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their peak in October 2015. Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migrant mutiny The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? But this month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently the German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight. The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take a share of the migrants on board. Malta said that Norway had now also agreed to take some migrants from the Lifeline. The Dublin principle - that asylum seekers should stay in the country where they enter the EU - has broken down. Italy and Greece, who receive the most, are demanding that their neighbours share the burden. This video can not be played Belgian PM gives UK PM his team's shirt ahead of World Cup clash on Thursday evening There was a lighter note, as the summit got under way in Brussels. Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel presented UK Prime Minister Theresa May with a Belgian football shirt ahead of the two countries' World Cup clash. It bore the number of Belgian star Eden Hazard. By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor Hardened Eurosceptics might love to think the EU's in trouble, but as leaders gather in Brussels for their summer summit on Thursday, dedicated Europhiles are also sounding the alarm. ""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size."" It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread. Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden. Read more from Katya Italy's new populist government has made getting an EU-wide deal on immigration and asylum a priority. The issue played a major role in the Italian election, catapulting nationalist League leader Matteo Salvini into power. But it is a powerful election issue EU-wide. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? How do EU governments see the summit? Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Brexit talks to move faster, May says Austria's right-wing government takes over the EU's rotating presidency next month and it has a hardline stance on irregular migrants. So do its Visegrad Group neighbours: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. That group rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. Italy is the main destination for migrants rescued from overloaded boats off Libya Much of the attention is on the German chancellor, because her interior minister has threatened to start blocking migrants at the border if they have already registered in another EU country. Without his party, the CSU, she would lose her parliamentary majority. European Council President Donald Tusk told the leaders in his pre-summit letter""the stakes are very high and time is short"",external. He warned that the EU's problems with migration policy were giving ammunition to populists, who ""offer simple answers to the most complicated questions"". 1. 'Regional disembarkation platforms' This is an Austrian-Danish proposal, aimed at breaking the business model of the people-smuggling gangs. In the draft summit conclusions, it is seen as a way to speed up the processing of asylum claims and stopping illegal economic migrants. Pros? They could deter migrants from putting to sea in overloaded boats. Gangs might then be less able to profit from migrants' desperation. Cons? Getting North African countries to host such centres could be very difficult. Morocco again on Thursday rejected the idea. Close co-ordination with UN agencies will be needed, to prevent them becoming crowded, dangerous camps. Greece says emergency action is necessary to ""decongest"" some of its islands 2. Beefing up EU border agency Frontex The European Commission says this would make it a genuine border police force.The force is to be boosted from the current 1,300 (with 1,500 in reserve) to 10,000 by 2027,external. Pros? The force could intervene more rapidly, nipping migrant emergencies in the bud, preventing any repetition of the 2015 chaos. Cons? Solidarity has been lacking among the 28 member states. Frontex still lacks some important resources that were pledged. EU police risk usurping the role of national border guards - a sensitive issue. This video can not be played Migrant crisis: EU border force Frontex explained 3. More co-operation with transit and migrants' home countries This would allow more failed asylum seekers to be sent back; the ""return"" rate currently is just 36.6%, the Commission says. Pros? There has been effective EU co-operation with Turkey: a 2016 deal led to a drastic drop in migrants taking the Balkan route. The EU naval mission off Libya works closely with the Libyan coastguard to stop people-smuggling. Cons? Conditions are dire in Libyan migrant holding centres. Turkey is still short of â¬3bn (Â£2.6bn; $3.5bn), pledged by the EU for Syrian refugees. Tackling poverty in Africa, from which many migrants are fleeing, requires generous EU funding. There is an EU Trust Fund for Africa, but it is short of â¬1.2bn in pledged funds. Malta allows migrant ship to dock The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers?

"The UK's largest producer of crumpets, Warburton's, has halted production at two of its four plants. The firm has run out of carbon dioxide which it uses to package the product. The CO2 scarcity has already forced beer, fizzy drink and meat firms to curb production. Warburton's supplies 1.5 million crumpets a week to UK consumers, packaged using carbon dioxide to give them longer shelf life and prevent mould. But plants in London and Burnley have run out of CO2 and supplies at the company's Stockton site are intermittent. ""We have had quite big shortfalls,"" said Tearmh Taylor, a spokeswoman for Warburton's. ""We're probably running at about 50% of what we can normally make"" she said. Students raise Â£1,500 for 'jolly' cleaner Bridge jogger-push investigation closed Mother suing Thomas Cook over 'abduction' Only the Midlands plant is operating normally and the firm doesn't know when supplies will resume. Their supplier said it could be next week but have had no confirmation. Meanwhile, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said brewers were ""working their socks off"" to keep the beer flowing. Scotland's biggest abattoir is closed and other meat producers are considering adapting their products to use less CO2. Some food and drink firms have asked whether the government could help alleviate the problem. ""If a similar issue were to affect the water industry... then you feel government would be acting with far greater urgency,"" the Food and Drink Federation said.. CO2 is widely used in the food processing and drinks industries. It puts the fizz into beer, cider and soft drinks, and is used in food packaging to extend the shelf life of salads, fresh meat and poultry. The gas is also used to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter, and create dry ice to help keep things chilled while in transit. However, several UK and mainland European producers of carbon dioxide - a by-product from ammonia production that is used in the fertiliser industry - closed for maintenance or scaled down operations. In the UK, only two of five plants that supply CO2 are operating at the moment. The shortage comes at the same time demand for food and drink is soaring. ""The football, the weather, the BBQs have created the sort of demand for beer we only see at Christmas,"" one big UK brewing company told the BBC. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association struck a reassuring note: ""Although stocks of bulk CO2 remain low, brewers across the country are working their socks off around the clock to ensure there is still plenty of beer to go around. ""The UK can produce as much as 10 million pints of beer per day, and with signs of things improving, pubs will certainly not be running dry. ""Our message to beer drinkers and England fans is clear: Keep calm and carry on going to the pub. If your usual beer of choice isn't available, then why not use it as an opportunity to try something new?"" These assurances come after big pub chains in Wetherspoon and Ei Group reported they had temporarily run out, or were short of, brands including John Smith's, Strongbow, Amstel and Birra Moretti in the run-up to Thursday evening's England match against Belgium. Scotland's biggest abattoir closed this week until further notice, and meat processors are considering shortening ""sell by"" dates because packaging will contain lower levels of CO2. There have been concerns about animal welfare if animals don't go to slaughter at their usual rate. ""The last few days have alerted the country to how dependent we are on CO2,"" Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors' Association, told the BBC on Thursday. He criticised CO2 producers for a lack of information about when carbon dioxide supplies might return to normal. ""It makes planning difficult,"" Mr Allen said. The British Poultry Council said its members continued to live ""day-to-day"" as they tried to stretch out their dwindling supplies of the gas. Beer shortage hits biggest pub chains Why the CO2 shortage really matters Beer sales rationed amid CO2 shortage The meat industry has become increasingly frustrated by a lack of information coming from CO2 firms and the UK government in particular over when supplies might return to normal. ""They are not telling us, which means we can't plan,"" said Richard Griffith, from the British Poultry Council. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Department of Business both said they were monitoring the situation. However, the Food and Drink Federation said ministers should really be on the ""front foot"" over what could develop into a major food supply issue. The industry trade journal Gas World, which first reported the news that CO2 was running short, said that two tankers full of liquid CO2 from mainland Europe have been delivered to ports in the UK in the past couple of days. A number of European plants are beginning to increase supplies, while another factory that had closed because of technical issues rather than maintenance, is due to come back online in mid-July.

Scotland's biggest abattoir is closed and other meat producers are considering adapting their products to use less CO2. Some food and drink firms have asked whether the government could help alleviate the problem. ""If a similar issue were to affect the water industry... then you feel government would be acting with far greater urgency,"" the Food and Drink Federation said.. CO2 is widely used in the food processing and drinks industries. It puts the fizz into beer, cider and soft drinks, and is used in food packaging to extend the shelf life of salads, fresh meat and poultry. The gas is also used to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter, and create dry ice to help keep things chilled while in transit. However, several UK and mainland European producers of carbon dioxide - a by-product from ammonia production that is used in the fertiliser industry - closed for maintenance or scaled down operations. In the UK, only two of five plants that supply CO2 are operating at the moment. The shortage comes at the same time demand for food and drink is soaring. ""The football, the weather, the BBQs have created the sort of demand for beer we only see at Christmas,"" one big UK brewing company told the BBC. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association struck a reassuring note: ""Although stocks of bulk CO2 remain low, brewers across the country are working their socks off around the clock to ensure there is still plenty of beer to go around. ""The UK can produce as much as 10 million pints of beer per day, and with signs of things improving, pubs will certainly not be running dry. ""Our message to beer drinkers and England fans is clear: Keep calm and carry on going to the pub. If your usual beer of choice isn't available, then why not use it as an opportunity to try something new?"" These assurances come after big pub chains in Wetherspoon and Ei Group reported they had temporarily run out, or were short of, brands including John Smith's, Strongbow, Amstel and Birra Moretti in the run-up to Thursday evening's England match against Belgium. Scotland's biggest abattoir closed this week until further notice, and meat processors are considering shortening ""sell by"" dates because packaging will contain lower levels of CO2. There have been concerns about animal welfare if animals don't go to slaughter at their usual rate. ""The last few days have alerted the country to how dependent we are on CO2,"" Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors' Association, told the BBC on Thursday. He criticised CO2 producers for a lack of information about when carbon dioxide supplies might return to normal. ""It makes planning difficult,"" Mr Allen said. The British Poultry Council said its members continued to live ""day-to-day"" as they tried to stretch out their dwindling supplies of the gas. Beer shortage hits biggest pub chains Why the CO2 shortage really matters Beer sales rationed amid CO2 shortage The meat industry has become increasingly frustrated by a lack of information coming from CO2 firms and the UK government in particular over when supplies might return to normal. ""They are not telling us, which means we can't plan,"" said Richard Griffith, from the British Poultry Council. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Department of Business both said they were monitoring the situation. However, the Food and Drink Federation said ministers should really be on the ""front foot"" over what could develop into a major food supply issue. The industry trade journal Gas World, which first reported the news that CO2 was running short, said that two tankers full of liquid CO2 from mainland Europe have been delivered to ports in the UK in the past couple of days. A number of European plants are beginning to increase supplies, while another factory that had closed because of technical issues rather than maintenance, is due to come back online in mid-July.

"The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews can pray A Belgian artist has faced a backlash in Israel after posing nude in front of one of Judaism's most sacred sites. Marisa Papen posted the image of herself reclining naked on a rooftop overlooking the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The rabbi of the site described the incident as ""grave and lamentable"". Last year, Ms Papen was briefly detained after taking naked photos at an ancient Egyptian temple in Luxor. On her website, the young model describes her way of life as ""a naked form of freedom where masks are torn off and thrown in the ocean"". Many of her publicly posted images are nude modelling shots taken all over the world. In a blog post on Saturday entitled ""The Wall of Shame"", the model said her experiences in Egypt had made her want ""to push the bounderies [sic] of religion and politics even further... [by] showing my personal religion in a world where freedom is becoming a very luxurious thing"". Marisa Papen has faced a backlash for her provocative images She said her three-day visit to Israel had coincided with the 70th anniversary of its founding, and the controversial opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem in May. Photos from the trip showed the model in the Dead Sea and straddling an Israeli flagpole. But the most provocative image was of Ms Papen posing naked in view of the Western Wall. It is a remnant from the time of the biblical second Jewish temple and the most sacred place where Jewish people can pray. Jewish religious authorities were quick to condemn the photograph. The Rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinovich, told Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper: ""This is an embarrassing incident, grave and lamentable, which offends the sanctity of the site and the feelings of those who visit the holy places."" Responding to the controversy in a Facebook post on Thursday, Ms Papen wrote: ""I am perplexed with the fact that people who believe a God created our bodies (yes, including boobs and our private parts) could think skin is offensive"". This video can not be played Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz explains why Jerusalem's Western Wall is so important to the Jewish faith Some of those commenting online accused Ms Papen of anti-Semitism and of deliberately excluding the Dome of the Rock and religious sites sacred to Muslims, just out of shot, to protect Muslim sensitivities. However, the model insisted that this was not the case. ""It was just way better artistically,"" she told The Times of Israel. A separate photo from the shoot does in fact show Ms Papen naked, looking out at the Dome of the Rock. The model's trip to Egypt in September also sparked outrage, after she was photographed naked for a sunglasses advertising campaign from inside the conservative Muslim-majority country. Ms Papen did not have permission from the country's authorities to take the images, and she later said that she and her cameraman had to bribe a policeman who interrupted their shoot at the pyramids in Cairo. Describing the negative response of two passers-by, she said: ""We tried to explain them that we were making art with the highest respect for Egyptian culture, but they could not see a connection between nudity and art. In their eyes it was porn, or something like that."" Their problems increased in a temple in the historic southern city of Luxor, where they were stopped by police and spent a night in an Egyptian prison before being released.

"Patients have been criticised for taking photos and videos of doctors and then asking people online to rate how attractive they find them. Social media posts of doctors are being shared without their consent, the British Medical Association's annual meeting heard. Such posts ""violate"" their privacy, the meeting in Brighton was told. Delegates voted in favour of a motion condemning patients for sharing private appointment recordings online. Dr Zoe Greaves, a trainee GP who proposed the motion, said in most cases patients who posted photos and videos of their doctors without consent were doing so for baby scans or a child's first GP appointment. But some posts were ""far more insidious"", she said, like those rating doctors on their attractiveness, as well as recordings of ""terrible"" GP appointments. Dr Greaves said that friends who are doctors had found themselves the subject of posts on Twitter asking people to judge their looks. ""And for each of these, private consultations are opened up to public comment and critique, and the individual's privacy is undermined,"" she said. Many posts shared without consent are of things like a baby's first appointment with a doctor Patients are allowed to record consultations for medical purposes to help them remember or understand what was discussed. Dr Greaves said this could be a ""valuable aide memoir"" but she added that ""there must be recognised responsibilities alongside that right"". Dr John Chisholm, chairman of the BMA's medical ethics committee, told the meeting that doctors could take legal action to seek to prevent or remove publication. But he said in practice this would be difficult to pursue in UK courts. The meeting's delegates, in passing the motion, called on the BMA ""to lobby for sanctions against patients who breach their doctor's privacy"". A BMA spokeswoman said patients should seek the consent of doctors before making a recording. ""Should a patient publish audio or video recordings without consent, they may be at risk of unlawfully misusing the doctor's private information. ""Greater support and legal protection should therefore be afforded to doctors given the significant difficulties that they may face in trying to prevent publication or remove published material.""

"MI6: Allegations officials helped organised rendition of Libyan dissident The UK government has apologised to former Libyan dissident Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar who were abducted with assistance from Britain's security services. The couple say an MI6 tip-off helped the US kidnap them in Thailand from where they were transferred to Libya and Mr Belhaj was tortured. Britain's unprecedented apology in the Belhaj case comes after allegations of rendition and torture relating to UK security services. Here is the background to the claims. Collusion in ill-treatment and torture. In the aftermath of 9/11, the US and others invaded Afghanistan in an attempt to crush al-Qaeda. The British government was among those aiding the US mission. Some of the individuals seized by the Americans - or sometimes by the security forces of other countries - had connections to the UK. The UK's two security agencies, MI5 and MI6, were battling to grasp the extent of the threat posed by al-Qaeda and knew some detainees held abroad had the key to plots at home. That meant British officers needed to interview anyone who had a connection to the UK or alternatively to gather information from foreign security agencies interrogating detainees. In the years that followed, it emerged that some of the detainees held in foreign prisons had been abused or tortured. The question was whether British officials aided and abetted that abuse or, at the least, had been told what was going on and did nothing to intervene. If the UK did not intervene, was that a crime? The most well-known case was Binyam Mohamed. Mr Mohamed, a resident of the UK, was detained in Pakistan in 2002 and handed over to US authorities. The then terrorism suspect was moved to Morocco and Afghanistan before being detained at Guantanamo Bay. Mr Mohamed says that he was abused in Pakistan and tortured in Morocco. When he was finally released from Guantanamo Bay to returned to the UK. He was never charged with a crime. The Court of Appeal in London eventuallyordered the release of information,externalshowing the US had indeed told the UK that the detainee had been subjected to ""cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment"". In the legal jargon, this is called ""rendition"" but, if it's illegal, it amounts to abduction. Arguably the most serious case is that of Libyan Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar. Mr Belhaj was a leader of an armed Islamist group dedicated to the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi. Abdul Hakim Belhaj (centre): Prime Minister Theresa May said he and wife Fatima Boudchar had suffered ""appalling treatment"" When the dictator crushed the group in the late 1990s, its leadership scattered - some of them throwing their lot in with al-Qaeda, the Taliban or other jihadist organisations. The UK government has apologised to Mr Belhaj and his wife and accepted the couple's account, which says MI6 provided key intelligence in 2004 on his movements which ultimately led to his capture and rendition by the US to Libya. Mr Belhaj spent six years in prison and was tortured. His then pregnant wife was only released days before she gave birth. The links to the UK government emerged following Gaddafi's 2011 fall afterinvestigators from Human Rights Watch,externalraided his intelligence HQ and discovered documents that pointed the finger at British officials. Document uncovered in Libya: Links London to rendition Torture has been banned for centuries under English law, a position backed by international convention. The UK also has a long-standing prohibition on lesser forms of abuse, relating to interrogation practices that were outlawed during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. There are no allegations that British officials broke the law in this way. The allegation has always been that some either turned a blind eye or did not do enough to stop foreign security agencies abusing detainees. In a letter read out in the Commons relating to the Belhaj case, Theresa May said UK actions had contributed to the couple's capture and that the government had ""shared information"" about them with ""international partners"". While the government's apology maintains a denial of legal liability, the settlement leaves questions unanswered about how much others in government were involved in what happened. The prime minister said: ""Later, during your [Mr Belhaj's] detention in Libya, we sought information about and from you. We wrongly missed opportunities to alleviate your plight: this should not have happened."" In another case, the UK in 2012agreed to pay Â£2.2m to Libyan dissident,Sami al-Saadi and his family who said MI6 was involved in their illegal rendition. And in another string of cases brought by British men held at Guantanamo Bay, the government settled for millions of pounds. That meant their cases were never fully examined. Ministers promised to hold a major public inquiry into the allegations - but they scrapped that after detectives began investigating the allegations made by Abdul Hakim Belhaj and another Libyan dissident. Separately, Parliament passed a law allowing courts to hold secret sessions to examine evidence of wrongdoing involving MI5 and MI6. That means the government can now, if it so wishes, defend its position in private, without having to reveal in public what, if anything, happened. Sir Peter Gibson, the retired judge chairing the inquiry, said in his closing report that there was indeed evidence that the UK""may have been inappropriately involved in some renditions""and this ""very serious matter"" needed to be properly investigated. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee is continuing that work in secret. After four years - and reportedly examining 28,000 pages of documents - the CPS decided last June there was insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone from MI6 in relation to the Libya claims. Prosecutors had previously ruled out prosecuting anyone in relation to the ill-treatment of Binyam Mohamed.

"Abd- al-Rashim al-Nashiri, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abu Zubaydah were captured and interrogated as part of the US fight against al-Qaeda The CIA carried out ""brutal"" interrogations of al-Qaeda suspects in the years after the 9/11 attacks on the US, a US Senate report has said. Thesummary of the report,external, compiled by Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the CIA had misled Americans about what it was doing. The information the CIA collected this way failed to secure information that foiled any threats, the report said. Ina statement,external, the CIA insisted the interrogations had helped save lives. ""The intelligence gained from the programme was critical to our understanding of al-Qaeda and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day,"" director John Brennan said. However, the CIA also acknowledged mistakes in the programme, especially early on when it was unprepared for the scale of the operation to detain and interrogate prisoners. The CIA programme - known internally as Rendition, Detention and Interrogation - took place from 2002-07, during the presidency of George W Bush. The report reveals that: Detainees were subjected to repeated waterboarding, slapping, stress positions and sleep deprivation Saudi al-Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah was kept confined in a coffin-sized box for hours on end Suspects were threatened with severe harm - psychologically and physically CIA report: The 20 key findings Analysis: Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent This report makes deeply uncomfortable reading but it shines a much-needed torch into some dark places. The fact that Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, or torture by any other name, was stopped years ago or that some people at the top of the US administration may not have known its full extent, does not excuse the fact it took place at all. After going through six million pages of documents, the authors concluded that in none of the cases they had looked at did these brutal methods stop a terrorist attack. Meaning that America's reputation, and by extension that of the wider West, has been sullied for no tangible gain. This will lay the US open to charges of hypocrisy, making it far harder for the West to criticise brutal and dictatorial regimes. It may also encourage terrorists to justify their atrocities by pointing to this past abuse. It can only be hoped this report's publication means these practices will be consigned to history's dustbin. Introducing the report to the Senate, Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein described the CIA's actions as a ""stain on US history"". This video can not be played Dianne Feinstein said it was time to face the ""ugly truth"" ""The release of this 500-page summary cannot remove that stain, but it can and does say to our people and the world that America is big enough to admit when it's wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes,"" she said. ""Under any common meaning of the term, CIA detainees were tortured,"" she added. Earlier, President Barack Obama said the methods used were inconsistent with US values. ""These techniques did significant damage to America's standing in the world and made it harder to pursue our interests with allies and partners,"" he said. Reacting to the release of the report summary, the Senate Republican leaders insisted that the methods used had helped in the capture of important suspects and the killing of Osama bin Laden. ""Claims included in this report that assert the contrary are simply wrong,"" Senators Mitch McConnell and Saxby Chambliss said in a joint statement. UK Prime Minister David Cameron said the issue had been ""dealt with from a British perspective"" but that torture was wrong. ""After 9/11 there were things that happened that were wrong - and we should be clear about the fact they were wrong,"" he said. The Senate committee's report runs to more than 6,000 pages, drawing on huge quantities of evidence, but it remains classified and only a525-page summary,externalhas been released. Described by US officials as al-Qaeda's former operational planner and terrorist recruiter, Abu Zubaydah was captured in Pakistan and sent to a secret facility in Thailand. His cell was described as white with no natural light or windows, but with four lights pointing into the cell and an air conditioner. He had two chairs, one more comfortable than the other, rotated based on his level of co-operation. From 4-23 August 2002, following 47 days of complete isolation, Abu Zubaydah was subjected to EIT almost 24 hours a day. Security personnel entered his cell, shackled and hooded him and removed his towel so that he was naked. ""Abu Zubaydah was typically kept naked and sleep-deprived,"" the report says. He was backed up against the wall and a box laid on the floor to look like a coffin. Whenever the suspect denied having certain information, the interrogators grabbed or slapped his face. On the first evening, he was waterboarded, as a result of which he coughed, vomited and had spasms. The sessions accelerated, progressing more quickly to waterboarding. According to the report, the objective was ""to ensure [he] is at his most vulnerable state"", at all times. Is 'waterboarding' torture? Who were the detainees? This video can not be played Former CIA lawyer John Rizzo on 'enhanced interrogation': ""I don't think I had any other choice."" The main points of the report include the following: None of 20 cases of counterterrorism ""successes"" attributed to the techniques led to unique or otherwise unavailable intelligence The CIA misled politicians and public, giving inaccurate information to obtain approval for using techniques The CIA claimed falsely that no senators had objected to the programme At least 26 of 119 known detainees in custody during the life of the programme were wrongfully held, and many held for months longer than they should have been Methods included sleep deprivation for up to 180 hours, often standing or in painful positions Waterboarding was physically harmful to prisoners, causing convulsions and vomiting Armed police guard the US embassy in London, as part of enhanced security measures at US facilities worldwide Mr Obama halted the CIA interrogation programme when he took office in 2009. Earlier this year, he said that in his view the methods used to question al-Qaeda prisoners amounted to torture. Publication of the report had been delayed amid disagreements in Washington over what should be made public. Security was increased at US facilities around the world ahead of publication. Embassies and other sites were taking precautions amid ""some indications"" of ""greater risk"", a White House spokesman said. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he had ordered all top US military commanders to be on high alert. US intelligence agencies were accused of using ""extraordinary rendition"" to send terror suspects for questioning in countries where they had no legal protection or rights under American law. Some of the suspects claimed they had been tortured in countries such as Syria and Egypt. A Council of Europe report in 2006 said it had pieced together details of a ""spider's web of secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers"", based on evidence from detainees' testimonies, flight plans and other publicly-available information. The Senate report released on Tuesday said that the CIA had sent some of its al-Qaeda suspects to detention centres in other countries, but did not say which ones.

"Harold Milner ran over 70-year-old Irene Moore on Hessle High Road A 79-year-old driver hit and killed a woman less than three weeks after passing his test, a court heard. Harold Milner pressed the accelerator instead of the brake when he struck 70-year-old Irene Moore on Hessle High Road, Hull, on 23 October 2017. Hull Crown Court heard a policeman called to the scene was unaware the victim was his mother until he heard her name later on the police radio. Milner was handed a four-month jail term, suspended for 12 months. More from East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire The pensioner, of Impala Way, Hull, had denied causing death by dangerous driving but admitted causing death by careless driving, at a previous hearing. Milner decided to learn to drive so that he could take his terminally ill wife to and from hospital, the court heard. His wife had done all the driving up until last year when she felt unable to continue after being diagnosed with bone cancer, the court heard. Mrs Moore had been shopping and was crossing the road at the junction of Summergroves Way when she was knocked down. She suffered head injuries and died in hospital three days later. In a victim statement read out in court, PC Bryan Moore described how his mother's face was covered by a breathing bag as she was being treated by paramedics. ""I took a quick glance at the lady on the floor... but it did not register with me that this was my own mother. ""I have to live with my last memories of my mother not being pleasant and seeing her in such a distressing state,"" he said. However, he added that he had ""no ill feeling"" towards Milner and did not want him to be jailed. Sentencing Milner, Judge Mark Bury said: ""It's a tragedy for all concerned. It is a truly remarkable and unique case."" Milner's barrister John Thackeray said his client had surrendered his licence and had ""no intention of ever driving"".

"Forbes ranked Fan Bingbing as the world's fifth highest-paid actress in 2016 China's authorities say they are capping the pay of actors as part of a move to crack down on tax evasion and ""money worship"" in the industry. Actors in Chinese films and TV programmes will have their pay capped at 40% of total production costs. Meanwhile, lead actors cannot be paid more than 70% of total cast pay, the government says. It comes after a debate on celebrity pay, and allegations of tax evasion in the film industry. The official announcement comes from a joint statement (in Chinese),externalfrom five government agencies, including the propaganda department, ministry of culture and tourism, and radio, TV and film regulators late on Wednesday. It does not specify why the government is cracking down on celebrity pay now - but says it is needed to deal with ""sky-high pay"" for actors, ""yin and yang contracts"" and ""tax evasion and other issues"". These problems have ""damaged the health of the film and TV industry"", and led to ""money worship"", ""the youth blindly chasing celebrities"" and ""distorted social values"", the notice added, without giving details about how the pay cap would be enforced. China's box-office revenue has been rising - with revenues of $8.6bn in 2017 The move is probably linked to a controversy over celebrity tax evasion that began last month. In May, TV presenter Cui Yongyuan posted what he said was a contract that Fan Bingbing - one of China's most famous actresses - had signed, worth $1.6m (Â£1.2m). He followed this up with a second social media post that alleged that many celebrities signed two contracts - known as ""yin and yang contracts"" - and only reported the lower-value contract to the authorities, as a way to evade taxes. Many social media users assumed he was referring to Fan Bingbing. Fan's studio has denied any wrongdoing, and warned Mr Cui he could face legal action for publishing Fan's contract and implying that she had been involved in tax evasion. Earlier in June, China's tax authorities began an investigation into ""the tax evasion issue by certain film and TV professionals as alleged in online discussions"". In other film industries - for example, in Hollywood and Bollywood - the government does not get involved with how much actors are paid. But in China, the government tends to have more oversight over many industries, even if they are in the private sector. Wednesday's notice said productions should ""prioritise benefits to society"", rather than considering ""just box office returns, ratings and click-through rates"". This video can not be played Many in China feel the authorities have gone too far in censoring The Empress of China, as John Sudworth reports More generally, the Chinese authorities are no stranger to censorship and regulation - social media platforms have sensitive words filtered out, while Chinese journalists are told to follow the leadership in ""politics, thought and action"". Last year, TV dramas were given notice of a new set of rules governing their content, and told to ""enhance people's cultural taste"" and ""strengthen spiritual civilisation"".

"Josephine Iyamu will be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court next week A London-based nurse has been convicted of trafficking five Nigerian women into Germany to work as prostitutes after subjecting them to ""voodoo"" rituals. Josephine Iyamu forced the women to swear oaths to hand over money to her during ""juju"" ceremonies. Iyamu, 51, formerly of Bermondsey, was convicted of five counts of arranging or facilitating travel for sexual exploitation at Birmingham Crown Court. Jurors also found her guilty of perverting the course of justice. The rituals saw the women forced to eat chicken hearts, drink blood containing worms, and have powder rubbed into cuts, the court heard. This video can not be played ""Kiki"" was one of Josephine Iyamu's victims Iyamu is the first person to be convicted under Modern Slavery Act laws passed in 2015, allowing prosecutions of British citizens for overseas sexual trafficking. She was born in Liberia, but became a British citizen in 2009 having been allowed to stay in the UK due to her nursing qualifications. Her husband, 60-year-old Efe Ali-Imaghodor, was acquitted of doing acts intending to pervert the course of justice. Iyamu declared a modest income of around Â£14,500 in 2016/17 from her work as an NHS agency nurse, the court heard. But after her arrest last year investigators found she was able to afford to spend thousands on air travel and a large home in Benin City, Nigeria. Iyamu had a large home in Benin City in Nigeria Prosecutor Simon Davis said by performing rituals Iyamu gained psychological control over the women. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Iyamu had ""enlisted the help of a voodoo priest"" to put the women through a ""juju"" ceremony which was ""designed to exert control"" over them. The victims and their families were threatened with serious harm if they broke their oath to Iyamu, according to the NCA. The court heard Iyamu was ""willing to put the women at risk of serious injury and or death as they made their journey from Nigeria to Europe"". They were too afraid to challenge her or fail to pay her back tens of thousands of Euros she charged them to be trafficked into Germany, the court was told. Opening the case, Mr Davis said: ""The debts incurred by the women were enforced through fear. ""Each of the women were put through what is known to some as a voodoo ceremony."" Iyamu will be sentenced on Wednesday. 'Kiki' was one of Iyamu's victims.

"Alexander Monson died in police custody after being arrested on suspicion of smoking cannabis A British aristocrat who died in custody in Kenya was beaten to death by police, an inquest has ruled. Alexander Monson, 28, son of Lord Nicholas Monson, was arrested for allegedly smoking cannabis in the Diani beach resort in May 2012. His family has always maintained he was killed by the police, while officers claimed he died of a drug overdose. Senior Principal Magistrate Richard Odenyo has recommended four officers be prosecuted. More from Lincolnshire According to the AFP news agency, Mr Odenyo said: ""His death was not natural, neither was it due to drugs. ""His life was cut short by the police and therefore, the director of public prosecution should prosecute the officers mentioned."" The officers suspected of being involved - named as Naftali Chege, John Pamba, Charles Munyiri and Ismael Pamba - had also contradicted each other, Mr Odenyo said. He concluded the 28-year-old died from a blow to the head with a blunt object, inflicted while he was in custody. Mr Monson, who was the son of the 12th Baron Monson and heir to the family estate in Lincolnshire, moved to Kenya to live with his mother Hilary Monson in 2008. Hilary Monson and her husband John Lockhart sat in court during the ruling Giving evidence during the inquest in Mombasa she said her son had been arrested after a night out with friends on suspicion of smoking bhang, a form of cannabis. She was later told her son had been found on the floor of the police station convulsing. Mrs Monson told the inquest, which started in 2015, she visited her son in hospital where he was chained to a bed. ""He was having very great difficulty breathing,"" she said. In a statement issued on behalf of the family, Lord Monson said: ""It is a cause for jubilation that the magistrate has delivered the correct verdict."" ""Alexander was unlawfully killed and the Kenyan police officers in post that night in Diani Police Station where he was held are being recommended for prosecution."" He said his son was subjected to ""a brutal attack"" while in the care of police, and was ""left lying unconscious in a cell and, later, behind the station's report desk having been denied medical attention and any semblance of decency"". An independent pathologist hired by the family found Mr Monson died from a fatal blow to the back of his head. Toxicology reports also showed he had no drugs in his system at the time of his death.

"Mr Trump has previously visited his golf courses at Turnberry in Ayrshire and the Menie Estate in Aberdeenshire A possible one-day visit by US President Donald Trump to Scotland in July could cost Police Scotland Â£5m. Mr Trump is scheduled to have talks with Prime Minister Theresa May at Downing Street on 13 July. It has been suggested the president may then visit at least one of his golf courses in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire. The prime minister's office has indicated that the UK government may consider providing financial assistance to cover policing costs. Interim Chief Constable Iain Livingstone has told the Scottish Police Authority that the visit would require at least 5,000 officers. He said that contingency planning was under way, with rest days cancelled and shifts changed for many officers. Protests against the controversial US president have already been organised for Glasgow and Edinburgh to coincide with the visit. Mr Livingstone told members of the authority: ""I do have to stress that we do not have final confirmation that the president of the United States will actually include any specific engagements in Scotland, however we do have to prepare for such an eventuality and I consider it's my duty in my current role to ensure that we prepare contingencies."" He said that, even without a confirmed visit or itinerary, the force would need to consider ""a wide variety of policing factors"". These included ""the deployment-appropriate security measures that would be required for the president of the United States as a protected person"". Mr Livingstone said it was Police Scotland's duty to ""ensure and enable"" any public demonstrations and protests ""should people wish to do so"". He added: ""We estimate at this time - and very much dependent on the specific nature of the potential visit - that we will have to utilise over 5,000 conventional officers, along with public order officers, specialised search and firearms resources."" Mr Livingstone said he had concerns about how the additional spend would be financed. He explained that even if the Scottish part of the UK visit does not go ahead ""there is still potential for a number of events in Scotland to have implications for us given his ties to Scotland and some of his legacy business interests"". The Scottish Police Federation has called on the UK government to release funds to cover the cost of the visit. General secretary Calum Steele said: ""It is simply iniquitous to expect (Police Scotland) to pick up the costs for this at the same time as additional central government funding is being made available to cover the exceptional costs the police forces in England and Wales will incur for their part in policing the visit. ""The argument that policing in Scotland is devolved and must therefore meet its own costs is disingenuous. ""President Trump is not visiting to meet the Prime Minister of England. His visit is in an official capacity to the United Kingdom."" Downing Street said it regularly considers requests for additional financial support from police forces for major events. A spokeswoman for the prime minister said details of any visit by President Trump had not been confirmed and would not comment on the specific concerns raised by Scottish police. But she added: ""More generally, for major events, we work very closely with the police and we consider requests for support including financial support on a case-by-case basis.""

"The art school and nearby O2 building were gutted by fire on 15 June Parts of the Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh building are to be dismantled after it was ravaged by fire earlier this month. Glasgow City Council said surveys had revealed substantial movement in the building's walls and that a sudden collapse of parts of it was likely. Work to partially dismantle sections of the building is expected to begin as a ""matter of urgency"". The building, which was completed in 1909,was gutted by fire on 15 June. The city council said remote surveys and close-in surveys from baskets suspended from cranes above the charred remains of the structure had revealed more substantial movement in its walls than previously thought. Is this Game Over for the Mack? Shock at Glasgow School of Art fire The other buildings lost to the flames In all its glory: Glasgow School of Art before the fire They have concluded that a sudden collapse of parts of the building was likely, rather than possible. The statement said: ""There is now a requirement to at least partially dismantle sections of the building as a matter of urgency. This video can not be played Fire engulfed the Glasgow School of Art on 15 June ""However, the dangerous nature of the site - which includes the Mackintosh building and the O2 ABC - is such that it will take around two days to devise a methodology for taking down the south facade, which is the most seriously affected part of the building. ""The west gable of the Mackintosh building has continued to deteriorate and the east gable has continued to move outwards. ""It is not possible at this time to say exactly when the work will begin, but it will be as soon as possible."" The council has also warned about the risk of falling bricks or stonework on Sauchiehall Street. Raymond Barlow, the authority's head of building control, said: ""With each passing day, a sudden collapse becomes more likely. ""It has become urgent that we take down the south facade. As the process begins, it will be likely that the other walls will also need to be reduced. The council is warning about the dangers of falling bricks or stonework from the site The fire was the second blaze to engulf the Mackintosh building in the past four years ""We do not know what effect this will have on the rest of the building, so I have to be clear this site remains dangerous and is becoming more dangerous. ""It is particularly important that people observe the cordon which remains in place."" The fire was the second blaze in four years at the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building. It was still undergoing renovations from the 2014 fire when it was engulfed by flames. The renovated Mackintosh library had been due to reopen next year. In a statement, Glasgow School of Art acknowledged that damage to the building was ""significantly greater than had initially been anticipated"". However, it said the aim of the work would be to achieve structural stability. The fire has brought hardship to businesses within the exclusion zone The statement said: ""The areas of significant concern are the east elevation, the west elevation and sections of the south elevation. ""The plan of works will involve [site contractor] Reigart undertaking extensive down-takings and potential structural bracing. ""Due to the condition of the Mackintosh building, this work will be undertaken in a highly-controlled way to minimise any potential risk of failure and be sufficient to achieve structural stability of the Mackintosh building."" Meanwhile, the first minister has said that residents and businesses affected by the fire will receive compensation. Nicola Sturgeon said a hardship and relief fund would be made available to those who had been displaced. This video can not be played Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art, taken before the 2014 fire Traders on Sauchiehall Street have warned that the fire could spell the end for some businesses, while some residents living within the exclusion zone around the site have been unable to return home since 15 June. Speaking during First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The Scottish government will make Â£1,500 available to each household, which will be match-funded by the council to make a total of Â£3,000 for each household. ""In addition, we will confirm increases in support for affected businesses, increasing the amount that the Scottish government contributes towards business rates from 75% to 95%.""

"The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews are permitted to pray The Duke of Cambridge has visited Jerusalem's most sacred religious sites and his great-grandmother's grave on the final day of his official tour. He laid flowers at the tomb of Princess Alice - the Duke of Edinburgh's mother - at the Church of Mary Magdalene. Also on his itinerary was the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, a site that is sacred to Jews and Muslims. He then went to the adjacent Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews are permitted to pray. Prince William's tour ended at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is widely regarded as Christianity's holiest place. Many Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected on the site. It is shared by the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Egyptian Copt and Ethiopian Orthodox denominations of Christianity. It is the final day of the duke's Middle East tour Prince William spoke with Western Wall chief Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch and British chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis during his visit The duke began his morning on the Mount of Olives, taking in a view of Jerusalem's Old City. There, he visited the Church of Mary Magdalene, a Russian Orthodox church and Princess Alice's final resting place. In keeping with Russian Orthodox tradition, Prince William took bread and salt at the entrance of the church. Inside, he laid flowers picked from the garden of Philip Hall - Britain's Consul General in Jerusalem - in the princess's crypt. The duke laid flowers at the tomb of his great-grandmother, Princess Alice Archimandrite Roman, head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, recited a ""prayer for the repose of Princess Alice's soul"" and the duke bowed his head with his eyes closed. After the visit, Father Roman said: ""He said he found it profoundly moving. ""He was certainly moved to learn more about his family history and pay his respects to his great-grandmother in such a holy place."" In pictures: Prince William's Middle East tour William meets Palestinian leader Abbas Prince William meets Eurovision winner Prince in first royal visit to West Bank He said he shared a ""little joke"" with the prince. ""When I was showing him the family tree with the Russian links, I told the prince that I'd read somewhere that someone once asked Prince Philip if he had ever been to Russia, and that he had said: 'They murdered half my bloody family, so maybe I'll go, maybe not'. ""The prince laughed and said: 'He would say that'."" The duke visited the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque at the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif The duke went on to tour the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque at the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif. He was shown around the area by Dr Mustafa Abu Sway, a professor of philosophy and Islamic studies at the city's Al-Quds University, and they spoke about the historical significance of the site. Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif sits on an elevated plaza, which was the site of both of Judaism's ancient temples, above the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Muslims believe it was the site of the Prophet Muhammad's ascent to heaven in the 7th Century. In Judaism it is where Abraham was instructed by God to sacrifice his son as a test of faith. Prince William began his morning on the Mount of Olives, taking in a view of Jerusalem's Old City During his visit to the Western Wall, Prince William - who was wearing a kippah, or religious head-covering, as a mark of respect - approached the landmark and placed a written prayer in a crack in the ancient wall, as is tradition. British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, who accompanied the prince, said: ""Today we experienced a moment of history which will live long in the memory of Jews around the world. ""The Western Wall stands at the epicentre of our faith. To see the future monarch come to pay his respects was a remarkable gesture of friendship and a sign of the duke's regard for the sanctity of Jerusalem."" The Western Wall is a remnant of the retaining wall which surrounded the second Jewish temple at the time of King Herod. By Jonny Dymond, royal correspondent, in Jerusalem Prince William visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem's Old City After four days of criss-crossing Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories, there was time for a little sightseeing. But on an official visit, every step is weighed up against what has come before and what will follow. The three sites Prince William visited each inspire devotion from the three great Abrahamic faiths - Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif has been a flashpoint for protests and conflagration. Today the compound was an oasis of calm and beauty in amidst the bustle of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Western Wall, a remnant from the time of the Second Temple of the Jews was busier. But there is an intensity to the moment you reach the Wall, and close your eyes, and touch the stone, that brings a peace of its own. And inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre the Prince got a taste of some of the swirling chaos that the disputatious church lives and thrives upon. In the space of just a few hours, like so many millions before him, the prince saw and must have felt the religious pull of Jerusalem, the reason that for so many centuries it has been coveted and fought over. Much to mull over on the flight back to Britain. The Duke of Cambridge's five-day visit to Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan began on Sunday. Since arriving on his current leg of the tour, he has met Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and its President Reuven Rivlin, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Princess Alice was married to Prince Andrew of Greece and is remembered for saving the life of a Jewish family in Athens during the Holocaust by sheltering them in her home from the Nazis. This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge's great-grandmother, Princess Alice, helped to save Jews during World War Two On Tuesday, the duke met relatives of the late Rachel Cohen, who was hidden from the Gestapo by his great-grandmother. Princess Alice, who was a nun for many years, was first laid to rest at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, when she died in 1969. But it was at her request that she was interred, in 1988, at the Russian Orthodox church on the Mount of Olives, near her aunt Elizabeth, the Grand Duchess of Russia. On Wednesday, Prince William became the first royal family member to make an official visit to the Palestinian territories in the occupied West Bank. While there he expressed hope for ""lasting peace"" between Israelis and Palestinians.

"The roof of the Glasgow Science Centre started leaking a pitch-like substance as temperatures soared on Thursday Scotland's largest city has enjoyed its hottest June day in history. The temperature hit 31.9C in Glasgow, which weather forecasters round up to 32C. Thursday beat Wednesday's record as Scotland's hottest day in 23 years. Temperatures triggered speed restrictions on rail routes in central Scotland and roads melted in Aberdeenshire, Moray and Fife. The ""weatherproof"" membrane on Glasgow Science Centre's roof melted and dripped black ""goo"" down the building. Thursday has become Scotland's warmest day of 2018 so far. Forecasters thought the day's temperatures might get close to Scotland's record highest June temperature of 32.2 recorded in Ochertyre in Perth and Kinross in 1893. People soak up the sunshine in Glasgow's George Square Brumma the bear enjoys a giant ice lolly to stay cool at Camperdown Wildlife Centre While the heat did get close, the record still stands. The high temperatures caused problems across the country. Sharon Lyons from Glasgow Science Centre said: ""As Scotland enjoys 'taps aff' weather, the weatherproof membrane from our roof is quite literally melting. ""The structural integrity of the roof is completely sound, but we are left with a bit of an unsightly black goo on the roof. ""When we return to typical Glasgow colder climes, we shall set about cleaning it."" The ""weatherproof"" membrane melted in the sun Gritters were sent out after roads were reported to be melting in high temperatures. Poor conditions were encountered on the A920 between Huntly and Dufftown and on the A916 Craigrothie to Cupar road. On Wednesday, Aviemore reached 31C, making it the hottest single day in five years before the record was surpassed 24 hours later. How hot is it where you are? When is it too hot to work? Staying safe and cool in UK heatwave conditions There were delays at Central Station as hot rails caused speed restrictions Train services between Glasgow Central and Lanark faced disruption for most of Thursday, the morning aftermajor signalling problemscaused issues on commuter routes. ScotRail said this was because of speed restrictions due to high track temperatures. Speed limits were also put in place between Bathgate and Edinburgh and were expected to last until about 19:00. Services between Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street via Falkirk High were reduced to a half-hourly service and journeys between Edinburgh and Dunblane were cut to hourly. Network Rail activated its ""extreme weather action team"" (EWAT). Temperatures across Scotland were expected to climb throughout the day David Dickson, Network Rail's infrastructure director for the ScotRail Alliance, said: ""On very sunny days, rails in direct sunshine can be as much as 20 degrees centigrade above air temperature causing the steel to expand markedly and could, if not carefully monitored and action taken, buckle causing travel disruption. ""Our engineers and specialist extreme weather teams are monitoring track-side temperatures and vulnerable locations and will, if necessary, introduce temporary speed restrictions during the hottest part of the day to keep trains running, albeit more slowly than normal."" Some rails have been painted white to absorb less heat. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

They issued a warning on Twitter, saying: ""Some quarry lakes may look inviting on a hot summer's day, but there are a number of hidden dangers! Deep water, submerged abandoned machinery & car wrecks, underwater recesses, hidden currents, dead animals, pollution."" The message added: ""More dangers of quarry swimming are sheer faces, falling rocks, quick sand, and believe it or not hypothermia - despite the weather, water deeper than a few inches will be cold enough to cause cold shock!"" Even pets have to stay cool and safe in the sun NHS Dumfries and Galloway sent out guidance on the risk the heat may cause to health. Dr Nigel Calvert said: ""It's important to remember though that, for some, temperatures like these, over more than a day or two can be really uncomfortable and pose a risk to health. ""People who may be at risk include the over 65s, young children and those with heart and lung conditions. ""It's important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk, and chances are we'll all know someone who may fit into these at-risk groups."" A reminder of the dangers of hot cars to dogs was also sent out on social media by Police Scotland, afterofficers smashed a car window in Fife yesterday to rescue a dog which was inside in record-breaking heat. It read: ""Please DO NOT leave your pets in the car, even if only popping into the shops - cars heat up extremely quickly.

"This video can not be played Firefighters working on the moorland face ""really difficult"" conditions, an officer says Soldiers helping fight a moorland fire in Greater Manchester that could rage ""for weeks"" will remain in the area for a further 48 hours to aid fire crews. About 100 troops from the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, were sent from their barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire, overnight. The blaze is currently under control but could flare up at any time, the fire service said. Stalybridge MP Jonathan Reynolds praised the community's ""Blitz spirit"". Military assistance was requested to help battle the blaze near Saddleworth Moor which has spread across seven square miles, in six different areas. The soldiers arrived to help tackle the wildfire near Saddleworth Moor Soldiers from 4th Battalion Royal Regiment Scotland arrived overnight Soldiers joined more than 100 firefighters to support the effort by managing water lines and assisting in fire beating on moorland above Stalybridge. While shops and local residents have teamed up to help keep emergency service staff fed and watered. A fish and chip shop owner has been offering free meals to firefighters and the military and donations of drinks and food parcels are being collected at Stalybridge Fire Station. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) has faced many hurdles in trying to quell the blaze that has raged for days including frequent changes in wind direction, the heavy concentration of flammable peat in the ground and the tinder-dry foliage which has baked in searing temperatures. It said the soldiers' help would allow the service to deal with other emergency calls, including supporting Lancashire colleagues at anothermoorland blaze at Winter Hillnear Rivington.

""It looks like we'll be here for another 48 hours then we'll wait for another request."" A Chinook helicopter was due to fly out of RAF Odiham, Hampshire, to move water-pumping equipment but Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) notified the Ministry of Defence it was ""no longer required"". The helicopter is on standby and is still ""available as a resource if we need it"", GMFRS said. Owen Jones has been co-ordinating the relief effort from Stalybridge Fire Station At the scene, Tom Mullen, BBC News Dozens of people, shops, supermarkets and local businesses have been contributing supplies to help feed the firefighters and military tackling the fire near Saddleworth Moor. GMFRS station manger Owen Jones has been tasked with co-ordinating the relief effort from Stalybridge Fire Station, where a huge pile of drinks, cakes and other snacks and supplies have been left - ready to be ferried up the hills. Mr Jones said about 50 people had called at the station today alone, including supermarkets Tesco and Morrisons, local schoolchildren and residents. Tameside Council has also contributed several 4x4 drivers to help take the supplies to the firefighters battling the flames, alongside volunteers from the fire service and the Prince's Trust. Mr Jones said: ""Working in these conditions is tough. The heat is encouraging the fire to burn, but it's also making the task of our firefighters more arduous. ""There's very little cover or shade or respite. We've got gazebos and shaded areas but it's still been an essential task to get supplies up there to them. ""The response from people wanting to help has been incredibly heart warming. From 7:30 this morning it hasn't stopped. It got to the point where I've had to ask people to go round the back to make room. ""The response from the schoolchildren has been especially nice to see as the schools are closed. They've made handmade cards for the firefighters, cakes, gifts, all sorts. ""I've been running round like a madman. It's been extremely disruptive and scary for the local residents but the community cohesion has been great to see."" Tony Hunter, assistant chief fire officer for the service, said there have been ""significant improvements"" but added an ""air of caution as we thought we had a similar situation yesterday"". He said if it does change direction it could add fuel to the fire. ""The fire is contained at the moment, but we only need a change of wind direction to see the fire increase. We are working hard to keep on top of the blaze."" He added: ""Our main action is to protect to the left-hand side to stop it spreading towards the residents, and to the right-hand side to make sure it doesn't go... into unburnt material."" Assistant chief fire officer for GMFRS says the fire was ""contained at the moment"" Resident Peter Fenton said he had been impressed with the way the community of Carrbrook, which had been evacuated on Tuesday, had come together in the wake of the fire. ""Schools are closed but the schoolchildren have been keeping busy handing out supplies to the police and firefighters,"" he said. Moorland fire in pictures How do you tackle a moorland blaze? ""Shops have been handing out water too, and I heard a supermarket sent up a whole stack of stuff."" Janine East, owner of Mill Brook fish and chip shop in Stalybridge, said she ""wanted to do her bit"" as she knows what a ""huge task"" they have. ""I know what it's like up on the moors and what the terrain's like. It's incredibly steep."" A panoramic view showed the extent of the smoke on Wednesday evening Evidence the fire was still burning could be seen as dawn broke on Thursday in Carrbrook Fire engines park up on the moor as firefighters continue tackling the blaze An investigation is set to be launched into the fire but Mr Hunter said: ""We can see this being prolonged for days if not weeks, particularly with the fact that the wind has drawn the fires towards the residential but actually away from the centre of the moor."" He said what was needed most was ""a significant downpour of rain"" - but none has been forecast. Mr Hunter said: ""Over the course of the fire it goes further and further down into the peat and once its down there, it gets very difficult without liquid to put the fire out unless you have a digger. ""We can't dig a square mile of moorland up."" This video can not be played Helicopters are being used in the effort to fight a moorland fire in Greater Manchester The blaze was initially brought under control but reignited on Monday Firefighters continued to battle the fire at daybreak On Wednesday, firefighters had faced the arduous task of hauling pumps and hoses for up to two miles in blistering heat to reach parts of the fire. Greater Manchester Police deployed a helicopter to assess the scene and United Utilities provided a helicopter to drop water on to remote areas. Having started on Sunday the blaze was initially brought under control but reignited on Monday and has continued throughout the hot and dry weather this week. About 150 people were forced to leave their homes in the village of Carrbrook on Tuesday evening as the fire encroached. The majority had returned by Wednesday afternoon. Community support officers patrolled the village of Carrbrook Dr Richard Bircher said fellow GPs had opened late to meet the extra demand An investigation is set to be launched into the cause of the fire. Dr Richard Bircher, of Lockside Medical Centre in Stalybridge, said he had treated nine ""normally fit and healthy"" people for chest complaints and breathing difficulties. ""Chest complaints can develop for a number of reasons but I think it's safe to assume the smoke is the main factor behind the increase,"" he said. Dr Bircher said he expected the number of people seeking treatment would continue to rise as smoke lingered, particularly among older people, but added there had been no increase in hospital admissions. He praised the response of Tameside's social care services and fellow GPs who had opened late to meet the extra demand for appointments and advised anybody exposed to smoke to continue to wear dust masks and seek advice if they developed breathing problems.

"The Queen's taxpayer-funded costs rose by 13% in the past year, partly due to the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace. Accounts show the public funds used by the Queen for official expenditure and duties went up from Â£41.9m to Â£47.4m. More than Â£4m was spent on the initial phase of improvements at the palace, including the removal of old wiring, while Â£21.4m went on payroll costs. The ""core"" sovereign grant is based on 15% of the net surplus of the Crown Estate, as it was two years previously. But from this year, the total grant is based on 25% of the surplus - an increase intended to meet the costs of refurbishing Buckingham Palace. Overall, the total Sovereign Grant was Â£76.1m - but Â£28.7m was transferred to reserves, most of which is intended to pay for the renovation. The Sovereign Grant accounts also show an increase in travel costs, from Â£4.5m to Â£4.7m. The most expensive trip was Prince Charles's tour of India and the Far East in November 2017, which cost Â£362,149. Over the year, the prince used the Royal Train - at a cost of about Â£20,000 a trip - twice as often as the Queen. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall carried out 619 UK engagements last year. The Queen undertook 154 official engagements, down from 162 the previous year. Queen to receive Â£6m public pay increase MPs back Â£369m Buckingham Palace revamp Reality Check: Who's paying for the royal wedding? Separately, figures from Clarence House - the Prince of Wales' private office - show an increase in funding of 40% for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex including capital expenditure and transfer to reserves. The total went from Â£3.5m to Â£5m. A Palace spokesman declined to be drawn on how much of the rise was related to Meghan, the new Duchess of Sussex. Separate figures show the Crown Estate provided Â£329.4m to the Treasury, a like-for-like increase of around 4% compared with last year's figures for England only. An independent commercial property business and one of the largest property portfolios in the UK The majority of assets are in London, but the estate also owns property in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Holdings include Windsor Great Park and Ascot racecourse, but most of the portfolio is made up of residential property, commercial offices, shops, businesses and retail parks Sir Michael Stevens, the new keeper of the Privy Purse, who oversees the monarch's finances, said: ""There are three generations of the Royal Family at work together in support of the Queen. ""Each generation brings its own style and personality. What everyone shares is a desire for the monarchy to reflect and serve all parts of our country and the wider Commonwealth."" On the renovations of Buckingham Palace, he said: ""The programme addresses the urgent need to overhaul the Palace's essential services - some of which have not been updated since the 1950s. ""These important works will help avert the very real danger of a catastrophic building failure such as a flood or fire."" Graham Smith of the group Republic, which campaigns for the monarchy to be abolished and for an elected head of state, said it was a ""big lie"" that the Queen's household is paid for by the Crown Estate. ""The reality is that the monarchy costs the British taxpayer dear, more than Â£345m a year.  That's a symptom of a secretive and unaccountable institution,"" he said.

"England play Belgium in the World Cup on Thursday. Both are definitely going through to the next round, but which country comes first and second will decide who they play. If they draw, it will be difficult to separate them. Fortunately,Fifa has rules,externalto distinguish between two or more teams with the same number of points, the same goal difference and the same number of goals scored. The first of these favours the winning team when the two played each other in the group stage. But if this game was a draw, these criteria are applied in the following order until the tie is broken: goal difference in games between the relevant teams (this is clearly only relevant only when three or more teams have the same number of points) goals scored in games between the relevant teams disciplinary points - one for a yellow card, three for two yellow cards resulting in a red card, four for a straight red card and five for a straight red card given to a player who already has a yellow card drawing of lots by the Fifa organising committee The tie-breaker on discipline was introduced after the2014 World Cup,external, presumably to make it less likely that lots would have to be drawn. There was something of an outcry against the drawing of lots after it was used to decide whether Mali or Guinea would qualify for the quarter-finals of the African Cup of Nations in 2015. The two countries drew all three of their group games 1-1 and there was no provision for fair play to be taken into account. At a local hotel, the president of the Malian football federation, Baba Diarra, and the financial director of Guinea's sports ministry, Amara Dabo, faced a bowl with two balls in it and were asked to choose one each. Mali went first and found in its ball a number three, indicating that they would come third in the group and be eliminated. The other ball had a two in it. If lots were to be drawn at the World Cup, Fifa has said that the balls would be drawn by a member of the World Cup organising committee who would not be from one of the relevant countries. It would take place at 23:00 local time (21:00 BST) in the press conference room at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. In an event open to the media, the committee member would choose between balls containing the names of the countries involved. The first country drawn would get the higher ranking in the group. This would be slightly different to the last time lots had to be drawn in the World Cup, which was in the 1990 tournament in Italy, when they were needed to decide whether the Netherlands or the Republic of Ireland would qualify in second or third place. At that tournament, four of the six third-place teams qualified. Niall Quinn scored Ireland's equaliser against the Netherlands, which meant lots needed to be drawn At a ceremony in Rome run by a youthful-looking Sepp Blatter,a flickery film of which you can watch online,external, ""Monique"" was asked to pick first between two yellow balls, which had the names of the countries in, and then between two red balls, one of which had a number two and the other a three. The Netherlands were drawn first, followed by the number three, which meant they had to play West Germany, while Ireland played Romania. The rankings were clearly important, with Ireland going on to beat Romania on penalties and progress to the quarter-finals, while the Netherlands lost 2-1 to the eventual champions, West Germany.

"This video can not be played Theresa May arrives at the European Council summit in Brussels Theresa May has said both the UK and EU want to work towards a future Brexit deal ""at a faster pace"", after being warned that time is running out. The UK PM said ""very good progress"" had been made on a withdrawal agreement. She will brief EU leaders at a summit for the last time before October, when both sides hope a deal will be done on the UK's March 2019 departure. But the European Commission president suggested UK cabinet splits were making things more difficult. Arriving at the summit in Brussels, Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""I don't have to lecture Theresa May, but I would like our British friends to make clear their position. ""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that."" Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Merkel: Defining moment for EU on migration Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress Brexit date could be delayed, says Blair Asked if talks could end in no deal, Mr Juncker said: ""We are preparing for different scenarios - on the proper withdrawal agreement but, in parallel, we are working on the no deal."" The prime minister, who has been under pressure at home within her own party, has called her cabinet together for what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting at Chequers on 6 July to agree the UK's blueprint for its future relations with the EU. Arriving in Brussels, Mrs May said she was looking forward to ""securing our strong future partnership"" which she said was in the interests of both the EU and UK . ""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that."" She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"". Mrs May said it was in everyone's interests that a new partnership on economic and security matters be agreed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Cabinet divisions over the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end, have yet to be resolved, as have arguments over the future movement of goods and people across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mrs May's former top aide, Nick Timothy, has urged her to face down her opponents in the cabinet, telling theDaily Telegraph,externalthe ""time for playing nice and being exploited are over"". Please upgrade your browser to view this content. With less than nine months to go before the UK's scheduled exit, businesses have issued warnings about the impact on jobs of leaving the EU without an agreement. The prime minister has been holding a number of face-to-face meetings with European counterparts on day one of the two-day summit, which is focused on the migration challenges facing Europe and eurozone reform. This video can not be played Is the EU punishing the UK? The remaining 27 EU leaders are due to discuss Brexit on their own on Friday morning, by which point Mrs May is expected to have left Brussels. On the eve of the summit, Mr Varadkar said he wanted ""detailed proposals"" from the UK on how it would honour the ""clear commitments"" made in December about the Irish border and citizens' rights. By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg The UK is eager for the EU to become more flexible. To move away from what the government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission. At dinner on Thursday night there's a chance for her to persuade the other leaders to loosen that approach. Only they can tell their negotiators to ease up on their red lines. In return for that request, she'll promise that the UK will be able to agree on its blueprint for the future relationship between the UK and EU, at a meeting of her cabinet next week. With almost daily skirmishes at home - that could prove optimistic. Read Laura's full blog ""Time is running out for the withdrawal agreement to be concluded satisfactorily by the October European Council,"" he said. ""I expect EU leaders to send a strong message to the UK that negotiations with the taskforce need to intensify."" The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier has said ""serious divergences"" remain over the question of backstop arrangements for the Irish border if neither of the UK's proposed customs proposals are deemed workable. Elsewhere, Mrs May will seek to show solidarity with the rest of Europe in their efforts to deal with illegal migrant flows across the Mediterranean from Africa and the Middle East. The issue has divided Europe for more than two years but tensions have increased since the election of a populist government in Italy, which has pledged to crack down on unlawful migration, and growing political uncertainty in Germany amid a backlash against Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policies. This video can not be played Brexit: No cherry picking, no cake-and-eat-it, says Leo Varadkar Mrs May is expected to stress the need to tackle the problem of people smuggling at its source, citing the success of a project in Nigeria where once the dangers of crossing the Mediterranean were explained to people, their attitudes to illegal working in the UK changed. On security, the prime minister will call for collective action against misinformation, cyber warfare and money laundering by ""hostile states"" such as Russia. One example of this, she will say, is the UK's sharing of details of Russian intelligence officers expelled after the attacks on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury with EU allies. The working dinner coincided with England's final World Cup group game against Belgium, whose prime minister Charles Michel was also present. The UK's permanent representative in Brussels couldn't say how much of the match Mrs May, who on Wednesday ordered St George's flags to be flown above No 10 for remaining England games, would see.

"The art school and nearby O2 building were gutted by fire on 15 June Parts of the Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh building are to be dismantled after it was ravaged by fire earlier this month. Glasgow City Council said surveys had revealed substantial movement in the building's walls and that a sudden collapse of parts of it was likely. Work to partially dismantle sections of the building is expected to begin as a ""matter of urgency"". The building, which was completed in 1909,was gutted by fire on 15 June. The city council said remote surveys and close-in surveys from baskets suspended from cranes above the charred remains of the structure had revealed more substantial movement in its walls than previously thought. Is this Game Over for the Mack? Shock at Glasgow School of Art fire The other buildings lost to the flames In all its glory: Glasgow School of Art before the fire They have concluded that a sudden collapse of parts of the building was likely, rather than possible. The statement said: ""There is now a requirement to at least partially dismantle sections of the building as a matter of urgency. This video can not be played Fire engulfed the Glasgow School of Art on 15 June ""However, the dangerous nature of the site - which includes the Mackintosh building and the O2 ABC - is such that it will take around two days to devise a methodology for taking down the south facade, which is the most seriously affected part of the building. ""The west gable of the Mackintosh building has continued to deteriorate and the east gable has continued to move outwards. ""It is not possible at this time to say exactly when the work will begin, but it will be as soon as possible."" The council has also warned about the risk of falling bricks or stonework on Sauchiehall Street. Raymond Barlow, the authority's head of building control, said: ""With each passing day, a sudden collapse becomes more likely. ""It has become urgent that we take down the south facade. As the process begins, it will be likely that the other walls will also need to be reduced. The council is warning about the dangers of falling bricks or stonework from the site The fire was the second blaze to engulf the Mackintosh building in the past four years ""We do not know what effect this will have on the rest of the building, so I have to be clear this site remains dangerous and is becoming more dangerous. ""It is particularly important that people observe the cordon which remains in place."" The fire was the second blaze in four years at the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building. It was still undergoing renovations from the 2014 fire when it was engulfed by flames. The renovated Mackintosh library had been due to reopen next year. In a statement, Glasgow School of Art acknowledged that damage to the building was ""significantly greater than had initially been anticipated"". However, it said the aim of the work would be to achieve structural stability. The fire has brought hardship to businesses within the exclusion zone The statement said: ""The areas of significant concern are the east elevation, the west elevation and sections of the south elevation. ""The plan of works will involve [site contractor] Reigart undertaking extensive down-takings and potential structural bracing. ""Due to the condition of the Mackintosh building, this work will be undertaken in a highly-controlled way to minimise any potential risk of failure and be sufficient to achieve structural stability of the Mackintosh building."" Meanwhile, the first minister has said that residents and businesses affected by the fire will receive compensation. Nicola Sturgeon said a hardship and relief fund would be made available to those who had been displaced. This video can not be played Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art, taken before the 2014 fire Traders on Sauchiehall Street have warned that the fire could spell the end for some businesses, while some residents living within the exclusion zone around the site have been unable to return home since 15 June. Speaking during First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The Scottish government will make Â£1,500 available to each household, which will be match-funded by the council to make a total of Â£3,000 for each household.

"Hotel booking sites must review the way they rank and display rooms, the UK's competition watchdog has said. Some sites may be making misleading claims about discounts, the Competition and Markets Authority said. It is also examining whether sites are giving a false impression of room availability and ""rushing"" customers into booking decisions. The CMA did not name which companies it has been investigating, but leading sites include Expedia and Booking.com. The extent to which a hotel's ranking may be influenced by the size of the commission it pays was another issue highlighted by the CMA. The CMA, whichlaunched its investigation into online booking sites in October, says it has sent warning letters to ""a range of sites"", demanding they review their practices to make sure they are fair and comply with consumer protection law. Concerns include: How search result rankings are influenced by factors irrelevant to consumers, such as how much commission a hotel pays the site Whether a false impression is created by claims about how many people are looking at the same room, how many rooms are left, and how long a price is available Clarity over discounts, including whether a weekday rate is being compared to a previous weekend rate Whether holidaymakers are hit with unexpected extra charges such as taxes and booking fees later in the booking process About 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites, according to the CMA. ""Booking sites can make it so much easier to choose your holiday, but only if people are able to trust them,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA. ""We are now demanding that sites think again about how they are presenting information to their customers and make sure they are complying with the law. Our next step is to take any necessary action - including through the courts if needed - to ensure people get a fair deal."" Expedia, one of the leading sites, said: ""Expedia Group continuously aims to deliver attractive travel options at affordable prices in transparent, clear and easy to understand ways, so that our customers can make informed travel choices. Expedia will continue to engage with the CMA on these consumer matters, as it continues its inquiries in the travel sector."" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality which represents hoteliers, welcomed the CMA's announcement saying it would bring ""reassurance"" for customers. She added that the inquiry should lead to a wider review of the charges that these booking sites levied on hotels, which led to higher prices for holidaymakers. ""This is another example of digital businesses stealing an unfair lead on honest, regulated operators whose first concern is to deliver good service to their customers,"" she said. Lavinia Dagostine has run a nine-room guest house in Dorset for 11 years and said that these sites could make life difficult for traditional providers. She relies on her own website and return guests before sending vacancies to a booking site. ""It means that smaller B&Bs get left out because they can't afford to pay commission on top of all their other expenses,"" she said. ""I agree it is easier for the booker but the commissions they charge the hotel or B&B sometimes take away any small profit that can be made, making us have to increase our prices."" The watchdog has ordered the sites, which it has not officially named, to review their practices, and to respond within the next few months. At the end of the review, the sites can either give a legally-binding commitment to change the way they operate, or argue their case that their practices do not break the law. If the CMA disagrees with their arguments, it can take the companies to court, where unlimited fines can be levied. It has also raised various price guarantee claims with the Advertising Standards Authority. Separately, the new EU Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations come into force on Sunday. The changes mean that package holidays consisting of a flight, hotel, car-hire or other tourist services - either bought online for an all-in price or through linked web pages - will get the same protection as packages bought in travel agencies.

"Ticketmaster sold 292 million tickets in 2017 Ticketmaster was warned in April that it had been the victim of a hack attack, digital bank Monzo has claimed. Ticketmaster had previously said it did not know about the breach until June and had then acted quickly to inform ""all relevant authorities"". It has been contacted for comment. But in anarticle,externalpublished on its website, Monzo said it had replaced the bank cards of about 50 of its customers who had, on 6 April, reported fraudulent transactions. And during the subsequent investigation, its financial crime and security team had noticed about 35 of them had used their cards with Ticketmaster in the previous five months. In the following two weeks, Monzo said, it had seen eight more compromised cards, six of which had been used at Ticketmaster. ""Given the pattern that was emerging, we decided to reach out to Ticketmaster directly,"" said Natasha Vernier, head of financial crime at Monzo. ""On Thursday 12 April, members of the Ticketmaster security team visited the Monzo office so we could share the information we had gathered. ""They told us they would investigate internally."" The cause of the breach, which the BBC understands has affected up to 40,000 UK users, appears to be a customer-service chatbot employed by third-party Inbenta Technologies. Over the next week, Monzo had found another nine cards had been used fraudulently and all of them had been used to make Ticketmaster transactions, it said. Later that month, without naming the company, the bank sent out 6,000 replacements cards to customers who had used their cards at Ticketmaster. ""Throughout this period, we were in direct contact with Ticketmaster,"" said Ms Vernier. ""On Thursday 19 April, they told us an internal investigation had found no evidence of a breach and that no other banks were reporting similar patterns. She added she was now ""glad to see that Ticketmaster has shared the information publicly"". ""It's incredibly important that companies always work together to protect customers and we'll always work hard to make sure this is the case,"" she said. Tony Pepper, chief executive office of security company Egress, said: ""There are going to be a few eyebrows raised this morning about this breach and when Ticketmaster discovered it. ""Clearly data was at risk for some time and apparently Ticketmaster had been alerted to the issue. ""It is going to be interesting to see how the ICO [Information Commissioner's Office] reacts when they get to the bottom of this, given the emphasis now placed on data breach reporting and reflected in the changes made under the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation].""

The search was launched in August 2017 when CCTV footage was released of a bus driver swerving to avoid the woman on Putney Bridge, south west London. Officers looked at more than 50 suspects and arrested three men, who were all released without charge. The Met Police said all lines of enquiry had now been ""exhausted"". The 33-year-old victim was fortunate to escape serious injury in the incident which took place on 5 May 2017, three months before film of it was released. Officers described the suspect as a white man, aged in his 30s, with brown eyes and short brown hair. The man ran the other way across the bridge about 15 minutes later and the victim attempted to speak to him, but ""he did not acknowledge her"", detectives said.

"Oil giant BP is buying the UK's largest electric charging network, Chargemaster, for Â£130m. BP runs 1,200 petrol forecourts, but said earlier this year it expected renewable energy to be the fastest-growing fuel source. It said the number of electric vehicles in the UK is set to grow from 135,000 at present to 12 million by 2040. The move echoes one made last year by rival Shell, which bought car charging company NewMotion. All leading car manufacturers are moving into electric vehicle production. Volkswagen, the world's biggest carmaker, has said it will offer an electric version of all its 300 models by 2030. Chargemaster, which will be rebranded BP Chargemaster, currently has 6,500 charging points and also sells electric vehicle charging points for home use. BP said the acquisition was an important move,externaltowards the company becoming the leading provider of energy to low carbon vehicles. By Theo Leggett, business correspondent For a global giant like BP, Â£130m is small change. But the acquisition of Chargemaster could turn out to be lucrative. The logic is simple. Electric cars aren't yet a very common sight - but they're expected to become much more so. BP itself thinks there will be 12 million on UK roads by 2040. They'll need access to chargers. Meanwhile, BP has a network of 1,200 service stations - and those service stations are also retail outlets. If a third of drivers no longer need to visit them, they'll become a lot less profitable. That's why BP says a major goal of the deal is to step up the deployment of fast and ultra-fast chargers on UK forecourts. It will give those millions of drivers a reason to keep on visiting - and help keep the tills ticking over. David Nichols, a spokesman for BP, told the BBC: ""We have no doubt that the electric vehicle market is growing and will become a significant part of the transport sector in future. ""Chargemaster is a leader in the UK market. We want to learn from them, and eventually, yes, grow the business worldwide."" It said one of its goals was to speed up charging capability to enable chargers capable of delivering 100 miles of range within 10 minutes. Chargemaster, which was founded in 2008, runs POLAR, the largest public charging network in the UK. It has more than 40,000 customers, some of whom pay by monthly subscription.

"The government department that runs energy policy has offices in highly energy inefficient buildings, BBC Freedom of Information requests show. Four of the eleven offices leased by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) received the lowest G rating. The energy display ratings are used to measure the energy performance of public buildings. The department said it had made progress in cutting emissions. The display energy certificates show 10 Victoria Street, in Westminster, which the department leases and operates, uses twice the amount of electricity a typical office of that type would do. Energy price cap plans revealed Consumers 'paying too much for energy' Its offices at Apex Court in Nottingham, Cheylsemore House South in Coventry, and Buckingham Palace Road in central London, also received the lowest possible G rating on their certificates. Only one building the department leases, The Observatory in Chatham, received an A rating, and the department's headquarters, at 1 Victoria Street, scored below average, with an E rating. Julie Godefroy, head of sustainability development at the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, which produces guidance on how to improve building use, said this energy inefficiency was a missed opportunity to provide leadership on making buildings less wasteful. ""Any building on this (G) scale is being operated inefficiently, meaning there are energy and carbon emissions that could be avoided, and costs savings missed for us as taxpayers,"" she said. Julie Godefroy says the poor ratings are a missed opportunity for leadership by BEIS Sian Berry, Green Party London Assembly member, said: ""An energy department that can't be bothered to improve the awful energy rating for their London offices shows a complete indifference to what's happening in their own back yard. ""We shouldn't really be surprised to see the 'green' department being so careless when the same government is also making climate-wrecking decisions on green energy projects, road building, fracking and Heathrow."" Last October, Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark put plans to increase energy efficiency in homes and businesses at the heart of hisClean Growth Strategy,externalto curb carbon dioxide emissions. A spokesperson for his department said: ""BEIS exceeded its target to reduce emissions by 40% by 2019/20 three years early. We achieved 51% reduction in emissions in 2016/17, and made Â£104m in savings across government in the last financial year through efficiency measures and streamlining of the estate."" They also said that at 10 Victoria Street the department was installing double glazing  and replacing the boiler system with a modern energy efficient one. 10 Victoria Street got the worst possible rating LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Transport pollution is rising Young people will be left to pick up the bill for climate change because politicians are dodging the issue, a UK report warns. The government must act faster to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from road traffic, homes and farming, the Committee on Climate Change says. Without action, the coming generation will have to pay much more to curb emissions in a heating world. The government says it is committed to being a world leader on climate change. It will introduce its low-carbon transport plan soon. The advisers are ""acutely concerned"" at the UK's lack of progress in cutting the carbon emissions overheating the planet. The committee says the UK made a good start with the power industry but emissions cuts have effectively stalled in the past five years. Members say it will be much cheaper, for instance, to begin a steady changeover to electric cars now than to have to rush the technology in years to come. What is climate change? Climate change 'hurts women more' 2017: 'Warmest year without El NiÃ±o' A manifesto to save Planet Earth (and ourselves) Power:The electricity industry is a star performer. Emissions from power generation have more than halved (-55%) Waste:Emissions from waste are down by almost a quarter (-23%) Farming:Emissions from farming have barely dropped (-3%) Transport:The villain is transport, where emissions have actually gone up (+4%) Since 2012, 75% of emissions cuts have come from power. Coal power stations in the UK arebeing phased out- they are the worst polluters. Renewables have proved far cheaper than anyone thought. The government has banned subsidies for onshore wind - even though analysts say that will add to energy bills. In addition, communities have been given the say as to whether they can go ahead or not. This means that just a few objections are needed to block the progress of wind projects. But the committee says onshore wind and solar will be even cheaper than burning gas for electricity in the 2020s. If it's dumped in a landfill, food and plant matter will rot and create methane, which contributes to climate change. Councils have been asking people to separate food and garden waste from general waste. Now, companies are increasingly trying to capture methane from food waste and harness it to make useful biogas. But after a good start, emissions cuts are stalling. Emissions from transport have bucked the trend and gone up Making fertiliser emits greenhouse gases. And so does spreading animal dung on the fields to help crops grow. Farm machines pollute. And cutting wood for farms is problematic for the climate too, because trees soak up CO2. The government says it will help more farmers combat climate change. People are buying bigger and heavier cars. The government removed the fuel duty incentive for low-pollution cars, so now a Porsche can be taxed at the same rate as a clean Toyota Prius. What is more, concern about pollution from diesels has shifted some drivers to petrol cars. They create less pollution but more greenhouse gases. The committee says sales of electric cars and installation of charging points are both too slow. Getting people to insulate their homes to save wasting heat is a big challenge. The committee says insulation rates in homes are 95% lower because of grants cuts. It wants ministers to insist that all new homes are zero-carbon. We also have to start experiments on a large scale with actually capturing the CO2 gas from industry and storing it in rocks underground, it says. The committee says part of the problem is that responsibility for cutting emissions is split between various government departments. They don't all see tackling climate change as a key priority. But a spokesperson for the UK government said: ""We've proven ourselves to be world-leaders in tackling climate change - cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country and producing record levels of low carbon energy. ""We're confident of cutting emissions across the wider economy to meet our carbon budgets while seizing the economic opportunities of clean growth."" People committed to personally tackling climate change can avoid flying and eating meat - two of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases. They maybe walk or cycle instead of taking the car - and they try to insulate their homes or turn the heating down. They recycle too - but that probably helps less with the climate than many people think.

"The splits within the EU have been highlighted by Italy's refusal to accept migrants carried by NGO rescue boats in the Mediterranean Hardened Eurosceptics might love to think the EU's in trouble, but as leaders gather in Brussels for their summer summit on Thursday, dedicated Europhiles are also sounding the alarm. ""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size."" It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread. Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden. Read more from Katya:EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics? Migration slashes the EU from east to west too. Newer member states from Central and Eastern Europe never signed up to the post World War Two ""all for one and one for all"" vision. When it comes to EU solidarity and burden-sharing, they are fervent non-believers. They determinedly turn their backs when Italy and Germany plead for migrant quotas. The number of migrants arriving illegally in Europe may be down, but so is voter tolerance of the problem. The rise and rise across the EU of tough-on-migration politicians has emboldened hardliners such as Hungary's Victor Orban and Austria's Sebastian Kurz, who takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU this Sunday and will push migration as a top priority. ""Keep Them Out"" is Austria's main aim and while Europe's (still) most influential leader, Angela Merkel, arrives in Brussels on Thursday pushing - and praying - for compromise on burden-sharing and prevention, the number of EU leaders pushing single-mindedly on the migrant deterrence button is growing. Which brings me to the next layer of European splits provoked by migration: within national governments as well as between countries. Germany is the most dramatic example. UK told 'little time left' for Brexit deal Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migration mutiny Can the EU reach a new deal on migrants? Mrs Merkel has clearly been weakened at home by her previous open-door migrant policy. Formerly viewed as politically untouchable, the German chancellor has now been given an ultimatum by her own interior minister. ""By the end of this Brussels summit, you need to come home with a workable pan-European solution to stop irregular migrants bleeding into Germany,"" Horst Seehofer has threatened her. ""Or I will unilaterally slam Germany's borders shut."" The Austrian government told me this week it would then immediately follow suit, causing a border-closing domino effect across Europe - with a seismic impact on the EU's prize political and economic project: the open-border Schengen agreement. What a blow for Brussels and nightmare for Europe's export-king Germany that would be. Of course we're not there yet. In true European Union style, once gathered round a table here in Brussels, there will undoubtedly be emphasis on what unites rather than divides member countries. On migration, EU leaders will easily agree to beef up their Frontex border guard. This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? There's also growing convergence around the idea of setting up so-called disembarkation centres outside the EU to identify economic migrants, who in theory could be sent home. Those with a right to asylum or refugee status could then be given safe and legal passage to Europe. And there's much talk of closer co-operation (read: money) with migrant countries of origin and the transit countries (read: Libya and its coastguard) that migrants cross to make their way to people smuggler boats. But these ideas are easier to formulate than to carry out. You would need a lot of EU border guards to truly patrol southern Europe's thousands of miles of open coastline. You would need permission from African countries such as Niger and Chad to set up processing centres, for example. So far that's a distant goal. In the meantime, there is no whiff of EU agreement over what to do with migrants who do reach Europe. Which brings us back to the threat to Schengen. Italy's populist Interior Minister Matteo Salvini believes migrant reception centres should be set up in Niger, Mali, Chad and Sudan Gloomy German government sources told me they gave the project a three out of 10 chance of survival thanks to the increasingly nationalistic nature of many European governments. ""And if Schengen does fail,"" they predict, ""that would be the beginning of the end of the European Union."" It's too early really to herald the demise of the EU or even the end of Mrs Merkel's career in government as a result of this very political migrant crisis in Europe. But, as EU summit host Donald Tusk said to EU leaders on the eve of their arrival: ""The stakes are very high. And time is short."" EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?

"This video can not be played Firefighters working on the moorland face ""really difficult"" conditions, an officer says Soldiers helping fight a moorland fire in Greater Manchester that could rage ""for weeks"" will remain in the area for a further 48 hours to aid fire crews. About 100 troops from the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, were sent from their barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire, overnight. The blaze is currently under control but could flare up at any time, the fire service said. Stalybridge MP Jonathan Reynolds praised the community's ""Blitz spirit"". Military assistance was requested to help battle the blaze near Saddleworth Moor which has spread across seven square miles, in six different areas. The soldiers arrived to help tackle the wildfire near Saddleworth Moor Soldiers from 4th Battalion Royal Regiment Scotland arrived overnight Soldiers joined more than 100 firefighters to support the effort by managing water lines and assisting in fire beating on moorland above Stalybridge. While shops and local residents have teamed up to help keep emergency service staff fed and watered. A fish and chip shop owner has been offering free meals to firefighters and the military and donations of drinks and food parcels are being collected at Stalybridge Fire Station. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) has faced many hurdles in trying to quell the blaze that has raged for days including frequent changes in wind direction, the heavy concentration of flammable peat in the ground and the tinder-dry foliage which has baked in searing temperatures. It said the soldiers' help would allow the service to deal with other emergency calls, including supporting Lancashire colleagues at anothermoorland blaze at Winter Hillnear Rivington.

Owen Jones has been co-ordinating the relief effort from Stalybridge Fire Station At the scene, Tom Mullen, BBC News Dozens of people, shops, supermarkets and local businesses have been contributing supplies to help feed the firefighters and military tackling the fire near Saddleworth Moor. GMFRS station manger Owen Jones has been tasked with co-ordinating the relief effort from Stalybridge Fire Station, where a huge pile of drinks, cakes and other snacks and supplies have been left - ready to be ferried up the hills. Mr Jones said about 50 people had called at the station today alone, including supermarkets Tesco and Morrisons, local schoolchildren and residents. Tameside Council has also contributed several 4x4 drivers to help take the supplies to the firefighters battling the flames, alongside volunteers from the fire service and the Prince's Trust. Mr Jones said: ""Working in these conditions is tough. The heat is encouraging the fire to burn, but it's also making the task of our firefighters more arduous. ""There's very little cover or shade or respite. We've got gazebos and shaded areas but it's still been an essential task to get supplies up there to them. ""The response from people wanting to help has been incredibly heart warming. From 7:30 this morning it hasn't stopped. It got to the point where I've had to ask people to go round the back to make room. ""The response from the schoolchildren has been especially nice to see as the schools are closed. They've made handmade cards for the firefighters, cakes, gifts, all sorts. ""I've been running round like a madman. It's been extremely disruptive and scary for the local residents but the community cohesion has been great to see."" Tony Hunter, assistant chief fire officer for the service, said there have been ""significant improvements"" but added an ""air of caution as we thought we had a similar situation yesterday"". He said if it does change direction it could add fuel to the fire. ""The fire is contained at the moment, but we only need a change of wind direction to see the fire increase. We are working hard to keep on top of the blaze."" He added: ""Our main action is to protect to the left-hand side to stop it spreading towards the residents, and to the right-hand side to make sure it doesn't go... into unburnt material."" Assistant chief fire officer for GMFRS says the fire was ""contained at the moment"" Resident Peter Fenton said he had been impressed with the way the community of Carrbrook, which had been evacuated on Tuesday, had come together in the wake of the fire. ""Schools are closed but the schoolchildren have been keeping busy handing out supplies to the police and firefighters,"" he said. Moorland fire in pictures How do you tackle a moorland blaze? ""Shops have been handing out water too, and I heard a supermarket sent up a whole stack of stuff."" Janine East, owner of Mill Brook fish and chip shop in Stalybridge, said she ""wanted to do her bit"" as she knows what a ""huge task"" they have. ""I know what it's like up on the moors and what the terrain's like. It's incredibly steep."" A panoramic view showed the extent of the smoke on Wednesday evening Evidence the fire was still burning could be seen as dawn broke on Thursday in Carrbrook Fire engines park up on the moor as firefighters continue tackling the blaze An investigation is set to be launched into the fire but Mr Hunter said: ""We can see this being prolonged for days if not weeks, particularly with the fact that the wind has drawn the fires towards the residential but actually away from the centre of the moor."" He said what was needed most was ""a significant downpour of rain"" - but none has been forecast. Mr Hunter said: ""Over the course of the fire it goes further and further down into the peat and once its down there, it gets very difficult without liquid to put the fire out unless you have a digger. ""We can't dig a square mile of moorland up.""

Greater Manchester Police deployed a helicopter to assess the scene and United Utilities provided a helicopter to drop water on to remote areas. Having started on Sunday the blaze was initially brought under control but reignited on Monday and has continued throughout the hot and dry weather this week. About 150 people were forced to leave their homes in the village of Carrbrook on Tuesday evening as the fire encroached. The majority had returned by Wednesday afternoon. Community support officers patrolled the village of Carrbrook Dr Richard Bircher said fellow GPs had opened late to meet the extra demand An investigation is set to be launched into the cause of the fire. Dr Richard Bircher, of Lockside Medical Centre in Stalybridge, said he had treated nine ""normally fit and healthy"" people for chest complaints and breathing difficulties. ""Chest complaints can develop for a number of reasons but I think it's safe to assume the smoke is the main factor behind the increase,"" he said. Dr Bircher said he expected the number of people seeking treatment would continue to rise as smoke lingered, particularly among older people, but added there had been no increase in hospital admissions. He praised the response of Tameside's social care services and fellow GPs who had opened late to meet the extra demand for appointments and advised anybody exposed to smoke to continue to wear dust masks and seek advice if they developed breathing problems.

"The art school and nearby O2 building were gutted by fire on 15 June Parts of the Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh building are to be dismantled after it was ravaged by fire earlier this month. Glasgow City Council said surveys had revealed substantial movement in the building's walls and that a sudden collapse of parts of it was likely. Work to partially dismantle sections of the building is expected to begin as a ""matter of urgency"". The building, which was completed in 1909,was gutted by fire on 15 June. The city council said remote surveys and close-in surveys from baskets suspended from cranes above the charred remains of the structure had revealed more substantial movement in its walls than previously thought. Is this Game Over for the Mack? Shock at Glasgow School of Art fire The other buildings lost to the flames In all its glory: Glasgow School of Art before the fire They have concluded that a sudden collapse of parts of the building was likely, rather than possible. The statement said: ""There is now a requirement to at least partially dismantle sections of the building as a matter of urgency. This video can not be played Fire engulfed the Glasgow School of Art on 15 June ""However, the dangerous nature of the site - which includes the Mackintosh building and the O2 ABC - is such that it will take around two days to devise a methodology for taking down the south facade, which is the most seriously affected part of the building. ""The west gable of the Mackintosh building has continued to deteriorate and the east gable has continued to move outwards. ""It is not possible at this time to say exactly when the work will begin, but it will be as soon as possible."" The council has also warned about the risk of falling bricks or stonework on Sauchiehall Street. Raymond Barlow, the authority's head of building control, said: ""With each passing day, a sudden collapse becomes more likely. ""It has become urgent that we take down the south facade. As the process begins, it will be likely that the other walls will also need to be reduced. The council is warning about the dangers of falling bricks or stonework from the site The fire was the second blaze to engulf the Mackintosh building in the past four years ""We do not know what effect this will have on the rest of the building, so I have to be clear this site remains dangerous and is becoming more dangerous. ""It is particularly important that people observe the cordon which remains in place."" The fire was the second blaze in four years at the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building. It was still undergoing renovations from the 2014 fire when it was engulfed by flames. The renovated Mackintosh library had been due to reopen next year. In a statement, Glasgow School of Art acknowledged that damage to the building was ""significantly greater than had initially been anticipated"". However, it said the aim of the work would be to achieve structural stability. The fire has brought hardship to businesses within the exclusion zone The statement said: ""The areas of significant concern are the east elevation, the west elevation and sections of the south elevation. ""The plan of works will involve [site contractor] Reigart undertaking extensive down-takings and potential structural bracing. ""Due to the condition of the Mackintosh building, this work will be undertaken in a highly-controlled way to minimise any potential risk of failure and be sufficient to achieve structural stability of the Mackintosh building."" Meanwhile, the first minister has said that residents and businesses affected by the fire will receive compensation. Nicola Sturgeon said a hardship and relief fund would be made available to those who had been displaced. This video can not be played Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art, taken before the 2014 fire Traders on Sauchiehall Street have warned that the fire could spell the end for some businesses, while some residents living within the exclusion zone around the site have been unable to return home since 15 June. Speaking during First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The Scottish government will make Â£1,500 available to each household, which will be match-funded by the council to make a total of Â£3,000 for each household. ""In addition, we will confirm increases in support for affected businesses, increasing the amount that the Scottish government contributes towards business rates from 75% to 95%.""

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? A key European Union summit may end without a deal to resolve a row over ways to tackle irregular migration. Italy - the entry point of thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - says it will veto a joint statement over the entire agenda if no solution is found. Leaders were talking into the early hours of Friday to find a compromise. Italy wants other countries to share the burden. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the issue could be a defining moment for the EU. Mrs Merkel is under pressure to come up with a deal to prevent new arrivals. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, has given her until this weekend. Otherwise he has said he will start turning away migrants from the border in his home state. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The migrant flows also include refugees fleeing the Syrian war and other conflicts, urgently seeking asylum. It is not a crisis on the scale of 2015, when thousands were coming ashore daily on the Greek islands. The European Council - the EU's strategic leadership - says the numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their peak in October 2015. Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migrant mutiny The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? But this month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently the German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight. The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take a share of the migrants on board. Malta said that Norway had now also agreed to take some migrants from the Lifeline. The Dublin principle - that asylum seekers should stay in the country where they enter the EU - has broken down. Italy and Greece, who receive the most, are demanding that their neighbours share the burden. This video can not be played Belgian PM gives UK PM his team's shirt ahead of World Cup clash on Thursday evening There was a lighter note, as the summit got under way in Brussels. Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel presented UK Prime Minister Theresa May with a Belgian football shirt ahead of the two countries' World Cup clash. It bore the number of Belgian star Eden Hazard. By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor Hardened Eurosceptics might love to think the EU's in trouble, but as leaders gather in Brussels for their summer summit on Thursday, dedicated Europhiles are also sounding the alarm. ""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size."" It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread. Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden. Read more from Katya Italy's new populist government has made getting an EU-wide deal on immigration and asylum a priority. The issue played a major role in the Italian election, catapulting nationalist League leader Matteo Salvini into power. But it is a powerful election issue EU-wide. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? How do EU governments see the summit? Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Brexit talks to move faster, May says Austria's right-wing government takes over the EU's rotating presidency next month and it has a hardline stance on irregular migrants. So do its Visegrad Group neighbours: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. That group rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. Italy is the main destination for migrants rescued from overloaded boats off Libya Much of the attention is on the German chancellor, because her interior minister has threatened to start blocking migrants at the border if they have already registered in another EU country. Without his party, the CSU, she would lose her parliamentary majority. European Council President Donald Tusk told the leaders in his pre-summit letter""the stakes are very high and time is short"",external. He warned that the EU's problems with migration policy were giving ammunition to populists, who ""offer simple answers to the most complicated questions"". 1. 'Regional disembarkation platforms' This is an Austrian-Danish proposal, aimed at breaking the business model of the people-smuggling gangs. In the draft summit conclusions, it is seen as a way to speed up the processing of asylum claims and stopping illegal economic migrants. Pros? They could deter migrants from putting to sea in overloaded boats. Gangs might then be less able to profit from migrants' desperation. Cons? Getting North African countries to host such centres could be very difficult. Morocco again on Thursday rejected the idea. Close co-ordination with UN agencies will be needed, to prevent them becoming crowded, dangerous camps. Greece says emergency action is necessary to ""decongest"" some of its islands 2. Beefing up EU border agency Frontex The European Commission says this would make it a genuine border police force.The force is to be boosted from the current 1,300 (with 1,500 in reserve) to 10,000 by 2027,external. Pros? The force could intervene more rapidly, nipping migrant emergencies in the bud, preventing any repetition of the 2015 chaos. Cons? Solidarity has been lacking among the 28 member states. Frontex still lacks some important resources that were pledged. EU police risk usurping the role of national border guards - a sensitive issue. This video can not be played Migrant crisis: EU border force Frontex explained 3. More co-operation with transit and migrants' home countries This would allow more failed asylum seekers to be sent back; the ""return"" rate currently is just 36.6%, the Commission says. Pros? There has been effective EU co-operation with Turkey: a 2016 deal led to a drastic drop in migrants taking the Balkan route. The EU naval mission off Libya works closely with the Libyan coastguard to stop people-smuggling. Cons? Conditions are dire in Libyan migrant holding centres. Turkey is still short of â¬3bn (Â£2.6bn; $3.5bn), pledged by the EU for Syrian refugees. Tackling poverty in Africa, from which many migrants are fleeing, requires generous EU funding. There is an EU Trust Fund for Africa, but it is short of â¬1.2bn in pledged funds. Malta allows migrant ship to dock The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers?

"The routine is familiar, the expectations low. There is no expectation that the prime minister will arrive in Brussels with a magic key to unlock the Brexit process. But Theresa May heads to the Belgian capital later with a promise at least that within 10 days she will have been able to persuade her cabinet to agree more of the UK's vision for life outside the EU. And that she will be able to put a detailed and ambitious vision into words in a White Paper to be published not long after - the UK's blueprint of how trade, customs, agriculture, and so many other areas might work after Brexit. That, she hopes, in mid-July will usher in a genuine discussion about the long-term relationship between the country and the rest of the continent. This summit therefore is not about technical negotiations, but about promises and persuasion, for the prime minister to convey that she is in charge of her agenda. Difficult - when public cabinet skirmishes are increasingly the norm, and because Brexit is rather a sideshow at this leaders' get-together. The EU will warn that her plans must be realistic - sources suggest that Mrs May is yet to own up fully to the logic that by choosing to leave, the UK can never have a deal that offers as much as the status quo. So what? You might wonder, we have been here many times before. Mrs May en route to Brussels. The European Union demanding Britain give more details of its approach. The prime minister arriving without a huge deal that's new to offer. Sources suggesting that the negotiating teams have been talking at, rather than to, each other constructively, the process frustrated until their political masters are willing to change the game. But remember time is not just short, it is running out. This is the last summit before the meeting of EU leaders that is scheduled to sign off the final deal. With the summer break almost upon us, that means there are precious few full working weeks to get this done. Of course, as we've discussed many times, political deals are often done at the very last moment. But this is unparalleled in recent time in its complexity and complications. The government has certainly never wanted to leave this until the last minute, but the fundamental disagreements in the cabinet have made it so hard to get even this far.

"This video can not be played ""We have a very excellent list... of tremendous people"" A political battle is brewing over the replacement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement from the US top court. Mr Kennedy, 81, retires on 31 July, giving President Donald Trump a chance to cement a conservative majority on the high court for decades to come. Democrats say the Republican-controlled Congress should wait until after mid-term elections to confirm a successor. But the Republican Senate leader says a vote will take place by the autumn. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has already cancelled a scheduled recess for the upper chamber in August, suggested Mr Kennedy's replacement would be confirmed before November's mid-term elections. ""The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on President Trump's nominee to fill this vacancy,"" he said on Wednesday. His comments came after President Trump said the process to find a replacement would ""begin immediately"". Mr Kennedy made the announcement earlier on Wednesday, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family after 30 years on the top court. Analysis: Why a fight over US abortion law looms Why is the US Supreme Court so important? Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court Although he was a conservative justice, Mr Kennedy sided with liberals on certain key votes, including abortion and gay marriage. Mr Kennedy has sided with liberals on many decisions The Senate, which votes to confirm Mr Trump's nominee, is currently controlled by Republicans with a slim 51-seat majority. But that could change after mid-term elections in November. Speaking at the rally in Fargo, North Dakota on Wednesday evening, Mr Trump warned his supporters that Democrats would ""rewrite the Constitution any way they want"" unless Republicans could quickly confirm a conservative justice. ""We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years,"" he said of Mr Kennedy's successor. The president has promised to draw names from the samelist of 25 conservative candidates,externalfrom which he picked Justice Neil Gorsuch in February last year. When asked by reporters on Wednesday if he would wait until after the mid-term elections to nominate a successor, Mr Trump said: ""I think you want to go as quickly as possible"",the Associated Press reported,external. The long-simmering tensions over Supreme Court picks became a political flash point in 2016 when the Republicans successfully blocked President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to replace the late Justice Anthony Scalia. At the time, Republicans said it was unfair to confirm a judge during an election year. Democrats are now pointing to that argument in an effort to halt the confirmation of Justice Kennedy's replacement. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Schumer in a televised speech on the floor of the Senate called for delaying a confirmation vote until after the mid-terms, adding that ""anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy"" from Republicans.

The Supreme Court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. Rather than serving fixed terms, the justices serve for life unless they decide to retire. This makes their appointments particularly significant. This week the courtupheld Mr Trump's travel banwhich covers people from several Muslim-majority countries, in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. Earlier this monthit ruled in favour of a baker in Coloradowho refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. ""Hopefully we are going to pick somebody who will be as outstanding,"" Mr Trump told reporters at the White House shortly after Justice Kennedy's retirement was announced. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Twitter that the president would nominate ""a strong conservative, in the tradition of the late Justice Scalia"" who would uphold the ""God-given liberties"" of the constitution.

Top US court deals blow to public unions Not best of times in US, says top justice Mr Kennedy, who is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court, earned a reputation as a swing vote conservative who supported liberal arguments on key decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. As a result, news of his retirement has raised fears among pro-choice groups that access to legal abortions in several states could be under threat. Mr Trump, during his presidential campaign, vowed to attempt to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision legalising abortion throughout the US. ""If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that is really what will happen,"" Mr Trump said during an October 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton. Anti-abortion activists say Justice Kennedy's retirement is a ""pivotal moment"" Mr Kennedy, who was raised in California, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and began his term in 1988. He voted conservative on issues of campaign finance, voting rights and gun rights. Mr Kennedy penned the Supreme Court's first major gay-rights decision,externalin 1996, protecting LGBT Americans from discrimination. In 2015, he authored the landmark opinion which gave LGBT citizens the right to marry, writing: ""They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right."" As a justice, he routinely favoured personal liberty and the limiting of federal power. Mr Trump said Mr Kennedy had ""displayed great vision"" and ""tremendous heart"". Mr Kennedy (second from left in front row) is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member court The White House also released a statement thanking Mr Kennedy for his 30 years of service as a ""tireless voice for individual rights"". ""His words have left an indelible mark not only on this generation, but on the fabric of American history."" From the list of 25 judges that Mr Trump has said he would draw from, US media report several front runners. Most candidates are appointees of President George W Bush, and only one of the supposed top-picks is a woman. Brett Kavanaugh, who is at the top of most lists, is Washington, DC appeals court judge and was a former clerk to Mr Kennedy. He represented Mr Bush during the Florida vote recount in 2000 that won Mr Bush the presidential election. But the American Bar Association recently downgraded his qualifications based on a lack of experience and concerns over partisan bias. Amul Thapar, a Kentucky judge handpicked by Mr McConnell and Amy Comey Barrett, a former professor at Catholic university Notre Dame, are other likely nominees.

Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court Although he was a conservative justice, Mr Kennedy sided with liberals on certain key votes, including abortion and gay marriage. Mr Kennedy has sided with liberals on many decisions The Senate, which votes to confirm Mr Trump's nominee, is currently controlled by Republicans with a slim 51-seat majority. But that could change after mid-term elections in November. Speaking at the rally in Fargo, North Dakota on Wednesday evening, Mr Trump warned his supporters that Democrats would ""rewrite the Constitution any way they want"" unless Republicans could quickly confirm a conservative justice. ""We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years,"" he said of Mr Kennedy's successor. The president has promised to draw names from the samelist of 25 conservative candidates,externalfrom which he picked Justice Neil Gorsuch in February last year. When asked by reporters on Wednesday if he would wait until after the mid-term elections to nominate a successor, Mr Trump said: ""I think you want to go as quickly as possible"",the Associated Press reported,external. The long-simmering tensions over Supreme Court picks became a political flash point in 2016 when the Republicans successfully blocked President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to replace the late Justice Anthony Scalia. At the time, Republicans said it was unfair to confirm a judge during an election year. Democrats are now pointing to that argument in an effort to halt the confirmation of Justice Kennedy's replacement. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Schumer in a televised speech on the floor of the Senate called for delaying a confirmation vote until after the mid-terms, adding that ""anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy"" from Republicans.

The Supreme Court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. Rather than serving fixed terms, the justices serve for life unless they decide to retire. This makes their appointments particularly significant. This week the courtupheld Mr Trump's travel banwhich covers people from several Muslim-majority countries, in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. Earlier this monthit ruled in favour of a baker in Coloradowho refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. ""Hopefully we are going to pick somebody who will be as outstanding,"" Mr Trump told reporters at the White House shortly after Justice Kennedy's retirement was announced. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Twitter that the president would nominate ""a strong conservative, in the tradition of the late Justice Scalia"" who would uphold the ""God-given liberties"" of the constitution.

Top US court deals blow to public unions Not best of times in US, says top justice Mr Kennedy, who is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court, earned a reputation as a swing vote conservative who supported liberal arguments on key decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. As a result, news of his retirement has raised fears among pro-choice groups that access to legal abortions in several states could be under threat. Mr Trump, during his presidential campaign, vowed to attempt to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision legalising abortion throughout the US. ""If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that is really what will happen,"" Mr Trump said during an October 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton. Anti-abortion activists say Justice Kennedy's retirement is a ""pivotal moment"" Mr Kennedy, who was raised in California, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and began his term in 1988. He voted conservative on issues of campaign finance, voting rights and gun rights. Mr Kennedy penned the Supreme Court's first major gay-rights decision,externalin 1996, protecting LGBT Americans from discrimination. In 2015, he authored the landmark opinion which gave LGBT citizens the right to marry, writing: ""They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right."" As a justice, he routinely favoured personal liberty and the limiting of federal power. Mr Trump said Mr Kennedy had ""displayed great vision"" and ""tremendous heart"". Mr Kennedy (second from left in front row) is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member court The White House also released a statement thanking Mr Kennedy for his 30 years of service as a ""tireless voice for individual rights"". ""His words have left an indelible mark not only on this generation, but on the fabric of American history."" From the list of 25 judges that Mr Trump has said he would draw from, US media report several front runners. Most candidates are appointees of President George W Bush, and only one of the supposed top-picks is a woman. Brett Kavanaugh, who is at the top of most lists, is Washington, DC appeals court judge and was a former clerk to Mr Kennedy. He represented Mr Bush during the Florida vote recount in 2000 that won Mr Bush the presidential election. But the American Bar Association recently downgraded his qualifications based on a lack of experience and concerns over partisan bias. Amul Thapar, a Kentucky judge handpicked by Mr McConnell and Amy Comey Barrett, a former professor at Catholic university Notre Dame, are other likely nominees.

"A revamped drug that can withstand extreme heat and stay effective for 1,000 days could ""revolutionise the ability"" to keep new mothers alive, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. The medicine - known as heat-stable carbetocin - helps prevent sometimes fatal bleeding after women give birth. It could potentially be given to millions of mothers worldwide. Existing drugs can help but hot, humid conditions in many countries may stop the lifesaving medicines working well. About 70,000 women die each year due to severe bleeding after childbirth. These so-called postpartum haemorrhages also increase the risk of their babies dying in the first month of life. To tackle the problem the WHO currently suggests an injection of oxytocin be offered to all women giving birth vaginally. But it is recommended that the medicine is kept between two and eight degrees from the moment it is manufactured to the moment it is used, which WHO experts say is often unachievable in countries with little access to refrigeration and unreliable power supplies . In the trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, almost 30,000 women in 10 countries across the globe were randomly allocated an injection of heat-stable carbetocin or oxytocin immediately after they gave birth. Researchers found that in most cases, both drugs were equally good at preventing excessive bleeding after birth. Experts say this paves the way for the heat-stable carbetocin to be offered to all women giving birth vaginally across as many as 90 countries around the world. And they say it could be particularly useful in areas where the oxytocin is substandard or has been tampered with so there is less of the active ingredient than is desirable. WHO expert Dr Metin Gulmezoglu said the development of a drug that remained in working order in hot and humid conditions was ""very good news for the millions of women who give birth in parts of the world without access to reliable refrigeration"". He added: ""It will help to save many lives of mothers in lower income countries where most deaths occur."" And the WHO's director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""This is a truly encouraging new development that can revolutionise our ability to keep mothers and babies alive."" The drug is already available for other uses and regulators will now look at whether the drug can be approved for wider use. WHO experts say they hope it will be available in some countries as early next year. The trial is a collaboration between the WHO, MSD for Mothers and Ferring Pharmaceuticals.

"Mr Mattis (L) met with President Xi during his three day trip to China China is committed to peace but will not give up ""even one inch"" of territory, President Xi Jinping has said, after talks with visiting US Defence Secretary James Mattis. Tensions between both countries are mounting over trade hostilities and China's increasingly assertive claims to territory in the South China Sea. Mr Mattis is the first Pentagon chief to visit China since 2014. He is on a trip across Asia, meeting several regional US allies. Mr Mattis said his talks with Mr Xi and other officials in Beijing on Wednesday had been ""very, very"" good, adding that the US was assigning a ""high degree of importance to the military relationship"" with China. Mr Xi added that China had peaceful intentions, but reasserted his view that there would be no concessions from China about what it considers to be Chinese territory. ""We cannot lose even one inch of the territory left behind by our ancestors,"" Mr Xi said, according to Chinese state media. ""What is other people's we do not want at all."" Why is the South China Sea contentious? The 'globalisation' of China's military power The US has repeatedly criticised China's movements in the South China Sea, accusing it of intimidating its neighbours and militarising the area, by building up facilities on artificial islands. Several countries have competing claims in the disputed sea, but China claims the largest portion of territory, saying its rights go back centuries. The area is a major shipping route, and a rich fishing ground, and is thought to have abundant oil and gas reserves. The defence secretary's Asia tour comes after ahistoric summit in Singapore which saw US President Donald Trump meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. On Thursday, Mr Mattis travelled on to South Korea and met the country's defence minister Song Young-moo. Mr Mattis sought to reassure Seoul that the US's commitment to the region's security remained ""ironclad"". He said Mr Trump's recent decision to suspend military drills with South Korea would create ""increased opportunity for our diplomats to negotiate, increasing prospects for a peaceful solution on the peninsula"". President Trump's move to cancel the joint military exercises, following his meeting with Mr Kim, was seen as a big concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise. North Korea sees the annual exercises as a rehearsal for invasion, but the government in Seoul maintains they are defensive in nature. What is the South China Sea dispute?

"The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews are permitted to pray The Duke of Cambridge has visited Jerusalem's most sacred religious sites and his great-grandmother's grave on the final day of his official tour. He laid flowers at the tomb of Princess Alice - the Duke of Edinburgh's mother - at the Church of Mary Magdalene. Also on his itinerary was the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, a site that is sacred to Jews and Muslims. He then went to the adjacent Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews are permitted to pray. Prince William's tour ended at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is widely regarded as Christianity's holiest place. Many Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected on the site. It is shared by the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Egyptian Copt and Ethiopian Orthodox denominations of Christianity. It is the final day of the duke's Middle East tour Prince William spoke with Western Wall chief Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch and British chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis during his visit The duke began his morning on the Mount of Olives, taking in a view of Jerusalem's Old City. There, he visited the Church of Mary Magdalene, a Russian Orthodox church and Princess Alice's final resting place. In keeping with Russian Orthodox tradition, Prince William took bread and salt at the entrance of the church. Inside, he laid flowers picked from the garden of Philip Hall - Britain's Consul General in Jerusalem - in the princess's crypt. The duke laid flowers at the tomb of his great-grandmother, Princess Alice Archimandrite Roman, head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, recited a ""prayer for the repose of Princess Alice's soul"" and the duke bowed his head with his eyes closed. After the visit, Father Roman said: ""He said he found it profoundly moving. ""He was certainly moved to learn more about his family history and pay his respects to his great-grandmother in such a holy place."" In pictures: Prince William's Middle East tour William meets Palestinian leader Abbas Prince William meets Eurovision winner Prince in first royal visit to West Bank He said he shared a ""little joke"" with the prince. ""When I was showing him the family tree with the Russian links, I told the prince that I'd read somewhere that someone once asked Prince Philip if he had ever been to Russia, and that he had said: 'They murdered half my bloody family, so maybe I'll go, maybe not'. ""The prince laughed and said: 'He would say that'."" The duke visited the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque at the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif The duke went on to tour the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque at the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif. He was shown around the area by Dr Mustafa Abu Sway, a professor of philosophy and Islamic studies at the city's Al-Quds University, and they spoke about the historical significance of the site. Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif sits on an elevated plaza, which was the site of both of Judaism's ancient temples, above the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Muslims believe it was the site of the Prophet Muhammad's ascent to heaven in the 7th Century. In Judaism it is where Abraham was instructed by God to sacrifice his son as a test of faith. Prince William began his morning on the Mount of Olives, taking in a view of Jerusalem's Old City During his visit to the Western Wall, Prince William - who was wearing a kippah, or religious head-covering, as a mark of respect - approached the landmark and placed a written prayer in a crack in the ancient wall, as is tradition. British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, who accompanied the prince, said: ""Today we experienced a moment of history which will live long in the memory of Jews around the world. ""The Western Wall stands at the epicentre of our faith. To see the future monarch come to pay his respects was a remarkable gesture of friendship and a sign of the duke's regard for the sanctity of Jerusalem."" The Western Wall is a remnant of the retaining wall which surrounded the second Jewish temple at the time of King Herod. By Jonny Dymond, royal correspondent, in Jerusalem Prince William visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem's Old City After four days of criss-crossing Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories, there was time for a little sightseeing. But on an official visit, every step is weighed up against what has come before and what will follow. The three sites Prince William visited each inspire devotion from the three great Abrahamic faiths - Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif has been a flashpoint for protests and conflagration. Today the compound was an oasis of calm and beauty in amidst the bustle of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Western Wall, a remnant from the time of the Second Temple of the Jews was busier. But there is an intensity to the moment you reach the Wall, and close your eyes, and touch the stone, that brings a peace of its own. And inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre the Prince got a taste of some of the swirling chaos that the disputatious church lives and thrives upon. In the space of just a few hours, like so many millions before him, the prince saw and must have felt the religious pull of Jerusalem, the reason that for so many centuries it has been coveted and fought over. Much to mull over on the flight back to Britain. The Duke of Cambridge's five-day visit to Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan began on Sunday. Since arriving on his current leg of the tour, he has met Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and its President Reuven Rivlin, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Princess Alice was married to Prince Andrew of Greece and is remembered for saving the life of a Jewish family in Athens during the Holocaust by sheltering them in her home from the Nazis. This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge's great-grandmother, Princess Alice, helped to save Jews during World War Two On Tuesday, the duke met relatives of the late Rachel Cohen, who was hidden from the Gestapo by his great-grandmother. Princess Alice, who was a nun for many years, was first laid to rest at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, when she died in 1969. But it was at her request that she was interred, in 1988, at the Russian Orthodox church on the Mount of Olives, near her aunt Elizabeth, the Grand Duchess of Russia. On Wednesday, Prince William became the first royal family member to make an official visit to the Palestinian territories in the occupied West Bank. While there he expressed hope for ""lasting peace"" between Israelis and Palestinians.

"Wireless Festival will now host an all-female stage following criticism over the lack of women in the original line-up. Only three out of the 37 acts announced in January were women - Mabel, Cardi B and Lisa Mercedez. Now more than 25 female artists will appear on an alternative stage. ""Shame it's a response to something negative, but it's 100% positive and progressive,"" says DJ Emerald, who is one of the acts performing. Paigey Cakey will perform on the all-female stage Bad Gyal, Paigey Cakey, Lady Leshurr and Barely Legal are among some of the other confirmed artists - the stage's line-up has been curated by Rinse FM. Julie Adenuga will share co-hosting duties with Emerald - who will also DJ on all three days of the festival. The stage's creation has been fuelled by Smirnoff's Equalising Music campaign, a global initiative addressing the gender imbalance in music. Its aim is to double the number of female headliners by 2020 in clubs and festival line-ups. Last year, 80% of festival headliners were male,a BBC study discovered- women made up 26% of UK festival line-ups in 2017. Earlier this year, theWireless line-up was criticisedfor its heavily male-dominated line-up which only featured three women. Lily Allen drew attention to this by sharing a picture of the line-up with all of the male artists removed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I remember seeing the flyer with all the male names taken out, it was so shocking to see that and it really hit home,"" said DJ Emerald. ""Not even the lack of women, but the volume of men. It was just so overpowering."" Despite being booked to play on the stage, Emerald is aware that the all-female stage could be criticised by some. ""I think that this stage we're doing could definitely be viewed as tokenism, but what are we going to do? Not have that stage there and have no women performing at the festival? ""I don't think that's the right thing to do."" Wireless Festival is now in its 13th year Melvin Benn, the director of Festival Republic, told Newsbeat that Wireless originally approached more than 20 female acts, but touring and other commitments meant that they were unable to book them. ""We'd love to see more female acts on the festival roster in the future, however, there is a bigger industry issue at the heart of the debate on line-up diversity, with fewer female acts available at all levels,"" he said. ""One of the ways Festival Republic is working to combat this problem is through our ReBalance campaign, which offers female artists studio time, mentorship, a spot on a festival line-up and much more.""

"Universities are being told to ""dramatically improve"" support for students with mental health issues. The government is announcing it will award a certificate of excellence to institutions which meet new standards of mental health care. It also wants universities to give students an opt-in service for vice chancellors to contact parents. This would mean if students find themselves in a mental health crisis their relatives can be alerted. Earlier this week, the Office for National Statistics published datasuggesting 95 students took their own lives in England and Walesin the 12 months to July last year. Student mental health 'failing a generation' 'The wounds heal but you still have scars' Universities minister Sam Gyimah is to outline the criteria that institutions need to meet to gain the recognition and is urging them to sign on to the ""best practice"" charter. This video can not be played Tears, taking time out and money worries - students talk about mental health It will reward institutions that show they are making student and staff mental health a priority, and have improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Officials will be working with charity Student Minds, Office for Students, Universities UK and the NUS among others to draw up the charter. Mr Gyimah said some universities are doing well, but there are others that ""have a way to go"". ""We want to make sure that every young person at university is better supported in the future, as far as their mental health and wellbeing is concerned,"" he said. Holly Moyse, 24, suffered from depression and an eating disorder which worsened when she started at the University of Derby four years ago. ""Things started to escalate because of it being such a big change in my life,"" she said. ""Moving from Birmingham to Derby... that pressure of making new friends - it just added to it and my health started to deteriorate."" Holly stopped socialising and became obsessive about her weight and exercise. She reached crisis point at the Christmas of her first term and made the university aware. She was offered six counselling sessions and then it was suggested where she could follow up. ""I felt like I couldn't tell my friends, I felt like I couldn't tell my family about it. So I kept going down this slope of poor mental health,"" she said. ""I was feeling quite isolated at the time, mainly because I felt no-one understood what I was going through."" Holly eventually went to A&E, which passed her on to their mental health teams who provided help. She confided in a lecturer who, with her permission, made other staff aware of the extent of her problems. ""At that point my eating disorder was very serious. It was life-threatening. They were quite strong about the fact that I need to have an authorised break,"" she said. ""So when I came back the following September to restart my course again, they were very supportive. ""I got a mentor, who'd support me once a week for about two hours. Just talking about how I was feeling and also if I was struggling with any university work to make sure I kept up with that while recovering."" She will graduate this summer from the University of Derby, which is acting as a research partner to help develop the charter. It has implemented mandatory tailored classes on mental health wellbeing and trained its staff to spot signs of those in mental health crisis. Mr Gyimah confirmed the government is also looking at how universities and NHS services can work more smoothly together to help students. A Universities UK report earlier this year found some studentsrisked ""slipping through the gaps""due to a lack of co-ordination between the NHS and universities. Student Minds CEO Rosie Tressler said: ""Together we will transform the futures of the 2.3 million students that are in higher education, whilst equipping the doctors, teachers and business leaders of the future to continue the positive change in wider society.""

"Transport pollution is rising Young people will be left to pick up the bill for climate change because politicians are dodging the issue, a UK report warns. The government must act faster to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from road traffic, homes and farming, the Committee on Climate Change says. Without action, the coming generation will have to pay much more to curb emissions in a heating world. The government says it is committed to being a world leader on climate change. It will introduce its low-carbon transport plan soon. The advisers are ""acutely concerned"" at the UK's lack of progress in cutting the carbon emissions overheating the planet. The committee says the UK made a good start with the power industry but emissions cuts have effectively stalled in the past five years. Members say it will be much cheaper, for instance, to begin a steady changeover to electric cars now than to have to rush the technology in years to come. What is climate change? Climate change 'hurts women more' 2017: 'Warmest year without El NiÃ±o' A manifesto to save Planet Earth (and ourselves) Power:The electricity industry is a star performer. Emissions from power generation have more than halved (-55%) Waste:Emissions from waste are down by almost a quarter (-23%) Farming:Emissions from farming have barely dropped (-3%) Transport:The villain is transport, where emissions have actually gone up (+4%) Since 2012, 75% of emissions cuts have come from power. Coal power stations in the UK arebeing phased out- they are the worst polluters. Renewables have proved far cheaper than anyone thought. The government has banned subsidies for onshore wind - even though analysts say that will add to energy bills. In addition, communities have been given the say as to whether they can go ahead or not. This means that just a few objections are needed to block the progress of wind projects. But the committee says onshore wind and solar will be even cheaper than burning gas for electricity in the 2020s. If it's dumped in a landfill, food and plant matter will rot and create methane, which contributes to climate change. Councils have been asking people to separate food and garden waste from general waste. Now, companies are increasingly trying to capture methane from food waste and harness it to make useful biogas. But after a good start, emissions cuts are stalling. Emissions from transport have bucked the trend and gone up Making fertiliser emits greenhouse gases. And so does spreading animal dung on the fields to help crops grow. Farm machines pollute. And cutting wood for farms is problematic for the climate too, because trees soak up CO2. The government says it will help more farmers combat climate change. People are buying bigger and heavier cars. The government removed the fuel duty incentive for low-pollution cars, so now a Porsche can be taxed at the same rate as a clean Toyota Prius. What is more, concern about pollution from diesels has shifted some drivers to petrol cars. They create less pollution but more greenhouse gases. The committee says sales of electric cars and installation of charging points are both too slow. Getting people to insulate their homes to save wasting heat is a big challenge. The committee says insulation rates in homes are 95% lower because of grants cuts. It wants ministers to insist that all new homes are zero-carbon. We also have to start experiments on a large scale with actually capturing the CO2 gas from industry and storing it in rocks underground, it says. The committee says part of the problem is that responsibility for cutting emissions is split between various government departments. They don't all see tackling climate change as a key priority. But a spokesperson for the UK government said: ""We've proven ourselves to be world-leaders in tackling climate change - cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country and producing record levels of low carbon energy. ""We're confident of cutting emissions across the wider economy to meet our carbon budgets while seizing the economic opportunities of clean growth."" People committed to personally tackling climate change can avoid flying and eating meat - two of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases. They maybe walk or cycle instead of taking the car - and they try to insulate their homes or turn the heating down. They recycle too - but that probably helps less with the climate than many people think.

"Wireless Festival will now host an all-female stage following criticism over the lack of women in the original line-up. Only three out of the 37 acts announced in January were women - Mabel, Cardi B and Lisa Mercedez. Now more than 25 female artists will appear on an alternative stage. ""Shame it's a response to something negative, but it's 100% positive and progressive,"" says DJ Emerald, who is one of the acts performing. Paigey Cakey will perform on the all-female stage Bad Gyal, Paigey Cakey, Lady Leshurr and Barely Legal are among some of the other confirmed artists - the stage's line-up has been curated by Rinse FM. Julie Adenuga will share co-hosting duties with Emerald - who will also DJ on all three days of the festival. The stage's creation has been fuelled by Smirnoff's Equalising Music campaign, a global initiative addressing the gender imbalance in music. Its aim is to double the number of female headliners by 2020 in clubs and festival line-ups. Last year, 80% of festival headliners were male,a BBC study discovered- women made up 26% of UK festival line-ups in 2017. Earlier this year, theWireless line-up was criticisedfor its heavily male-dominated line-up which only featured three women. Lily Allen drew attention to this by sharing a picture of the line-up with all of the male artists removed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I remember seeing the flyer with all the male names taken out, it was so shocking to see that and it really hit home,"" said DJ Emerald. ""Not even the lack of women, but the volume of men. It was just so overpowering."" Despite being booked to play on the stage, Emerald is aware that the all-female stage could be criticised by some. ""I think that this stage we're doing could definitely be viewed as tokenism, but what are we going to do? Not have that stage there and have no women performing at the festival? ""I don't think that's the right thing to do."" Wireless Festival is now in its 13th year Melvin Benn, the director of Festival Republic, told Newsbeat that Wireless originally approached more than 20 female acts, but touring and other commitments meant that they were unable to book them. ""We'd love to see more female acts on the festival roster in the future, however, there is a bigger industry issue at the heart of the debate on line-up diversity, with fewer female acts available at all levels,"" he said. ""One of the ways Festival Republic is working to combat this problem is through our ReBalance campaign, which offers female artists studio time, mentorship, a spot on a festival line-up and much more.""

"Mr Mattis (L) met with President Xi during his three day trip to China China is committed to peace but will not give up ""even one inch"" of territory, President Xi Jinping has said, after talks with visiting US Defence Secretary James Mattis. Tensions between both countries are mounting over trade hostilities and China's increasingly assertive claims to territory in the South China Sea. Mr Mattis is the first Pentagon chief to visit China since 2014. He is on a trip across Asia, meeting several regional US allies. Mr Mattis said his talks with Mr Xi and other officials in Beijing on Wednesday had been ""very, very"" good, adding that the US was assigning a ""high degree of importance to the military relationship"" with China. Mr Xi added that China had peaceful intentions, but reasserted his view that there would be no concessions from China about what it considers to be Chinese territory. ""We cannot lose even one inch of the territory left behind by our ancestors,"" Mr Xi said, according to Chinese state media. ""What is other people's we do not want at all."" Why is the South China Sea contentious? The 'globalisation' of China's military power The US has repeatedly criticised China's movements in the South China Sea, accusing it of intimidating its neighbours and militarising the area, by building up facilities on artificial islands. Several countries have competing claims in the disputed sea, but China claims the largest portion of territory, saying its rights go back centuries. The area is a major shipping route, and a rich fishing ground, and is thought to have abundant oil and gas reserves. The defence secretary's Asia tour comes after ahistoric summit in Singapore which saw US President Donald Trump meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. On Thursday, Mr Mattis travelled on to South Korea and met the country's defence minister Song Young-moo. Mr Mattis sought to reassure Seoul that the US's commitment to the region's security remained ""ironclad"". He said Mr Trump's recent decision to suspend military drills with South Korea would create ""increased opportunity for our diplomats to negotiate, increasing prospects for a peaceful solution on the peninsula"". President Trump's move to cancel the joint military exercises, following his meeting with Mr Kim, was seen as a big concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise. North Korea sees the annual exercises as a rehearsal for invasion, but the government in Seoul maintains they are defensive in nature. What is the South China Sea dispute? China condemns US over disputed islands US: China is 'intimidating neighbours' Is the US-China trade war back on?

"This video can not be played Fear or opportunity? Liberals and conservatives on what's next for the US Supreme Court Anthony Kennedy was a swing vote on the US Supreme Court, albeit one that frequently tilted to the right. Replacing him with a solidly conservative justice, however, could have a significant impact on US jurisprudence - and politics - for decades to come. Here's a look at some of the most consequential issues. Shortly after Mr Kennedy announced his retirement, Supreme Court analyst Jeffrey Toobin tweeted that ""abortion will be illegal in 20 states in 18 months"" - an indication that he believes Mr Trump's nominee will join a majority in reversing Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision legalising abortion throughout the US. Anti-abortion advocates have been trying to scale back the broad constitutional guarantees of the Roe decision in the decades since, and now - without Mr Kennedy on the court - they could be poised for a breakthrough. Back in 1992, when Mr Kennedy was just a junior justice, the court considered a series of Pennsylvania restrictions on abortion rights in a case, Planned Parenthood v Casey, that could have drastically curtailed what had been established as a constitutional right to abortion. Trump gets chance to reshape Supreme Court How US abortion debate got to this point Trump proposes federal funding curbs Mr Kennedy reportedly initially sided with the more conservative justices but eventually co-wrote a three-justice plurality that upheld the ""essential holding"" of the landmark Roe decision legalising first-trimester abortions throughout the US. Since then, Mr Kennedy has frequently sided with abortion rights advocates in the court, most recently last year, when he joined the court's four liberal justices to strike down a Texas law stringently regulating abortion clinics and the doctors who perform the procedure. This video can not be played The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi It may not be long before the Court considers the next big abortion case, as there is already an Iowa law prohibiting the procedure after a foetal heartbeat is detected - usually around six weeks of pregnancy. The measure is currently on hold pending a legal challenge from abortion rights groups. At the very least, a court without Mr Kennedy could uphold the constitutionality of state-level regulations that make abortion effectively - if not legally - unavailable in a number of states where only a handful of clinics currently operate at the moment. The White House was lit up in rainbow colours after the Supreme Court ruled gay marriage constitutional in June, 2015 Mr Kennedy may be most remembered for his support for cases involving gay rights. He sided with the majority in a 1996 decision striking down a Colorado measure banning city-level anti-gay discrimination ordinances. In 2003, he authored the decision holding that a Texas law that made gay and lesbian sex illegal was unconstitutional. His most famous opinion, however, surely is the 2015 ruling that legalised gay marriage across the US. In Obergfell v Hodges, Mr Kennedy wrote that marriage ""allows two people to find life that could not be found alone"" and that the Constitution grants gay couples right to ""equal dignity in the eyes of the law"". Top court backs baker's gay wedding cake snub Can Trump outlaw gay marriage? The Court's vote was 5 to 4, the narrowest of margins, and while a newly constituted conservative majority on the court may follow precedent and not directly reverse this decision, it could take steps to allow individuals and corporations greater freedom to deny civil rights protections and accommodations to gay persons and married couples by citing religious beliefs. The court also was poised to consider the constitutionality of school bathroom bans for transgender students before the Trump administration reversed an Obama-era guidance prohibiting such bans. The case is back at the lower-court level and could end up in the next few years on the docket of a Supreme Court that looks very different from the one that would have ruled on the matter this term. Capital punishment has been allowed in the US since a Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of the practice in 1976. Mr Kennedy has not questioned that precedent, but he has repeatedly sided with justices who have chipped away at who can be executed and under what circumstances. In 2005 he wrote the majority opinion ruling that capital punishment was an unconstitutional punishment for crimes committed by those under the age of 18. He joined a 2002 opinion prohibiting the execution of those with intellectual disabilities and authored a 2014 majority opinion limiting a state's ability to decide who is and isn't mentally capable. The woman who watched 300 executions in Texas How US death penalty capital changed its mind There has been some speculation that the Supreme Court could be steadily progressing to a point where it could rule that capital punishment in all cases constitutes ""cruel and unusual punishment"" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution. There is a good chance that whoever Mr Trump picks to replace Mr Kennedy will bring this trend to a halt. The ability of public colleges and universities to consider race and ethnicity in an attempt to create a diverse student body has been on shaky grounds for years. Mr Kennedy has opposed any type of school admissions process that gives individuals an advantage in admissions based solely on their race. In 2016, however, he authored a majority opinion, again by one vote, that upheld a University of Texas practice of weighing an applicant's race among a number of factors in a ""holistic review"" of a prospective student's enrolment application. This video can not be played In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision over Michigan's affirmative action policies, the BBC takes a look at American public opinion on the issue. It was an opinion that walked a fine legal line, allowing public universities to craft policies that created a more diverse student body while avoiding quotas and other direct actions. That's a line the other conservative justices have shown no interest in observing. With one more reliable vote in their number, Mr Kennedy's measured ""maybe"" could be replaced by a firm ""no"". The new Supreme Court vacancy is certain to throw petrol on the smouldering flames of anger and resentment that have come to define US politics in the Trump era. Liberal activists are girding for all-out war, although their ability to block the Republican-controlled Senate's ability to confirm the president's nominee is limited. Mid-term congressional elections are less than five months away, and the coming confirmation fight is sure to figure prominently in the campaigns. This video can not be played ""We have a very excellent list... of tremendous people"" Republicans running against Senate Democratic incumbents in Trump-friendly states like West Virginia, Indiana and North Dakota are sure to highlight any moves their opponents make to block the president's choice. Meanwhile, Democrats targeting at-risk Republicans in House of Representatives races could capitalise on increased engagement and energy from liberal voters who view abortion and gay rights at new risk. In 2016 the open court seat ended up helping Mr Trump by spurring evangelical voters and cultural conservatives to stick by their candidate despite his various controversies and missteps. At the time, Republicans were on the defensive - facing the prospect of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia being replaced by a liberal jurist. Now Republicans are on the attack, with the opportunity to cement a conservative court for a generation. Democrats may not be able to do anything to stop it at this point, but flocking to the polls in November may give them some measure of comfort - or revenge.

"This video can not be played ""We have a very excellent list... of tremendous people"" A political battle is brewing over the replacement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement from the US top court. Mr Kennedy, 81, retires on 31 July, giving President Donald Trump a chance to cement a conservative majority on the high court for decades to come. Democrats say the Republican-controlled Congress should wait until after mid-term elections to confirm a successor. But the Republican Senate leader says a vote will take place by the autumn. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has already cancelled a scheduled recess for the upper chamber in August, suggested Mr Kennedy's replacement would be confirmed before November's mid-term elections. ""The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on President Trump's nominee to fill this vacancy,"" he said on Wednesday. His comments came after President Trump said the process to find a replacement would ""begin immediately"". Mr Kennedy made the announcement earlier on Wednesday, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family after 30 years on the top court. Analysis: Why a fight over US abortion law looms Why is the US Supreme Court so important? Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court Although he was a conservative justice, Mr Kennedy sided with liberals on certain key votes, including abortion and gay marriage. Mr Kennedy has sided with liberals on many decisions The Senate, which votes to confirm Mr Trump's nominee, is currently controlled by Republicans with a slim 51-seat majority. But that could change after mid-term elections in November. Speaking at the rally in Fargo, North Dakota on Wednesday evening, Mr Trump warned his supporters that Democrats would ""rewrite the Constitution any way they want"" unless Republicans could quickly confirm a conservative justice. ""We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years,"" he said of Mr Kennedy's successor. The president has promised to draw names from the samelist of 25 conservative candidates,externalfrom which he picked Justice Neil Gorsuch in February last year. When asked by reporters on Wednesday if he would wait until after the mid-term elections to nominate a successor, Mr Trump said: ""I think you want to go as quickly as possible"",the Associated Press reported,external. The long-simmering tensions over Supreme Court picks became a political flash point in 2016 when the Republicans successfully blocked President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to replace the late Justice Anthony Scalia. At the time, Republicans said it was unfair to confirm a judge during an election year. Democrats are now pointing to that argument in an effort to halt the confirmation of Justice Kennedy's replacement. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Schumer in a televised speech on the floor of the Senate called for delaying a confirmation vote until after the mid-terms, adding that ""anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy"" from Republicans.

The Supreme Court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. Rather than serving fixed terms, the justices serve for life unless they decide to retire. This makes their appointments particularly significant. This week the courtupheld Mr Trump's travel banwhich covers people from several Muslim-majority countries, in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. Earlier this monthit ruled in favour of a baker in Coloradowho refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. ""Hopefully we are going to pick somebody who will be as outstanding,"" Mr Trump told reporters at the White House shortly after Justice Kennedy's retirement was announced. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Twitter that the president would nominate ""a strong conservative, in the tradition of the late Justice Scalia"" who would uphold the ""God-given liberties"" of the constitution.

Top US court deals blow to public unions Not best of times in US, says top justice Mr Kennedy, who is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court, earned a reputation as a swing vote conservative who supported liberal arguments on key decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. As a result, news of his retirement has raised fears among pro-choice groups that access to legal abortions in several states could be under threat. Mr Trump, during his presidential campaign, vowed to attempt to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision legalising abortion throughout the US. ""If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that is really what will happen,"" Mr Trump said during an October 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton. Anti-abortion activists say Justice Kennedy's retirement is a ""pivotal moment"" Mr Kennedy, who was raised in California, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and began his term in 1988. He voted conservative on issues of campaign finance, voting rights and gun rights. Mr Kennedy penned the Supreme Court's first major gay-rights decision,externalin 1996, protecting LGBT Americans from discrimination. In 2015, he authored the landmark opinion which gave LGBT citizens the right to marry, writing: ""They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right."" As a justice, he routinely favoured personal liberty and the limiting of federal power. Mr Trump said Mr Kennedy had ""displayed great vision"" and ""tremendous heart"". Mr Kennedy (second from left in front row) is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member court The White House also released a statement thanking Mr Kennedy for his 30 years of service as a ""tireless voice for individual rights"". ""His words have left an indelible mark not only on this generation, but on the fabric of American history."" From the list of 25 judges that Mr Trump has said he would draw from, US media report several front runners. Most candidates are appointees of President George W Bush, and only one of the supposed top-picks is a woman. Brett Kavanaugh, who is at the top of most lists, is Washington, DC appeals court judge and was a former clerk to Mr Kennedy. He represented Mr Bush during the Florida vote recount in 2000 that won Mr Bush the presidential election. But the American Bar Association recently downgraded his qualifications based on a lack of experience and concerns over partisan bias. Amul Thapar, a Kentucky judge handpicked by Mr McConnell and Amy Comey Barrett, a former professor at Catholic university Notre Dame, are other likely nominees.

"Justice Kennedy's retirement hands Mr Trump a second pick on the US Supreme Court US Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is to retire, giving President Donald Trump the chance to cement a conservative majority on the top court. The conservative has sided with liberals on many decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. In his letter to Mr Trump, Justice Kennedy expressed ""profound gratitude"" for having served in the highest court. The 81-year-old judge will retire on 31 July, he said in his letter. He is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court. Analysis: Why a fight over US abortion law looms Why is the US Supreme Court so important? The court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. In recent years, it has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, halted President Barack Obama's immigration orders and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward. Earlier this week it upheld Mr Trump's travel banwhich covers people from several Muslim-majority countries, in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said on Wednesday that a vote on Mr Trump's nominee to replace Justice Kennedy - who earned a reputation as the court's ""swing"" vote - would take place by the autumn. Justice Kennedy has frequently sided with abortion rights advocates in the court and news of his retirement has raised fears among pro-choice groups that access to legal abortions in several states could be under threat. Justice Kennedy said he was retiring because he wanted to spend more time with his family. Justice Kennedy, who was raised in California, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and began his term in 1988. He voted conservative on issues of campaign finance, voting rights and gun rights but was considered a swing vote on key rulings. Justice Kennedy penned the Supreme Court's first major gay-rights decision,externalin 1996, protecting LGBT Americans from discrimination. In 2015, he authored the landmark opinion which gave LGBT citizens the right to marry, writing: ""They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right."" Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court Not best of times in US, says top justice As a justice, he routinely favoured personal liberty and the limiting of federal power. Mr Trump said Justice Kennedy had ""displayed great vision"" and ""tremendous heart"". Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Without Anthony Kennedy, the political centre on the Supreme Court will be firmly on the right. Whoever Donald Trump nominates - and he's promised to draw from the same list of candidates from which he picked Neil Gorsuch - will be a person with solid conservative bona fides. Democrats and liberal activists will howl, rage and do all they can to slow the process, but the timing of Mr Kennedy's retirement makes what happens next all but inevitable. The president will surely offer his choice quickly, and if Republican senators stick together they have the votes to confirm before November's mid-terms congressional elections, let alone when new senators are sworn in next January. And even if the court vacancy becomes a campaign issue, the open seat in 2016 proved that court vacancies are a much stronger motivating consideration for Republicans - particularly evangelical voters - than they are for Democrats. File this as yet another entry in the ""elections have consequences"" scrapbook. If Hillary Clinton had prevailed in 2016, Democrats would be contemplating a 6-3 liberal Supreme Court majority and an opportunity to reshape the legal landscape for a generation. Instead, on subjects like abortion law and gay rights, the pendulum is swinging the other direction. During a meeting with Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa at the White House, President Trump said he would select a nominee to replace Justice Kennedy from a list of 25 potential court candidates that his campaign had compiled during the election. Mr Trump said the process to replace him would begin immediately. ""Hopefully we will pick someone who is just as outstanding"", he said. Mr Trump added that he had learned of the judge's retirement about a half hour before, when Justice Kennedy came to the White House to meet him. This video can not be played ""We have a very excellent list... of tremendous people"" The White House also released a statement thanking Justice Kennedy for his 30 years of service as a ""tireless voice for individual rights"". ""His words have left an indelible mark not only on this generation, but on the fabric of American history."" Top Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a televised speech on the floor of the Senate that Justice Kennedy's replacement would be a decision affecting ""generations"". ""Our Republican colleagues in the senate should follow the rule they set in 2016, not to consider a Supreme Court Justice in an election year,"" Senator Schumer said. ""Anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy."" This video can not be played Judge Gorsuch spoke of his ""most solemn assignment"" Fellow Democrat Tammy Duckworth cited that same rule, pushed in 2016 by Republican leader Mitch McConnell, in a tweet.

"A revamped drug that can withstand extreme heat and stay effective for 1,000 days could ""revolutionise the ability"" to keep new mothers alive, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. The medicine - known as heat-stable carbetocin - helps prevent sometimes fatal bleeding after women give birth. It could potentially be given to millions of mothers worldwide. Existing drugs can help but hot, humid conditions in many countries may stop the lifesaving medicines working well. About 70,000 women die each year due to severe bleeding after childbirth. These so-called postpartum haemorrhages also increase the risk of their babies dying in the first month of life. To tackle the problem the WHO currently suggests an injection of oxytocin be offered to all women giving birth vaginally. But it is recommended that the medicine is kept between two and eight degrees from the moment it is manufactured to the moment it is used, which WHO experts say is often unachievable in countries with little access to refrigeration and unreliable power supplies . In the trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, almost 30,000 women in 10 countries across the globe were randomly allocated an injection of heat-stable carbetocin or oxytocin immediately after they gave birth. Researchers found that in most cases, both drugs were equally good at preventing excessive bleeding after birth. Experts say this paves the way for the heat-stable carbetocin to be offered to all women giving birth vaginally across as many as 90 countries around the world. And they say it could be particularly useful in areas where the oxytocin is substandard or has been tampered with so there is less of the active ingredient than is desirable. WHO expert Dr Metin Gulmezoglu said the development of a drug that remained in working order in hot and humid conditions was ""very good news for the millions of women who give birth in parts of the world without access to reliable refrigeration"". He added: ""It will help to save many lives of mothers in lower income countries where most deaths occur."" And the WHO's director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""This is a truly encouraging new development that can revolutionise our ability to keep mothers and babies alive."" The drug is already available for other uses and regulators will now look at whether the drug can be approved for wider use. WHO experts say they hope it will be available in some countries as early next year. The trial is a collaboration between the WHO, MSD for Mothers and Ferring Pharmaceuticals.

"An estimated 1,000 students at the university are affected Students at Durham University are angry at plans which could see them have to get up an hour earlier for lectures. A big increase in student numbers at the elite university means business and law undergraduates may have to attend lectures from 08:00 from September. The university said the move would be a temporary measure while additional lecture space was being built. However, the university's student union accused bosses of being more concerned about student fees than students. The university, part of the prestigiousRussell Group,external, has embarked on a massive expansion programme, which includes relocating students from campuses on Teesside and plans to increase student numbers by 4,000 over the next 10 years to 21,500. The planned early starts would affect an estimated 1,000 students. Student accommodation row fee protest University to sell shares in fossil fuel firms Durham University opens Â£11.5m 'space centre' Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Prof Alan Houston, said: ""If agreed, this arrangement will be for one year only, until our new Teaching and Learning Centre opens, which will increase our teaching capacity. ""Out of nearly 2,000 lectures scheduled each week, it is currently proposed that only four start at 8am. Of the four affected modules, each has only one lecture scheduled at 8am - the remainder of teaching activities take place within the university's core teaching hours. ""We are still working closely with departments to further reduce the number of these 8am slots."" University students union president Megan Croll said: ""It seems the university is more concerned about tuition fees than the student experience at Durham. ""The student body has not been consulted at all about this and it appears the university has enrolled too many new students. ""We've been told this is temporary, but we'll have to see what happens. ""Students are suffering because of over ambitious aims to expand the university. This will put extra hours on working days, not just of students but of staff too. ""It's also not just a question of losing out on sleep and other activities, there also has to be some thought about students who will be walking to lectures in the dark. There's a question of safety as well."" A spokesman for the University and College Union (UCU) said: ""We have received a number of complaints from members about the change to start some lectures at 8am. ""Those with caring responsibilities are particularly concerned about the implications for them. ""As a trade union, we haven't been consulted about this.

"The splits within the EU have been highlighted by Italy's refusal to accept migrants carried by NGO rescue boats in the Mediterranean Hardened Eurosceptics might love to think the EU's in trouble, but as leaders gather in Brussels for their summer summit on Thursday, dedicated Europhiles are also sounding the alarm. ""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size."" It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread. Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden. Read more from Katya:EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics? Migration slashes the EU from east to west too. Newer member states from Central and Eastern Europe never signed up to the post World War Two ""all for one and one for all"" vision. When it comes to EU solidarity and burden-sharing, they are fervent non-believers. They determinedly turn their backs when Italy and Germany plead for migrant quotas. The number of migrants arriving illegally in Europe may be down, but so is voter tolerance of the problem. The rise and rise across the EU of tough-on-migration politicians has emboldened hardliners such as Hungary's Victor Orban and Austria's Sebastian Kurz, who takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU this Sunday and will push migration as a top priority. ""Keep Them Out"" is Austria's main aim and while Europe's (still) most influential leader, Angela Merkel, arrives in Brussels on Thursday pushing - and praying - for compromise on burden-sharing and prevention, the number of EU leaders pushing single-mindedly on the migrant deterrence button is growing. Which brings me to the next layer of European splits provoked by migration: within national governments as well as between countries. Germany is the most dramatic example. UK told 'little time left' for Brexit deal Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migration mutiny Can the EU reach a new deal on migrants? Mrs Merkel has clearly been weakened at home by her previous open-door migrant policy. Formerly viewed as politically untouchable, the German chancellor has now been given an ultimatum by her own interior minister. ""By the end of this Brussels summit, you need to come home with a workable pan-European solution to stop irregular migrants bleeding into Germany,"" Horst Seehofer has threatened her. ""Or I will unilaterally slam Germany's borders shut."" The Austrian government told me this week it would then immediately follow suit, causing a border-closing domino effect across Europe - with a seismic impact on the EU's prize political and economic project: the open-border Schengen agreement. What a blow for Brussels and nightmare for Europe's export-king Germany that would be. Of course we're not there yet. In true European Union style, once gathered round a table here in Brussels, there will undoubtedly be emphasis on what unites rather than divides member countries. On migration, EU leaders will easily agree to beef up their Frontex border guard. This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? There's also growing convergence around the idea of setting up so-called disembarkation centres outside the EU to identify economic migrants, who in theory could be sent home. Those with a right to asylum or refugee status could then be given safe and legal passage to Europe. And there's much talk of closer co-operation (read: money) with migrant countries of origin and the transit countries (read: Libya and its coastguard) that migrants cross to make their way to people smuggler boats. But these ideas are easier to formulate than to carry out. You would need a lot of EU border guards to truly patrol southern Europe's thousands of miles of open coastline. You would need permission from African countries such as Niger and Chad to set up processing centres, for example. So far that's a distant goal. In the meantime, there is no whiff of EU agreement over what to do with migrants who do reach Europe. Which brings us back to the threat to Schengen. Italy's populist Interior Minister Matteo Salvini believes migrant reception centres should be set up in Niger, Mali, Chad and Sudan Gloomy German government sources told me they gave the project a three out of 10 chance of survival thanks to the increasingly nationalistic nature of many European governments. ""And if Schengen does fail,"" they predict, ""that would be the beginning of the end of the European Union."" It's too early really to herald the demise of the EU or even the end of Mrs Merkel's career in government as a result of this very political migrant crisis in Europe. But, as EU summit host Donald Tusk said to EU leaders on the eve of their arrival: ""The stakes are very high. And time is short."" EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?

"The mandatory part of national service will last a month, while the second, longer phase will be more closely focused on defence and security The French government has introduced a plan to bring back national service for all 16-year-olds. It was an idea put forward by Emmanuel Macron in his presidential campaign, to promote a sense of civic duty and national unity among French youth. But some remain unconvinced of the benefits. The new national service will cover all 16-year-olds, girls as well as boys, and will be divided into two distinct phases. The first phase is a mandatory one-month placement with a focus on civic culture, which the government says will ""enable young people to create new relationships and develop their role in society"". Voluntary teaching and working with charities are among the options being looked at, alongside traditional military preparation with the police, fire service or army. The second phase is a voluntary placement of at least three months and up to a year, in which young people will be encouraged to serve ""in an area linked to defence and security"" - but again, they could opt to carry out volunteer work linked to heritage, the environment or social care. More on Macron: French MPs back Macron's rail reforms Macron splashing out on presidential pool How tech took the bite out of France's rail strikes It's not quite the programme Mr Macron initially had in mind. When he first floated the idea, during the 2017 race for the presidency, it was a sort of military service in miniature, with all French citizens forced to have a ""direct experience of military life"" for a minimum of one month between the ages of 18 and 21. Students' groups, already unimpressed with education reforms, have so far been lukewarm about national service That's now been softened and broadened into what's being called a Universal National Service - partly because of concerns that it would cost too much and overburden the country's armed forces. Even now, the programme is estimated to cost â¬1.6bn (Â£1.4bn; $1.8bn) a year to run, with â¬1.75bn of investment up front. The goal of this new-style national service, the government says, is to encourage young French citizens to take part in the life of the nation, and promote social cohesion. Consultations will now begin, with a view to rolling out the programme from early next year. But there is still a lot of detail to be hammered out, not least the legal basis. A working group, set up to look into the scheme, has warned that the French constitution bans the state from forcing an entire section of the population to spend time away from home, except in the case of national defence. Even before it was announced, 14 youth organisations objected to the ""inconsistencies"" in the plan, unhappy with the idea of being forced to take part in a project. ""Choosing a commitment is just as important as the commitment itself, if not more so,"" they argued, calling for young people to be able to exercise freedom of choice. This video can not be played When Emmanuel Macron told a French teen to call him ""Mr President"" More broadly, about 60% of the population are in favour, according to a YouGov poll carried out in March, although the number dips to just below half when younger people are asked for their views. Mr Macron is the first French president not to have done military service; it was scrapped for the new intake in 1996, when Mr Macron was 18. Before that, all young French men were expected to serve for the best part of a year in the armed forces. When the old post-war draft ended, in 1997, there was a collective sigh of relief. Amid the nostalgia, many people here recognised that it had become a social exercise rather than a military one. Twenty years later, it's that social cohesion President Macron now wants to recapture.

"Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue crews are battling through the smoke Tackling moorland fires poses a unique set of challenges far removed from an urban blaze. Images of firefighters caked in soot and sweat reflect the arduous conditions on the scorched hills above Greater Manchester. The biggest test for crews near Saddleworth Moor is reaching remote fires with water and manpower. Once there, they face intense heat and the danger of being caught out by flames whipped up by strong winds. An arsenal of equipment and expertise is on hand, but dousing and beating the flames to starve them of oxygen remains a low-tech and back-breaking endeavour made tougher by the ongoing heatwave. Rob Taylor, from Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, said reaching the often remote location of the seat of the fire is one of the biggest hurdles. Crews and water may need to travel several miles from nearby roads to bring fires under control. Moorland fire in pictures 'Apocalyptic' moors fire continues to rage While beating flames to starve them of oxygen is partly effective, a deep-seated blaze requires soaking with water to stop it spreading, said Tony Wellock, from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. Fire engines each carry about 1,800 litres of water but struggle to move across bumpy moorland terrain. By linking seven hoses together, a so-called ""water relay"" can allow crews to stretch supplies up to 200m (656ft). Crews are damping down blazing patches ""Access to water is our biggest challenge,"" says firefighter Rob Taylor Mr Taylor said the most effective way to fight moorland fires is by helicopter but it comes at a significant cost, requiring funding from the landowner. ""Access to water is our biggest challenge - the pumps will be exhausted in five to eight minutes of continuous use."" An eight-wheeled Argocat vehicle, which can move swiftly across the landscape, can be used for remote blazes. ""It carries what looks like a giant pressure washer and allows us to reach some remote terrain, but there's a limit to the amount of water it can carry,"" he explained. The moors are at the mercy of strong winds which can whip smouldering embers into a well-developed blaze in seconds. Mr Taylor said flames which rapidly change direction could place crews at risk. The danger is mitigated by using teams of spotters to monitor speed and direction. ""The Peak District National Park rangers are invaluable to us - they understand the wind and how it will blow the fire around,"" said Mr Taylor. Beneath the scrub and heather burning above the surface, roots and peat are prone to burning underground - and can spread undetected. Mr Wellock said: ""When you put the fire out, it springs up again behind you."" The moors are at the mercy of strong winds which can whip up smouldering embers However, there are some features of the landscape which can be used to firefighters' advantage. ""Where there's a break, like a road, we can damp it with water to keep it cool and it will stop the fire from spreading,"" said Mr Taylor. Firefighters adopt more lightweight kit for tackling a blaze in the open countryside and eschew breathing apparatus for dust masks, except during the smokiest parts of the work. They can expect to work in 60-minute stints at the frontline of the fire before being relieved by another crew, rotating in shifts of four to five hours. Allow Twitter content?

Each engine carries water and snack bars to keep crews fed and hydrated. Those fortunate enough to get a longer break might have chance to eat a ready meal prepared using hot water before resuming work. Crews on the moors are often exposed to heat and smoke for longer periods compared to the intense challenge of a house fire. ""This is the most arduous work our crews carry out,"" Mr Taylor added.

"The Brexit findings come in the Bank's financial stability report The Bank of England says the UK has made positive ""progress"" on handling financial services risks around the UK's departure from the European Union. But it also says there has been a lack of similar action from the EU. It says that means ""material risks remain"" to trillions of pounds worth of financial contracts - which support the business activities that flow between the UK and rest of Europe. The findings come in the bank's bi-annual Financial Stability Report. The report said the passing of the EU Withdrawal Bill and Treasury plans for a ""temporary permissions"" system - for continuing cross-border financial trade - had eased the ""risk of disruption"". ""Progress has been made in the UK towards mitigating risks of disruption to the availability of financial services to UK-end users,"" the report said. ""The EU (Withdrawal) Bill has been passed by Parliament. ""The UK government has committed to legislate, if necessary, to put in place temporary permissions and recognition regimes - this will allow banks [and] insurers to continue their activities in the UK for a time-limited period after the UK has left the EU, even if there is no implementation period, thus mitigating a number of risks of disruption to UK customers."" But it added: ""As yet the EU has not indicated a solution analogous to a temporary permissions regime. European Economic Area customers remain reliant on UK-based financial companies being able to overcome any future barriers to cross service provision. ""The Financial Policy Committee judges that material risks remain."" The Bank said that the UK's banks were sufficiently robust to weather a ""disorderly Brexit"". But despite the progress, its Brexit risk register still has amber warnings on progress towards ensuring there is a legal and regulatory plan in place once Britain leaves the EU. For the UK, there is a single red warning on the continuing validity of contracts used to insure businesses making currency trades, for example, involving institutions in Britain and the EU. There are believed to be Â£29 trillion worth of such contracts which could become ""unserviceable"" after March next year if action is not taken. The Bank says the EU is facing three ""red light"" issues. Two are on contracts and one on is on clearing - the ability to finalise deals and trades across borders between banks, businesses and fund managers. Both sides also face amber warnings on the ability of banks and asset managers to continue providing other services across borders, as well as on the lack of agreement on the cross-border flow of personal data between Britain and the EU.

"Hotel booking sites must review the way they rank and display rooms, the UK's competition watchdog has said. Some sites may be making misleading claims about discounts, the Competition and Markets Authority said. It is also examining whether sites are giving a false impression of room availability and ""rushing"" customers into booking decisions. The CMA did not name which companies it has been investigating, but leading sites include Expedia and Booking.com. The extent to which a hotel's ranking may be influenced by the size of the commission it pays was another issue highlighted by the CMA. The CMA, whichlaunched its investigation into online booking sites in October, says it has sent warning letters to ""a range of sites"", demanding they review their practices to make sure they are fair and comply with consumer protection law. Concerns include: How search result rankings are influenced by factors irrelevant to consumers, such as how much commission a hotel pays the site Whether a false impression is created by claims about how many people are looking at the same room, how many rooms are left, and how long a price is available Clarity over discounts, including whether a weekday rate is being compared to a previous weekend rate Whether holidaymakers are hit with unexpected extra charges such as taxes and booking fees later in the booking process About 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites, according to the CMA. ""Booking sites can make it so much easier to choose your holiday, but only if people are able to trust them,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA. ""We are now demanding that sites think again about how they are presenting information to their customers and make sure they are complying with the law. Our next step is to take any necessary action - including through the courts if needed - to ensure people get a fair deal."" Expedia, one of the leading sites, said: ""Expedia Group continuously aims to deliver attractive travel options at affordable prices in transparent, clear and easy to understand ways, so that our customers can make informed travel choices. Expedia will continue to engage with the CMA on these consumer matters, as it continues its inquiries in the travel sector."" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality which represents hoteliers, welcomed the CMA's announcement saying it would bring ""reassurance"" for customers. She added that the inquiry should lead to a wider review of the charges that these booking sites levied on hotels, which led to higher prices for holidaymakers. ""This is another example of digital businesses stealing an unfair lead on honest, regulated operators whose first concern is to deliver good service to their customers,"" she said. Lavinia Dagostine has run a nine-room guest house in Dorset for 11 years and said that these sites could make life difficult for traditional providers. She relies on her own website and return guests before sending vacancies to a booking site. ""It means that smaller B&Bs get left out because they can't afford to pay commission on top of all their other expenses,"" she said. ""I agree it is easier for the booker but the commissions they charge the hotel or B&B sometimes take away any small profit that can be made, making us have to increase our prices."" The watchdog has ordered the sites, which it has not officially named, to review their practices, and to respond within the next few months. At the end of the review, the sites can either give a legally-binding commitment to change the way they operate, or argue their case that their practices do not break the law. If the CMA disagrees with their arguments, it can take the companies to court, where unlimited fines can be levied. It has also raised various price guarantee claims with the Advertising Standards Authority. Separately, the new EU Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations come into force on Sunday. The changes mean that package holidays consisting of a flight, hotel, car-hire or other tourist services - either bought online for an all-in price or through linked web pages - will get the same protection as packages bought in travel agencies. These protections include being flown home or a refund if a travel company or airline goes bust. Parents fined Â£24m for pupil absences Hotel booking sites to be investigated Holiday promotions 'can be misleading' The unwanted holiday homes owners can't give away LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Eloise Parry was ""enchanted by her weight loss"" despite becoming unhealthy, the court heard A man has been found guilty of the manslaughter of a bulimic student who bought a toxic slimming aid online. Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury, died after taking eight diet pills containing dinitrophenol (DNP). Bernard Rebelo, 30, of Gosport, was convicted of two counts of manslaughter at Inner London Crown Court. Before she died in April 2015, Miss Parry needed hospital treatment several times for side effects of the tablets. Midlands Live: Swimmers defy quarry ban despite deaths; TV appeal over pensioner beaten to death Rebelo, who denied manslaughter, admitted during the trial he sold the pills to her, but said there was a warning about the drug on his website. Manslaughter charges were dropped against Albert Huynh, 33, from Northolt, north-west London, and Mary Roberts, 32, from Gosport, after the judge rule there was insufficient evidence the pair were involved. Miss Parry, a student at Glyndwr University, Wrexham, had had mental health problems as a teenager and as well as the bulimia had borderline personality disorder.

Bernard Rebelo has been told to expect a lengthy sentence Miss Parry had become ""focused"" on losing weight before her death, her sister Rebecca, 19, told the trial. She seemed ""too enchanted by her weight loss to acknowledge how unhealthy she was getting"". Miss Parry started taking the pills in February 2015, and quickly became addicted to them. In a statement read to the court, Rebecca said she was with her sister on 11 April, the evening before she died in hospital. She left her at about 21:00 BST after a conversation about her ordering a takeaway before noticing the next day Miss Parry had binged on food before taking the diet pills. DNP tablets bought online by the BBC Harrow Council searched the flat where Rebelo was based And in texts to her university lecturer hours before she died, Miss Parry said: ""I screwed up big time. Binged/purged all night and took four pills at 4am. ""I took another four when I woke and I started vomiting soon after. I think I am going to die. ""No one is known to survive if they vomit after taking DNP. I am so scared."" Rebelo was operating from a flat in Harrow, north west London, and made the capsules to be sold online for considerable profits, his trial was told. The chemicals were bought in drums from China, bypassing authorities such as the Food Standards Agency and Interpol which had tried to close the operation down. Graham Henson, leader of Harrow Council, which was involved in bringing the prosecution, said: ""This sets a precedent that we can now prosecute people for selling pesticides, like DNP, online as a slimming agent.""
