"Artwork: The Chang'e-4 rover will explore a huge impact basin on the far side China has launched the first mission to land a robotic craft on the far side of the Moon, Chinese media say. The Chang'e-4 mission will see a static lander and rover touch down in Von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n crater, located on the side of the Moon which never faces Earth. The payload blasted off atop a Long March 3B rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center. The mission will pave the way for the country to deliver samples of Moon rock and soil to Earth. The landing will not occur until early January, when the probe will descend on thrusters and touch down on the rugged terrain of the lunar far side. Von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n crater is of interest to scientists because it is located within the oldest and largest impact feature on the Moon - the South Pole-Aitken Basin. This was probably formed by a giant asteroid impact billions of years ago. The landers will characterise the region's geology and the composition of rock and soil. China launch will prep for Moon landing Why China is fixated on the Moon China's scientific revolution Because of a phenomenon called ""tidal locking"", we see only one ""face"" of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth. Though often referred to as the ""dark side"", this face of the Moon is also illuminated by the Sun and has the same phases as the near side; ""dark"" in this context simply means ""unseen"". The lunar far side has a thicker crust and is more heavily cratered than the near side The far side looks rather different to the more familiar near side. It has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also few of the ""mare"" - dark basaltic ""seas"" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side. The powerful impact that created the South Pole Aitken Basin may have punched through the crust down to the Moon's mantle layer. Chang'e-4's instruments could examine whether this was the case, shedding light on the early history of our only natural satellite. The mission will also characterise the ""radio environment"" on the far side, a test designed to lay the groundwork for the creation of future radio astronomy telescopes on the far side, which is shielded from the radio noise of Earth. The static lander will carry a 3kg (6.6lb) container with potato and arabidopsis plant seeds to perform a biological experiment. The ""lunar mini biosphere"" experiment was designed by 28 Chinese universities. ""We want to study the respiration of the seeds and the photosynthesis on the Moon,"" Liu Hanlong, chief director of the experiment and vice president of Chongqing University, toldthe state-run Xinhua news agency,externalearlier this year. China's Yutu rover, part of the Chang'e-3 mission, explored the Moon in 2013 Xie Gengxin, chief designer of the experiment, told Xinhua: ""We have to keep the temperature in the 'mini biosphere' within a range from 1 degree to 30 degrees, and properly control the humidity and nutrition. We will use a tube to direct the natural light on the surface of Moon into the tin to make the plants grow."" Because the landers on the far side have no line of sight with our planet, they mustsend data back via a relay satellite named Queqiao, launched by China in May this year. The probe's design is based on that of its predecessor, Chang'e-3, which deployed landing craft to the Moon's Mare Imbrium region in 2013. However, it has some important modifications. The lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform the low-frequency radio astronomy observations. The rover will carry a panoramic camera; a radar to probe beneath the lunar surface; an imaging spectrometer to identify minerals; and an experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface. The mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations. Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.

"Images showed dozens of people in Aleppo with breathing difficulties The US and the UK have accused the Syrian government and its Russian allies of fabricating a story accusing rebel fighters of a chemical attack. The US state department said the purpose was to ""undermine confidence"" in the ceasefire in Idlib province. Syria and Russia said shells carrying chlorine gas injured about 100 people in the government-held city of Aleppo last month. State media showed images of residents being treated in hospital. Russia later carried out air strikes against the rebels it accused of the attack. At the time, rebel groups denied carrying out a chemical strike and said the claims were a pretext for an attack on opposition-held areas. On Friday, the US said it had ""credible information"" that the story was false and that Russian and Syrian forces had instead fired tear gas. ""The United States is deeply concerned that pro-regime officials have maintained control of the attack site in its immediate aftermath, allowing them to potentially fabricate samples and contaminate the site before a proper investigation of it by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,"" state department spokesman Robert Palladino said. ""We caution Russia and the regime against tampering with the suspected attack site and urge them to secure the safety of impartial, independent inspectors so that those responsible can be held accountable."" Why does the battle for Idlib matter? How chemical weapons have helped Assad The long-distance learners of Aleppo Parts of the Aleppo region, as well as the neighbouring provinces of Hama and Idlib, are controlled by Turkish-backed rebels and jihadists. Britain's Foreign Office said it had ""seen nothing to support the claims"" made by Russia and Syria. ""The UK assesses it highly unlikely that chlorine was used in this incident, as the regime and its Russian allies have claimed. It is highly unlikely that the opposition was responsible,"" a statement said. ""It is likely that this was either a staged incident intended to frame the opposition, or an operation which went wrong and from which Russia and the regime sought to take advantage."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the war via a network of activists on the ground, said that about 100 people had been treated for breathing difficulties following a strike on western parts of Aleppo on 24 November. Western powers and the UN have accused government forces of using chemical and nerve agents on numerous occasions since the start of the civil war. Why does the battle for Idlib matter?

"A court sketch shows Meng Wanzhou during her bail hearing at the Supreme Court of British Columbia The chief financial officer of the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei faces fraud charges in the United States, a Canadian court hearing has revealed. Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei's founder, is accused of breaking American sanctions on Iran. She was arrested in Vancouver on Saturday and faces extradition to the US. China has demanded Ms Meng's release, insisting she has not violated any laws. The court is deciding whether or not to allow bail. Friday's five-hour hearing has now ended and the case was adjourned until Monday. Ms Meng's detention became public knowledge on Wednesday, but details at the time were unclear as she had requested a publication ban. That blackout has now been overturned by the court. On Friday, the Supreme Court of British Columbia was told that Ms Meng had used a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. The court was told that she had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company. Why Huawei matters in five charts What's going on with Huawei? A quick guide to the US-China trade war Ms Meng faces up to 30 years in prison in the US if found guilty of the charges, the court heard. Court reporters said she was not handcuffed for the hearing and was wearing a green sweatsuit. A Canadian government lawyer said Ms Meng was accused of ""conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions"". He said she had denied to US bankers any direct connections between Huawei and SkyCom, when in fact ""SkyCom is Huawei"". The lawyer said Ms Meng could be a flight risk and thus should be denied bail. The media were camped outside the court for the bail hearing The arrest has put further strain on US-China relations. The two countries have been locked in trade disputes, althougha 90-day truce had been agreedon Saturday - before news of the arrest came to light on Wednesday. Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung. Ms Meng's arrest was not revealed by Canadian authorities until Wednesday, the day of her first court appearance. Details of the charges were also not revealed at the time after she was granted a publication ban by a Canadian judge. Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of the company's founder Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Friday that China had been assured that due process was being followed and Ms Meng would have consular access while her case was before the courts. ""Canada is a rule-of-law country and we follow our procedures, our laws and our agreements,"" she told journalists during a press teleconference.Huawei executive faces Iran fraud charges ""Due process has been, and will be, followed in Canada."" Ms Freeland reiterated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's claim that Ms Meng's arrest had ""no political involvement"". By BBC Monitoring Meng Wanzhou, 46, joined Huawei as early as 1993, when she began a career at her father's company as a receptionist. After she graduated with a master's degree in accountancy from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 1999, she joined the finance department of Huawei. She became the company's chief finance officer in 2011 and was promoted to vice-chair a few months before her arrest. Ms Meng's links to her father, Ren Zhengfei, were not known to the public until a few years ago. In a practice highly unusual in Chinese tradition, she adopted her family name not from her father but her mother, Meng Jun, who was Mr Ren's first wife. Some Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. Japan is expected to ban government use of products made by Huawei and ZTE over cybersecurity concerns, local media reported on Friday.It would follow moves by New Zealand and Australia to block Huawei. Should we worry about Huawei? Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? US National Security Adviser John Bolton said his country has had ""enormous concerns for years"" about the practice of Chinese firms ""to use stolen American intellectual property, to engage in forced technology transfers, and to be used as arms of the Chinese government's objectives in terms of information technology in particular"". ""Not respecting this particular arrest, but Huawei is one company we've been concerned about,"" he said. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters: ""The detention without giving any reason violates a person's human rights."" ""We have made solemn representations to Canada and the US, demanding that both parties immediately clarify the reasons for the detention, and immediately release the detainee to protect the person's legal rights.""

Iran nuclear deal: Key details Mr Trump had been fiercely opposed to the deal, which saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The re-imposed sanctions hit oil exports, shipping and banks - all core parts of Iran's economy. Although there are some waivers, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the US will ""aggressively"" target any firm or organisation ""evading our sanctions"".

"Langdon Doidge was the owner of Langdons Hotel in Roath A man died after swallowing a glass of pipe cleaning fluid that he mistook for Ribena after a night out drinking. Langdon Doidge, 59, began vomiting blood and called 999 after drinking the beer line cleaner, which he kept in the fridge at his Cardiff Bay flat. The purple liquid was in a Robinson's squash bottle next to the Ribena, coroner Sarah Richards was told. Mr Doidge died of multiple organ failure 19 days later. The coroner concluded his death was misadventure. His son Lewis Doidge told Pontypridd Coroner's Court that his father would often go to the pub after work at 16:00 and stay out late. He owned Langdon's Hotel close to Cardiff city centre and used the liquid for his hotel bar. It is bright purple so workers can spot it in the pipes. Langdon Doidge's son said his father ""loved to go out"" Mr Doidge brought cleaning products home from work to clean his motorbike, his son said. ""You're meant to keep it in a cool place otherwise the reaction process doesn't work,"" he told the coroner. PC Kerry Thomas Young said investigating officers found the bottles in Mr Doidge's fridge when they visited his home after he died. ""There was an opened bottle of Ribena cordial alongside another Robinson's bottle,"" said the officer. A glass was also discovered that contained purple residue from his drink. Welsh Ambulance Service worker Sarah Woods, who took the 999 call from Mr Doidge, said he had complained of vomiting blood. ""He returned home after an evening of drinking and drank the alkaline after mistaking it for a soft drink,"" coroner Ms Richards said.

"Ben Hedger steered his mum Lauren Smith's car to safety after she had a seizure An eight-year-old boy took control of a car at 60mph and steered it to safety across a busy dual carriageway when his mother blacked out at the wheel. Ben Hedger was on his way home from school with mum Lauren Smith when she had a seizure on the A120 near Colchester, in Essex. The Ford Ka hit the central reservation and realising the danger, Ben put on the hazard lights and guided the vehicle across the lanes to the hard shoulder. His mum said she was ""so proud"". Miss Smith, 27, who lives in Colchester, lost consciousness at about 15.45 GMT on Monday. ""When I started having the seizure at first I grabbed the wheel and was steering erratically so because of that we moved from the left lane into the central reservation and crashed into that,"" she said. ""We were scraping along and that is when Ben realised he needed to do something. ""He put the hazards on, grabbed the steering wheel and steered us to the hard shoulder where we continued along until the car stalled."" The pair were on the school run home Miss Smith said Ben had not realised how serious his actions had been. ""He realised something was wrong with me but he didn't realise he had done this amazing thing. ""He said he just did what he had to do otherwise we would have died."" After pulling the car over, Ben tried to use his mother's phone to call the emergency services before another car stopped and helped them. Miss Smith, who came around after five to 10 minutes, said she had never had a seizure before and had to be told about what had happened by Ben, the emergency services and a fellow driver.

"A rematch between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder is a step closer The WBC has sanctioned a ""direct rematch"" between heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury. Britain's Fury and American Wilder shareda controversial and thrilling draw in Los Angeles on Saturday. Both fighters have said they want a rematch, whileFury is pushing for it to be in the UK. The WBC said in a statement there was a ""unanimous agreement"" to sanction a rematch in a meeting of the board of governors. ""Wilder and Fury gave boxing one of the best fights in the heavyweight division in a long time, which has created tremendous popular demand for the fans to see a rematch,"" it said. ""The WBC is happy to confirm a direct rematch has been approved."" Wilder's mandatory challenger is Dominic Breazeale but this decision by the WBC clears the way for him to fight Fury again next without being stripped of his belt. Listen: 5 Live Boxing with Costello and Bunce What next for the elite heavyweights? Although Fury was knocked down in the ninth and 12th rounds, many observers thought the 30-year-old Briton should have won the bout, which was scored 115-111 for Wilder, 114-112 for Fury and 113-113. Fury's promoter Frank Warren said he and the British Boxing Board of Control would write to the WBC demanding another bout and asking for an explanation of the scoring, with Mexican judge Alejandro Rochin having awarded Wilder seven of the 12 rounds. Fury said he had ""never seen a worse decision in my life"" and described it as a ""gift"" for his opponent. In an Instagram post in response, Wilder, 33, said: ""You saw the best Fury but you did not get the best Wilder and I still managed to get the job done."" Wilder alsoquestioned if referee Jack Reiss' count was too slowin Fury's remarkable rise from the canvas in the 12th round,which Reiss denied. BBC Radio 5 live boxing analyst Steve Bunce Fury and Wilder both want the rematch but I'm not sure where it will be. Had Fury got the decision I am convinced the rematch, 100%, would be in May in this country. I think there will already be an offer in from Las Vegas given how many Brits will go. Don't be surprised if we are going to Vegas in May.

"Fashion chain Ted Baker's chief executive Ray Kelvin is to take a voluntary leave of absence amid allegations of harassment. Last week, an online petition launched by employees accused 62-year-old Mr Kelvin of inappropriate comments and behaviour,including ""forced hugging"". Ted Baker said its committee and board had been made aware of ""further serious allegations"" against Mr Kelvin. Mr Kelvin said the claims had raised ""serious and upsetting issues"". The company has appointed a law firm to conduct an independent external investigation. And chief operating officer Lindsay Page has been named acting chief executive. The firm said it would not be making any further comment about the nature of the allegations while they remained under investigation. The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence about at least ""50 recorded incidents of harassment"" at the fashion group. Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears. Mr Kelvin said the allegations had raised some ""very serious and upsetting issues"", and that it was ""only right"" Ted Baker's committee and board should investigate.

"Experts have said they feared the tiara may be cut apart and the diamonds sold separately Four people have been arrested in connection with the theft of a diamond tiara from a country estate. The Portland Tiara,part of a jewellery collection at the Welbeck Estate, was worn by the Duchess of Portland to Edward VII's coronation in 1902. It was taken along with a diamond brooch on 20 November. Three men, 46, 38 and 33, and a 30-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of burglary. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Nottinghamshire Police said all four remain in custody and enquiries are ongoing. The force previously released CCTV footage showing a trio of raiders using power tools to break into the glass case where the tiara was housed. It also appealed for information about a silver Audi RS5 Quattro, registration KY61 USJ, found burnt out in Cross Lane, Blidworth, about 30 minutes after the burglary. This video can not be played CCTV shows the moments before the Portland Tiara was stolen Det Insp Gayle Hart said: ""The stolen property hasn't been recovered and we still want to hear from anyone who knows where the items might be.""

"Dame Mary is known for such BBC documentaries as Meet the Romans and Civilisations Mary Beard has said she is happy to have been made a dame, even though she has not always agreed with what the honours system stands for. ""Had somebody said to me at 23 that I would accept a damehood of the British Empire, I would have said, 'Sorry, sunshine, that's not what my politics is all about,'"" she said on Friday. Now 63, though, the historian said she was ""older and wiser"". She told reporters she found the title ""quaint"" and ""charming"", if ""odd"". She said honours were no longer associated with the politics of the empire - because there is no empire - adding: ""Dames cart around the stage, don't they?"" Speaking after collecting her damehood from Prince William at Buckingham Palace, Dame Mary also revealed she had offered to teach his three children Latin. The classics professor received her damehood from the Duke of Cambridge on Friday ""I hope he was listening,"" the Cambridge University classics professor said. ""Of course he was very polite and said, 'I'll have to get you to teach them', and I said, 'Anything!' ""It's important to learn where we've been and where we've come from, and for people to have access to some of the most extraordinary and influential literature in world culture. ""That kind of direct connection with something so influential written so long ago is, I think, terribly important.""

"Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer was seen as Ms Merkel's heir apparent and protÃ©gÃ© Germany's ruling Christian Democrat Union has chosen Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as its new party leader, ending Angela Merkel's 18-year reign. The CDU general secretary narrowly beat Friedrich Merz, a millionaire lawyer, in a run-off vote in Hamburg. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer, or AKK as she is also known, received 517 of 999 votes. Mrs Merkel, who plans to serve out her term as chancellor until 2021, gave an emotional farewell speech on Friday at the special party conference. As the head of Germany's largest party, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer could now become the next German chancellor. Is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer Merkel 2.0? Merkel bids emotional farewell to party Germany country profile The former prime minister of the state of Saarland said: ""I learned what it is to lead, and above all learnt that leadership is more about being strong on the inside than being loud on the outside."" She called for party unity in her first address as leader and brought Mr Merz and her other opponent, Health Minister Jens Spahn, to the stage, saying she would be ""very happy"" if they joined her in this task. The 56-year-old was the favourite for party leader and Ms Merkel's choice to succeed her. Earlier, during her farewell speech as party leader, Ms Merkel praised AKK for her 2017 electoral success in Saarland, in a clear hint of the chancellor's personal preference. CDU delegates had three candidates to consider: Jens Spahn (L), Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Friedrich Merz ""I would have liked to win, but it was still fun,"" Mr Merz told his peers, asking them to back the new party leader. The lawyer, who got 482 votes in a run-off, was a powerful player in the CDU in the early 2000s but left politics when he fell out with the chancellor. Since then, the 63-year-old has built a career in the private sector and works for US investment firm BlackRock. Mr Spahn, a former banker, was not seen as a likely winner and received 157 votes. The 38-year-old - a divisive figure for many having ruffled feathers in the party and cabinet - said he would ""stay in the team"". By BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer does in many respects resemble Angela Merkel in style and politics, although she's said to be more direct, more decisive, more approachable. She used her acceptance speech to urge the party to, in effect, continue on the centrist Merkel path. For the wider CDU membership, she's also the popular choice. Known for her calm and analytical approach, she reassures those who feared that Friedrich Merz might have proven a more divisive figure. And she raises the hopes of those who would like a smooth transition of power from Ms Merkel to a new chancellor candidate in the not too distant future. But she'll have to win over those who resented Ms Merkel's centrism, her migration politics and those who fear the rise of the populist far right. But most of all, AKK as she's known here, needs to get voters back to the CDU. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer has sometimes been dubbed mini-Merkel or Merkel 2.0, neither nickname she particularly enjoys. ""I have read a lot about what I am and who I am,"" she told her party members, ""Mini, a copy, simply 'more of the same'. Dear delegates, I stand before you as I am and as life made me, and I am proud of that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Leaders of other German parties have rolled in their congratulations, such as Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, leader of CDU's sister party in Bavaria. ""You've got big shoes to fill,"" tweeted Andrea Nahles, leader of Mrs Merkel's coalition's junior partner, the Social Democrats. ""Good luck! Now it's time to solve problems: ensuring the future of pensions, recognising the value of work, strengthening cohesion in Europe. I offer good co-operation."" Not everyone is happy though - Sahra Wagenknecht, a left-wing leader, wrote on Twitter: ""Merkel 2.0 is not a solution... Merkel's policy continues with AKK and social change is not possible."" Popular in her home state of Saarland and Berlin, she has an unpretentious style and a reputation for calm analysis, as well as political acumen. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer joined the CDU as a student in 1981 and rose up the ranks of state-level politics. The devout Catholic was seen as Ms Merkel's heir apparent and protÃ©gÃ©. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer became the first woman to serve as a state minister for internal affairs in 2000 and the first woman to serve as prime minister of Saarland, a position she held from 2011 to 2018. She is a Merkel loyalist, perceived as someone who will replicate much of the chancellor's style and policy. However she has differentiated herself from her mentor, voting in favour of quotas for women on corporate boards and taking a tougher line on Russia. She is also more conservative on social issues such as gay marriage, and has vowed to review the country's position on security and migration.

"President Donald Trump has nominated William Barr to be the new attorney general, a post he held in the 1990s. By replacing Jeff Sessions, who was fired by Mr Trump last month, the 68-year-old will take charge of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. US media report he has been critical of some aspects of that inquiry. A well-known conservative lawyer, Mr Barr held the role under President George H W Bush from 1991 to 1993. The president called him a ""highly respected lawyer"" by both Republicans and Democrats and ""a terrific man"" while speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn. In the same statement, Mr Trump confirmed reports he is pushing for Heather Nauert to be the new US ambassador to the United Nations. Trump picks Heather Nauert for UN role This video can not be played 'A brilliant man, a smart, talented woman' - President Trump unveils his nominees for top posts Currently, Mr Barr is counsel at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm in Washington DC. If Mr Barr is confirmed by the senate after his official nomination, he will replace the current acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker. Mr Whitaker had been a controversial pick from the start due to his views on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry. Mr Trump has repeatedly lashed out at the investigation, calling it a ""witch hunt"". When he selected Mr Whitaker to replace Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the inquiry, Democrats feared Mr Whitaker would bring an end to the special counsel's work. Democrats say they will definitely press Mr Barr on his views regarding protecting Mr Mueller and his work, during his confirmation hearings. The Trump-Russia story - in 250 words Who's who in the Trump-Russia drama Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Analysis byAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On paper William Barr looks like a safe pick for US attorney general. Since serving under George HW Bush, he's spent most of his career as a corporate lawyer, so he's more than familiar with Washington's corridors of power. Mr Barr is the kind of nominee Senate Republicans - whose votes will be needed for confirmation - know and are comfortable with. He's not exactly a drain-the-Washington-swamp choice, but that has never been a priority in the gilded halls of the upper chamber of Congress. This, of course, is no normal time - and it didn't take long for interested parties to scour Mr Barr's recent comments and writings in search of any meaningful hints on how he would oversee Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Democrats won't be encouraged to learn that he expressed support for Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and recommended further investigation of Democrat Hillary Clinton. It's going to be months before Mr Barr receives a Senate vote, and the scouring will surely continue. Contentious confirmation hearings are all but a given. This, however, is a nomination that will be difficult for Democrats to derail. The 68-year-old Republican lawyer has an impressive political resume, spanning the CIA, White House and Department of Justice. Mr Barr holds degrees in government and Chinese studies from Columbia University. While studying law at George Washington University, he worked at the CIA from 1973-1977. As a young lawyer, he clerked for the DC appeals court. For a year, Mr Barr was a member of President Ronald Reagan's domestic policy staff at the White House; a role he eventually left to pursue corporate law. In 1989, he was appointed by President Bush to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. He was promoted to deputy attorney general next, and then to the top role. Mr Barr's official attorney general portrait by artist William Alan Shirley After passing his senate confirmation hearing unanimously, he served as the 77th US attorney general from 1991-1993. As the top US law official at that time, he oversaw Robert Mueller, who was then leading the department's criminal division. Mr Barr retired from his position as counsel and executive vice-president of Verizon in 2008. Mr Barr has voiced disapproval over some aspects of the inquiry but his views on the investigation's legitimacy remain unknown. He has said that Robert Mueller hired too many prosecutors with Democratic campaign ties for his investigative team -telling the Washington Post,externalhe ""would have liked to see [Mueller] have more balance"". Ina 2017 opinion piece for the Post,external, Mr Barr said Mr Trump had been right to fire FBI director James Comey because he ""crossed a line"" by announcing the outcome of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. He has also defended Mr Trump's desire for a criminal investigation against Hillary Clintonto the New York Times,external, adding that some of her actions merited an inquiry more than any Trump-Russia collusion. The Times has described Mr Barr as a lawyer with a vision for broad presidential powers, but also one who sees the attorney general's duty as avoiding political considerations. On Twitter, many are wondering why Mr Barr chose to accept the role again, and what he might make of Mr Trump's latest tweets deriding the Russian inquiry. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has already called for Mr Barr to firmly commit to protect Mr Mueller's investigation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has spearheaded a number of lawsuits against the Trump administration, said that Mr Barr could continue Mr Sessions' ""legacy of hostility to civil rights"".

"Mobile operator O2 has said it will compensate its customers following a day of disruption to its data networks. Customers with a monthly subscription will be refunded the cost of two days' service by the end of January. Pay As You Go customers will get 10% extra when they top up their phone in the new year or 10% off when they buy data for mobile broadband devices. On Thursday, O2 issued a joint apology with mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson for the shutdown. The compensation for customers on monthly subscriptions includes small businesses and mobile broadband users. Business customers are advised to contact their O2 corporate account manager to discuss compensation. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Tesco, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Luke Stagg runs a plumbing business and depends on his phone, but could not get through to customers or use his sat nav. He said he would never know how many jobs he had missed out on during Thursday. In addition, he could not contact those he was supposed to be visiting, and his day was wasted. ""I'm 36 years old, so I know how to use a map, but I could not make calls,"" he said. ""Mine was not a proper emergency but there is a wider point - I want to know what happens if it went down for even longer."" O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption He said when he lost data coverage on a previous occasion, he was offered vouchers to use in the O2 shop. However, he was not impressed with the offer. Mischa Bittar, also a plumber, said he had been ""unable to contact any of my engineers or customers via email, unable to use our mobile systems to contact any engineers at all, so everyone's just had to down tools"". ""A lot of money lost and the first thing I know about it is via the BBC website, no contact from O2 at all - disappointing,"" he added. Omeran Amirat said he had lost bids for presents he was supposed to be buying for his children on internet auction site eBay. However, it is unlikely that he will receive compensation from O2 for this. Ericsson president BÃ¶rje Ekholm said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added. O2 said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. It is the company that bills customers, so it holds the responsibility for compensation. Mr French, of Which?, said the company should ""do the right thing"" for customers, with the option of offering additional perks alongside refunds. Many people would have used public-access wi-fi if they were unable to access data through the O2 network. Mr French said this created additional risks if people were exposing personal information on these networks.

"Fiona Bruce has said it is ""an honour"" to be confirmed as the new host of BBC One's Question Time. Known for presenting the BBC News at Six and Ten and Antiques Roadshow, she will be the first female full-time host in the show's 40-year history. A senior BBC source said she performed superbly in recent auditions, according to BBC media editor Amol Rajan. Question Time's current host David Dimbleby will leave the show later this month after 24 years. Bruce said: ""It is an honour to be asked to take on one of the great political programmes of the BBC, particularly at a time of such historic change for the UK and tumult at Westminster. ""For many years, Question Time has been presented by one of my television heroes so I am thrilled and not a little daunted to be stepping into his shoes."" Fiona Bruce has worked with David Dimbleby on general election coverage, pictured here in 2005 Fran Unsworth, director of BBC News and Current Affairs, said: ""Question Time is one of our flagship political programmes, giving people across Britain the chance to hold the powerful to account."" Question Time is still the BBC's flagship political show, and David Dimbleby's quarter of a century reign is generally thought to have been a huge success by both the public and politicians. Fiona Bruce is therefore taking on a huge task. In her new role, she will be reunited with the show's editor Hilary O'Neill, who was previously a deputy editor on the Six and Ten O'Clock News, which Bruce has presented for many years. A senior BBC source said Bruce performed superbly in the recent auditions. Her credentials as one of the most established and high-profile journalists on BBC One were also key. The interesting question now is how much the show evolves editorially. There has been a concerted effort to expand the roster of contributors, while still being plugged into national politics, during a tumultuous few years. At a time when ratings for many scheduled TV programmes are under strain, just maintaining the show's current audience and editorial integrity, while reflecting a changing country and occasionally creating real news, may well count as success. Bruce has worked at the BBC since 1990, when she began her career as a researcher on Panorama. The 54-year-old went on to become a reporter on the programme and also on Newsnight. Bruce also co-hosted Crimewatch on BBC One for eight years. In 2001, she became the first female presenter to be part of the BBC's general election studio team.

"This video can not be played The Bloodhound car was tested in Newquay, Cornwall, last year A 1,000mph race car project has been axed meaning the supersonic vehicle is on the market for the price of a Ferrari. TheBloodhound supersonic vehicle,external- built with a Rolls-Royce Eurofighter jet engine bolted to a rocket - is all but finished. The Bristol-based team behind it was aiming to beat the existing land speed world record of 763mph (1,228km/h). Driver Andy Green said the car was now available at a cost of about Â£250,000. It was set to go for the record-breaking speed in South Africa, where a 18km-long, 1,500m-wide track at Hakskeen Pan in the Northern Cape has been prepared for it. ""You're going to need to find a few million to get it running to full speed,"" said Mr Green who added he knew a team of engineers ""who could help"". ""We have basically completed the main structure, the desert is ready, we just need the funding."" Bloodhound Diary: It's going to get toasty Delay for Bloodhound high-speed trials First public runs for 1,000mph car Previous test runs at Newquay Airport in 2017 saw Bloodhound reach speeds of 200mph (320km/h). Mr Green said he would ""love to see the car run"" and said it was still possible that it could happen. ""If somebody is out there with a quarter of a million there is a car there. There is still a chance that Bloodhound could run. ""As far as Christmas presents go, that's the one I'd like."" Supporters have paid to have their names printed on the tail fin The main structure of the vehicle has been built already with ""shakedown"" tests a year ago working to plan. But failure to secure the investment forced the firm financing the project into administration. ""Since [then] we have worked tirelessly with the directors to identify a suitable individual or organisation who could take the project forward,"" joint administrator Andrew Sheridan said. Meet the fastest car ever made Building the world's fastest wheels ""Despite overwhelming public support, and engagement with a wide range of potential and credible investors, it has not been possible to secure a purchaser for the business and assets."" Mr Sheridan added: ""We will now work with key stakeholders to return the third-party equipment and then sell the remaining assets of the company to maximise the return for creditors."" Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Bloodhound is a private undertaking.It is funded through donation, sponsorship and partnership. It has excelled at leveraging all three, but ultimately this funding model has not delivered sufficient cash to fully sustain such a complex venture. The last two-to-three years have been an especially tough environment in which to raise financial support. The investment landscape is difficult, in part because of Brexit uncertainty, but principally because many large brands that might once have put their name on the side of a car to build awareness are now using other marketing tools, such as social media. The project had got to the point that the South African government had cleared an area of stones in which to attempt the record and several rockets that were to be used have proved their worth. Developed by the Norwegian aerospace and defence company Nammo, one was launched into space for the first time at the end of September. The Nucleus rocket flew to an altitude of 107km from the AndÃ¸ya Space Center. Bloodhound would use a cluster of three Nucleus motors in addition to the Eurofighter EJ200 jet. But ultimately, despite all of this being ready, there was not enough money to get to the final hurdle. The vehicle was tested at Newquay Airport The project has planned on running on Hakskeen Pan towards the end of 2019, when the water in the lakebed evaporated and the ground had become dry. The Bloodhound would have tested at 500-600mph (800-965km/h) before tests approaching its top speed in runs during 2020 or 2021. 1,000mph car hits financial roadblock Bloodhound Diary: It's going to get toasty Delay for Bloodhound high-speed trials First public runs for 1,000mph car 'Peak yet to come' as people told to wear masks to limit virus spread Bristol doctor jailed for attacking petrol pumps at M25 services Great British Pub Awards runner-up donates prize money to local charity âHotter than a Turbo Island bonfireâ Sound engineer crafts device to play records through digital set up X-Press makes a Mark on local charity Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Some Virgin Atlantic pilots will strike from 22 December to Christmas Day in a dispute over union recognition, the Professional Pilots Union has said. The union, which represents about a third of pilots at the airline, said it was excluded from talks over proposed changes to pilot benefits. It said this was the first of a series of one to four-day strikes it wants to hold until the dispute is resolved. Virgin Atlantic said it did not expect any disruption to its schedule. The PPU said 72% of its Virgin Atlantic members turned out for a ballot, and 71.5%  of those who voted backed strike action. The other strikes are planned for 30 December to 2 January and 4 January to 7 January inclusive. PPU spokesman Steve Johnson, a former Virgin pilot, said the union had conducted a work-to-rule action for two years to secure recognition by Virgin. He said it was the ""last straw"" when the union was left out of negotiations after Virgin Atlantic ""consistently refused to recognise the PPU as a legitimate and independent union"". ""We hope that Virgin acknowledge the mandate our members have given us, and help avoid strike action by recognising the PPU and halt the benefits review that is so damaging to our members long-term security,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Our door is - and has always been - open to Virgin to take the necessary steps to prevent any disruption for Christmas travellers."" Virgin Atlantic in talks to rescue Flybe Virgin Atlantic stops forced deportations Virgin Atlantic said a ""small number"" of its pilots had voted for industrial action.

"This video can not be played George Duke-Cohan's arrest by NCA officers was captured on a bodycam A teenager who sent thousands of hoax bomb threats to schools and triggered an American airline security scare has been jailed for three years. George Duke-Cohan, 19, sparked nationwide panic and a transatlantic investigation from the bedroom of his home in Watford, Hertfordshire. He pleaded guilty at Luton Crown Court in September to three counts of making hoax bomb threats. It followed an investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA). Duke-Cohan, of Mutchetts Close, caused widespread panic in March when he emailed more than 1,700 schools, colleges and nurseries across the UK to warn about an explosive. Hundreds of the schools were evacuated. He was arrested days later but in April, he sent another batch of hoax emails to schools in the US and UK. NCA investigators, working with the FBI, also found that while on bail for the bomb hoaxes, Duke-Cohan had made a fake report of a hijacked US-bound plane. Jailing him, Judge Richard Foster said: ""You knew exactly what you were doing and why you were doing it, and you knew full well the havoc that would follow. ""You were playing a game for your own perverted sense of fun in full knowledge of the consequences. ""The scale of what you did was enormous,"" he added. His defence barrister said psychology experts had described Duke-Cohen as very immature, but the prosecution said he craved attention from his followers on social media. Marc Horsfall, senior investigating officer with the NCA, said Duke-Cohan had few real friends and spent ""a great deal of his time online"". George Duke-Cohan's first hoax email was sparked by a disagreement over Minecraft He had no previous convictions and lived with his mother and sister, but was linked to a cyber-hacker group on Twitter calling itself the Apophis Squad. In January 2018, the IT student was expelled from West Herts College for issuing a bomb threat. Police were in the process of organising a community resolution order for his actions when ""events overtook them"" two months later, the NCA said. His first bomb hoax email was prompted by a disagreement with the owners of VeltPvP, a US-based server that allows users to play the game Minecraft. The email warned a student had entered schools with a bomb - and demanded $5,000 to be deposited in VeltPvP's account. More than 400 schools across the UK were evacuated before the email was dismissed as a hoax. Duke-Cohan was arrested at home within two days and his laptops, USB sticks and mobile phones were seized. His second batch of hoax emails did not contain a financial demand. A tweet from the Apophis Squad following Duke-Cohan's bogus hijacking claim It claimed pipe bombs were hidden on schools' premises and a car would be driven at students at home-time. One email sent to Marlborough College in Wiltshire said: ""We follow in the footsteps of our two heroes who died in the Columbine High School shooting."" Prosecutor Rebecca Austin said it was ""clear"" that Duke-Cohan used the influence of the Columbine attack of 1999 to add ""authenticity"". He was arrested for a second time and released on bail with conditions that he did not use electronic devices. But while on bail Duke-Cohan called San Francisco airport posing as the concerned father of a girl on board United Airlines flight UAL 949, claiming hijackers had taken over the flight from Heathrow to San Francisco. The aircraft - with 295 passengers on board - was quarantined at San Francisco airport for a full security check. A tweet sent after the plane landed included the words ""9/11 remake"". Duke-Cohan was arrested for a third time on 31 August. He was sentenced to one year in jail for the emails sent to schools and two years for the airport security scare. Judge Foster said that, for the purposes of sentencing, he accepted Duke-Cohan had autism spectrum disorder. He said what Duke-Cohan did was ""far removed from anything that could be described as naivety or a cry for help from a sick person"" and his ""fascination with computer hacking and your motivation of seeking notoriety is indicative of your high culpability"". Criminal psychologist Dr Samantha Lundrigan, of Anglia Ruskin University, said gamers like Duke-Cohan could easily become ""disassociated from reality"". ""His actions were ultimately selfish, indicative of someone who is self-absorbed, who sought retribution for a grievance and turned to the internet for control,"" she said. ""He will have had a power trip watching the chaos unfold, without feeling guilt or shame.""

"It's seemed almost hard to move anywhere without running into a minister on a mission - tasked to promote a Brexit plan that's widely judged to be doomed to defeat in the Commons on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the bars and the tea rooms in Parliament have been quietly humming with the sound of plotting and scheming. For some, about how to take control of Brexit. For others, how to grab the keys to Number Ten. While no-one can be sure of anything just now, none of the outcomes being discussed by MPs look anything but grim for the prime minister and her plan. Some MPs are wondering: might a narrow defeat next week mean she could try to squeeze more out of Brussels? She might try, but the signs are the EU's all out of big concessions. Ministers 'can still win over Brexit rebels' Would she even get the chance to try before she's forced out by her party? Labour's hope of forcing an election seems a little remote. There's more respect than support for Mrs May among Tories. Some senior Conservatives say, privately, the answer could be to choose a caretaker prime minister to carry on in some fresh direction. Meanwhile, rival leadership contenders are quietly getting ready to run - even to the point of promising jobs. One senior Tory told me he'd been offered a senior cabinet post by TWO of them in exchange for his support. And you can bet he's not the only one. There's still a chance the government pulls out of the big vote and, by so doing, buys a bit more time. There's another proposal by Labour MP and Brexit select committee chairman, Hilary Benn, to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and rule in a soft version. That would reunite some Brexiteers and Mrs May and maybe even limit the scale of any defeat. Yet more speculation, obviously. The prime minister will be mulling her options and her future this weekend. But those options, and maybe her time in office, could be running out.

"Lorries have been parked on the M20 in Kent during previous problems at Channel crossing points Bodies may remain uncollected and children might miss exams due to gridlocked roads in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a council has warned. In a damning report, Kent County Council warned about the effect on other key services. It said refuse could blight the streets and food deliveries could be disrupted as the county copes with 10,000 lorries parked or stacked on its roads. A government spokesman said it was providing support to local authorities. The 17-pagereport,external- an update on no-deal contingency planning -  laid bare the possible Brexit scenarios for the county, with ""prolonged disruption"" predicted to affect several vital services. It could result in staff shortages in areas such as social care, as well as problems for people trying to get to hospital and disruption to the delivery of medicines, the council said. The coroner service ""could face difficulties with the transport of the deceased to post mortem or body storage facilities... and travel by pathologists to mortuary to conduct post mortems"". The council report warns even more lorries may be stuck on Kent's roads in the event of a no-deal Brexit It goes on to say: ""Schools could be compromised if staff and pupils cannot effectively travel to exams."" Talking about waste management, the report said: ""District and borough collection services may be delayed and disrupted if there is significant traffic congestion, which could lead to a build up of waste awaiting collection."" Changes in the border at the cross-Channel terminals are likely to cause traffic congestion, with Kent's roads forecast to feel the brunt. The council warned it could exceed that of theproblems experienced in 2015, when almost 7,000 HGVs were contained on the M20 in Kent as part of Operation Stack. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the the Road Haulage Association, said the customs process in the event of a no-deal was ""alarming"". He said: ""If there's a slowing of that... people won't get the stuff when they want it because it won't be there. ""That's going to be catastrophic for us and the nation."" A government spokesman said: ""We have been working closely with Kent County Council - and all other local authorities - to make sure they have the support and resources they need to cope with Brexit in any scenario. ""That includes keeping the county's vital road networks moving so that local people, businesses, schools, and visitors face as little disruption as possible.""

"This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs? Ministers are trying to rally support for the PM's Brexit deal across the UK but a bid to find a compromise has been dismissed by the DUP and Brexiteers. With Theresa May widely expected to lose Tuesday's Commons vote, No 10 has dismissed calls for it to be delayed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said with two days of debate remaining, there was still time to win over MPs. But a Tory backbench amendment aimed at easing concerns about the controversial ""backstop"" has met with criticism. Downing Street has said the vote is still due to take place on Tuesday, despite dozens of Tories threatening to reject the deal, along with the DUP, whose support keeps Mrs May's government in power. Lib Dems in Commons bid for new Brexit vote 'Bodies uncollected' under no-deal Brexit Attempt to halt Brexit heard in High Court Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU But a senior minister has told the BBC ""the only political common sense is to delay"" it. The minister, who preferred not to be named, said: ""We need to find a solution and we can't find one by Tuesday."" Matt Hancock, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Scottish Secretary David Mundell are among those trying to sell it to the public in visits across the UK. Amid calls from some Tory and Labour MPs for the UK to pursue an even closer Norway-style relationship with the EU, Mr Lidington said it was wrong to assume there was a ""magic alternative"" waiting in the wings which retained the existing benefits of membership without the obligations. ""If it is not this deal which the rest of the EU says they are not willing to renegotiate, then either you crash out of the EU without any deal, without any transitional period or you revisit the referendum result of 2016 and you stay in the European Union,"" he said. The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by Parliament if it is to come into force. Pro and anti-Brexit campaigners stage protests at Westminster Many MPs have expressed concerns about the backstop, aimed at preventing a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, if no trade deal is ready before the end of the post-Brexit transition period. It would mean Northern Ireland staying aligned to some EU rules, which many MPs say is unacceptable. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement. Jeremy Corbyn told Euronews that in a Labour Brexit deal ""there certainly wouldn't be a backstop from which you can't escape"". ""We will have to come to an agreement on a customs union, a specific customs union with the European Union that does give us the opportunity to have a say in it all, but also guarantees that level of trade,"" the Labour leader said. Downing Street has dismissed reports the vote could be delayed. And Mr Hancock told the BBC that ""the best thing for the country"" was for MPs to back Mrs May's deal. ""My view is we should continue the debate,"" he said. ""We've had three days, there's two days more. I think we should make the argument, make the case and persuade people - that's what you have Parliamentary debate for."" This video can not be played Jo Johnson and Stephen Kinnock argue for and against an alternative Brexit option Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Education Secretary Damian Hinds acknowledged the government had ""a big job on"" to win Tuesday's vote, but appealed to MPs to back the deal ""in the national interest"". And Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said while the deal on offer was ""not perfect"" - it delivered on what people voted for. The prime minister has suggested that MPs could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to activate the backstop, and on Thursday night, a Tory backbench amendment was laid down intended to do that. The amendment - which is understood to have government support - would also give the devolved administrations, particularly the Northern Ireland Assembly, although it is currently suspended, more say in the process. It would also press the UK and EU to agree a future trade deal within a year of the implementation period ending. Former Northern Ireland minister Hugo Swire tabled the amendment along with Bob Neill and Richard Graham. This video can not be played Tory MP Lee Rowley explains why he will be voting against Theresa May's withdrawal deal Mr Swire told the BBC that many Tory MPs would like to see the backstop ""disappear altogether or be time limited"" but the European Commission had said it would not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, so the amendment was ""about the nearest we feel we can probe"". He said it was aimed at ""people like me, who would like to be able to support this deal but find they are unable to"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker dismissed the amendment: ""Giving Parliament the choice between the devil and the deep blue sea is desperate and will persuade very few."" And fellow backbencher Peter Bone told the BBC the amendment was ""absolutely meaningless"". DUP leader Arlene Foster tweeted: ""Domestic legislative tinkering won't cut it. The legally binding international withdrawal treaty would remain fundamentally flawed, as evidenced by the attorney general's legal advice."" Meanwhile, former cabinet minister Justine Greening has told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast that a Conservative Party ""that seems consumed by Brexit"" would lose the support of ""Middle England"". ""One of the problems for the Conservative Party is it's now 31 years since we last won a landslide and we need to realise as a party if things don't change, that'll be our last landslide,"" she said.

"A paedophile has been ordered to pay Â£127,000 to five Filipinos in a ""landmark"" case, after a judge decided he had sexually abused them. Douglas Slade has not been convicted of those offences and denies wrongdoing. The men's lawyer said the ""unprecedented"" High Court case ""provided a sense of vindication for the victims"". Slade, 77, who moved to the Philippines in 1985, wasjailed for 24 years in 2016 for abusing five boys in the UK. The judge in that case said Slade, who was extradited to the UK the previous year, was ""wholly unrepentant"" over the offences, committed between 1965 and 1980. Slade was a founder member of the Paedophile Information Exchange and actively campaigned for sex between children and paedophiles to be legalised in the 1970s and 1980s. He used to run a helpline for child sex abusers from his parents' home in Bristol. 'One of the vilest men in Britain' Slade lived in the Philippines for 30 years and, despite several investigations, there was no successful prosecution against him there. It is the first case where foreign victims have successfully claimed compensation against a British abuser, despite a failed attempt to prosecute him abroad, lawyer Alan Collins - representing the five Filipinos - said. The four young men and one teenage boy at the centre of this case sued Slade for ""personal injuries arising out of sexual abuse"" and gave evidence from Manila. The youngest was 10 at the time the abuse is alleged to have started. They lived in poverty and were allegedly groomed by Slade, who is said to have offered them money and chocolate after buying a house near a school. The payments the five will receive from Slade range from Â£20,000 to Â£35,000. Mr Collins, of law firm Hugh James, said: ""This landmark case is unprecedented for a High Court in London, showing how the legal system in England and Wales delivers justice for victims of sexual abuse whether they live in England or overseas. ""The judgement has finally provided a sense of vindication for the victims after Slade avoided justice for so many years through his lying and deception and I'm sure this case will set a precedent for others in a similar situation to seek justice."" Judge Mark Gargan published his ruling on Friday after analysing evidence at a recent High Court case in London. Slade had denied abusing the five, saying their allegations were a fabrication.

"Fashion chain Ted Baker's chief executive Ray Kelvin is to take a voluntary leave of absence amid allegations of harassment. Last week, an online petition launched by employees accused 62-year-old Mr Kelvin of inappropriate comments and behaviour,including ""forced hugging"". Ted Baker said its committee and board had been made aware of ""further serious allegations"" against Mr Kelvin. Mr Kelvin said the claims had raised ""serious and upsetting issues"". The company has appointed a law firm to conduct an independent external investigation. And chief operating officer Lindsay Page has been named acting chief executive. The firm said it would not be making any further comment about the nature of the allegations while they remained under investigation. The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence about at least ""50 recorded incidents of harassment"" at the fashion group. Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears. Mr Kelvin said the allegations had raised some ""very serious and upsetting issues"", and that it was ""only right"" Ted Baker's committee and board should investigate. ""Ted Baker has been my life and soul for 30 years,"" he said. ""I love this company and I care deeply for all my colleagues. It's for that reason that I have decided to take a temporary leave of absence. ""Ted Baker means everything to me and I can't bear to see it harmed in any way.""

"Protests have been taking place at over 280 schools across the country Anti-government protests in France have ""created a monster"", France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner has said. And he is warning that ""radical elements"" could infiltrate planned ""yellow vest"" protests at the weekend. Tourist sites in Paris are to close on Saturday amid fears of further street violence. The protests began three weeks ago, initially against a rise in fuel taxes but have spread to take in other issues, including education reforms. Mr Castaner said ""large-scale security measures"" would be put in place this weekend. Across France, 89,000 police officers will be on duty and armoured vehicles will be deployed in the capital, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced. Paris police have urged shops and restaurants on the Champs-Elysees to shut and some museums will also be closed.

A police officer was seriously injured at a student protest in Mulhouse, according to French broadcaster BFMTV.

There has also been widespread anger at images showing howpolice made high school students kneel and put their hands behind their headsfollowing clashes on Thursday in Mantes-la-Jolie, to the west of Paris.

He repeated an appeal for calm but added: ""We are facing people who are not here to protest, but to smash and we want to have the means not to give them a free rein.""

"Chancellor Merkel summed up what the CDU meant for her German Chancellor Angela Merkel has given an emotional farewell speech to her ruling Christian Democrats (CDU), as she steps down as party leader. She was speaking at a special party conference to elect her successor. She plans to stay Chancellor till 2021. Her preferred choice, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is in a run-off with millionaire lawyer Friedrich Merz. The former chief minister of Saarland received 450 votes to Mr Merz's 392 in a first round of votes on Friday. A third candidate, health minister Jens Spahn, received only 157 of the 999 votes cast in CDU's party conference in Hamburg. Counting from a second round of voting is now under way. Ms Merkel plans to serve out her full term as chancellor. All 999 CDU delegates, including Ms Merkel, cast their vote in cardboard voting cabins in their seats Ms Merkel's speech was punctuated by applause and she got a standing ovation of more than six minutes at the end. CDU delegates at the congress in Hamburg also held up signs saying ""Thanks boss"". Then the conservative party paid tribute to Ms Merkel, 64, with a video showing highlights from her 18-year CDU leadership. The soundtrack was the 1960s hit Days, by The Kinks. Race to succeed Merkel reaches climax Angela Merkel: Germany's shrewd political survivor Angela Merkel's quiet power Merkel career in pictures Ms Merkel was first elected chancellor in 2005 and is not seeking a fifth term beyond 2021. The video picked out qualities such as ""courage"" and ""chutzpah"" to describe Ms Merkel In her speech she warned of tough challenges ahead, including climate change, maintaining European unity and coping with Brexit. She reminded the CDU of other electoral successes last year, avoiding mention of this year's setbacks in state elections, which were heavy blows for her. ""I don't need to be party chairman to remain bound to this party. And I'm still chancellor,"" she said. She stressed that the CDU stood for human dignity, and praised the late US President George Bush Senior and late German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for reuniting Germany in 1990. She was at the funeral of George HW Bush on Wednesday. Speaking of the end of the Cold War, she told the CDU that ""at that decisive time he [Mr Bush] trusted Chancellor Kohl... he understood how politics must serve everyone"". She expressed ""overwhelming gratitude"" for having had the role of CDU leader. ""The future will test our values... we must always approach work joyfully,"" she said. The three candidates: Favourite Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (L), Friedrich Merz (C) and Jens Spahn The 56-year-old former prime minister of the state of Saarland was appointed CDU general secretary earlier this year and is the party favourite, polls suggest. Popular in Saarland and Berlin, she has an unpretentious style and a reputation for calm analysis, as well as political acumen. Her greatest strength is also her greatest weakness; she is a Merkel loyalist, perceived as someone who will replicate much of the chancellor's style and policy. The millionaire businessman was a powerful player in the CDU in the early 2000s but left politics when he fell out with the chancellor. Since then the 63-year-old lawyer - who has strong links to America - has built a career in the private sector and works for US investment firm Blackrock. He appeals to the more conservative and business-minded wing of the party and has the official backing of ex-Finance Minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble. The health minister is ambitious and, aged 38, the youngest of the three candidates. A former banker, he was once described by Mr SchÃ¤uble as ""one of the great hopes for the future of our party"". But Mr Spahn has ruffled feathers in the party and in the cabinet. Sharply conservative, Catholic and gay, he is a divisive figure for many.

"President Donald Trump has nominated William Barr to be the new attorney general, a post he held in the 1990s. By replacing Jeff Sessions, who was fired by Mr Trump last month, the 68-year-old will take charge of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. US media report he has been critical of some aspects of that inquiry. A well-known conservative lawyer, Mr Barr held the role under President George H W Bush from 1991 to 1993. The president called him a ""highly respected lawyer"" by both Republicans and Democrats and ""a terrific man"" while speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn. In the same statement, Mr Trump confirmed reports he is pushing for Heather Nauert to be the new US ambassador to the United Nations. Trump picks Heather Nauert for UN role This video can not be played 'A brilliant man, a smart, talented woman' - President Trump unveils his nominees for top posts Currently, Mr Barr is counsel at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm in Washington DC. If Mr Barr is confirmed by the senate after his official nomination, he will replace the current acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker. Mr Whitaker had been a controversial pick from the start due to his views on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry. Mr Trump has repeatedly lashed out at the investigation, calling it a ""witch hunt"". When he selected Mr Whitaker to replace Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the inquiry, Democrats feared Mr Whitaker would bring an end to the special counsel's work. Democrats say they will definitely press Mr Barr on his views regarding protecting Mr Mueller and his work, during his confirmation hearings. The Trump-Russia story - in 250 words Who's who in the Trump-Russia drama Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Analysis byAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On paper William Barr looks like a safe pick for US attorney general. Since serving under George HW Bush, he's spent most of his career as a corporate lawyer, so he's more than familiar with Washington's corridors of power. Mr Barr is the kind of nominee Senate Republicans - whose votes will be needed for confirmation - know and are comfortable with. He's not exactly a drain-the-Washington-swamp choice, but that has never been a priority in the gilded halls of the upper chamber of Congress. This, of course, is no normal time - and it didn't take long for interested parties to scour Mr Barr's recent comments and writings in search of any meaningful hints on how he would oversee Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Democrats won't be encouraged to learn that he expressed support for Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and recommended further investigation of Democrat Hillary Clinton. It's going to be months before Mr Barr receives a Senate vote, and the scouring will surely continue. Contentious confirmation hearings are all but a given. This, however, is a nomination that will be difficult for Democrats to derail. The 68-year-old Republican lawyer has an impressive political resume, spanning the CIA, White House and Department of Justice. Mr Barr holds degrees in government and Chinese studies from Columbia University. While studying law at George Washington University, he worked at the CIA from 1973-1977. As a young lawyer, he clerked for the DC appeals court. For a year, Mr Barr was a member of President Ronald Reagan's domestic policy staff at the White House; a role he eventually left to pursue corporate law. In 1989, he was appointed by President Bush to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. He was promoted to deputy attorney general next, and then to the top role. Mr Barr's official attorney general portrait by artist William Alan Shirley After passing his senate confirmation hearing unanimously, he served as the 77th US attorney general from 1991-1993. As the top US law official at that time, he oversaw Robert Mueller, who was then leading the department's criminal division. Mr Barr retired from his position as counsel and executive vice-president of Verizon in 2008. Mr Barr has voiced disapproval over some aspects of the inquiry but his views on the investigation's legitimacy remain unknown. He has said that Robert Mueller hired too many prosecutors with Democratic campaign ties for his investigative team -telling the Washington Post,externalhe ""would have liked to see [Mueller] have more balance"". Ina 2017 opinion piece for the Post,external, Mr Barr said Mr Trump had been right to fire FBI director James Comey because he ""crossed a line"" by announcing the outcome of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. He has also defended Mr Trump's desire for a criminal investigation against Hillary Clintonto the New York Times,external, adding that some of her actions merited an inquiry more than any Trump-Russia collusion. The Times has described Mr Barr as a lawyer with a vision for broad presidential powers, but also one who sees the attorney general's duty as avoiding political considerations. On Twitter, many are wondering why Mr Barr chose to accept the role again, and what he might make of Mr Trump's latest tweets deriding the Russian inquiry. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has already called for Mr Barr to firmly commit to protect Mr Mueller's investigation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

" In fear for her life, Kurt’s Jewish single mother fled Nazi Vienna for the UK in 1939, leaving him behind. This 14-year-old’s story of abandonment and adversity can be told for the first time, through recently discovered letters. It is mid-March 1939 and 14-year-old Kurt and his devoted Jewish single mother Hedwig are standing on the platform of a railway station in Nazi Vienna saying their tearful goodbyes. The destination of the impending journey is the UK, and the purpose is to escape the intensifying persecution of Austria’s Jewish citizens. Since December 1938, trains have been carrying Jewish children from Germany and German-annexed Europe to safety in the UK, thanks to the Kindertransport operation, a charity-run scheme sanctioned by the British Government. Many children have already fled Austria, leaving selfless parents behind to face an uncertain fate - in most cases, a barbaric death. Hedwig and Kurt, her only child, wave to each other one final time as the train steams away from the station. Then, pulling himself together, Kurt turns around and walks back into a hostile city. He will not be joining the children on the Kindertransport today. Instead, it is Hedwig who boards a regular train to safety. This is the starting point for a dramatic story told through letters from Kurt to Hedwig after she arrived in Market Harborough, a town in the East Midlands. Here she would be working as a household cook, after obtaining a domestic service visa of the type issued to 20,000 Jewish Austrian and German women intent on escaping the Nazis. Hedwig’s passport in 1939: Note the J for Jew The 40 letters, discovered in a loft in the UK earlier this year, have now been turned into an online exhibition by the Wiener Library Holocaust archive in London for what they add to our knowledge about the experience of pre-war refugees. The letters reveal that there was no prospect of a reunion between Kurt and Hedwig at the time of her departure. They trace Kurt’s loneliness, his increasing destitution and the harassment he faced because of his Jewish background. They also reveal how long he endured such conditions and the narrowness of his eventual escape. All of these were unexpected discoveries for me, Kurt’s son. Otto Kurt Pöllinger was born in Vienna in 1924 and lived in the centre of what was known as Vienna’s Jewish district, Leopoldstadt. His most cherished memories were of the frequent visits to his mother’s small home town of Gmünd, where her brothers were respected third-generation shopkeepers. It was around here, deep in Austria’s forested Waldviertel area, that he developed his love of the great outdoors and activities such as swimming and mushroom picking. Kurt’s life was unsettled in 1936 when his Catholic father Stefan and Jewish mother separated. They legally divorced in 1938. Stefan, who was said to have been unkind - although I didn’t discover the full extent of that until I found the letters - moved out of the family home. But the most testing times of Kurt’s childhood were yet to come. Hedwig and Kurt, in ‘Lederhosen’, outside the family shop in Gmünd, 1930 In March 1938, Nazi Germany annexed a none-too reluctant Austria, an event known as the Anschluss. This marked the first major territorial expansion for Germany in the run-up to World War Two. Life changed immediately for Austria’s Jewish inhabitants, who formed a greater proportion of the total population than in Germany. Most of Austria’s Jews lived in Vienna, a thriving hub of Jewish life in central Europe. They became subject to the hundreds of regulations and decrees already affecting those in Germany and which continued to grow. The legislation radically limited where they could work or study, what they could own, who they could marry and even where they could live and go. The aim was to deprive Jewish people of their rights, to the point that they did not qualify as citizens. Kurt personally witnessed the effect of such persecution. The family’s shop in Gmünd was swiftly expropriated and his uncles were forced to leave town for Vienna. He later described to me watching Jewish people in Vienna being humiliated by being forced to perform tasks such as scrubbing the streets. Many synagogues and Jewish shops were destroyed in his neighbourhood on Kristallnacht (or Night of the Broken Glass) in November 1938. A smashed Jewish shop window in Berlin (Getty) This period of violence, orchestrated by the Nazi authorities, also marked an uptick in the arbitrary arrests of Jews. More than 6,000 were incarcerated in Vienna, some probably in Kurt’s old school, which had been converted into a prison by the Gestapo, the feared secret police. Many inmates were sent from there to concentration camps. Around 60,000 of Austria’s Jews would be deported and murdered by the end of WW2 in 1945. The rest, a lucky but scarred 120,000 or so, managed to escape the country before the war started in September 1939. Hedwig would be among those, and the first in her immediate family to make it out. But this is where the record went quiet because neither Hedwig nor Kurt spoke much about their experiences from that time. Following their deaths in 1967 and 1990 respectively, I had resigned myself to the fact that the circumstances of their escapes to the UK would remain a mystery. But it turns out that Hedwig had kept a detailed record of this terrible time in the form of letters that, until earlier this year, only she and Kurt had known to exist. One evening in January 2018, I was in my mother’s new house looking through removals boxes for Hedwig’s old photo album and documents. I wanted to help an Austrian historian Dr Friedrich Polleross, who had once interviewed surviving family members for a book. He needed photography to illustrate his new book that focused on the vanished Jewish families of the Waldviertel. When I eventually found the album, the photos I remembered were all there - of Hedwig as a baby, posing in her finery with young friends in Gmünd, standing beside her husband with baby on knee, and eventually portraits of her alone with Kurti, as he was known affectionately. Then beneath where the album had lain, the lid of a battered 1940s-style white and gold chocolate box that I had never seen before caught my eye. I lifted the lid carefully to find 200 yellowing letters written in unfamiliar and impenetrable handwriting, packed inside haphazardly. Sifting through the letters that were mostly addressed to Hedwig and from the 1920s to 1940s, I could make out that many were signed Kurti and were dated between March and July 1939. Gripped by the realisation that they must contain important detail about the haziest period in my father’s biography, I stayed up until the early hours trying and failing to decipher them. Impatient to reveal their secrets, I set about finding someone to transcribe them that week. Postcard of Knabeninstitut Rosenhügel, Kurt’s school Once the transcriber got to work- feeding small batches of letters back to me over the course of a few frustrating weeks - the touching, nerve-wracking and troubling story began to take shape. Kurt surprised me by not begrudging Hedwig’s departure in his first letter, written on 18 March 1939. Instead, he tries to console her. “Don’t be sad, I will surely follow within four months,” he writes, despite the many challenges he was facing. It soon became apparent that for some weeks or months before Hedwig left, Kurt had been enrolled at a weekly boarding school in Vienna. He was only in school because his paternal grandparents were not Jewish, which classified him in discriminatory Nazi race law as a “Mischling”, or “half breed”. Kurt’s class photo, May 1939 His contemporaries with three or four Jewish grandparents were considered fully Jewish, whether they identified as such or not, and had been thrown out of mainstream education. Kurt describes spending the weekends with Hedwig’s sister Otti who was also based in Vienna. He was reluctant to spend any time with his unwelcoming father, who clearly resented Kurt’s attachment to Hedwig and had issues with custody arrangements that he thought favoured her. Kurt describes his father’s bad temper and language about Hedwig on 28 March after one encounter: “He cursed you in the nastiest and foulest ways,” he writes. As the letter transcripts arrived in order, I started to appreciate that Hedwig must have weighed certain factors when deciding whether to leave, and her decision was not as cold-hearted as it first appeared. There were some safeguards in place for Kurt. He was at school for most of the week, and his mother’s relatives were still in the picture. Despite this, he expressed his sadness early and often: “No-one is looking after me…I am so lonely,” he writes on 22 March. But later letters reveal that the teenager was able to spend some time not dwelling on his predicament. With his inquisitive mother clearly pressing him for details about his daily life, he writes: “I went walking with Eva (not my type, too homely),” on 16 April. But the safeguards were not going to last, with dire consequences as the next batch of letters would reveal. Kurt's father Stefan Kurt hated his school and not just because of the slop he complained of being served at mealtimes. He had to hide his origins and his mother’s location from his classmates and the teachers he mentions were Nazi party members. He reminded Hedwig constantly not to address any letters to the school, but his precautions were in vain. On 20 May, he reports that: “The boys are bullying me a lot; it seems they have got wind from somewhere that I am a Mischling.” In the beginning, Aunt Otti and Kurt’s two displaced uncles helped with his deficient nourishment, when they could get hold of food: “Jews aren’t allowed to buy fruit or meat here,” Kurt writes on 7 May. Otti offered Kurt a refuge from his troubles on weekends, and subject to the success of her own attempts to escape, offered a solution to the increasingly pressing problem that the school would be closing for summer, leaving Kurt without accommodation. Until, that is, anonymous anti-Semitic hate mail started to arrive at Otti’s house.  Kurt tells his mother that one such letter included a picture of Julius Streicher - Nazi party member and editor of the anti-Semitic journal Der Stürmer. Such help had to be curtailed because shockingly, as I learned in a note added by Otti to Kurt’s letter, the prime suspect was my grandfather. I had to revisit previous letters to try to piece together why. Around that time, Kurt reports that his father demanded that he break off contact with his mother or face consequences - a demand made when (or perhaps because) mother and son were highly vulnerable. When Kurt rejected the demand his father's anger was such that he told Kurt never to contact him again. In one letter, Kurt writes that his father had described his offer of an “Aryan upbringing” as superior to the one offered by Kurt’s mother. This, despite Hedwig’s secular outlook and the fact that Kurt had been baptised a Catholic, which were inadmissible factors for Nazis. It appears that my grandfather was now taking his anger to new levels and giving vent to his anti-Semitism. As no doubt intended, the anonymous letters only aggravated Kurt’s predicament because Otti was forced to stop letting him stay at her house. She feared being denounced to the authorities by Kurt’s father for breaking any of the many anti-Jewish regulations. Kurt tells Hedwig that he cannot approach his uncles for help because he fears for their safety even more, presumably because unlike Otti they had Jewish spouses. With nowhere to turn and dwindling financial reserves that also meant his clothes were disintegrating, Kurt writes on 24 May that he would be seeking out a park bench to sleep on. Almost 1,000 miles away, Hedwig must have been beside herself. So why did she seem to urge Kurt continually to try to see his father in the face of evidence of intimidation and rejection? The answer lay in the goal mother and son were each striving towards - a goal that formed the most common subject matter in the letters and one that became increasingly urgent as time passed: Kurt’s escape. Kurt and aunt Otti in Vienna in April 1939 If there was a plan, it was to try everything and anything to extract Kurt. From the beginning of her exile, Hedwig had been trying to get him a work-based visa and the kind of financial sponsorship necessary for this, or a place on a Kindertransport as her dependant. She was arguably better placed to do this when based in the UK. But it must have been exceedingly difficult with a full-time job, living in rural isolation and not speaking a word of English. By 30 April 1939, Hedwig’s employer Mrs Seaton had agreed to help by writing to the Kindertransport committee, sponsoring Kurt and finally setting about finding him a place of work. However, it was two months and many anxious letters before a possible candidate, a farm, would be found. Kurt desperately needed to get a passport. Without it, any progress his mother made would come to nothing. The problem was that he still needed his father’s permission to travel. Hedwig encouraged Kurt to stay in contact with him to lay the groundwork for the request, but as I had discovered, their relationship was going from bad to worse. I was on tenterhooks as I waited for the final instalments of letters from the transcriber. Hedwig with her five siblings and some of their spouses. Sister Helene Kompert (5th from the left) and Ella Müller (8th from the left) both died with their husbands in the Holocaust. In the front row is Hedwig’s mother and Kurt with a sling. Kurt’s father’s blunt refusal to talk eventually gave way to a promise to sign the relevant papers at the guardianship court after Kurt cornered his father at work. Kurt turned up at the court alone on 9 June full of hope, to find that his father had lied. “This low-life has of course not signed…my father doesn’t care about me,” he writes in a letter on the same day. An intervention from aunt Otti’s non-Jewish husband Stefan was decisive, but only after he was told that it was “shameful” that an Aryan like him should represent the Jewess Hedwig. Kurt’s father agreed to sign a document that absolved him of any further parental duties or school payments, meaning Stefan could authorise Kurt’s passport. “A heavy load has just been lifted from me,” writes Kurt on 25 June, and in happy anticipation of a reunion: “I think that you will recognise me: I have become a bit bigger and more manly but don’t yet look like Clark Gable.” Now the burden was entirely Hedwig’s. The farm placement had not yet materialised and Kurt pressed his mother to get an answer. On 28 June, a breakthrough made it unnecessary. The Quaker Society of Friends, a key Kindertransport organiser, told Kurt that he would be travelling on 11 July, but only if he could get all of his documents together. Otherwise, the next available place was mid-August, just two weeks before the war that he sensed was coming would start. “I am overjoyed,” he wrote to his mother when the news arrived. Kurt raced to comply and on 10 July, just one day before his scheduled departure on a Kindertransport, he got his passport. Having already endured parental separation, he was in the unusual position among his travelling companions of steaming towards a reunion. Most of the other children on the train, along with the almost 10,000 who made the same journey to safety on Kindertransports before war broke out, had, unbeknownst to them, said their final goodbyes before boarding. With the benefit of hindsight, leaving first was absolutely the right decision. Had Hedwig stayed, Kurt may not have found a place on a Kindertransport, although as a Mischling he would have been spared death, if not discrimination, in Austria. Wherever he was, Kurt would have been even more alone in the world because Hedwig would have faced the fate of two other sisters who died in Nazi camps. If at the outset of reading the letters I had expected to learn why Hedwig and Kurt may have found it hard to talk about this period in their lives, then by the end of the 100 pages I had unexpectedly discovered why Kurt may have avoided talking about his father, too. Hedwig had little choice for a decision that at first seemed callous, and her devotion to Kurt shone through in the letters. But the opposite could be said of my grandfather. I was troubled by the discovery that he was responsible for a great deal of the trauma and almost prevented the reunion. To cap it all, he had become sympathetic to the hate-filled ideology that takes the ultimate blame for Hedwig and Kurt’s predicament in 1939. But my most lasting impression from the letters is how an unshakeable bond between mother and son helped them to prevail in dark times so that they could be together again. I later found a chit issued by the Vienna authorities in the 1960s among Hedwig’s papers. She could never face going back but Kurt did, so it must have been from one of his visits. He had requested his father’s address and it had been provided. Who knows whether they met or what passed between them, but there was clearly unfinished business for Kurt long into adulthood. A great deal of this, no doubt, was from the period that he was alone in Vienna, caught between a Jewish mother and an anti-Semitic father at a time that this paradox had never been so consequential. Kurt and his cousin (Otti’s daughter) in April 1939 in Vienna.

"A paedophile has been ordered to pay Â£127,000 to five Filipinos in a ""landmark"" case, after a judge decided he had sexually abused them. Douglas Slade has not been convicted of those offences and denies wrongdoing. The men's lawyer said the ""unprecedented"" High Court case ""provided a sense of vindication for the victims"". Slade, 77, who moved to the Philippines in 1985, wasjailed for 24 years in 2016 for abusing five boys in the UK. The judge in that case said Slade, who was extradited to the UK the previous year, was ""wholly unrepentant"" over the offences, committed between 1965 and 1980. Slade was a founder member of the Paedophile Information Exchange and actively campaigned for sex between children and paedophiles to be legalised in the 1970s and 1980s. He used to run a helpline for child sex abusers from his parents' home in Bristol. 'One of the vilest men in Britain' Slade lived in the Philippines for 30 years and, despite several investigations, there was no successful prosecution against him there. It is the first case where foreign victims have successfully claimed compensation against a British abuser, despite a failed attempt to prosecute him abroad, lawyer Alan Collins - representing the five Filipinos - said. The four young men and one teenage boy at the centre of this case sued Slade for ""personal injuries arising out of sexual abuse"" and gave evidence from Manila. The youngest was 10 at the time the abuse is alleged to have started. They lived in poverty and were allegedly groomed by Slade, who is said to have offered them money and chocolate after buying a house near a school. The payments the five will receive from Slade range from Â£20,000 to Â£35,000. Mr Collins, of law firm Hugh James, said: ""This landmark case is unprecedented for a High Court in London, showing how the legal system in England and Wales delivers justice for victims of sexual abuse whether they live in England or overseas. ""The judgement has finally provided a sense of vindication for the victims after Slade avoided justice for so many years through his lying and deception and I'm sure this case will set a precedent for others in a similar situation to seek justice."" Judge Mark Gargan published his ruling on Friday after analysing evidence at a recent High Court case in London. Slade had denied abusing the five, saying their allegations were a fabrication.

"An effigy of Faye and Andrew Stephen's dead son, Alex, was made by staff at a Jamaican hotel Hotel staff created a ""horrifying"" effigy of a couple's dead son in a misguided attempt at a tribute. Karen Baker had arranged for workers at a Jamaican resort to dress a room for friends Faye and Andrew Stephens, whose son Alex died in 2014. Instead, she was left ""sweating and shaking"" when met by the sight of a body made out of clothes lying on the hotel bed. TUI UK refunded the family for the ""misunderstanding"". The Stephens, from Willesden, north-west London, have made an annual tradition of celebrating their son's birthday since his death, aged 22, in 2014. His godmother Ms Baker, from Hertfordshire, who was also on the trip, tipped two members of staff at the Royalton Jamaica Resort to secretly adorn the couple's bedroom with balloons and a cake. Instead, they created the effigy, replete with tears on its face and a can of lager clutched in its hand, next to petals spelling out ""We miss you Alex"". Mrs Baker, who first discovered the effigy, said she was ""utterly horrified"" and removed the dummy before her friends saw it. ""When I walked into the bedroom, all I can describe is a dummy body on the bed,"" she said. ""Staff had gone through my friend's wardrobe and stuffed the clothes with towels to make it look like a body on the bed. They even put tears down the face and a can of lager in his hand. ""I was absolutely horrified - as you can imagine I was sweating and shaking. We just didn't want our friends to see it. ""I have truly never seen anything like it. I still look at the photographs now and can't believe somebody thought to do that"", she said.

"Oxford and Cambridge are being accused of being so socially exclusive that they recruit more students from eight top schools than almost 3,000 other UK state schools put together. The Sutton Trust social mobility charity says the leading universities are failing to attract a wide enough range of talent. Trust founder Sir Peter Lampl said all young people needed a ""fair chance"". Oxford University said they were ""very aware"" that they ""must work harder"". The study examined Oxford and Cambridge admissions data between 2015 and 2017 and found a handful of schools, mostly private, disproportionately dominating the number of places awarded. The Sutton Trust says pupils from eight schools filled 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years, compared with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools. These 2,900 schools were those with historically few admissions to Oxbridge - and accounted for about three-quarters of secondary schools. In the past three years, Oxford and Cambridge admitted a total of 19,851 undergraduates, with the remainder of places coming from other private schools and top performing state schools and colleges. The charity was using anonymised admissions data - but it says it believes most of these eight places were private schools plus a couple of big state sixth-form colleges. Using published figures, among the schools and colleges with the highest number of Oxbridge admissions are: Westminster School, London(independent) - an average of 70-80 pupils each year have been offered places at Oxford and Cambridge in the last five years, the school says Eton College, Berkshire(independent) - in 2014, 82 students were accepted to Oxbridge. The following year 68 were accepted Hills Road Sixth Form College, Cambridge(state sixth form college) - an average 60 pupils receive Oxbridge offers, the school says St Paul's School, London(independent) - 53 students went to Oxbridge in 2016 and 41 in 2015 Peter Symonds College, Hampshire(state sixth form college) - an average of 48 students received offers from Oxbridge over the past three years St Paul's Girls' School, London(independent) - an average of 45 students went to Oxbridge each year between 2015 and 2017 King's College School, London(independent) - sent 48 students to Oxbridge in 2017 Magdalen College School, Oxford(independent) - 44 students went to Oxbridge in 2018 The research also found that high-achieving independent school pupils were twice as likely as state school pupils to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, even with the same ability and predicted grades. The report shows the imbalance in admissions: 7% of all UK pupils attend private schools 18% of those taking A-levels are at private school 34% of Oxbridge applications are from private school 42% of Oxbridge places go to private school pupils The study says there are some parts of the country where particularly few young state-educated people get places. These include: Halton Knowsley Lincolnshire North Lincolnshire Portsmouth Rochdale Rutland Salford Southampton Thurrock The study blames a lack of advice and guidance for applicants and calls for better information about what is required for entry and for admissions to take into account young people's backgrounds. ""If we are to ensure that all young people, regardless of their background, have a fair chance of getting in to our top universities, we need to address the patchwork of higher education guidance and support,"" said Sir Peter. ""All young people, regardless of what area they grow up in, or what school they go to, should have access to high quality personal guidance that allows them to make the best informed choices about their future."" William Baldwin, principal of non-selective state sixth form Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College (BHASVIC) said offers from Oxbridge ""began to snowball"" in recent years. Last year 57 students were offered Oxbridge places and 27 of those were from less affluent backgrounds. Mr Baldwin put the success down to dedicating college resources to admissions and employing a full-time co-ordinator of Oxbridge applications. Students self-select their interest in applying and then receive bespoke tutorial sessions on personal statements, extra-curricular activities and interview practice, he said. Andrew Halls, head master of selective independent school King's College School said his school also gave extra lessons and advice sessions to students wanting to apply to Oxbridge. The school sent 48 students to Oxbridge in 2017. He said the selective nature of the school played a part: ""These kids are very bright anyway. In January about 800 pupils will sit for about 80-90 places."" He also stressed the importance of teachers who could ""demystify"" the Oxbridge process. ""Schools like King's do understand the structures of Oxbridge because they've been historically sending children there for hundreds of years."" Martin Williams, Oxford University's pro-vice-chancellor for education, said the university accepted the need to do more to widen access. ""We are very much aware that Oxford must work harder to attract a more representative selection of students from across the UK,"" said Prof Williams. Biggest winners and losers from degrees Oxford University in Twitter row with David Lammy What is a fair university admissions system? Oxford runs summer schools to encourage more disadvantaged students to apply - and the university says there are plans to attract more students from places where it had recruited few students in the past. The university says it spends Â£7m per year on outreach schemes and is promising a new ""detailed action plan"" with changes to make sure there are places for students of ""outstanding potential from all backgrounds"". A spokesman for the University of Cambridge welcomed the idea that ""more support should be made available to students before they choose their A-level subjects and agree there should be more provision of careers advice"". But Cambridge rejected ""lowering grade requirements"", saying this would ""place unfair pressure on students and that is something the university cannot support"". Education Secretary Damian Hinds, speaking on Thursday, said leading universities should accept students with the new technical qualifications, known as T-levels. He said it would be an ""error"" to have a ""blanket rejection"" of young people applying with the new vocational exams, where they were relevant. Oxford University says it is waiting to see how the T-levels develop before making a decision. Mr Hinds was launching plans for an overhaul of vocational education - saying such exams needed to be of sufficiently high quality to be held in the same esteem as A-levels and academic qualifications. He warned of a ""plethora of mediocre"" qualifications that were not well understood by either the public or employers but said, he wanted to remove ""false barriers"" between academic and vocational qualifications and that both could be routes into higher education. On the Sutton Trust report, Mr Hinds said: ""Whilst potential and talent is evenly spread, the opportunities to make the most of it sometimes aren't. ""I want universities to work with us, consider the data carefully and look at their own admissions policies to work out what can be done to ensure that their university is open to everyone who has the potential, no matter their background or where they are from."" Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of leading universities, said: ""We want to recruit students with potential and drive, regardless of background, and we are working hard to improve social mobility.""

"Jamie Acourt was never convicted of any offence relating to Stephen Lawrence's death A suspect in the 1993 racist murder of Stephen Lawrence has been jailed for nine years for conspiring to supply ""huge quantities"" of cannabis resin. Jamie Acourt, 42, pleaded guiltyon the second day of his trial after previously denying the charge. Acourt, originally from Eltham, south-east London, had fled to Spain where he was living under the alias ""Simon Alfonzo"" until his arrest in May. He was sentenced at Kingston Crown Court. Acourt was never convicted of the racist attack on Mr Lawrence and has always denied any involvement. Jurors had been told of the allegation against him and warned they should consider him solely on the trial's evidence. In 2012,Gary Dobson and David Norris were convictedat the Old Bailey of murdering Mr Lawrence and jailed for life. Jamie Acourt was one of the five named suspects of killing black teenager Stephen Lawrence Acourt pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to supply drugs in the period between 1 January 2014 and 2 May 2015. His 43-year-old brother Neil Acourt has already been jailed for more than six years for the same drugs plot. Prosecutors believe both brothers were ringleaders and they enlisted family members to the scheme that saw drugs transported between London and South Shields, Tyne and Wear. Both Acourts were arrested after the racist stabbing of 18-year-old Mr Lawrence by a gang of white men in Eltham, but have always denied involvement. Acourt was arrested by armed officers as he left a gym in Barcelona on 4 May Acourt had spent more than two years on the run until his arrest in May, during which he lived in Spain under the alias ""Simon Alfonzo"". He fled the country after police raided the home where he lived with his partner and their two children in Bexley, south-east London, in February 2016. On 4 May this year Acourt was arrested by armed officers as he left a gym in Barcelona and extradited back to Britain.

"Lorries have been parked on the M20 in Kent during previous problems at Channel crossing points Bodies may remain uncollected and children might miss exams due to gridlocked roads in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a council has warned. In a damning report, Kent County Council warned about the effect on other key services. It said refuse could blight the streets and food deliveries could be disrupted as the county copes with 10,000 lorries parked or stacked on its roads. A government spokesman said it was providing support to local authorities. The 17-pagereport,external- an update on no-deal contingency planning -  laid bare the possible Brexit scenarios for the county, with ""prolonged disruption"" predicted to affect several vital services. It could result in staff shortages in areas such as social care, as well as problems for people trying to get to hospital and disruption to the delivery of medicines, the council said. The coroner service ""could face difficulties with the transport of the deceased to post mortem or body storage facilities... and travel by pathologists to mortuary to conduct post mortems"". The council report warns even more lorries may be stuck on Kent's roads in the event of a no-deal Brexit It goes on to say: ""Schools could be compromised if staff and pupils cannot effectively travel to exams."" Talking about waste management, the report said: ""District and borough collection services may be delayed and disrupted if there is significant traffic congestion, which could lead to a build up of waste awaiting collection."" Changes in the border at the cross-Channel terminals are likely to cause traffic congestion, with Kent's roads forecast to feel the brunt. The council warned it could exceed that of theproblems experienced in 2015, when almost 7,000 HGVs were contained on the M20 in Kent as part of Operation Stack. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the the Road Haulage Association, said the customs process in the event of a no-deal was ""alarming"". He said: ""If there's a slowing of that... people won't get the stuff when they want it because it won't be there. ""That's going to be catastrophic for us and the nation."" A government spokesman said: ""We have been working closely with Kent County Council - and all other local authorities - to make sure they have the support and resources they need to cope with Brexit in any scenario. ""That includes keeping the county's vital road networks moving so that local people, businesses, schools, and visitors face as little disruption as possible.""

"This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs? Ministers are trying to rally support for the PM's Brexit deal across the UK but a bid to find a compromise has been dismissed by the DUP and Brexiteers. With Theresa May widely expected to lose Tuesday's Commons vote, No 10 has dismissed calls for it to be delayed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said with two days of debate remaining, there was still time to win over MPs. But a Tory backbench amendment aimed at easing concerns about the controversial ""backstop"" has met with criticism. Downing Street has said the vote is still due to take place on Tuesday, despite dozens of Tories threatening to reject the deal, along with the DUP, whose support keeps Mrs May's government in power. Lib Dems in Commons bid for new Brexit vote 'Bodies uncollected' under no-deal Brexit Attempt to halt Brexit heard in High Court Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU But a senior minister has told the BBC ""the only political common sense is to delay"" it. The minister, who preferred not to be named, said: ""We need to find a solution and we can't find one by Tuesday."" Matt Hancock, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Scottish Secretary David Mundell are among those trying to sell it to the public in visits across the UK. Amid calls from some Tory and Labour MPs for the UK to pursue an even closer Norway-style relationship with the EU, Mr Lidington said it was wrong to assume there was a ""magic alternative"" waiting in the wings which retained the existing benefits of membership without the obligations. ""If it is not this deal which the rest of the EU says they are not willing to renegotiate, then either you crash out of the EU without any deal, without any transitional period or you revisit the referendum result of 2016 and you stay in the European Union,"" he said. The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by Parliament if it is to come into force. Pro and anti-Brexit campaigners stage protests at Westminster Many MPs have expressed concerns about the backstop, aimed at preventing a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, if no trade deal is ready before the end of the post-Brexit transition period. It would mean Northern Ireland staying aligned to some EU rules, which many MPs say is unacceptable. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement. Jeremy Corbyn told Euronews that in a Labour Brexit deal ""there certainly wouldn't be a backstop from which you can't escape"". ""We will have to come to an agreement on a customs union, a specific customs union with the European Union that does give us the opportunity to have a say in it all, but also guarantees that level of trade,"" the Labour leader said. Downing Street has dismissed reports the vote could be delayed. And Mr Hancock told the BBC that ""the best thing for the country"" was for MPs to back Mrs May's deal. ""My view is we should continue the debate,"" he said. ""We've had three days, there's two days more. I think we should make the argument, make the case and persuade people - that's what you have Parliamentary debate for."" This video can not be played Jo Johnson and Stephen Kinnock argue for and against an alternative Brexit option Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Education Secretary Damian Hinds acknowledged the government had ""a big job on"" to win Tuesday's vote, but appealed to MPs to back the deal ""in the national interest"". And Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said while the deal on offer was ""not perfect"" - it delivered on what people voted for. The prime minister has suggested that MPs could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to activate the backstop, and on Thursday night, a Tory backbench amendment was laid down intended to do that. The amendment - which is understood to have government support - would also give the devolved administrations, particularly the Northern Ireland Assembly, although it is currently suspended, more say in the process. It would also press the UK and EU to agree a future trade deal within a year of the implementation period ending. Former Northern Ireland minister Hugo Swire tabled the amendment along with Bob Neill and Richard Graham. This video can not be played Tory MP Lee Rowley explains why he will be voting against Theresa May's withdrawal deal Mr Swire told the BBC that many Tory MPs would like to see the backstop ""disappear altogether or be time limited"" but the European Commission had said it would not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, so the amendment was ""about the nearest we feel we can probe"". He said it was aimed at ""people like me, who would like to be able to support this deal but find they are unable to"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker dismissed the amendment: ""Giving Parliament the choice between the devil and the deep blue sea is desperate and will persuade very few."" And fellow backbencher Peter Bone told the BBC the amendment was ""absolutely meaningless"". DUP leader Arlene Foster tweeted: ""Domestic legislative tinkering won't cut it. The legally binding international withdrawal treaty would remain fundamentally flawed, as evidenced by the attorney general's legal advice."" Meanwhile, former cabinet minister Justine Greening has told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast that a Conservative Party ""that seems consumed by Brexit"" would lose the support of ""Middle England"". ""One of the problems for the Conservative Party is it's now 31 years since we last won a landslide and we need to realise as a party if things don't change, that'll be our last landslide,"" she said.

"This video can not be played George Duke-Cohan's arrest by NCA officers was captured on a bodycam A teenager who sent thousands of hoax bomb threats to schools and triggered an American airline security scare has been jailed for three years. George Duke-Cohan, 19, sparked nationwide panic and a transatlantic investigation from the bedroom of his home in Watford, Hertfordshire. He pleaded guilty at Luton Crown Court in September to three counts of making hoax bomb threats. It followed an investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA). Duke-Cohan, of Mutchetts Close, caused widespread panic in March when he emailed more than 1,700 schools, colleges and nurseries across the UK to warn about an explosive. Hundreds of the schools were evacuated. He was arrested days later but in April, he sent another batch of hoax emails to schools in the US and UK. NCA investigators, working with the FBI, also found that while on bail for the bomb hoaxes, Duke-Cohan had made a fake report of a hijacked US-bound plane. Jailing him, Judge Richard Foster said: ""You knew exactly what you were doing and why you were doing it, and you knew full well the havoc that would follow. ""You were playing a game for your own perverted sense of fun in full knowledge of the consequences. ""The scale of what you did was enormous,"" he added. His defence barrister said psychology experts had described Duke-Cohen as very immature, but the prosecution said he craved attention from his followers on social media. Marc Horsfall, senior investigating officer with the NCA, said Duke-Cohan had few real friends and spent ""a great deal of his time online"". George Duke-Cohan's first hoax email was sparked by a disagreement over Minecraft He had no previous convictions and lived with his mother and sister, but was linked to a cyber-hacker group on Twitter calling itself the Apophis Squad. In January 2018, the IT student was expelled from West Herts College for issuing a bomb threat. Police were in the process of organising a community resolution order for his actions when ""events overtook them"" two months later, the NCA said. His first bomb hoax email was prompted by a disagreement with the owners of VeltPvP, a US-based server that allows users to play the game Minecraft. The email warned a student had entered schools with a bomb - and demanded $5,000 to be deposited in VeltPvP's account. More than 400 schools across the UK were evacuated before the email was dismissed as a hoax. Duke-Cohan was arrested at home within two days and his laptops, USB sticks and mobile phones were seized. His second batch of hoax emails did not contain a financial demand. A tweet from the Apophis Squad following Duke-Cohan's bogus hijacking claim It claimed pipe bombs were hidden on schools' premises and a car would be driven at students at home-time. One email sent to Marlborough College in Wiltshire said: ""We follow in the footsteps of our two heroes who died in the Columbine High School shooting."" Prosecutor Rebecca Austin said it was ""clear"" that Duke-Cohan used the influence of the Columbine attack of 1999 to add ""authenticity"". He was arrested for a second time and released on bail with conditions that he did not use electronic devices. But while on bail Duke-Cohan called San Francisco airport posing as the concerned father of a girl on board United Airlines flight UAL 949, claiming hijackers had taken over the flight from Heathrow to San Francisco. The aircraft - with 295 passengers on board - was quarantined at San Francisco airport for a full security check. A tweet sent after the plane landed included the words ""9/11 remake"". Duke-Cohan was arrested for a third time on 31 August. He was sentenced to one year in jail for the emails sent to schools and two years for the airport security scare. Judge Foster said that, for the purposes of sentencing, he accepted Duke-Cohan had autism spectrum disorder. He said what Duke-Cohan did was ""far removed from anything that could be described as naivety or a cry for help from a sick person"" and his ""fascination with computer hacking and your motivation of seeking notoriety is indicative of your high culpability"". Criminal psychologist Dr Samantha Lundrigan, of Anglia Ruskin University, said gamers like Duke-Cohan could easily become ""disassociated from reality"". ""His actions were ultimately selfish, indicative of someone who is self-absorbed, who sought retribution for a grievance and turned to the internet for control,"" she said. ""He will have had a power trip watching the chaos unfold, without feeling guilt or shame.""

"Queues of lorries left residents near the Port of Dover unable to get out to buy basic supplies in 2015 Dover and other Channel ports face disruption for up to six months if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, ministers have said. The ""worst case scenario"" warning,externalcomes after analysis of likely traffic flows, if customs checks are delayed. Lorries carrying medicine could get priority at ports and planes used to fly in drugs, ministers said. But Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said it was ""Project Fear on steroids,"" ahead of Tuesday's big Brexit vote. He told the BBC: ""It's the last throw of the dice from the prime minister who is desperate to get MPs to vote for her withdrawal agreement."" The prime minister's claim that the alternative to the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU is a no-deal Brexit, has so far failed to convince many of her own MPs. Ministers 'can still win over Brexit rebels' Piennar: Plotting and scheming afoot as PM's options narrow 'Bodies uncollected' under no-deal Brexit Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Health Secretary Matt Hancock was among ministers trying to promote the deal on Friday, ahead of Tuesday's Commons vote, which the PM is widely expected to lose. He told the BBC: ""I don't know how likely 'no deal' is. It is what happens automatically unless Parliament passes something else. ""I very strongly feel that the best thing for the country, not just for the health service but for the country as a whole, is for Theresa May's deal to pass."" Lib Dems in Commons bid for new Brexit vote Brexit campaign prepares for referendum Updated advice to government departments from officials warns there could be six months of reduced access and delays at Dover and Folkestone, if the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 without a deal. By BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym Drug companies were told in August by the government to create stockpiles in the UK with six weeks worth of supplies. That has largely been achieved although there has not been so much progress with medical devices. But pharma bosses believe the government should do more to ensure continuity of supply and ministers should give more detail of plans to fast-track lorries through ports. Some may be suspicious about the timing of this with political debate over Brexit raging - government sources say the warning is based on analysis of trading patterns by officials which could not be withheld from Whitehall departments. Mr Hancock has written to health leaders, telling them to check their plans for ensuring the continued supply of medicines. Current advice is that there should be a six-week stockpile of medicines in the UK to cover the possibility of disruption after a no-deal Brexit. About 90% of medicines imported by the UK and the Republic of Ireland come in through Dover. This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs? The health secretary said the ""worst-case planning assumption"" meant that ""whilst the six-week stockpiling activities remain a critical part of our contingency plans, this now needs to be supplemented with additional actions"". He said the NHS should prepare to use alternative routes in the event of disruption on cross-channel routes, including the use of planes to fly in supplies. He wrote that if France or other EU countries imposed additional border checks in a no-deal scenario, the impact was ""likely to be felt mostly on the short straits crossings into Dover and Folkestone"" affecting both exports and imports, with ""significantly reduced access"" for up to six months. ""This is very much a worst-case scenario. In a 'no deal' exit from the EU we would, of course, be pressing member states hard to introduce pragmatic arrangements to ensure the continued full flow of goods which would be to their benefit as well as ours."" This video can not be played Dover council has three concerns over the impact of Brexit Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said the government warning was ""stark"" adding that ""stockpiling more medicines is not the solution to this problem"". He welcomed the intention to prioritise the flow of medicines and vaccines, but added, with just four months to go, ""we need the government to take immediate action to open up alternative supply routes between the UK and Europe and tell companies so that they can make plans"". Kent County Council has warned that dead bodies may remain uncollected and children might miss exams due to gridlocked roads in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In an update,externalon its contingency planning, the local authority said refuse could blight the streets and food deliveries could be disrupted as the county copes with 10,000 lorries parked or stacked on its roads. Council leader Paul Carter said preparations had been made for potential difficulties but added: ""We now need far more input and information from national government in how they are going to work with us. ""There must be a national freight transport plan which, when necessary, can hold lorries back from coming into Kent in the first place should the need arise."" The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by Parliament if it is to come into force. With many of her own MPs opposing the deal, particularly the controversial issue of the ""backstop"", aimed at preventing the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, Mrs May is expected to lose Tuesday's vote on the deal. One senior minister has told the BBC ""the only political common sense is to delay"" it - but Downing Street has said it will go ahead as planned.

"Listen to the prime minister this morning and you hear a leader looking for a way out. Dozens and dozens of her MPs are set to vote against her, largely because they don't like a fiddly bit of a big package of proposals. What should she do then? No surprise, fiddle with the fiddly bit. What Theresa May sketched out on Thursday was the idea of allowing MPs to choose when and if they want to go into the controversial ""backstop"" - the insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland. You can read more abouthow that would work here. May 'looking at MPs' role on backstop Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU Clearly, to try to get some angry Brexiteers to change their minds, the PM is trying to give a sense that they might have more of a say. They could, as the agreement already suggests, just extend the ""transition period"", giving the two sides longer to come up with a free trade deal that would mean the dreaded backstop is never used. It's not surprising that MPs would have a vote on that. But Number 10 clearly hopes it will give some grumpy MPs a sense that they will have more of a say, introducing another layer of decision-making so that the backstop can be avoided. There are problems here though. If all the PM is offering Brexiteers is a future choice between the backstop or extending the status quo, then that's not tempting or particularly meaningful for them. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. All it says is: If you don't like the backstop, well, you can choose to stay longer in the EU (remember during the transition period things essentially don't change very much.) And as a sceptical EU source points out, it's not just their decision anyway. And it doesn't sound like she is willing to give them a more dramatic choice - extend the transition period, go into the backstop or leave without it. How could she, when it's taken two years to agree on this central part of a legal deal with Brussels? There is another scheme being talked about too, which seeks to make the backstop more palatable if we are in it. Number 10 is talking to MPs about whether they could give Parliament an annual vote on the backstop, to approve the arrangement or not. Now, again, my sceptical EU source points out there is no way that the UK would have a veto on its own. But political signalling can make a difference. And frankly at this stage, anything that could make the next week less painful for Number 10 might seem worth pursuing to them. If it's only a fig leaf, then it won't move very many MPs. Any compromise would emerge as an amendment from a backbencher, not in the name of the government. But if it is more dramatic, then Brussels is not likely to tolerate it. Fiddling around could help the prime minister cut the chances or scale of defeat next week. But it might prove only a holding position until she has to do something more fundamental.

"The pay gap left Meenakshi Sarkar feeling depressed and devalued When Meenakshi Sarkar landed a job as a teaching fellow at Leeds University after a successful career in business in India, she was delighted. But the university put her on the lowest possible academic pay band, leaving her struggling financially. It became clear that colleagues were paid more for similar work, leaving her feeling ""depressed and devalued"". ""I feel like everyone else is running a 100m sprint and I'm running a steeplechase alongside them,"" she says. ""It's not an equal race."" Ms Sarkar's frustration is not unusual, according to data obtained by BBC News under Freedom of Information law. The BBC sent FOI requests to all 24 universities in the Russell Group of highly selective, research-based universities, and 22 responded. At these universities, the data showed average salaries of: Â£52,000 for white academics Â£38,000 for black academics Â£37,000 for academics from an Arab background This means that black and Arab academics at the UK's top universities earn an average 26% less than white colleagues. And female academics fare even worse, with an ethnicity pay gap on top of the gender pay gap. The pay gap is smaller for other Asian and mixed-heritage academics. The Russell Group said it was unable to comment on individual universities' recruitment practices. But Leeds University said it took the issue ""very seriously"". ""This is why we are committed to ensuring that black and minority ethnic staff are employed at all levels and to reducing any pay gap arising from our current representation across the grades."" Pay gaps can be caused by unequal pay, which is illegal, or by a group of staff tending to be in lower paid jobs or in part-time work. The new data suggests that ethnic minority academics are less likely than white men or women to be promoted to better paid, senior positions. They also tend to be in lower pay bands. The data shows the gender pay gap is more pronounced for ethnic minority women at Russell Group universities where white male staff are on average salaries of Â£55,000. On average, compared with white men: white women got 15% less Asian women, 22% less black women, 39% less Prof Akwugo Emejulu, of Warwick University, is one of just 26 black women professors in the UK. She says she attained her current position in the sociology department at Warwick University despite experiencing ""racist and sexist bullying"" throughout her career. ""One of the reasons for the gap is that black women in particular tend to be on temporary teaching-only contracts that trap them in low waged work with few opportunities to move on to permanent positions,"" she told the BBC. The BBC data shows that at Warwick, ethnic minority academics are paid an average 25% less than their white colleagues, amounting to over Â£14,500. White academics at Warwick receive an average salary of Â£59,000 but the 215 identifying as Asian get 27% less and the 25 black academics earn 39% less. But the university says its own analysis shows the gap is in fact just 15.5% although it agrees ""there is much room for improvement"". ""We at Warwick are actively looking at the best ways to identify where the barriers are to help us reduce the ethnic minority pay gap."" The university says the approach is paying off, with 28% of its early career academic staff identifying as black or minority ethnic. The former Universities Minister and Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy said the figures showed universities needed to ""take a look in the mirror and realise that more needs to be done to both widen access at undergraduate level and to keep and retain a diverse cohort right through to PhDs, professorships and the very top of these institutions"". Across the Russell Group universities that responded, the BBC found that there are: More than 49,000 White academic staff Three thousand Chinese and East Asian Three thousand Indian and South Asian Just over 600 Black and only 250 from Arab backgrounds Disclosing ethnicity is not mandatory and about one in six academic staff had refused to declare their ethnicity to their employers  so their data is not included. The figures disclosed to the BBC came as the government revealed plans to make ethnicity pay reporting mandatory for companies with more than 250 employees. This story has been updated as initial data provided by Glasgow University was incorrect.

"Mobile operator O2 has said it will compensate its customers following a day of disruption to its data networks. Customers with a monthly subscription will be refunded the cost of two days' service by the end of January. Pay As You Go customers will get 10% extra when they top up their phone in the new year or 10% off when they buy data for mobile broadband devices. On Thursday, O2 issued a joint apology with mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson for the shutdown. The compensation for customers on monthly subscriptions includes small businesses and mobile broadband users. Business customers are advised to contact their O2 corporate account manager to discuss compensation. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Tesco, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Luke Stagg runs a plumbing business and depends on his phone, but could not get through to customers or use his sat nav. He said he would never know how many jobs he had missed out on during Thursday. In addition, he could not contact those he was supposed to be visiting, and his day was wasted. ""I'm 36 years old, so I know how to use a map, but I could not make calls,"" he said. ""Mine was not a proper emergency but there is a wider point - I want to know what happens if it went down for even longer."" O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption He said when he lost data coverage on a previous occasion, he was offered vouchers to use in the O2 shop. However, he was not impressed with the offer. Mischa Bittar, also a plumber, said he had been ""unable to contact any of my engineers or customers via email, unable to use our mobile systems to contact any engineers at all, so everyone's just had to down tools"". ""A lot of money lost and the first thing I know about it is via the BBC website, no contact from O2 at all - disappointing,"" he added. Omeran Amirat said he had lost bids for presents he was supposed to be buying for his children on internet auction site eBay. However, it is unlikely that he will receive compensation from O2 for this. Ericsson president BÃ¶rje Ekholm said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added. O2 said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. It is the company that bills customers, so it holds the responsibility for compensation. Mr French, of Which?, said the company should ""do the right thing"" for customers, with the option of offering additional perks alongside refunds. Many people would have used public-access wi-fi if they were unable to access data through the O2 network. Mr French said this created additional risks if people were exposing personal information on these networks.

"This video can not be played George Duke-Cohan's arrest by NCA officers was captured on a bodycam A teenager who sent thousands of hoax bomb threats to schools and triggered an American airline security scare has been jailed for three years. George Duke-Cohan, 19, sparked nationwide panic and a transatlantic investigation from the bedroom of his home in Watford, Hertfordshire. He pleaded guilty at Luton Crown Court in September to three counts of making hoax bomb threats. It followed an investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA). Duke-Cohan, of Mutchetts Close, caused widespread panic in March when he emailed more than 1,700 schools, colleges and nurseries across the UK to warn about an explosive. Hundreds of the schools were evacuated. He was arrested days later but in April, he sent another batch of hoax emails to schools in the US and UK. NCA investigators, working with the FBI, also found that while on bail for the bomb hoaxes, Duke-Cohan had made a fake report of a hijacked US-bound plane. Jailing him, Judge Richard Foster said: ""You knew exactly what you were doing and why you were doing it, and you knew full well the havoc that would follow. ""You were playing a game for your own perverted sense of fun in full knowledge of the consequences. ""The scale of what you did was enormous,"" he added. His defence barrister said psychology experts had described Duke-Cohen as very immature, but the prosecution said he craved attention from his followers on social media. Marc Horsfall, senior investigating officer with the NCA, said Duke-Cohan had few real friends and spent ""a great deal of his time online"". George Duke-Cohan's first hoax email was sparked by a disagreement over Minecraft He had no previous convictions and lived with his mother and sister, but was linked to a cyber-hacker group on Twitter calling itself the Apophis Squad. In January 2018, the IT student was expelled from West Herts College for issuing a bomb threat. Police were in the process of organising a community resolution order for his actions when ""events overtook them"" two months later, the NCA said. His first bomb hoax email was prompted by a disagreement with the owners of VeltPvP, a US-based server that allows users to play the game Minecraft. The email warned a student had entered schools with a bomb - and demanded $5,000 to be deposited in VeltPvP's account. More than 400 schools across the UK were evacuated before the email was dismissed as a hoax. Duke-Cohan was arrested at home within two days and his laptops, USB sticks and mobile phones were seized. His second batch of hoax emails did not contain a financial demand. A tweet from the Apophis Squad following Duke-Cohan's bogus hijacking claim It claimed pipe bombs were hidden on schools' premises and a car would be driven at students at home-time. One email sent to Marlborough College in Wiltshire said: ""We follow in the footsteps of our two heroes who died in the Columbine High School shooting."" Prosecutor Rebecca Austin said it was ""clear"" that Duke-Cohan used the influence of the Columbine attack of 1999 to add ""authenticity"". He was arrested for a second time and released on bail with conditions that he did not use electronic devices. But while on bail Duke-Cohan called San Francisco airport posing as the concerned father of a girl on board United Airlines flight UAL 949, claiming hijackers had taken over the flight from Heathrow to San Francisco. The aircraft - with 295 passengers on board - was quarantined at San Francisco airport for a full security check. A tweet sent after the plane landed included the words ""9/11 remake"". Duke-Cohan was arrested for a third time on 31 August. He was sentenced to one year in jail for the emails sent to schools and two years for the airport security scare. Judge Foster said that, for the purposes of sentencing, he accepted Duke-Cohan had autism spectrum disorder. He said what Duke-Cohan did was ""far removed from anything that could be described as naivety or a cry for help from a sick person"" and his ""fascination with computer hacking and your motivation of seeking notoriety is indicative of your high culpability"". Criminal psychologist Dr Samantha Lundrigan, of Anglia Ruskin University, said gamers like Duke-Cohan could easily become ""disassociated from reality"". ""His actions were ultimately selfish, indicative of someone who is self-absorbed, who sought retribution for a grievance and turned to the internet for control,"" she said. ""He will have had a power trip watching the chaos unfold, without feeling guilt or shame.""

"The boss of Motability Operations is to step down by 2020 following criticism over his pay and a scathing review from the government's spending watchdog. The report from the National Audit Office,externalrevealed Mike Betts was in line for an extra Â£1.86m bonus on top of already ""generous"" pay. The firm operates the Motability scheme which provides wheelchairs, cars and scooters to disabled people. Mr Bett's level of pay was described as ""obscene"" by MP Frank Field. Mr Field, who chairs Parliament's Work and Pensions Committee, said it was ""beyond appalling to learn that money that could have been used to improve the lives of disabled people will be lining his pockets instead"". The Motability scheme arranges cars, scooters and powered wheelchairs for disabled people in exchange for some of their state disability allowance. Motability Operations - the firm which runs the scheme - is a monopoly which faces no competition and also benefits from tax concessions. The NAO report said the scheme had made more profit than intended, and that its customers had been charged Â£390m more than was required to cover lease costs. Motability said it was making some changes in the light of the report and that Mr Betts, whocame under the spotlightearlier this year when it was revealed he receives a Â£1.7m salary, would step down by 2020, once the recommendations of the NAO review had been implemented. The NAO said the scheme provided ""an excellent service to customers"", but because it operated in ""a protected environment, supported by government"" it was making high levels of unplanned profit and held large reserves. ""Motability Operations has taken an unnecessarily conservative view of risk, holds more in reserves than arguably it needs and has also made large unplanned profits,"" said Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO. ""On top of which there has been an internal view of executive performance as being 'consistently extraordinary', with the reward to match."" Mr Morse questioned whether Motability's governance and accountability arrangements were robust enough. In March this year Motability Operations was holding Â£2.62bn in reserves, the NAO said. The NAO also highlighted an incentive scheme designed to ensure Mr Betts stayed in post, which had not previously been disclosed. The bonus scheme was worth Â£1.86m in September this year. Lord Sterling, chairman of the Motability charity, said in a statement that the scheme accepted the watchdog's recommendations but said there were ""areas still open to further debate"". The finding that customers are being overcharged ""runs quite contrary"" to prices that are lower than the market rate, he said. Neil Johnson, chairman of Motability Operations, said many of the changes recommended by the NAO were already being implemented, and defended the scheme's operation. ""Our business model has allowed the company to return more than Â£500m in payments directly back to customers over the last 10 years. Moreover, efficient running of the scheme has ensured that prices are consistently 44% cheaper than any alternative."" Mr Johnson is due to retire as chairman of Motability Operations in April 2019.

"Oxford and Cambridge are being accused of being so socially exclusive that they recruit more students from eight top schools than almost 3,000 other UK state schools put together. The Sutton Trust social mobility charity says the leading universities are failing to attract a wide enough range of talent. Trust founder Sir Peter Lampl said all young people needed a ""fair chance"". Oxford University said they were ""very aware"" that they ""must work harder"". The study examined Oxford and Cambridge admissions data between 2015 and 2017 and found a handful of schools, mostly private, disproportionately dominating the number of places awarded. The Sutton Trust says pupils from eight schools filled 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years, compared with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools. These 2,900 schools were those with historically few admissions to Oxbridge - and accounted for about three-quarters of secondary schools. In the past three years, Oxford and Cambridge admitted a total of 19,851 undergraduates, with the remainder of places coming from other private schools and top performing state schools and colleges. The charity was using anonymised admissions data - but it says it believes most of these eight places were private schools plus a couple of big state sixth-form colleges. Using published figures, among the schools and colleges with the highest number of Oxbridge admissions are: Westminster School, London(independent) - an average of 70-80 pupils each year have been offered places at Oxford and Cambridge in the last five years, the school says Eton College, Berkshire(independent) - in 2014, 82 students were accepted to Oxbridge. The following year 68 were accepted Hills Road Sixth Form College, Cambridge(state sixth form college) - an average 60 pupils receive Oxbridge offers, the school says St Paul's School, London(independent) - 53 students went to Oxbridge in 2016 and 41 in 2015 Peter Symonds College, Hampshire(state sixth form college) - an average of 48 students received offers from Oxbridge over the past three years St Paul's Girls' School, London(independent) - an average of 45 students went to Oxbridge each year between 2015 and 2017 King's College School, London(independent) - sent 48 students to Oxbridge in 2017 Magdalen College School, Oxford(independent) - 44 students went to Oxbridge in 2018 The research also found that high-achieving independent school pupils were twice as likely as state school pupils to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, even with the same ability and predicted grades. The report shows the imbalance in admissions: 7% of all UK pupils attend private schools 18% of those taking A-levels are at private school 34% of Oxbridge applications are from private school 42% of Oxbridge places go to private school pupils The study says there are some parts of the country where particularly few young state-educated people get places. These include: Halton Knowsley Lincolnshire North Lincolnshire Portsmouth Rochdale Rutland Salford Southampton Thurrock The study blames a lack of advice and guidance for applicants and calls for better information about what is required for entry and for admissions to take into account young people's backgrounds. ""If we are to ensure that all young people, regardless of their background, have a fair chance of getting in to our top universities, we need to address the patchwork of higher education guidance and support,"" said Sir Peter. ""All young people, regardless of what area they grow up in, or what school they go to, should have access to high quality personal guidance that allows them to make the best informed choices about their future."" William Baldwin, principal of non-selective state sixth form Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College (BHASVIC) said offers from Oxbridge ""began to snowball"" in recent years. Last year 57 students were offered Oxbridge places and 27 of those were from less affluent backgrounds. Mr Baldwin put the success down to dedicating college resources to admissions and employing a full-time co-ordinator of Oxbridge applications. Students self-select their interest in applying and then receive bespoke tutorial sessions on personal statements, extra-curricular activities and interview practice, he said. Andrew Halls, head master of selective independent school King's College School said his school also gave extra lessons and advice sessions to students wanting to apply to Oxbridge. The school sent 48 students to Oxbridge in 2017. He said the selective nature of the school played a part: ""These kids are very bright anyway. In January about 800 pupils will sit for about 80-90 places."" He also stressed the importance of teachers who could ""demystify"" the Oxbridge process. ""Schools like King's do understand the structures of Oxbridge because they've been historically sending children there for hundreds of years."" Martin Williams, Oxford University's pro-vice-chancellor for education, said the university accepted the need to do more to widen access. ""We are very much aware that Oxford must work harder to attract a more representative selection of students from across the UK,"" said Prof Williams. Biggest winners and losers from degrees Oxford University in Twitter row with David Lammy What is a fair university admissions system? Oxford runs summer schools to encourage more disadvantaged students to apply - and the university says there are plans to attract more students from places where it had recruited few students in the past. The university says it spends Â£7m per year on outreach schemes and is promising a new ""detailed action plan"" with changes to make sure there are places for students of ""outstanding potential from all backgrounds"". A spokesman for the University of Cambridge welcomed the idea that ""more support should be made available to students before they choose their A-level subjects and agree there should be more provision of careers advice"". But Cambridge rejected ""lowering grade requirements"", saying this would ""place unfair pressure on students and that is something the university cannot support"". Education Secretary Damian Hinds, speaking on Thursday, said leading universities should accept students with the new technical qualifications, known as T-levels. He said it would be an ""error"" to have a ""blanket rejection"" of young people applying with the new vocational exams, where they were relevant. Oxford University says it is waiting to see how the T-levels develop before making a decision. Mr Hinds was launching plans for an overhaul of vocational education - saying such exams needed to be of sufficiently high quality to be held in the same esteem as A-levels and academic qualifications. He warned of a ""plethora of mediocre"" qualifications that were not well understood by either the public or employers but said, he wanted to remove ""false barriers"" between academic and vocational qualifications and that both could be routes into higher education. On the Sutton Trust report, Mr Hinds said: ""Whilst potential and talent is evenly spread, the opportunities to make the most of it sometimes aren't. ""I want universities to work with us, consider the data carefully and look at their own admissions policies to work out what can be done to ensure that their university is open to everyone who has the potential, no matter their background or where they are from."" Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of leading universities, said: ""We want to recruit students with potential and drive, regardless of background, and we are working hard to improve social mobility.""

"Mobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users. A statement on its website,external, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday. It said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening. But some users told the BBC they were still having issues with texting and urged O2 to fix the glitches. ""I have a Tesco mobile [which uses the O2 network] - any texts I send say 'not sent. Tap to try again',"" wrote Lesley. ""Each tap brings the same message! But I find the person I've sent it to actually has received it!"" Another user Steve wrote: ""No, it's most definitely not fixed as there are numerous error messages sending texts as well as duplicated sendings."" Can I claim compensation from O2? An O2 spokeswoman said: ""A small proportion of customers have reported issues sending text messages. We can see that the vast majority are being sent and received successfully and our technical teams are investigating. ""Our 3G and 4G data services are performing as normal."" Earlier, O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Ericsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the ""faulty software"" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned. In a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: ""I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can. ""We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry."" Ericsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries. Customers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney. Ms Dewdney, who writes a blog calledThe Complaining Cow,external, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care. That means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone. This must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle. Ms Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint. Ericsson president BÃ¶rje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption. He said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added. Japan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted. Network down: how people are coping without a signal O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working. Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts. ""As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses. ""Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,"" he said. O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption On Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having. Allison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and was unable to get to a landline. ""I'm disabled ... I'm in a wheelchair,"" she told the BBC. ""So having no data but also no calls as well means I can't contact anyone if I have a fall or if I need anything."" Lynsey Greavesruns a company in Doncaster providing home visits to the elderly and vulnerable. Her 130 staff all rely on O2 phones to access rotas, schedules, names and addresses. She called in extra office staff to give out the information for each visit over the phone. ""There are nine of us trying to sort it now,"" she said. ""It's been a nightmare."" Luke Staggruns a plumbing business and depends on his phone, but he couldn't get through to customers or use his sat nav. ""That's a whole day wasted,"" he said. ""I'll be seeking to recoup my losses, especially as a business customer."" Mischa Bittaris also a plumber. He said he had been ""unable to contact any of my engineers or customers via email, unable to use our mobile systems to contact any engineers at all, so everyone's just had to down tools today"". ""A lot of money lost and the first thing I know about it is via the BBC website, no contact from O2 at all, disappointing,"" he added. Omeran Amiratsaid he had been a loyal O2 customer for a long time. He said he had bids on eBay on Thursday morning but he could not do them because the O2 network was down. ""It's Christmas, the budget's tight for me, there were presents I was supposed to be buying for my daughter and my son on eBay today. They've gone now."" He said he had lost the bids and ""O2 are responsible"".

"The violence of the ""gilets jaunes"" protests has shocked France Tourist sites in Paris are to close on Saturday amid fears of further street violence from ""yellow vest"" anti-government protests. Across France, 89,000 police officers will be on duty and armoured vehicles will be deployed in the capital, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced. Police have urged shops and restaurants on Paris's Champs-Elysees to shut and some museums will also be closed. Paris endured some of the worst rioting in decades last Saturday. The government has said it is scrapping unpopular fuel tax increases in its budget - the original trigger for the protests. But broader discontent with the government has spread and protests have erupted over other issues. An official with the interior ministry told AFP news agency authorities were braced for ""significant violence"" on Saturday, with activists from both the far right and far left planning to converge on the capital. In an interview with TV channel TF1, Mr Philippe said 8,000 police would be deployed in Paris as well as a dozen armoured vehicles. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Will you be affected by the closures? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external He repeated an appeal for calm but added: ""We are facing people who are not here to protest, but to smash and we want to have the means to not give them a free rein."" Earlier, Mr Philippe suggested further concessions to protesters, telling the Senate that the government was open to new measures to help the lowest-paid workers. The operator of the Eiffel Tower said the threat of violent protests on Saturday made it impossible to ensure ""adequate security conditions"". City authorities say they are stepping up protection for famous landmarks after the Arc de Triomphe was damaged last week. Culture Minister Franck Riester said the Louvre and Orsay museums, opera houses and the Grand Palais complex were among sites that would be closed. Police secured the Trocadero place near the Eiffel Tower during last week's demonstrations ""We cannot take the risk when we know the threat,"" he told RTL radio. Police have asked stores and restaurants along the Champs-Elysees and other major shopping streets to stay closed and to remove any outdoor items such as tables and chairs. A series of football matches have also been postponed on Saturday. They include those between Paris and Montpellier, Monaco and Nice, Toulouse and Lyon, and Saint-Etienne and Marseille. On Thursday young people took to the streets, protesting over education reforms. More than 140 people were arrested when a protest outside a school in Mantes-la-Jolie to the west of Paris ended in clashes with police. Pictures of the arrests, in which the students are made to kneel and put their hands behind their heads, sparked outrage on social media. Allow Twitter content?

The town's police chief told Le Monde newspaper that those arrested were suspected of taking part in an ""armed gathering"", adding thatofficers had wanted to break up a situation that was getting ""out-of-control."",external Dozens of other schools were blockaded in cities including Marseille, Nantes and Paris. Students have been angered by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to change the end-of-school exam, known as the baccalaureate, which is required for entrance to university. Critics fear the reforms will limit opportunity and breed inequality. Students at Saint-ExupÃ©ry high school in Mantes-la-Jolie were detained by police The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters, so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law, initially complained at a sharp increase in diesel taxes. Mr Macron said his motivation for the increase was environmental, but protesters accused him of being out of touch. The government later scrapped the plan but the yellow vest protesters were not placated. Last week, the movement - despite a lack of central leadership - issued more than 40 demands to government. Among them were a minimum pension, widespread changes to the tax system, and a reduction in the retirement age. The protest movement has gained momentum via social media, encompassing a whole range of participants from the anarchist far left to the nationalist far right, and moderates in between.

"Mr Nuttall succeeded Nigel Farage as leader of UKIP in 2016 Former UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has quit the party in protest at the decision to appoint Tommy Robinson as an adviser. Mr Nuttall said he was leaving because the party was being taken in a direction ""harmful to Brexit"". The association with the former English Defence League leader would ""appal many moderate Brexit voters,"" he said. Mr Nuttall's resignation follows that of fellow former leader Nigel Farage, who expressed similar sentiments. UKIP's leader in Scotland has also quit the party, accusing it of being ""infiltrated by people with an alternative agenda"". UKIP's Scottish leader quits party Former leader Nigel Farage quits UKIP UKIP leader survives no-confidence vote UKIP row over admitting Tommy Robinson Mr Nuttall, a former history lecturer from Bootle, Merseyside, said he would continue to work as an MEP for North West England. He said: ""Putting Tommy Robinson front and centre, whilst Brexit is in the process of being betrayed is, in my view, a catastrophic error. ""The party leadership and my MEP colleagues have been aware of my views on this issue for some time."" Tommy Robinson is a former leader of the English Defence League Mr Nuttall took over from Nigel Farage as leader of UKIP in November 2016. He was later heavily criticised afteradmitting claims that he had lost close friendsin the Hillsborough disaster were false. Standing down in June 2017, he said the party was more relevant than ever and would continue to be ""the guard dogs of Brexit"". He also said the party had ""lost its way in recent times"" and attacked its ""clumsy, blundering approach"" to tackling female genital mutilation and its ""hardline anti-Islam messages"". Mr Nuttall joined UKIP in 2004 after running for the Conservatives in a council election in Bootle two years earlier. He became an MEP for North West England in 2009 and served as UKIP deputy leader from 2010. Analysis By Gavin Stamp, political reporter, BBC News UKIP's change of direction is also being played out in the European Parliament, where Gerard Batten has quit the political grouping chaired by former leader Nigel Farage. The party's nine remaining MEPs, and most of those who have quit the party like Mr Farage, are members of the Europe of Freedom of Direct Democracy, one of the smaller pan-national groups in the Parliament. The grouping, whose other major player is Italy's populist Five Star Movement, has shrunk considerably in size in recent years due to defections. Mr Batten has not yet signalled whether he will align himself with another group in his remaining time in the European Parliament. The UK will no longer have any MEPs after Brexit. But, as it stands, the UK's existing 73 representatives will be expected to work for three weeks after the scheduled Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - to complete the full parliamentary term ahead of May's elections. Some former UKIP members have chosen not to join other groups although Janice Atkinson teamed up with Europe of Nations and Freedom, whose members include France's National Rally, the new name for the Front National.

"Zainab Mughal was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare type of cancer A two-year-old US girl who needs several blood transfusions to fight cancer has spurred a global campaign to search for compatible donors. Zainab Mughal has one of the rarest blood types in the world, which makes it difficult to treat her condition. Campaigners say more than 1,000 people have been tested, but only three so far have the blood she needs. Doctors say seven to 10 donors will be needed over the course of her cancer treatment. Earlier this year Zainab was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, an aggressive and rare form of cancer that mostly affects babies and young children. Blood transfusions will be needed for the duration of her treatment, but Zainab's blood is ""extremely rare"" because it is missing an antigen - ""Indian B"" - that most people carry in their red blood cells, says OneBlood,a non-profit blood centre that's spearheading the search for donors,external. The only donors likely to be a match are people of exclusively Pakistani, Indian or Iranian descent with blood type O or A, OneBlood says. But even within these populations, fewer than 4% of people will be missing the Indian B antigen. Zainab with her mother and father Zainab's body will reject any blood which doesn't match all the requirements. Two matching donors have been found in the US, and another in the UK. ""This is so rare that honestly this the first time I've seen it in the 20 years I've been doing this,"" said Frieda Bright, a laboratory manager with OneBlood. NHS appeal for black blood donors 'drops straight knowledge' We are reliant on blood donors to keep him alive' 'I donate breast milk to give something back' OneBlood is working with other blood banks and the American Rare Donor Program (ARDP), a program that finds donors of rare types of blood around the world. ""Blood is not going to cure her, but it's very important for her to survive cancer treatment,"" Ms Bright said in a campaign video. At least seven to 10 suitable donors are needed Zainab's father Raheel Mughal said his daughter was diagnosed in September. ""We were all crying, this was the worst thing we were expecting,"" he said in the OneBlood video. After he and Zainab's mother offered to donate their own blood, doctors discovered neither of them was compatible. ""And then a lot of people from my family, they went around and donated blood and that's when it became more of an alert."" A baby picture of Zainab Mughal, who was diagnosed with cancer in October According to OneBlood, treatment with chemotherapy is already reducing the size of the Zainab's tumour, but she will eventually need two bone marrow transplants. ""My daughter's life very much depends on the blood,"" says Mr Mughal. ""What [donors] are doing to save my daughter's life is amazing. The work you are doing, I will never ever forget it.""

Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Bloodhound is a private undertaking.It is funded through donation, sponsorship and partnership. It has excelled at leveraging all three, but ultimately this funding model has not delivered sufficient cash to fully sustain such a complex venture. The last two-to-three years have been an especially tough environment in which to raise financial support. The investment landscape is difficult, in part because of Brexit uncertainty, but principally because many large brands that might once have put their name on the side of a car to build awareness are now using other marketing tools, such as social media. The project had got to the point that the South African government had cleared an area of stones in which to attempt the record and several rockets that were to be used have proved their worth. Developed by the Norwegian aerospace and defence company Nammo, one was launched into space for the first time at the end of September. The Nucleus rocket flew to an altitude of 107km from the AndÃ¸ya Space Center. Bloodhound would use a cluster of three Nucleus motors in addition to the Eurofighter EJ200 jet. But ultimately, despite all of this being ready, there was not enough money to get to the final hurdle. The vehicle was tested at Newquay Airport The project has planned on running on Hakskeen Pan towards the end of 2019, when the water in the lakebed evaporated and the ground had become dry.

Developed by the Norwegian aerospace and defence company Nammo, one was launched into space for the first time at the end of September. The Nucleus rocket flew to an altitude of 107km from the AndÃ¸ya Space Center. Bloodhound would use a cluster of three Nucleus motors in addition to the Eurofighter EJ200 jet. But ultimately, despite all of this being ready, there was not enough money to get to the final hurdle. The vehicle was tested at Newquay Airport The project has planned on running on Hakskeen Pan towards the end of 2019, when the water in the lakebed evaporated and the ground had become dry.

"Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of the company's founder Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government had no involvement in the arrest of a top executive from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, was detained at Vancouver airport on a US extradition request. China has demanded her release, calling the arrest a human rights violation. The charges have not been made public. Huawei said it was ""not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng"". She faces a bail hearing on Friday. The arrest comes at a sensitive time for US-China relations. The nations are locked in a trade war that has seen both impose duties on billions of dollars of one another's goods. Ms Meng was detained on Saturday, the same day US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit in Argentina and laterreached a temporary truce in their trade battle. Huawei arrest a 'hostage' in a new tech war A quick guide to the US-China trade war But the arrest has angered China and threatens to inflame tensions with the US. Earlier reports suggested that Ms Meng's arrest could be related to a US investigation into a possible violation of sanctions against Iran. US National Security Adviser John Bolton declined to comment on this when questioned by journalists. Instead he said that - generally speaking - he had ""enormous concerns"" over Chinese firms' business practices and their possible operations as ""arms"" of the government. Ms Meng is the company's chief financial officer and the founder's daughter. Ms Meng was detained while transferring between flights in Vancouver Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung. Should we worry about Huawei? Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? The details of the charges against Ms Meng remain unknown after she sought a publication ban, which was granted by the Canadian judge. Her arrest was not revealed by the Canadian authorities until Wednesday, the day when she had her first court appearance. Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Mr Trudeau said his government was told about the arrest a few days beforehand, but it did not play a role. ""I can assure everyone that we are a country [with] an independent judiciary,"" he said. Some Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. US lawmakers have repeatedly accused the company of being a threat to US national security. Japan is expected to ban government use of products made by Huawei and ZTE, local media reported on Friday, over cybersecurity concerns. It would follow moves byNew Zealand and Australia to block Huawei. Without making specific reference to Huawei, US Security Adviser Mr Bolton said his country had ""enormous concerns for years"" about the practice of Chinese firms ""to use stolen American intellectual property, to engage in forced technology transfers, and to be used as arms of the Chinese government's objectives in terms of information technology in particular"". By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent It is hard to overstate the symbolism and significance of this event. Huawei is the crown jewel of Chinese tech and Ms Meng is effectively its princess. Even though it's still not clear what the charges against her are, this is not simply a case about the arrest of one woman, or just one company. This arrest could materially damage the relationship between the US and China at possibly one of the most sensitive times between the two countries in their long and torrid history. The gloves are off. Things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Read more from Karishma A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters: ""The detention without giving any reason violates a person's human rights."" ""We have made solemn representations to Canada and the US, demanding that both parties immediately clarify the reasons for the detention, and immediately release the detainee to protect the person's legal rights."" In a statement, Huawei said it had complied with ""all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU."" The company also said in a letter to suppliers: ""We believe it is unreasonable of the US government to use these sorts of approaches to exert pressure on a business entity.

"This video can not be played One gang used oxy-acetylene canisters to cause an explosion Thieves are increasingly trying to smash or blast their way into UK cash machines - with the number of attacks on ATMs nearly doubling in four years. Attempts to steal cash have risen from 400 attacks in 2014 to 723 last year, according to a report by ATM operator Cardtronics. It said one in five incidents in Europe occurred in the UK. Thieves are generally unsuccessful, with 41% of cases resulting in cash being stolen. ""For the first time, we have proof that the wider damage caused by these attacks is far greater than the direct impact to cash machines or the building they are in. ATM attacks are not victimless crimes,"" said Tim Halford, managing director of Cardtronics UK and Ireland. The report suggested that nearly half of all attacks could be considered as dangerous, in that heavy force was used. This could include ram-raids and gas explosions to blast out the ATM. These ""dangerous"" attempted thefts have risen from an estimated 129 in 2014 to 342 in 2017. Last year, a seven-man gang that blew up cash machines across the UK, stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds, werehanded jail sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. Would-be thieves in Liverpool blew up a cash machine but were unable to take any money from it on Monday. Other dramatic cases included raiders using gas to blow up a cash machine outside a Matalan store in Darlington last year. The cash machine had stood outside Matalan inside a kiosk The explosion was reportedly heard several miles away The report said industry data showed that in 2018 almost 70% of gas attacks on ATMs took place on petrol station forecourts, adding an extra level of potentially dangerous consequences. The report said that rural communities, where there are are already issues over access to cash, were being targeted. One in four attacks occurred in communities which had only one or no bank branch in the vicinity, it said. It could take more than four months for the ATM to reopen. Who do we trust after cash? The High Streets with 'too many' ATMs Cardtronics is the largest operator of non-bank cash machines in the UK, and receives a fee from banks each time one is used. It run brands such as Cardzone and Bank Machine which operate on forecourts, It is one of the various operators closing ATMs. Network co-ordinator Link has said more than 250 free-to-use cash machines are disappearing a month as operators shut unprofitable ones. There are more than 50,000 free machines in the UK - but the number is shrinking at a record rate as people use less cash.

"Air travel could become smoother and less fraught for disabled passengers if a new charter for airlines and airports is adopted, say ministers. Disabled flyers have long complained of lost or damaged wheelchairs, struggles with access on planes and in airports, and poor customer service. If adopted, the charter would remove the Â£2,000 limit on payouts for damaged wheelchairs. It would also enforce better training for airline crews and baggage handlers. In the longer term, the charter would encourage the industry to look at ways to allow people to take their own wheelchairs into aircraft cabins. Paraplegic man drags himself through airport Google offers London step-free access info Pledge over wheelchair users' bus access More than half (57%) of passengers with a disability say they find flying and using airports difficult, according to a survey by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Accessibility minister Nusrat Ghani said that statistic needed to be addressed and the proposed charter included measures to make ""real changes"". ""We are committed to continuing the progress the industry has already made in making the aviation network truly open to all,"" she said. Chris Wood, from campaign group Flying Disabled, said the charter was what they had been working towards. ""My aspiration is to have people flying in their own wheelchairs to a destination within two years and it looks as if the UK could lead the way in making this happen,"" he said. Frank Gardner was stranded in an empty plane for nearly two hours Frank Gardner, who travels widely for his job as BBC security correspondent, has shared some ofhis own experiencesto highlight the obstacles faced by wheelchair users. In March, on his way back from Ethiopia, he was stranded on an empty aircraft for almost two hours after staff said they had lost his wheelchair. At the time, he said: ""That is your legs gone - it is a basic human right"". Mr Gardner, who has used a wheelchair since being shot in Saudi Arabia in 2004, has spoken of airports having a ""casual disregard"" for disabled passengers. Last year a paraplegic athletedragged himself along the floor through Luton Airportafter his self-propelling wheelchair was left behind on a flight. And in November a man with a spinal problem was taken to hospitalafter he collapsed at Heathrow Airport while waiting for a booked wheelchair that failed to turn up. This video can not be played Justin Levene said the airport couldn't provide an adequate wheelchair last August By BBC disability news correspondent Nikki Fox When it comes to flying, if you have a disability, physical or invisible, the problems are never ending and progress slow. This Passenger Charter pinpoints some of the key issues for disabled passengers - increasing the limit on lost or damaged mobility equipment, better training for staff and getting wheelchairs on planes. All will be welcomed by disabled people and those who have been campaigning for change. What is unclear is how this will all work. The government will have to find a way of getting around the Montreal Convention - a set of rules the aviation industry has had to follow since the 1990s. One of those being how much an airline has to reimburse a passenger for lost, broken and often expensive, wheelchairs. There is also no clear indication of how long it will take to see real change. At the moment, these new measures will feed into the government's aviation strategy, but as yet, no date has been set. Some airports are already introducing measures to improve the experience for disabled flyers. At Gatwick, one of the airport lounges has been specifically designed for passengers who require assistance and some security lanes are now accessible for passengers with a range of disabilities and staffed by people trained to recognise and respond to their needs. Gatwick's chief operating officer Chris Woodruffe said ""Flying can be a challenge for people with a disability and airports, in partnership with airlines, can change that by improving their practices and infrastructure so that everyone has an equal opportunity to fly."" The government's aviation strategy has been supported by Airlines UK, an association representing 13 airlines, including British Airways, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic. The charter is part of the government's aviation strategy which will be considered in a 16-week consultation, due to begin this month. The government says the policy will be finalised next year.

"The boss of Motability Operations is to step down by 2020 following criticism over his pay and a scathing review from the government's spending watchdog. The report from the National Audit Office,externalrevealed Mike Betts was in line for an extra Â£1.86m bonus on top of already ""generous"" pay. The firm operates the Motability scheme which provides wheelchairs, cars and scooters to disabled people. Mr Bett's level of pay was described as ""obscene"" by MP Frank Field. Mr Field, who chairs Parliament's Work and Pensions Committee, said it was ""beyond appalling to learn that money that could have been used to improve the lives of disabled people will be lining his pockets instead"". The Motability scheme arranges cars, scooters and powered wheelchairs for disabled people in exchange for some of their state disability allowance. Motability Operations - the firm which runs the scheme - is a monopoly which faces no competition and also benefits from tax concessions. The NAO report said the scheme had made more profit than intended, and that its customers had been charged Â£390m more than was required to cover lease costs. Motability said it was making some changes in the light of the report and that Mr Betts, whocame under the spotlightearlier this year when it was revealed he receives a Â£1.7m salary, would step down by 2020, once the recommendations of the NAO review had been implemented. The NAO said the scheme provided ""an excellent service to customers"", but because it operated in ""a protected environment, supported by government"" it was making high levels of unplanned profit and held large reserves. ""Motability Operations has taken an unnecessarily conservative view of risk, holds more in reserves than arguably it needs and has also made large unplanned profits,"" said Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO. ""On top of which there has been an internal view of executive performance as being 'consistently extraordinary', with the reward to match."" Mr Morse questioned whether Motability's governance and accountability arrangements were robust enough. In March this year Motability Operations was holding Â£2.62bn in reserves, the NAO said. The NAO also highlighted an incentive scheme designed to ensure Mr Betts stayed in post, which had not previously been disclosed. The bonus scheme was worth Â£1.86m in September this year. Lord Sterling, chairman of the Motability charity, said in a statement that the scheme accepted the watchdog's recommendations but said there were ""areas still open to further debate"". The finding that customers are being overcharged ""runs quite contrary"" to prices that are lower than the market rate, he said. Neil Johnson, chairman of Motability Operations, said many of the changes recommended by the NAO were already being implemented, and defended the scheme's operation. ""Our business model has allowed the company to return more than Â£500m in payments directly back to customers over the last 10 years. Moreover, efficient running of the scheme has ensured that prices are consistently 44% cheaper than any alternative."" Mr Johnson is due to retire as chairman of Motability Operations in April 2019.

Mr Williams added:  ""There is a measure of success in the railways. The number of passengers has increased, the investment has increased significantly, but that isn't leading to greater passenger satisfaction. ""I see an acknowledgement of a need for change. When I go and meet passengers, and interested parties in the railway, what I see is a huge passion in the railway, and a consensus that something needs to be better."" He said that Britain's railways had a great history, but that the network now needed to be fit to meet the demands of the 21st Century. ""My issue is not around the past, my issue is making sure we have something that works for passengers into the future,"" he said. As well as passenger satisfaction he said the review also had to look at the rail network in a broader context, including economic and environmental issues. ""It is the engine of economic growth for the country,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Frightened Rabbit set for emotional return Frightened Rabbit are preparing for their ""highly emotional"" return to the stage after the death of singer Scott Hutchison. Mr Hutchison'sbody was foundon the banks of the Firth of Forth after he took his own life in May. His brother and band mate Grant said he was ""more nervous"" about this weekend's performance than he had ever been before. Frightened Rabbit's appearance at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Bandstand will be part of a charity event to raise money for the social enterprise Social Bite. If you or someone you know has been affected by mental health problems,these organisations may be able to help. The Selkirk band, formed by Mr Hutchison and Grant on drums, were signed up to the concert - which is part of aSocial Bite's sleep in the park event,externalto raise money for homeless people - before Mr Hutchison's death. The remaining band members felt this was the right opportunity for their first show without him. They will be joined by special guests in a tribute. Grant Hutchison will play at Kelvingrove Bandstand this weekend The concert will also raise funds for a charity Mr Hutchison's family are setting up in his memory. Grant said: ""It seemed like the right thing to do, and like a natural thing to do - to make a positive thing out of something that personally was a very tragic event - to be able to help two charities and two causes, and also to play with people that are good friends."" Asked how he would feel playing without his brother, he said: ""To be honest, I don't know. ""I don't think it's something I can really prepare for. It's going to be highly emotional, but I think the setting for it, both physically and the fact that it's a charity event for Social Bite, means it's a positive way to do that for the first time. ""I think I'll be more nervous than I've ever been for a Frightened Rabbit gig before. It'll be strange."" 'His music meant so much to people' Profile: Frightened Rabbit Scott Hutchison at the BBC Scott's family said there had been concerns about his mental health and they were ""devastated"" by his death. Looking to the future, Grant said he was still grieving but the band had plans to continue. He said: ""All of us are dealing with Scott's death on a personal level. It's been seven months, that's a very short time. ""We do have something planned for next year which was meant to happen this year which we'll hopefully announce at the start of the year."" Scott Hutchison died in May Frightened Rabbit, pictured here at Glastonbury in 2013, released five albums Frightened Rabbit were formed with Scott Hutchison on vocals and guitar and his brother Grant on drums, with the band's most recent line-up also featuring Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. They released the first of their five albums, Sing the Greys, in 2006, with Scott also releasing a solo album called Owl John. Scott and Grant had formed a new band called Mastersystem, joining forces with Justin Lockey from Editors and his brother James, a film maker. Scott had also hinted at a sixth Frightened Rabbit album being released before the end of the year, saying they had five or six songs that were coming together.

"The Aquarius has been stuck in Marseille since its registration was revoked Doctors Without Borders (MSF) says it has been forced to end migrant rescue operations in the Mediterranean carried out by the vessel Aquarius.

""Fewer sailings, fewer landings, fewer deaths. That's good,"" he tweeted. Aquarius has been stuck in Marseille since its registration was revoked.

"The pay gap left Meenakshi Sarkar feeling depressed and devalued When Meenakshi Sarkar landed a job as a teaching fellow at Leeds University after a successful career in business in India, she was delighted. But the university put her on the lowest possible academic pay band, leaving her struggling financially. It became clear that colleagues were paid more for similar work, leaving her feeling ""depressed and devalued"". ""I feel like everyone else is running a 100m sprint and I'm running a steeplechase alongside them,"" she says. ""It's not an equal race."" Ms Sarkar's frustration is not unusual, according to data obtained by BBC News under Freedom of Information law. The BBC sent FOI requests to all 24 universities in the Russell Group of highly selective, research-based universities, and 22 responded. At these universities, the data showed average salaries of: Â£52,000 for white academics Â£38,000 for black academics Â£37,000 for academics from an Arab background This means that black and Arab academics at the UK's top universities earn an average 26% less than white colleagues. And female academics fare even worse, with an ethnicity pay gap on top of the gender pay gap. The pay gap is smaller for other Asian and mixed-heritage academics. The Russell Group said it was unable to comment on individual universities' recruitment practices. But Leeds University said it took the issue ""very seriously"". ""This is why we are committed to ensuring that black and minority ethnic staff are employed at all levels and to reducing any pay gap arising from our current representation across the grades."" Pay gaps can be caused by unequal pay, which is illegal, or by a group of staff tending to be in lower paid jobs or in part-time work. The new data suggests that ethnic minority academics are less likely than white men or women to be promoted to better paid, senior positions. They also tend to be in lower pay bands. The data shows the gender pay gap is more pronounced for ethnic minority women at Russell Group universities where white male staff are on average salaries of Â£55,000. On average, compared with white men: white women got 15% less Asian women, 22% less black women, 39% less Prof Akwugo Emejulu, of Warwick University, is one of just 26 black women professors in the UK. She says she attained her current position in the sociology department at Warwick University despite experiencing ""racist and sexist bullying"" throughout her career. ""One of the reasons for the gap is that black women in particular tend to be on temporary teaching-only contracts that trap them in low waged work with few opportunities to move on to permanent positions,"" she told the BBC. The BBC data shows that at Warwick, ethnic minority academics are paid an average 25% less than their white colleagues, amounting to over Â£14,500. White academics at Warwick receive an average salary of Â£59,000 but the 215 identifying as Asian get 27% less and the 25 black academics earn 39% less. But the university says its own analysis shows the gap is in fact just 15.5% although it agrees ""there is much room for improvement"". ""We at Warwick are actively looking at the best ways to identify where the barriers are to help us reduce the ethnic minority pay gap."" The university says the approach is paying off, with 28% of its early career academic staff identifying as black or minority ethnic. The former Universities Minister and Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy said the figures showed universities needed to ""take a look in the mirror and realise that more needs to be done to both widen access at undergraduate level and to keep and retain a diverse cohort right through to PhDs, professorships and the very top of these institutions"". Across the Russell Group universities that responded, the BBC found that there are: More than 49,000 White academic staff Three thousand Chinese and East Asian Three thousand Indian and South Asian Just over 600 Black and only 250 from Arab backgrounds Disclosing ethnicity is not mandatory and about one in six academic staff had refused to declare their ethnicity to their employers  so their data is not included. The figures disclosed to the BBC came as the government revealed plans to make ethnicity pay reporting mandatory for companies with more than 250 employees. This story has been updated as initial data provided by Glasgow University was incorrect.

"This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs? Ministers are trying to rally support for the PM's Brexit deal across the UK but a bid to find a compromise has been dismissed by the DUP and Brexiteers. With Theresa May widely expected to lose Tuesday's Commons vote, No 10 has dismissed calls for it to be delayed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said with two days of debate remaining, there was still time to win over MPs. But a Tory backbench amendment aimed at easing concerns about the controversial ""backstop"" has met with criticism. Downing Street has said the vote is still due to take place on Tuesday, despite dozens of Tories threatening to reject the deal, along with the DUP, whose support keeps Mrs May's government in power. Lib Dems in Commons bid for new Brexit vote 'Bodies uncollected' under no-deal Brexit Attempt to halt Brexit heard in High Court Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU But a senior minister has told the BBC ""the only political common sense is to delay"" it. The minister, who preferred not to be named, said: ""We need to find a solution and we can't find one by Tuesday."" Matt Hancock, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Scottish Secretary David Mundell are among those trying to sell it to the public in visits across the UK. Amid calls from some Tory and Labour MPs for the UK to pursue an even closer Norway-style relationship with the EU, Mr Lidington said it was wrong to assume there was a ""magic alternative"" waiting in the wings which retained the existing benefits of membership without the obligations. ""If it is not this deal which the rest of the EU says they are not willing to renegotiate, then either you crash out of the EU without any deal, without any transitional period or you revisit the referendum result of 2016 and you stay in the European Union,"" he said. The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by Parliament if it is to come into force. Pro and anti-Brexit campaigners stage protests at Westminster Many MPs have expressed concerns about the backstop, aimed at preventing a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, if no trade deal is ready before the end of the post-Brexit transition period. It would mean Northern Ireland staying aligned to some EU rules, which many MPs say is unacceptable. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement. Jeremy Corbyn told Euronews that in a Labour Brexit deal ""there certainly wouldn't be a backstop from which you can't escape"". ""We will have to come to an agreement on a customs union, a specific customs union with the European Union that does give us the opportunity to have a say in it all, but also guarantees that level of trade,"" the Labour leader said. Downing Street has dismissed reports the vote could be delayed. And Mr Hancock told the BBC that ""the best thing for the country"" was for MPs to back Mrs May's deal. ""My view is we should continue the debate,"" he said. ""We've had three days, there's two days more. I think we should make the argument, make the case and persuade people - that's what you have Parliamentary debate for."" This video can not be played Jo Johnson and Stephen Kinnock argue for and against an alternative Brexit option Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Education Secretary Damian Hinds acknowledged the government had ""a big job on"" to win Tuesday's vote, but appealed to MPs to back the deal ""in the national interest"". And Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said while the deal on offer was ""not perfect"" - it delivered on what people voted for. The prime minister has suggested that MPs could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to activate the backstop, and on Thursday night, a Tory backbench amendment was laid down intended to do that. The amendment - which is understood to have government support - would also give the devolved administrations, particularly the Northern Ireland Assembly, although it is currently suspended, more say in the process. It would also press the UK and EU to agree a future trade deal within a year of the implementation period ending. Former Northern Ireland minister Hugo Swire tabled the amendment along with Bob Neill and Richard Graham. This video can not be played Tory MP Lee Rowley explains why he will be voting against Theresa May's withdrawal deal Mr Swire told the BBC that many Tory MPs would like to see the backstop ""disappear altogether or be time limited"" but the European Commission had said it would not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, so the amendment was ""about the nearest we feel we can probe"". He said it was aimed at ""people like me, who would like to be able to support this deal but find they are unable to"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker dismissed the amendment: ""Giving Parliament the choice between the devil and the deep blue sea is desperate and will persuade very few."" And fellow backbencher Peter Bone told the BBC the amendment was ""absolutely meaningless"". DUP leader Arlene Foster tweeted: ""Domestic legislative tinkering won't cut it. The legally binding international withdrawal treaty would remain fundamentally flawed, as evidenced by the attorney general's legal advice."" Meanwhile, former cabinet minister Justine Greening has told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast that a Conservative Party ""that seems consumed by Brexit"" would lose the support of ""Middle England"". ""One of the problems for the Conservative Party is it's now 31 years since we last won a landslide and we need to realise as a party if things don't change, that'll be our last landslide,"" she said.

"Women studying maths at Oxford and men taking economics at Bristol get the biggest increase in earnings from going to university, says an analysis of salaries at the age of 29. The study, from the Department for Education and Institute for Fiscal Studies, says women are much more likely to gain from getting a degree. Women with a degree earn on average 28% more than non-graduate women. Men with degrees earn an average of 8% more than non-graduates. But a third of men go to universities which give them only a ""negligible"" pay advantage, despite the cost of fees. The lowest for earnings for men is studying philosophy at Sussex - and for women it is computing at Westminster. The report, based on tax records of people who went to school in England and then went to university in England, Wales or Scotland,looks at how going to university might affect earnings,external. Setting aside any social benefits, it's asking if it's worth the cash, when graduates are leaving with an average of Â£50,000 of debt. A woman with a degree on average earns Â£6,700 more per year than a non-graduate woman - with women improving their earnings for almost every course at every university. But the difference is much narrower for men, with a male graduate on average earning Â£2,700 more than a non-graduate. There are tougher questions for the one-third of men who go to universities which give ""negligible or negative impact"" on earnings compared with those without a degree. Are they getting value for money? The report says getting a degree is clearly an ""excellent investment"" for women, because their earnings are so much higher than non-graduate women. Much of this is because women without degrees are particularly likely to be low earners - and so the gap between them and graduates is likely to be wider. This could be because women without degrees are likely to be in particularly low-paid jobs. But another factor is that non-graduate women in their 20s are twice as likely to be working part-time as women with degrees. This could be because women who do not go to university tend to have children earlier than graduate women. So the big gains for women described in the report could include comparisons between full-time graduate earnings and those non-graduates working part-time. The report shows there is a huge difference in likely earnings depending on the subject studied. At the top end of the pay scale are medicine, economics, maths, business and law. Women studying medicine can expect to earn 78% more than non-graduate women. At the lower end are subjects such as creative arts, philosophy and English. Men taking these subjects are likely to get ""negative"" returns - as on average they will earn less than their male counterparts who did not go to university. For men taking creative arts, they can expect 14% less than non-graduates. There are significant earnings premiums for those at the top of the table - with women getting the best returns from four London universities - the LSE, Imperial, King's College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies - and Oxford. Bristol and Cambridge are added to the list of high earners for male students. At the bottom, for male graduates, are modern universities, such as Bath Spa, or colleges which also deliver further education, such as Leeds City. Almost all women are at universities which will boost their pay - although Bolton is an exception and is ranked lowest. It might not seem that surprising that modern universities do less well in future earnings. It might also be predictable that arts-based institutions get lower earnings, such as Ravensbourne, Goldsmiths and the University of the Arts. But there might be scrutiny of the scale of universities where there are negative outcomes - 26 institutions where male earnings are on average less than non-graduates and 39 where the returns are less than 2%. Essex, Hull, Leicester, Sussex, Keele and Bradford all have an earnings premium below 10% for male students. If you put together the subject and university choice you can see the extremes of high and low-earning courses. For women, maths at Oxford is the highest, followed by economics at the LSE. Economics at University College London gives a big return, as does medicine at Imperial. In fact, the highest earners are a narrow combination of maths, law, medicine, physics and economics taken at a handful of top universities. It's very similar for male graduates, headed by economics at Bristol and physics at Oxford. For women, the lowest paying is computing at Westminster. Psychology at Bolton is in the bottom five. But showing how much the course can drive the outcome, creative arts at Cambridge is among the least likely to deliver high earnings. For men, philosophy at Sussex is ranked as offering the lowest rate of return - and studying languages at Oxford is also in the bottom five for male earnings. The Universities Minister Sam Gyimah says that more transparency is vital to make sure that young people make informed choices about university places. This will help them to think about getting value for money from their degree. He also wants this to ""shine a light"" on courses that seem to deliver such a low rate of return. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Half of university tuition fees spent on teaching The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't But in the background, the big political context is a review considering the future of tuition fees in England. This latest report could raise some very awkward questions. Is it reasonable to charge students Â£9,500 regardless of course or university when there are such different outcomes in earnings? And is it sustainable to have such a high level of fee and debt, when for so many, particularly men, the returns can be marginal or non-existent? Half of tuition fees spent on teaching Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Tuition fees cut to Â£6,500 but higher for science?

"Listen to the prime minister this morning and you hear a leader looking for a way out. Dozens and dozens of her MPs are set to vote against her, largely because they don't like a fiddly bit of a big package of proposals. What should she do then? No surprise, fiddle with the fiddly bit. What Theresa May sketched out on Thursday was the idea of allowing MPs to choose when and if they want to go into the controversial ""backstop"" - the insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland. You can read more abouthow that would work here. May 'looking at MPs' role on backstop Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU Clearly, to try to get some angry Brexiteers to change their minds, the PM is trying to give a sense that they might have more of a say. They could, as the agreement already suggests, just extend the ""transition period"", giving the two sides longer to come up with a free trade deal that would mean the dreaded backstop is never used. It's not surprising that MPs would have a vote on that. But Number 10 clearly hopes it will give some grumpy MPs a sense that they will have more of a say, introducing another layer of decision-making so that the backstop can be avoided. There are problems here though. If all the PM is offering Brexiteers is a future choice between the backstop or extending the status quo, then that's not tempting or particularly meaningful for them. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. All it says is: If you don't like the backstop, well, you can choose to stay longer in the EU (remember during the transition period things essentially don't change very much.) And as a sceptical EU source points out, it's not just their decision anyway. And it doesn't sound like she is willing to give them a more dramatic choice - extend the transition period, go into the backstop or leave without it. How could she, when it's taken two years to agree on this central part of a legal deal with Brussels? There is another scheme being talked about too, which seeks to make the backstop more palatable if we are in it. Number 10 is talking to MPs about whether they could give Parliament an annual vote on the backstop, to approve the arrangement or not. Now, again, my sceptical EU source points out there is no way that the UK would have a veto on its own. But political signalling can make a difference. And frankly at this stage, anything that could make the next week less painful for Number 10 might seem worth pursuing to them. If it's only a fig leaf, then it won't move very many MPs. Any compromise would emerge as an amendment from a backbencher, not in the name of the government. But if it is more dramatic, then Brussels is not likely to tolerate it. Fiddling around could help the prime minister cut the chances or scale of defeat next week. But it might prove only a holding position until she has to do something more fundamental. Right now, Number 10 is clear that they have no intention of pulling this vote. Finding a way of making it hurt less is the task- for now.

"Mobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users. A statement on its website,external, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday. It said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening. But some users told the BBC they were still having issues with texting and urged O2 to fix the glitches. ""I have a Tesco mobile [which uses the O2 network] - any texts I send say 'not sent. Tap to try again',"" wrote Lesley. ""Each tap brings the same message! But I find the person I've sent it to actually has received it!"" Another user Steve wrote: ""No, it's most definitely not fixed as there are numerous error messages sending texts as well as duplicated sendings."" Can I claim compensation from O2? An O2 spokeswoman said: ""A small proportion of customers have reported issues sending text messages. We can see that the vast majority are being sent and received successfully and our technical teams are investigating. ""Our 3G and 4G data services are performing as normal."" Earlier, O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Ericsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the ""faulty software"" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned. In a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: ""I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can. ""We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry."" Ericsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries. Customers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney. Ms Dewdney, who writes a blog calledThe Complaining Cow,external, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care. That means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone. This must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle. Ms Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint. Ericsson president BÃ¶rje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption. He said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added. Japan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted. Network down: how people are coping without a signal O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working. Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts. ""As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses. ""Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,"" he said. O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption On Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having. Allison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and was unable to get to a landline. ""I'm disabled ... I'm in a wheelchair,"" she told the BBC. ""So having no data but also no calls as well means I can't contact anyone if I have a fall or if I need anything."" Lynsey Greavesruns a company in Doncaster providing home visits to the elderly and vulnerable. Her 130 staff all rely on O2 phones to access rotas, schedules, names and addresses. She called in extra office staff to give out the information for each visit over the phone. ""There are nine of us trying to sort it now,"" she said. ""It's been a nightmare."" Luke Staggruns a plumbing business and depends on his phone, but he couldn't get through to customers or use his sat nav. ""That's a whole day wasted,"" he said. ""I'll be seeking to recoup my losses, especially as a business customer."" Mischa Bittaris also a plumber. He said he had been ""unable to contact any of my engineers or customers via email, unable to use our mobile systems to contact any engineers at all, so everyone's just had to down tools today"". ""A lot of money lost and the first thing I know about it is via the BBC website, no contact from O2 at all, disappointing,"" he added. Omeran Amiratsaid he had been a loyal O2 customer for a long time. He said he had bids on eBay on Thursday morning but he could not do them because the O2 network was down. ""It's Christmas, the budget's tight for me, there were presents I was supposed to be buying for my daughter and my son on eBay today. They've gone now.""

"This video can not be played Heather Nauert: Who is Trump's nominee for UN ambassador? US President Donald Trump has picked state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to be America's new UN ambassador. The president also nominated William Barr as the new attorney general. Ms Nauert, a former Fox News presenter, was made state department spokeswoman in April 2017, her first government position. Her predecessor at the UN, Nikki Haley, announced in October that she would leave the post by the end of the year. Ms Nauert's appointment to the UN role now has to be approved by the US Senate. After making the announcement, President Trump told reporters: ""She's very talented, very smart, very quick, and I think she's going to be respected by all.""

Past ambassadors have been scholars, diplomats or prominent politicians. The role has often gone to skilled negotiators and leading names in US foreign policy, such as Adlai Stevenson and Madeleine Albright. But President Trump values her loyalty and her TV skills. He trusts her to effectively sell America First over multilateralism. Diplomats at the UN will know she is held in high regard by the president, his daughter and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. They will also be aware of how her resume sharply contrasts with theirs. It will be interesting to see how those dynamics could play out during this tumultuous time on the Security Council, with the most challenging crises being Yemen, North Korea and Syria. Ms Haley has served for nearly two years as UN ambassador. The 46-year-old former South Carolina governor - one of the few women in the Trump cabinet - gave no reason for leaving, but dismissed speculation she was planning to run for president in 2020.

Nikki Haley: Trump critic to Trump envoy The White House revolving door Former deputy National Security Council adviser Dina Powell and Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka were names initially floated as possible replacements for Ms Haley. US media has suggested the role will be sub-cabinet level, as it was under the past two Republican administrations. The Democratic Clinton and Obama administrations elevated it, and this status has been retained under President Trump. In 2008, John Bolton, a former UN ambassador and the current national security adviser, said the role did not merit cabinet rank.

He trusts her to effectively sell America First over multilateralism. Diplomats at the UN will know she is held in high regard by the president, his daughter and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. They will also be aware of how her resume sharply contrasts with theirs. It will be interesting to see how those dynamics could play out during this tumultuous time on the Security Council, with the most challenging crises being Yemen, North Korea and Syria. Ms Haley has served for nearly two years as UN ambassador. The 46-year-old former South Carolina governor - one of the few women in the Trump cabinet - gave no reason for leaving, but dismissed speculation she was planning to run for president in 2020. This video can not be played Trump to Haley: ""Hopefully you'll be coming back at some point ... you can have your pick"" President Trump said she had done ""an incredible job"". Nikki Haley: Trump critic to Trump envoy The White House revolving door Former deputy National Security Council adviser Dina Powell and Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka were names initially floated as possible replacements for Ms Haley. US media has suggested the role will be sub-cabinet level, as it was under the past two Republican administrations. The Democratic Clinton and Obama administrations elevated it, and this status has been retained under President Trump. In 2008, John Bolton, a former UN ambassador and the current national security adviser, said the role did not merit cabinet rank. ""One,it overstates the role and importance the UN should have in US foreign policy,external, second, you shouldn't have two secretaries in the same department,"" he said, according to the New York Times.

"This video can not be played Frightened Rabbit set for emotional return Frightened Rabbit are preparing for their ""highly emotional"" return to the stage after the death of singer Scott Hutchison. Mr Hutchison'sbody was foundon the banks of the Firth of Forth after he took his own life in May. His brother and band mate Grant said he was ""more nervous"" about this weekend's performance than he had ever been before. Frightened Rabbit's appearance at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Bandstand will be part of a charity event to raise money for the social enterprise Social Bite. If you or someone you know has been affected by mental health problems,these organisations may be able to help. The Selkirk band, formed by Mr Hutchison and Grant on drums, were signed up to the concert - which is part of aSocial Bite's sleep in the park event,externalto raise money for homeless people - before Mr Hutchison's death. The remaining band members felt this was the right opportunity for their first show without him. They will be joined by special guests in a tribute. Grant Hutchison will play at Kelvingrove Bandstand this weekend The concert will also raise funds for a charity Mr Hutchison's family are setting up in his memory. Grant said: ""It seemed like the right thing to do, and like a natural thing to do - to make a positive thing out of something that personally was a very tragic event - to be able to help two charities and two causes, and also to play with people that are good friends."" Asked how he would feel playing without his brother, he said: ""To be honest, I don't know. ""I don't think it's something I can really prepare for. It's going to be highly emotional, but I think the setting for it, both physically and the fact that it's a charity event for Social Bite, means it's a positive way to do that for the first time. ""I think I'll be more nervous than I've ever been for a Frightened Rabbit gig before. It'll be strange."" 'His music meant so much to people' Profile: Frightened Rabbit Scott Hutchison at the BBC Scott's family said there had been concerns about his mental health and they were ""devastated"" by his death. Looking to the future, Grant said he was still grieving but the band had plans to continue. He said: ""All of us are dealing with Scott's death on a personal level. It's been seven months, that's a very short time. ""We do have something planned for next year which was meant to happen this year which we'll hopefully announce at the start of the year."" Scott Hutchison died in May Frightened Rabbit, pictured here at Glastonbury in 2013, released five albums Frightened Rabbit were formed with Scott Hutchison on vocals and guitar and his brother Grant on drums, with the band's most recent line-up also featuring Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. They released the first of their five albums, Sing the Greys, in 2006, with Scott also releasing a solo album called Owl John. Scott and Grant had formed a new band called Mastersystem, joining forces with Justin Lockey from Editors and his brother James, a film maker. Scott had also hinted at a sixth Frightened Rabbit album being released before the end of the year, saying they had five or six songs that were coming together.

"Mobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users. A statement on its website,external, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday. It said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening. But some users told the BBC they were still having issues with texting and urged O2 to fix the glitches. ""I have a Tesco mobile [which uses the O2 network] - any texts I send say 'not sent. Tap to try again',"" wrote Lesley. ""Each tap brings the same message! But I find the person I've sent it to actually has received it!"" Another user Steve wrote: ""No, it's most definitely not fixed as there are numerous error messages sending texts as well as duplicated sendings."" Can I claim compensation from O2? An O2 spokeswoman said: ""A small proportion of customers have reported issues sending text messages. We can see that the vast majority are being sent and received successfully and our technical teams are investigating. ""Our 3G and 4G data services are performing as normal."" Earlier, O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Ericsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the ""faulty software"" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned. In a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: ""I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can. ""We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry."" Ericsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries. Customers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney. Ms Dewdney, who writes a blog calledThe Complaining Cow,external, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care. That means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone. This must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle. Ms Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint. Ericsson president BÃ¶rje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption. He said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added. Japan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted. Network down: how people are coping without a signal O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working. Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts. ""As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses. ""Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,"" he said. O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption On Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having. Allison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and was unable to get to a landline. ""I'm disabled ... I'm in a wheelchair,"" she told the BBC. ""So having no data but also no calls as well means I can't contact anyone if I have a fall or if I need anything."" Lynsey Greavesruns a company in Doncaster providing home visits to the elderly and vulnerable. Her 130 staff all rely on O2 phones to access rotas, schedules, names and addresses. She called in extra office staff to give out the information for each visit over the phone. ""There are nine of us trying to sort it now,"" she said. ""It's been a nightmare."" Luke Staggruns a plumbing business and depends on his phone, but he couldn't get through to customers or use his sat nav. ""That's a whole day wasted,"" he said. ""I'll be seeking to recoup my losses, especially as a business customer."" Mischa Bittaris also a plumber. He said he had been ""unable to contact any of my engineers or customers via email, unable to use our mobile systems to contact any engineers at all, so everyone's just had to down tools today"". ""A lot of money lost and the first thing I know about it is via the BBC website, no contact from O2 at all, disappointing,"" he added. Omeran Amiratsaid he had been a loyal O2 customer for a long time. He said he had bids on eBay on Thursday morning but he could not do them because the O2 network was down. ""It's Christmas, the budget's tight for me, there were presents I was supposed to be buying for my daughter and my son on eBay today. They've gone now."" He said he had lost the bids and ""O2 are responsible"".

"This video can not be played Stall holders at Manchester's Christmas market worry they will lose customers Millions of customers have been unable to access their data on the O2 network after the companyexperienced technical problems. Here is a selection of some of the difficulties people have experienced when they were unable to use the service. Peter says that the outage shows how reliant we are on technology Peter Wilson, from West Drayton, realised the importance of mobile technology when his partner collapsed in central London. ""Libby collapsed in the branch of a well-known coffee chain when she was on her way to work,"" Peter told the BBC. The couple were eventually able to make contact via wi-fi and the emergency 999 number. Thankfully, Libby is now recovering but he says:  ""It made this morning very stressful and at a critical moment it provided clear evidence about how reliant we are on data and phone networks."" The 02 data outage meant that Greg was late for work and also had to abandon his bike Greg Ashworth, a senior insurance clerk in Blackpool, received a notification in the morning telling him there was no service on his network. To make matters worse, Greg told the BBC his motorbike also broke down on his way to work. Not only was he unable to phone his employer to say he was running late, he could not get through to the breakdown company. There was a limited service later on so he was eventually able to contact his manager and a taxi firm. ""The downside was I've had to abandon my motorbike."" Lynsey Greaves, who works for a domiciliary care agency in Doncaster, where electronic care monitoring is used, told the BBC carers were unable to see their rotas because of the outage. They were also unable to log in to service users' calls, see maps or send messages. ""It brought our company to a halt. Nightmare. What was their plan B?""

"The violence of the ""gilets jaunes"" protests has shocked France Tourist sites in Paris are to close on Saturday amid fears of further street violence from ""yellow vest"" anti-government protests. Across France, 89,000 police officers will be on duty and armoured vehicles will be deployed in the capital, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced. Police have urged shops and restaurants on Paris's Champs-Elysees to shut and some museums will also be closed. Paris endured some of the worst rioting in decades last Saturday. The government has said it is scrapping unpopular fuel tax increases in its budget - the original trigger for the protests. But broader discontent with the government has spread and protests have erupted over other issues. An official with the interior ministry told AFP news agency authorities were braced for ""significant violence"" on Saturday, with activists from both the far right and far left planning to converge on the capital. In an interview with TV channel TF1, Mr Philippe said 8,000 police would be deployed in Paris as well as a dozen armoured vehicles. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Will you be affected by the closures? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external He repeated an appeal for calm but added: ""We are facing people who are not here to protest, but to smash and we want to have the means to not give them a free rein."" Earlier, Mr Philippe suggested further concessions to protesters, telling the Senate that the government was open to new measures to help the lowest-paid workers. The operator of the Eiffel Tower said the threat of violent protests on Saturday made it impossible to ensure ""adequate security conditions"". City authorities say they are stepping up protection for famous landmarks after the Arc de Triomphe was damaged last week. Culture Minister Franck Riester said the Louvre and Orsay museums, opera houses and the Grand Palais complex were among sites that would be closed. Police secured the Trocadero place near the Eiffel Tower during last week's demonstrations ""We cannot take the risk when we know the threat,"" he told RTL radio. Police have asked stores and restaurants along the Champs-Elysees and other major shopping streets to stay closed and to remove any outdoor items such as tables and chairs. A series of football matches have also been postponed on Saturday. They include those between Paris and Montpellier, Monaco and Nice, Toulouse and Lyon, and Saint-Etienne and Marseille. On Thursday young people took to the streets, protesting over education reforms. More than 140 people were arrested when a protest outside a school in Mantes-la-Jolie to the west of Paris ended in clashes with police. Pictures of the arrests, in which the students are made to kneel and put their hands behind their heads, sparked outrage on social media. Allow Twitter content?

Students have been angered by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to change the end-of-school exam, known as the baccalaureate, which is required for entrance to university. Critics fear the reforms will limit opportunity and breed inequality. Students at Saint-ExupÃ©ry high school in Mantes-la-Jolie were detained by police The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters, so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law, initially complained at a sharp increase in diesel taxes. Mr Macron said his motivation for the increase was environmental, but protesters accused him of being out of touch. The government later scrapped the plan but the yellow vest protesters were not placated. Last week, the movement - despite a lack of central leadership - issued more than 40 demands to government. Among them were a minimum pension, widespread changes to the tax system, and a reduction in the retirement age. The protest movement has gained momentum via social media, encompassing a whole range of participants from the anarchist far left to the nationalist far right, and moderates in between.

"JK Rowling hired Amanda Donaldson to help organise her business and personal matters. The former personal assistant of JK Rowling has been described as a ""good liar"" by the author's husband. Dr Neil Murray made the comment during a civil case at Airdrie Sheriff Court against Amanda Donaldson. Ms Donaldson is accused of fraudulently using the Harry Potter creator's credit card to fund spending sprees that included buying Â£3,629 of luxury cosmetics from Molton Brown. The 35-year-old, from Coatbridge, in Lanarkshire, denies the claims. Dr Murray said Amanda Donaldson had been employed to help organise his wife's business and personal matters. He said she was suspended and later dismissed in 2017 over alleged unauthorised spending that also included Â£2,139 in stationery shop goods from Paper Tiger and more than Â£1,800 spent at Starbucks and Costa. His wife claims Ms Donaldson wrongly benefited to a total value of nearly Â£24,000 Dr Murray said the biggest concern was over cash withdrawals of Â£400 and Â£250 in December 2016 that Ms Donaldson claimed were for a Christmas lunch deposit. Chartered accountant Steven Simou had earlier told the court that he had contacted the restaurant involved and found no deposit had been requested or taken off the final bill. Dr Neil Murray said he was ""really taken"" by how good a liar Ms Donaldson was. Dr Murray said he had then challenged Ms Donaldson in ""an astonishing encounter"". He said: ""Amanda had always adopted a lively, slightly bubbly, a bit scatty demeanour. ""I thought she might be emotional or run about the office looking for bits of paper, but what I found was a completely different personality. ""She shut down, was calm and basically lied. At the end of the encounter I was really taken at how good a liar she was."" The author's husband said there was a small staff of four full-time and two part-time workers who shared an office with Ms Donaldson in Edinburgh. Asked by JK Rowling's solicitor, Kirsteen MacDonald, if there was any reason for the Â£3,629 spend at Molton Brown, Dr Murray said: ""Well not for the office, it doesn't make sense. ""I think the vast majority was purchased by Amanda for Amanda."" JK Rowling was named Companion of Honour by the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 2017 Dr Murray said there was ""no question"" about what the credit card was meant to be used for. ""This was a business card to facilitate my wife's business life,"" he told the court. He added: ""I heard from office staff there was an occasion Amanda was out socially with staff and they bought pizza. ""Amanda offered to pay for the group and took out the business credit card. I was told she said 'don't worry, Neil doesn't check this card'."" Accountant Steven Simou earlier told the court that a safe, which Ms Donaldson had access to, was found to be missing more than Â£7,700 after she was suspended. The accountant said he had analysed the credit card account after a concern was raised by another member of staff. He said: ""I was just quite shocked to see so many expenses there, clearly not of a business nature."" He added: ""Certain expenses stood out more than others - Costa, Starbucks, bakeries, Boots and other high street shops you wouldn't normally associate with a business spend."" Cross-examined by Amanda Donaldson's lawyer, Mr Simou acknowledged that he did not know what instructions she had been given for using the card.
