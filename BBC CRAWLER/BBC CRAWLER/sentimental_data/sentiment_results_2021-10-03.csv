"Specially designed barges were used in the construction of North Sea Link The world's longest under-sea electricity cable, transferring green power between Norway and the UK, has begun operation. The 450-mile (725km) cable connects Blyth in Northumberland with the Norwegian village of Kvilldal. At full 1,400 megawatt capacity it will import enough hydro-power to supply 1.4 million homes, National Grid said. National Grid Ventures president Cordi O'Hara said it was a ""remarkable feat of engineering"". She added: ""We had to go through mountains, fjords and across the North Sea to make this happen. ""North Sea Link (NSL) is also a great example of two countries working together to maximise their renewable energy resources for mutual benefit."" National Grid said the â¬1.6bn (Â£1.37bn) joint venture with Norwegian power operator Statnett would help the UK reduce carbon emissions by 23 million tonnes by 2030. It has four other power cables running to Belgium, France and the Netherlands and said 90% of energy imported in this way would be from zero carbon sources by 2030. The link from Blyth in Northumberland to Kvilldal in Norway took six years to build Hydropower in Norway and wind power in the UK are subject to weather conditions and fluctuations in demand. Using NSL, renewable power can be exported from the UK when wind generation is high and electricity demand low, or be imported from Norway when demand is high and wind generation low. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy minister Greg Hands said NSL enabled both countries to ""benefit from the flexibility and energy security that interconnectors provide"". He added: ""This pioneering partnership shows first-hand how crucial international cooperation will be in helping us to deliver on our net zero ambitions.""

"Bernard Tapie faced great highs and lows in his colourful career One of France's most recognisable figures, the businessman, sports club owner and politician Bernard Tapie, has died at the age of 78. Tapie, who had battled stomach cancer for the past four years, died peacefully, surrounded by his family, they said in a statement. At one time he owned Adidas, Olympique Marseille and was a minister under President Francois Mitterrand. He also had a string of legal problems and served time in jail. Tapie's wife Dominique and his family announced his death with ""immense sadness"". They said he wished to be buried in Marseille, ""the city of his heart"". President Emmanuel Macron was among the many to pay tribute to him, saying his ""ambition, energy and enthusiasm... were a source of inspiration for generations of French people"". Olympique de Marseille won the French Championship five times while Tapie was president, and took home the UEFA Champions League in 1993 Bernard Tapie grew up in the working class suburbs of Paris. He began his career as a singer, then a race car driver - before discovering a talent for buying up failing businesses and selling them on, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris. He demonstrated his wealth by buying the Olympique de Marseille football club, which won the French championship while he was their owner. However, he was accused of match-fixing and the club was stripped of its league championship title and later relegated to a lower division. He also bought a cycling team that twice won the Tour de France, was the majority shareholder of the sportswear brand Adidas and owned a number of newspapers. In the 1990s, he dabbled in politics, briefly became urban affairs minister and later elected as a leftist French and European parliament MP in Marseille. In 1984, Tapie (right) sang one of his old songs on a TV show hosted by Sacha Distel (left) He also had a lifelong interest in entertainment. In 1966, aged 23, he recorded songs under the name Bernard Tapy, but failed to make much of impact. He returned to singing in the 1980s, after making his name as a corporate raider, and collaborated with acclaimed songwriter Didier Barbelivien. In the 1990s, he appeared in major films including Claude Lelouch's Men, Women: A User's Manual, as well as plays. Over the past 20 years he has starred as a police inspector in a TV drama and hosted a number of chat shows. Bernard and Dominique Tapie at the unveiling of a new theatre in Paris in 2007 Tapie's late career as a showman took off as his empire crumbled amid a string of legal problems from the late 1990s. He served time in jail for match fixing and other charges concerning corruption, tax fraud and misuse of corporate assets. Earlier this year, he and his wife were attacked in a violent burglary at their home. Bernard Tapie faced the ups and downs of his life always with panache, our correspondent notes, and he was an admired and fascinating figure until the end.

"Many petrol stations in the South East that have had fuel - such as this one in Ashford, Kent - have seen long queues Petrol supplies are still not getting to London and south-east England, with more than a fifth of forecourts still dry, retailers have said. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said it hoped the Army driving tankers would help increase fuel deliveries. But it said the ""crisis is virtually at an end"" in Scotland, Wales, the North and Midlands. Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier did not rule out supply chain problems continuing until Christmas. Fuel supply: Military to deliver petrol to UK garages from Monday Conservative conference: UK in period of adjustment after Brexit, says PM Brian Madderson, chairman of the PRA, said: ""The fuel is still not going to the pumps that need it most in London and the South East."" On Sunday morning up to 22% of filling stations in the UK's most populous region were dry and only 60% had both grades of fuel available. The PRA said only 6% of stations were dry in the Midlands, northern England and Scotland. Mr Madderson said the PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations, was ""disappointed that no concerted action is being taken to address the supply problems"" in the South. Filling stations need to get more information ahead of time about deliveries, he said. However, he said in the North there was a ""plentiful supply at filling stations"" and little queuing. Mr Madderson added he hoped the army being deployed ""will help to increase fuel deliveries"". From Monday military personnel will start to be available for hauliers to use, with more than 65 drivers available initially. There are plans for 200 members of the army to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers. A government spokesman said: ""Stocks in London and the South of England have been recovering at slightly slower rates than other parts of the UK, so we have begun deploying military personnel to boost supply in these areas."" ""More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England."" 23 September:BP temporarily closes some petrol stationsdue to a shortage of lorry drivers 25 September:After days of long queues at stations, with many running dry, the governmentannounces a temporary visa scheme, allowing 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK in the run-up to Christmas 27 September:The Army is put on standbyto help deliver fuel to stations hit by shortages 28 September:Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsays the situation at forecourts is ""stabilising"", while the PRA says there are ""early signs"" pressure is starting to ease at pumps 2 October:Despite a ""distinct improvement"" nationwide,the PRA says petrol supplies remain critical in London and south-east England Supermarket Sainsbury's said it was still seeing ""high demand"" for fuel at its petrol stations. ""We're working closely with our supplier to maintain supply and all our sites continue to receive fuel,"" a spokeswoman said. Many sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: The ""big lever marked uncontrolled immigration"" will not be pulled to solve the driver shortage On Sunday Boris Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that labour market problems would not be solved by pulling ""the big lever marked uncontrolled immigration"" to allow in large numbers of foreign workers. He insisted the lack of lorry drivers was not just a problem for the UK, and claimed the US, China, and some countries in Europe were having similar issues. However, there have been no reports of fuel problems or interruptions to food supply linked to driver shortages in those countries. The rush of people filling up their cars in the past week was triggered by reports that a shortage of tanker drivers was affecting deliveries. The prime minister said the UK economy was going through a ""period of adjustment"" and the way to get more HGV drivers was for the industry to ensure they were ""decently paid"". He added: ""We have got to make sure people come on stream as fast as we practically can. ""When people voted for change in 2016, when they voted for change again in 2019 as they did, they voted for the end of a broken model of the UK economy that relied on low wages and low skills and chronic low productivity. We are moving away from that."" More than a week on from the first forecourt queues and closures, what began as a problem mainly affecting Southern parts of the country has returned to being just that. Following limited supply issues caused by a tanker driver shortage, pleas not to panic buy were seemingly ignored. The resulting crisis has shown the impact a sudden hike in demand can have on the finely balanced supply chain. Measures aimed at helping the distribution system cope have included temporarilyrelaxing competition laws, so oil firms could better share information and target fuel deliveries. The situation appears to have improved markedly in many regions of the UK but less so in the densely-populated capital and the South East. Businesses, the government and of course millions of motorists will hope the deployment of military drivers from Monday helps to plug remaining gaps.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak at the Conservative conference in Manchester Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said there is no ""magic wand"" to make disruption to fuel and food supplies disappear overnight. He told the BBC supply problems were global, and ministers were doing everything they can to mitigate them. ""Pragmatic controlled immigration"" could be part of the short-term solution, he said. He was speaking ahead of addressing the Conservative party conference amid concerns over living standards. The Chancellor's first in-person speech to Tory members comes against a backdrop of rising food and energy prices, alongsidecuts to universal creditbenefits and tax rises to fund the NHS and social care. Supply chain issues are continuing to affect several sectors, with the military due to begin driving fuel to petrol stations. PM: UK in period of adjustment after Brexit What impact has the furlough scheme had? Most roles not filled in plan to help young jobless Kuenssberg: Is the Tory party at ease with itself on tax? Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Sunak said ""challenges"" to supply chains are not unique to the UK but were a problem across the world as a result of lockdowns and the rapid re-opening of economies. But he said the government was doing ""everything we can to mitigate the bits of that that we can"". ""There are things that we can do and should do and it is reasonable that people expect us to do what we can,"" he said. ""Whether it's short-term visas, speeding up testing capacity for HGV drivers, of course we should do all those things and we are doing all those things, but we can't wave a magic wand and make global supply chain challenges disappear overnight."" But he said the problems ""we are seeing at the moment will be transitory and will pass through the system"". PM Boris Johnson also insisted supply problems were part of an international trend, telling reporters they were due to the global economy ""coming back to life"" after Covid shutdowns. ""There's a shortage of lorry drivers actually around the world,"" he added. The prime minister tried on Sunday to present this as short-term pain as part of what he believes will be very significant long-term gains because of Brexit. Now, the prime minister and other ministers would not say, 'oh, suck it up, enjoy the fact that you have to queue for petrol'. But they have, in the last few days, woven this narrative: to take some of the things that we see happening, acutely, whether in agriculture, whether in fuel supply - and to turn them into this story of short-term pain for a long-term gain. That was not Rishi Sunak's language. He talked rather soberly about global supply shortages, things that the government can mitigate, clearly he believes the government does have a role. But he was very different in tone, which was something on the day of a big chancellor's speech at this conference, very well worth noting. In his speech later, Mr Sunak will say the best protection against cost of living challenges is to give people the skills and opportunities to get better paid work. The chancellor will commit Â£500m to renew job support programmes and  promise to ""double down"" on help for the jobs market after Covid. He will also promise to reshape the economy around technology and scientific innovation. Ahead of his speech, Mr Sunak praised the UK's economic recovery but warned the ""job is not done yet"". ""At the start of this crisis I made a promise to do whatever it takes, and I'm ready to double down on that promise now as we come out of this crisis,"" he said. He will also promise to make the UK the ""the most exciting place on the planet"" through better infrastructure and improved skills. Activists queued earlier for a space to watch Rishi Sunak's speech, the biggest of the conference so far His speech will come on the second day of conference, and he will say the Kickstart Scheme - which subsidises eligible jobs for young people on universal credit - will be extended by three months to March 2022. The scheme, launched in September last year, was allocated Â£2bn in funding to create 250,000 jobs by the end of 2021. However, only 76,900 have actually started Kickstart roles, accordingto latest figures,external, with 196,300 roles in total made available for youngsters to apply for. The Federation of Small Businesses had been calling for the scheme to be extended, amid reports that firms had encountered delays and found the scheme slow. Mr Sunak will also announce the extension of the JETS scheme to help long-term unemployed people on universal credit until September 2022. A separate scheme paying employers Â£3,000 per apprentice they take on will also be prolonged by four months until the end of January. And the government is promising more help finding work for those coming off the furlough scheme, whichclosed last week, having paid the wages of 11.6 million workers during the pandemic. The various extensions will be paid for with Â£500m of funding, with the Treasury saying that details will be confirmed at the Spending Review on 27 October. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government's plan to support jobs was ""struggling"" and had ""failed to hit its original targets"". ""An extended deadline will do nothing to compensate for the chancellor's tax rises, cost of living crisis and cuts to universal credit,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr Show: ""We don't want to raise taxes"" Boris Johnson says the UK is in a ""period of adjustment"" after Brexit and Covid as the country faces petrol shortages and supply chain issues. A lack of HGV drivers and high demandplunged the UK into a fuel crisislast week, with lengthy queues and closures. Worries persist about the cost of living, as food and energy prices rise,alongside cuts to universal credit. But the PM insisted his plan for a higher wage, higher skilled economy would offer a long-term solution. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on the first day of Conservative Party conference, Mr Johnson said: ""There will be a period of adjustment, but that is what I think we need to see."" He would not say if supply issues would affect Christmas, but later told reporters he was ""very confident"" the festive season would be ""considerably better"" than last year. A few thousand peopleheld an anti-government protest outside the event in Manchesteron Sunday, where the Tories will be hosting party members until Wednesday. PM vows economic change as Tory conference begins Who funds the Tory party and what's in it for them? The PM also refused to rule out raising taxes again just three weeks before Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces his annual Budget. He said he was a ""zealous opponent of unnecessary tax rises"", but warned the pandemic had hit the UK's economy like a ""fiscal meteorite"". Last month, the government announced it would beraising National Insurance to pay for health and social care. At the time, when asked whether he would rule out additional taxes, Mr Johnson said he couldgive an ""emotional commitment"" that he did not want to introduce further rises. Earlier this year Mr Sunak also froze income tax thresholds -leading to more people paying the levy- and the extra Â£20 weekly universal credit payment, brought in during the pandemic, is due to end this week. Asked on Sunday by Andrew Marr if he would raise taxes again, Mr Johnson replied: ""If I can possibly avoid it, I do not want to raise taxes again."" The PM added: ""I can tell you that you have no fiercer and more zealous opponent of unnecessary tax rises than me, but we have had to deal with a pandemic on a scale which this country has not seen before in our lifetimes and long before. ""We don't want to raise taxes, of course we don't, but what we will not do is be irresponsible with the public finances."" Cabinet members are warning against any further tax increases, with Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg telling a party conference fringe event that ""tax is about the highest level it has been since the war"" and ""we are at the upper reaches of the reasonableness of the tax burden"". He added: ""We are [at] about the limit of what taxes we can raise."" Tees Valley Tory Mayor Ben Houchen also called on the PM to avoid further tax rises, saying they would not be ""helpful"" for businesses coming out of the pandemic. Speaking to BBC News at the conference, he said: ""I appreciate it is a difficult job being the prime minister and chancellor [and] to balance the books. ""But if we want to support those businesses to create those jobs to put more money in people's pockets, I don't think tax rises are the way to go about it."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss insisted the government did not want to put additional tax burden on working people, saying growing the economy would ""pay the bill from Covid"". She told the BBC: ""None of us want to see taxes rise, we are a low tax party. We understand that it is enterprise that is going to deliver the opportunities and we need to keep the tax burden low at the same time as growing our economy."" Liz Truss made her first conference speech as foreign secretary on Sunday Asked about job shortages and supply issues in shops and on petrol forecourts, the PM insisted the lack of lorry drivers - affecting the delivery of goods - was not just a UK issue, claiming the United States and China were seeing similar problems, as well as some countries in Europe. And he said the petrol shortages were ""very largely driven by demand"", adding: ""I understand people's frustrations and I understand how infuriating it is when you turn up and can't get any. But we are making sure we have the supplementary drivers where necessary."" Mr Johnson called out those who wanted to ""go back to the tired, failed old model"" of ""reaching for the lever called uncontrolled immigration"" to bring people into the country to fill the job gaps. But he did not reject comments made by Mr Sunak, who toldthe Daily Mail,externalthe ""very real"" shortages could affect Christmas, Instead the PM said the country was going through a ""period of adjustment"" post-Brexit and needed to look to a future of ""better paid, better skilled jobs"" for British people. Mr Johnson added: ""What we had for decades was a system whereby [sectors like] the road haulage industry... were not investing in the truck stops, not improving conditions, not improving pay and we relied on very hard working people who were willing to come in, largely from European accession countries, to do that work under those conditions. ""What you need to do is make sure that people now invest in basic equipment, such as truck stops, and better pay. ""When people voted for change in 2016 [over Brexit] and when people voted for change again in 2019...they voted for the end of a broken model of the UK economy that relied on low wages and low skill and chronic low productivity and we are moving away from that."" Andrew Marr and Boris Johnson argued about what's happened to the average wage, with the prime minister saying we're finally seeing ""growth in wages, after more than 10 years of flat-lining"" but Andrew Marr saying that ""in real terms over the last three months wages have gone down, not up"". So, what's been happening? Real wages, a measure that takes account of rising prices, peaked just before the financial crash in 2008 and only returned to that level in August 2020. So, there has been a decade of little improvement overall. Rather than ""flatlining"" - as Mr Johnson claimed - it was actually roughly five years of falls followed by growth over most of the last five years. Last year saw record dips and jumps as the economy was shut down and then re-opened. But the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that growth may be stalling, with real wages looking lower in July than they were in April.

"Armed forces personnel will begin delivering petrol to garages across the UK from Monday, the government says. Almost 200 servicemen and women, 100 of them drivers, will provide ""temporary"" support to ease pressure on stations. Ministers have also announced that up to 300 overseas fuel tanker drivers will be able to work in the UK immediately until the end of March. There have been long queues at petrol stations this week after a shortage of drivers disrupted fuel deliveries. Petrol prices at eight-year high amid fuel crisis Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Ministers - who have maintained there is enough fuel if people buy at their normal rates - say the situation at petrol station forecourts is improving, with more fuel now being delivered than sold. But they acknowledge some parts of the country are worse affected than others. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations said Scotland, the north of England and parts of the Midlands had seen a ""distinct improvement"" with fewer dry sites. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it remained a ""big problem"" in London and south-east England, where ""if anything it had got worse."" He said the military drivers will be a ""large help"" but a ""prioritisation of deliveries to filling stations, particularly the independent ones, which are the neighbourhood sites"" was needed ""immediately"". Mr Madderson warned drivers would see a rise in fuel prices next week, but because of ""global factors"" not because of profiteering. On Friday, the RAC motoring group also saidthe disruption in deliveries was continuing to ease, though many areas were still experiencing supply issues. Smaller fuel stations were facing major supply problems as drivers filled up for the weekend, it said. Military personnel are currently training at haulier sites and will be on the road delivering fuel supplies across the country to ""help fuel stocks further improve"" from Monday, the government said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said personnel would be seen working alongside drivers this weekend following training this week. In addition to the 300 fuel tanker drivers being allowed to work temporarily in the UK, temporary visas are also being offered to 4,700 food haulage drivers who are able to arrive from late October and leave by 28 February 2022. Visas are being offered to a further 5,500 poultry workers who can come from late October and stay until 31 December. Previously, the government said these temporary visas would last until Christmas Eve. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said there were ""continued signs that the situation at the pumps is slowly improving"". ""UK forecourt stock levels are trending up, deliveries of fuel to forecourts are above normal levels, and fuel demand is stabilising,"" he said. ""It's important to stress there is no national shortage of fuel in the UK, and people should continue to buy fuel as normal."" By political correspondent Pete Saull More than a week after queues started appearing on petrol station forecourts, just under 200 military personnel will take to the roads. Ministers say it takes time to train up servicemen and women to drive large tankers carrying highly flammable substances into built-up areas. While they will help with getting supplies to garages, there's been a concern inside government that falling back on the armed forces could be counter-productive. What message does it send to worried motorists to see soldiers driving petrol tankers? Could it lead to more panic buying? Ministers are confident the situation will continue to stabilise, but they've been under pressure to take more urgent action. It's notable that alongside the decision to deploy the military, up to 300 tanker drivers will be allowed into the UK from overseas immediately - several weeks before the wider visa scheme comes into effect. Labour leaderSir Keir Starmer called on the PM to recall Parliamentfrom party conference recess, saying ""emergency action"" was needed to speed up the visas. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson accused the haulage industry of being too reliant on low-paid migrant workers. He added that he would not allow the UK to repeat the ""failures"" of the past, by allowing mass immigration to create a ""low-wage, low-skill economy"" for British workers. The haulage industry says the driver shortage already existed, but has been made worse by factors including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, low wages and poor working conditions. A survey from earlier this year suggests a number of reasons for the driver shortage In addition to offering temporary visas, the government last week set out a number of other measures aimed at limiting disruption in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. These include increasing HGV (heavy goods vehicle) testing capacity, sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence, encouraging them back into the industry, and offering training courses for HGV drivers. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned there is global disruption to supply chains in other industries, which could continue until Christmas. ""These shortages are very real,"" Mr Sunaktold the Daily Mail,external. ""We're seeing real disruptions in supply chains in different sectors, not just here but around the world. We are determined to do what we can to try to mitigate as much of this as we can.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr Show: ""We don't want to raise taxes"" Boris Johnson says the UK is in a ""period of adjustment"" after Brexit and Covid as the country faces petrol shortages and supply chain issues. A lack of HGV drivers and high demandplunged the UK into a fuel crisislast week, with lengthy queues and closures. Worries persist about the cost of living, as food and energy prices rise,alongside cuts to universal credit. But the PM insisted his plan for a higher wage, higher skilled economy would offer a long-term solution. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on the first day of Conservative Party conference, Mr Johnson said: ""There will be a period of adjustment, but that is what I think we need to see."" He would not say if supply issues would affect Christmas, but later told reporters he was ""very confident"" the festive season would be ""considerably better"" than last year. A few thousand peopleheld an anti-government protest outside the event in Manchesteron Sunday, where the Tories will be hosting party members until Wednesday. PM vows economic change as Tory conference begins Who funds the Tory party and what's in it for them? The PM also refused to rule out raising taxes again just three weeks before Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces his annual Budget. He said he was a ""zealous opponent of unnecessary tax rises"", but warned the pandemic had hit the UK's economy like a ""fiscal meteorite"". Last month, the government announced it would beraising National Insurance to pay for health and social care. At the time, when asked whether he would rule out additional taxes, Mr Johnson said he couldgive an ""emotional commitment"" that he did not want to introduce further rises. Earlier this year Mr Sunak also froze income tax thresholds -leading to more people paying the levy- and the extra Â£20 weekly universal credit payment, brought in during the pandemic, is due to end this week. Asked on Sunday by Andrew Marr if he would raise taxes again, Mr Johnson replied: ""If I can possibly avoid it, I do not want to raise taxes again."" The PM added: ""I can tell you that you have no fiercer and more zealous opponent of unnecessary tax rises than me, but we have had to deal with a pandemic on a scale which this country has not seen before in our lifetimes and long before. ""We don't want to raise taxes, of course we don't, but what we will not do is be irresponsible with the public finances."" Cabinet members are warning against any further tax increases, with Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg telling a party conference fringe event that ""tax is about the highest level it has been since the war"" and ""we are at the upper reaches of the reasonableness of the tax burden"". He added: ""We are [at] about the limit of what taxes we can raise."" Tees Valley Tory Mayor Ben Houchen also called on the PM to avoid further tax rises, saying they would not be ""helpful"" for businesses coming out of the pandemic. Speaking to BBC News at the conference, he said: ""I appreciate it is a difficult job being the prime minister and chancellor [and] to balance the books. ""But if we want to support those businesses to create those jobs to put more money in people's pockets, I don't think tax rises are the way to go about it."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss insisted the government did not want to put additional tax burden on working people, saying growing the economy would ""pay the bill from Covid"". She told the BBC: ""None of us want to see taxes rise, we are a low tax party. We understand that it is enterprise that is going to deliver the opportunities and we need to keep the tax burden low at the same time as growing our economy."" Liz Truss made her first conference speech as foreign secretary on Sunday Asked about job shortages and supply issues in shops and on petrol forecourts, the PM insisted the lack of lorry drivers - affecting the delivery of goods - was not just a UK issue, claiming the United States and China were seeing similar problems, as well as some countries in Europe. And he said the petrol shortages were ""very largely driven by demand"", adding: ""I understand people's frustrations and I understand how infuriating it is when you turn up and can't get any. But we are making sure we have the supplementary drivers where necessary."" Mr Johnson called out those who wanted to ""go back to the tired, failed old model"" of ""reaching for the lever called uncontrolled immigration"" to bring people into the country to fill the job gaps. But he did not reject comments made by Mr Sunak, who toldthe Daily Mail,externalthe ""very real"" shortages could affect Christmas, Instead the PM said the country was going through a ""period of adjustment"" post-Brexit and needed to look to a future of ""better paid, better skilled jobs"" for British people. Mr Johnson added: ""What we had for decades was a system whereby [sectors like] the road haulage industry... were not investing in the truck stops, not improving conditions, not improving pay and we relied on very hard working people who were willing to come in, largely from European accession countries, to do that work under those conditions. ""What you need to do is make sure that people now invest in basic equipment, such as truck stops, and better pay. ""When people voted for change in 2016 [over Brexit] and when people voted for change again in 2019...they voted for the end of a broken model of the UK economy that relied on low wages and low skill and chronic low productivity and we are moving away from that."" Andrew Marr and Boris Johnson argued about what's happened to the average wage, with the prime minister saying we're finally seeing ""growth in wages, after more than 10 years of flat-lining"" but Andrew Marr saying that ""in real terms over the last three months wages have gone down, not up"". So, what's been happening? Real wages, a measure that takes account of rising prices, peaked just before the financial crash in 2008 and only returned to that level in August 2020. So, there has been a decade of little improvement overall. Rather than ""flatlining"" - as Mr Johnson claimed - it was actually roughly five years of falls followed by growth over most of the last five years. Last year saw record dips and jumps as the economy was shut down and then re-opened. But the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that growth may be stalling, with real wages looking lower in July than they were in April.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr Show: ""People should trust the police"" The government ""will stop at nothing to make sure that we get more rapists behind bars"", Boris Johnson has said. The PM told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that prosecutions for rape and sexual violence were ""going wrong"". He added women should have confidence in the police, with the nation's officers ""overwhelmingly trustworthy"". The jailing of Wayne Couzens for Sarah Everard's murder has raised questions about women's safety, and trust in the police and criminal justice system. Couzens was a police officer in London at the time of Ms Everard's murder, and the Metropolitan Police is facing questions over its failure to stop him. What should you do if you are stopped by police? Police to be quizzed over Couzens' work at Commons Rape case blame game between police and CPS - report Asked by Andrew Marr whether he would launch an independent public inquiry into the case, Mr Johnson said he wanted the police watchdog to complete its review first. He said: ""We do need to look systemically at not just the Wayne Couzens case, but the whole handling of rape, domestic violence, sexual violence and female complaints about harassment, all together."" Speaking later, he added: ""There are delays taking place at every stage in the process. ""You know the reasons - it's all the complexities to do with people's mobile phones, the evidence that's produced by the defence, and all that kind of stuff. ""But, in the end, that is no excuse. We have to have these complaints properly dealt with."" Over the past five years, cases reported to police - and initially recorded as rape - have risen sharply. However, the proportion making it to court - known as prosecutions - in that time has more than halved,the BBC's Reality Check team found. Figures for 2019-20 show 1,439 suspects in cases when a rape had been alleged were convicted of rape or lesser offences in England and Wales, the lowest level since records began. This was down from 1,925 the previous year, despite a rise in reports of rape. Rape carries a penalty of between four and 19 years' custody, with a maximum of life imprisonment in limited circumstances, according to Sentencing Council guidelines. Boris Johnson responded to questions about whether funding cuts had had an impact on rape investigations, saying the government was ""investing massively in policing and crime and in all aspects of the justice system"". In 2020-21, the budget of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) was Â£9.5bn - an increase on the previous couple of years but still below where it was in 2010. Overall, between 2010 and 2020, the MoJ had a cut of about 25% to its budget, according to official spending figures. After the last budget in March 2021, the Institute for Government projected that spending on areas including police and crime would only increase by 1% each year once you adjust for rising prices after 2021-22. In the year to March 2021, just 1.5% of recorded rapes ended in a suspect being charged or issued with a summons - roughly half as many as five years ago. This has been attributed to funding cuts, as well as a number of other things - such as big court backlogs and victims being more likely to withdraw their complaints rather than go through the often intrusive court process. What's the truth about rape prosecutions? Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is also minister for women and equalities, said the criminal justice system and the culture within the police needed to change. ""It is wrong that women don't feel safe on our streets and I personally very much understand that,"" she told the BBC. ""We will only have a truly equal society when women feel as safe as men on the streets."" The Met has been criticised over its safety advice to women after it emerged Couzens used his position as an officer to falsely arrest and kidnap Ms Everard. The advice said women who were suspicious of lone plain-clothes police officers should shout out, flag down a bus, or knock on doors for help. Mr Johnson said women who were suspicious about they way they were being treated by a police officer should follow this advice. But he added: ""My view is that the police do - overwhelmingly - a wonderful job and what I want is the public, and women in particular, girls and young women, women of all ages, to trust the police. ""They are overwhelmingly trustworthy."" The murder of Sarah Everard sparked calls for more action to tackle violence against women The Met wasfacing further questionsover its handling of vetting procedures after it confirmed Couzens stood guard within Parliament on five occasions last year. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, requested an urgent meeting with the force's leadership ""to discuss how this person could have been deemed suitable for deployment here"". It followed the revelation there were two separate allegations of indecent exposure linked to Couzens - with one in the days leading up to Ms Everard's murder. Dame Lynne Owens, the outgoing director general of the National Crime Agency, said ""we, in policing, need to take a long hard look at ourselves"" after Couzens was jailed. Shewrote on Twitter,external: ""The many good people [in] policing, at all ranks & grades, need to be part of the solution though. ""They joined because they want to make a difference and they know the public needs confidence in them."" Why do so few rape cases go to court?

"The secret wealth and dealings of some of the worldâs most powerful people has been exposed in a huge leak of 12 million files The Pandora Papers shed light on the hidden world of offshore finance and tax havens Some 35 current and former world leaders - and more than 300 public officials - are named in the files They show how the King of Jordan secretly amassed a UK and US property empire worth more than Â£70m ($100m) And they reveal how ex-UK PM Tony Blair and his wife saved Â£312,000 in tax when they bought a London office. The couple bought an offshore firm that owned the building You can watch the full BBC Panorama episode on BBC iPlayer or at the top of this page (UK only) By Pandora Papers reporting team Weâre going to leave our live coverage of the Pandora Papers here for the evening, but weâre only just getting started on this massive story â expect plenty more in the coming days. Weâll have more revelations tomorrow and from 07:00 BST weâll bring you the latest throughout the day here on the live page. And if you just canât get enough: Thanks for joining us, see you tomorrow. As we've mentioned, the BBC is one of more than 140 different media organisations involved in investigating the papers. Here's a snapshot of some of our partners' websites. In India...  The UK's Guardian newspaper... Radio France Internationale... And the Washington Post... Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta is one of the world leaders mentioned in the files Some 35 current and former world leaders were mentioned in the papers, which have been pored over by hundreds of journalists. Hereâs what some of our partner organisations have found: Still getting to grips with what the Pandora Papers are all about? Read our simple guidehere. Charities and campaigners have been responding to the Pandora Papers. Anti-poverty group Oxfam called the release ""another shocking exposÃ© of the oceans of money sloshing around the darkness of the worldâs tax havens that must prompt immediate action, as has long been promised"". The group's international tax policy lead Susana Ruiz called offshore finance ""a secret parallel system of capital"" that was ""open only to those with fat amounts of money and the greed to hoard it all untaxed"". She added: This is where our missing hospitals are. This is where the pay-packets sit of all the extra teachers and firefighters and public servants we need. Whenever a politician or business leader claims there is âno moneyâ to pay for climate damage and innovation, for more and better jobs, for a fair post-Covid recovery, for more overseas aid, they know where to look.  Big financial leaks like these are undoubtedly complicated. At their heart, they involve financial schemes most of us have never heard of, and people who might seem far removed from our day-to-day life. So why should you care? Fergus Shiel, from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)which organised the world-wide investigation of the files,external, says some people are using offshore accounts âto enrich their own families, at the expense of their citizensâ. And Lakshmi Kumar, from the think tank Global Financial Integrity, says the ability of people to hide money has a direct impact on all of our lives through, for example, lost tax revenues. âIt affects your child's access to education, access to health, access to a home,â she says. And Gerard Ryle - also from the ICIJ - explains that it shows âthe people that could end the secrecy offshore - could end what's going on - are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.â Some reaction now to the release of the Pandora Papers. One of the revelations is that Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family have secretly acquired a large amount of UK property using offshore companies. Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International called the papers a ""wake up call"" for the UK government. âOnce again Britainâs role as an enabler of global corruption and money laundering has been exposed with the same loopholes exploited to funnel suspect wealth into the country,"" said Duncan Hames, Director of Policy at Transparency International UK. ""Not only does this damage the UKâs reputation as a country governed by the rule of law, but it enriches corrupt elites around the world at the expense of their populations. No one benefits from this system but them."" The BBC approached the Aliyev family for comment but received no
response. The UK government says it is cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows. This Mayfair building was sold to a front company in 2009 The Pandora Papers also show how Azerbeijanâs ruling Aliyev family secretly acquired 17 properties â including a Â£33m London office block officially for the presidentâs 11-year-old son Heyder Aliyev. The family has been long accused of corruption in the central Asian nation. The building in Mayfair was bought in 2009 by a front company owned by a family friend of President Ilham Aliyev. It was transferred one month later to the presidentâs son, Hedyer. Another office block owned by the family was sold in 2018 for Â£66m to the Crown Estate â the Queenâs property empire that is managed by the Treasury and raises cash for the UK. When we asked the Crown Estate about the purchase, it said it carried out checks at the time but is now looking into the matter. Read the full storyhere. Itâs been 14 years since former Labour prime minister Tony Blair left No 10 with his wife Cherie by his side.Since then, Mr Blairis reported to havemade millions advising foreign governments and multinational companies. Although the full range of his business activities has never been disclosed, in 2016 Mr Blair was reported to have been paid Â£2m a year alone by bank JP Morgan after leaving office. He has since focused on his not-for-profit organisation which,according to its website,external, aims to âhelp political leaders build open, inclusive and prosperous societiesâ. Cherie is a human rights barrister and runs a legal advisory firm, Omnia Strategy, as well as a foundation for women. The couple acquired an office for her two organisations through an offshore company â a method she said was insisted on by those who sold it to them. As weâve just been saying, Tony Blair and his wife Cherie saved Â£312,000 in stamp duty tax in 2017 when buying a property in London. The four-floor building is now home to Mrs Blairâs legal advisory firm, Omnia Strategy, and her foundation for women. Letâs look at how they did it: Mrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way â but she said theyâd now brought it under UK control, meaning capital gains tax would be due if they sold it. The papers reveal how former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair saved Â£312,000 in stamp duty tax in 2017 when buying a London townhouse for Â£6.45m. Instead of buying the property directly - and paying the tax that comes with that - he and his wife Cherie bought an offshore company that owned the building. No laws were broken and thereâs no suggestion the Blairs hid their wealth, but Mr Blair has previously criticised people who âcan employ the right accountantsâ, saying âthe tax system is a haven of scams, perks, City deals and profitsâ. Mrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way but they had brought it under UK control â and that it would be liable for capital gains tax if it was resold. Read the full story on the Blairshere. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has pledged to investigate ""all our citizens mentioned in the Pandora Papers"" and take action if wrongdoing is found. It comes after the papers revealed how members of Mr Khan's inner circle, including cabinet ministers and their families, secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars. Welcoming the global investigation into the papers,Mr Khan said on Twitter,external: ""My over-two decades struggle has been premised on the belief that countries are not poor but corruption causes poverty because money is diverted from being invested in our people."" He added: ""I call on the international community to treat this grave injustice as similar to the climate change crisis."" Whatâs the story?The secret wealth of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and billionaires has been exposed in one of the biggest ever leaks of financial documents. What have they done?Many of the files involve no legal wrongdoing, but some figures face allegations of corruption, money laundering and global tax avoidance. Where can I read more?Our main storyhereruns through all the big findings - so far - and our simple guide to the story ishere. Why does this sound familiar?It is the latest in a string of leaks over the past seven years, following the FinCen Files, the Paradise Papers, the Panama Papers and LuxLeaks. As weâve been discussing,the King of Jordan has secretly acquired luxury homesin Malibu, California and Washington DC, as well as London and the English town of Ascot. In Malibu, California, he spent Â£50m ($68m) on three clifftop mansions According to California planning records, one will soon be rebuilt twice the size, and another will get a new swimming pool The kingâs properties also include apartments in Washington DC, where his son attended university A seven-bedroom apartment in this block was bought for Â£4.7m ($6.5m) in 2012 And in the UK, King Abdullah owns eight properties in London and south-east England, through offshore companies This includes these multi-million pound homes near Buckingham Palace. He bought the property on the left and three flats in the property on the right. When the BBC approached King Abdullah for comment, his lawyers said the information about his properties was not accurate or up to date. They said heâd bought them with his personal wealth. In short, pretty massive: almost 12 million leaked files make up the Pandora Papers. They come from 14 financial services companies in countries including the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Belize, Cyprus,  the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Switzerland. Combing through them has been the work of the biggest journalism partnership in history. Itâs taken 600 journalists - from more than half the worldâs countries - several months to pick out the stories youâll see over the next few days. King Abdullah has been married to Queen Rania since 1993 One of the people weâve been hearing about is the King of Jordan,who secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a string of properties in the UK and US. Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein has been King of Jordan for 22 years and is seen as a moderate Western ally in the Middle East. The 59-year-old rules a country of 10 million people and has the power to appoint governments and approve legislation. Jordan isnât a wealthy country and receives international aid. The British government is one of its biggest financial backers and is giving Â£650m over five years. King Abdullahâs sprawling property portfolio built up between 2003 and 2017. At the same time, he has been accused of presiding over an authoritarian regime at home - with protests taking place in recent years amid austerity measures and tax rises. Annelle Sheline, a Middle East analyst, says: âIt's just very, very difficult for the average Jordanian to achieve a basic level of home and family, and a good job. âSo to have it really thrown in Jordaniansâ faces that he's just been funneling money abroad all this time?  That would look really bad.â As we said earlier, lawyers for the king say heâs done nothing improper. They said heâd bought the houses with his personal wealth, which is also used to fund projects for Jordanians. The Pandora Papers investigation is the largest ever organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists â theyâre the group that looked into a string of other leaks you mightâve heard of including theFinCen Files(2020),Paradise Papers(2017) andPanama Papers(2016). âThereâs never been anything on this scale,â says Fergus Shiel, the ICIJâs managing editor. âIt shows the reality of what offshore companies can offer to help people hide dodgy cash or avoid tax."" And his colleague Gerard Ryle says: âWe are talking about some of the most famous people in the world that are in these documents. Presidents, prime ministers, government ministersâ¦ âWeâre not looking at a couple of million dollars here. Weâre looking at trillions of dollars.â One of the most powerful people named in the Pandora Papers is the King of Jordan. The leak reveals a network of secretly-owned companies used by Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein to spend more than Â£70m ($100m) on 15 homes since he became king in 1999.  The properties include three ocean-view homes in Malibu, California purchased for Â£50m ($68m) and properties in some of Londonâs most exclusive streets. The people who set up the companies for the king were careful not to identify him â in one internal document heâs called âYou know whoâ. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he had used his personal wealth to buy the properties and that there was nothing improper about him using offshore companies to do so. They also said that he uses his wealth to fund projects for Jordanâs citizens. Read our full storyhere. The papers are named after the Greek myth of Pandoraâs box. In the tale, Pandora opens a sealed box containing the forces of evil and suffering which, once released, were uncontainable. Gerard Ryle, the director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which organised the world-wide investigation of the files, says this leak was given the name because âwe're opening a box on a lot of thingsâ.

"(File Picture) Thousands of paedophiles have operated within the French Catholic Church since 1950, the head of a panel investigating abuses by church members says. Jean-Marc SauvÃ© told French media that the commission had found evidence of 2,900 to 3,200 abusers - out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics. ""That is a minimal estimate,"" he added. The commission is to release a lengthy report on Tuesday. It is based on church, court and police archives, as well as interviews with victims. The inquiry was commissioned by the French Catholic Church in 2018, following a number of scandals in other countries. VOICES:Ex-nuns share stories of Church abuse VATICAN REACTION:Pope condemns sex abuse 'atrocities' Mr SauvÃ©, a senior civil servant, told France's Le Monde newspaper that the panel had handed over evidence to prosecutors in 22 cases where criminal action could still be launched. He added that bishops and other senior church officials had been told of other allegations against people who were still alive. Commission members included doctors, historians, sociologists and theologians. More than 6,500 victims and witnesses were contacted over two and a half years. The final report is 2,500 pages long.

"(File Picture) Thousands of paedophiles have operated within the French Catholic Church since 1950, the head of a panel investigating abuses by church members says. Jean-Marc SauvÃ© told French media that the commission had found evidence of 2,900 to 3,200 abusers - out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics. ""That is a minimal estimate,"" he added. The commission is to release a lengthy report on Tuesday. It is based on church, court and police archives, as well as interviews with victims. The inquiry was commissioned by the French Catholic Church in 2018, following a number of scandals in other countries. VOICES:Ex-nuns share stories of Church abuse VATICAN REACTION:Pope condemns sex abuse 'atrocities' Mr SauvÃ©, a senior civil servant, told France's Le Monde newspaper that the panel had handed over evidence to prosecutors in 22 cases where criminal action could still be launched. He added that bishops and other senior church officials had been told of other allegations against people who were still alive. Commission members included doctors, historians, sociologists and theologians. More than 6,500 victims and witnesses were contacted over two and a half years. The final report is 2,500 pages long. This video can not be played Brigitte, a survivor of child sex abuse by a chaplain, explains why she is ready to speak now (From 2019) Christopher Lamb, of the Roman Catholic publication The Tablet, told the BBC that abuse scandals had plunged the Church into ""its greatest crisis in... 500 years"".

"The King of Jordan secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a property empire in the UK and US. Leaked financial documents identify a network of secretly-owned firms used by Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein to buy 15 homes since he assumed power in 1999. They included houses in Malibu, and in London and Ascot in the UK. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so. Jordan receives substantial international aid, including from the US and UK. The UK government is one of the regime's biggest financial backers, doubling its funding to Â£650m over five years in 2019. And King Abdullah is seen as a moderate Western ally in the Middle East. But his property interests have been built up between 2003 and 2017 as he has been accused of presiding over an authoritarian regime at home - with protests taking place in recent years at a time of austerity measures and tax rises. Secret wealth of leaders exposed in document leak Blairs saved Â£300,000 stamp duty in property deal A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak The Jordanian authorities announced a crackdown in June 2020 to target money being sent abroad by its citizens. One dissident has been quoted as saying King Abdullah appears to rule Jordan by ""remote control"" - and a former government employee suggested to Panorama he spends four to six months a year away from the country. King Abdullah has been married to Queen Rania since 1993 Born 30 January 1962, eldest son of King Hussein and his British born wife Princess Muna Al-Hussein Schooled in the UK and US, attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Served in the British Army and the Royal Jordanian Army Married Queen Rania in 1993 Backed Western military efforts following the September 11 attacks Promoted economic and social modernisation within Jordan but faced criticism over the economy, with austerity measures and tax rises sparking protests in 2018 The revelations about the King of Jordan are contained in newly-obtained financial documents dubbed the Pandora Papers. They detail the work of companies that offer secretive financial services - and the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian in the UK have worked with other media partners to access more than 12 million files from 14 companies in the British Virgin Islands, Belize, Panama, Hong Kong, Cyprus, Switzerland and other countries. King Abdullah also bought four apartments in Georgetown, an expensive part of Washington DC, between 2012 and 2014. It is possible the $16m purchases were connected to his son, Crown Prince Hussein, who was attending Georgetown University around the time. The seven-bedroom home sits among the multi-million dollar cliff-top properties overlooking the Pacific in the Point Dume peninsula of Malibu, California. Sir Anthony Hopkins, Julia Roberts, Simon Cowell, Gwyneth Paltrow and Barbra Streisand have all lived in the area. The property was bought for $33.5m in 2014 by Nabisco Holdings SA, a company in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) - a record price for the area at the time. Two different BVI companies bought the homes either side of the property in 2015 and 2017, taking the total spend to $68m - and all three are being developed into one huge property. The documents in the Pandora Papers reveal the three companies are among those represented by a Panama law firm, and all were secretly owned by the King of Jordan. An anonymous blogger who writes about celebrity house sales in California said at the time: ""Someone has gone to a hell of a lot of trouble to cover their tracks here. Yes, very rich people often like to stay anonymous. But this level of deliberate opacity is practically beyond anything we've ever witnessed."" The King of Jordan was able to to keep his property ownership secret because he used offshore companies to make the purchases. The people who set up the companies for the king were careful not to identify him, referring to him in one internal document as ""You know who"". Your guide to nine years of finance leaks Send us your questions about the Pandora Papers There are also suggestions that international efforts to improve financial transparency can face difficulties. The British Virgin Islands passed a law in 2017 - compelling the owners of all companies on the island to be identified on an internal register held by the government. But a document shows that eight months after the Beneficial Ownership Secure Search System Act came into force, a number of BVI companies linked to King Abdullah had still not submitted his details to the authorities. The king also does not appear to have been identified as a politically-exposed person - someone in a prominent public position - a requirement on financial firms under anti-corruption rules. Annelle Sheline, a Middle East analyst, suggests the revelations could have an impact in Jordan. She told Panorama: ""It's just very, very difficult for the average Jordanian to, achieve a basic level of home and family, and a good job. And so to have it really thrown in Jordanians' faces that he's just been funnelling money abroad all this time? That, that would look really bad."" Lawyers for King Abdullah said the information about his properties was not accurate or up to date. They said all his overseas properties were bought with his personal wealth, which he also uses to fund projects for Jordan's citizens. They added the offshore structures were not used to hide the king's wealth and it is common practice practice for high profile individuals and corporations to acquire and hold assets through such corporate structures for privacy and security reasons. They said the management is ""handled by professionals to ensure smooth running of day-to-day operations and compliance with all legal and financial obligations in the relevant jurisdiction in which they are incorporated"". It was not just Malibu, where the king secretly bought property. Eight were in London and south-east England, the Pandora Papers indicate. They included six houses on some of the capital's most exclusive streets - in Kensington and Belgravia. There were also two house in Ascot, Surrey. He also purchased the four flats in Georgetown, Washington DC. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

"Tony and Cherie Blair did not have to pay Â£312,000 in stamp duty when buying a Â£6.45m London townhouse, leaked documents show. The ex-Labour prime minister and his barrister wife bought the property as an office for her business in 2017 by buying the offshore firm that owned it. Mrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way but they had brought it under UK control. She said they would be liable to pay capital gains tax if they sell it. When the property was put up for sale, the ultimate owners were a family with political connections in Bahrain - but both parties say they did not initially know who they were dealing with. Mrs Blair said her husband's only involvement in the transaction was that the mortgage for the property used their joint income and capital. The revelation is contained in the Pandora Papers, a leak detailing the work of companies offering offshore financial services in the British Virgin Islands, Singapore, Panama, Belize, Switzerland and other countries.

King of Jordan amassed Â£70m secret UK-US property empire A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak Your guide to nine years of finance leaks Since leaving Downing Street in 2007, the Blairs have built up a significant property portfolio. Altogether they are reported to have spent more than Â£30m on 38 residential properties before they bought the office. Documents show how the way the property in Harcourt Street, Marylebone, was acquired in July 2017 saved the Blairs a bill for stamp duty. The four-floor building is now home to Mrs Blair's legal advisory firm, Omnia Strategy, and her foundation for women. The previous owner of Harcourt Street is listed in UK Land Registry records as Romanstone International Limited - a British Virgin Islands firm. Romanstone itself had been owned by another BVI company, whose shareholders were members of the Al Zayani family. Among them was a minister in Bahrain's government - Zayed Rashid Al Zayani, Bahrain's minister for industry, commerce and tourism. The leaked documents show the Blairs bought the building by setting up a UK company to acquire Romanstone. Mr and Mrs Blair each held a 50% stake in the British company. They closed the offshore company after the purchase. Buying the property in this way meant the Blairs did not have to pay stamp duty. Stamp duty is paid by the purchasers of a property or land over a certain price. The tax is not paid when a company owning a property is acquired because the shareholder of a company is switching hands, rather than the actual ownership of the property. Tony and Cherie Blair bought the four-floor building in 2017 No laws were broken in buying the Harcourt Street office but Mr Blair had previously been critical of tax loopholes, once saying ""the tax system is a haven of scams, perks, City deals and profits"". In his first speech as Labour leader in 1994, Mr Blair said: ""Millionaires with the right accountant pay nothing while pensioners pay VAT on fuel. ""Offshore trusts get tax relief while homeowners pay VAT on insurance premiums. We will create a tax system that is fair which is related to ability to pay."" Robert Palmer from campaign group Tax Justice UK told Panorama: ""It partly doesn't look great because most people cannot do the same thingâ¦ even if what the Blairs did was perfectly legal, perfectly legitimate in the business world, it feels instinctively really unfair because they got access to an advantage, a potential advantage that the rest of us don't have."" Mrs Blair stressed that Harcourt Ventures had been formed to bring Romanstone and its building under UK tax and regulatory rules. She said: ""It is not unusual for a commercial office building to be held in a corporate vehicle or for vendors of such property not to want to dispose of the property separately."" The Blairs said ""the acquisition of a company comes with different tax consequences"" and they ""will of course be liable for capital gains tax on resale"". Lawyers for the Al Zayani family say their companies have complied with all UK laws past and present.

"The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents that reveals hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering by some of the world's rich and powerful. More than 600 journalists in 117 countries have been trawling through the files from 14 sources for months, finding stories that are being published this week. The data was obtained by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalin Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK. The Pandora Papers leak includes 6.4 million documents, almost three million images, more than a million emails and almost half-a-million spreadsheets. Stories revealed so far include: the owners of more than 1,500 UK properties bought using offshore firms, including individuals accused of corruption the Qatari ruling family whoavoided Â£18.5m tax on a London super-mansion Sir Philip and Lady Green went on a property spreeafter off-loading the BHS retail chain which went on to collapse the prominent Tory donor who wasinvolved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals the King of Jordan's Â£70m spending spreeon properties in the UK and US through secretly-owned companies Azerbaijan's leading family'shidden involvement in property deals in the UK worth more than Â£400m the Czech prime minister'sfailure to declare an offshore investment companyused to purchase two French villas for Â£12m how the family of Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta'ssecretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades The files expose how some of the most powerful people in the world - including more than 330 politicians from 90 countries - use secret offshore companies to hide their wealth. Lakshmi Kumar from US think-tank Global Financial Integrity explained that these people ""are able to funnel and siphon money away and hide it,"" often through the use of anonymous companies. The Pandora Papers reveal complex networks of companies that are set up across borders, often resulting in hidden ownership of money and assets. For example, someone may have a property in the UK, but own it via a chain of companies based in other countries, or ""offshore"". These offshore countries orterritoriesare where: it's easy to set up companies there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies there is low or no corporation tax The destinations are often called tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions. There is no definitive list of tax havens, but the most well known destinations include British Overseas Territories such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, as well as countries such as Switzerland and Singapore. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is often seen as unethical. The UK government says tax avoidance ""involves operating within the letter, but not the spirit, of the law"". There are also a number of legitimate reasons people may want to hold money and assets in different countries, such as protection from criminal attacks or guarding against unstable governments. Although having secretive offshore assets is not illegal, using a complex network of secret companies to move around money and assets is the perfect way to hide the proceeds of criminality. There have been repeated calls for politicians to make it harder to avoid tax or hide assets, particularly following previous leaks such asthe Panama Papers. But Mr Ryle said the Pandora Papers show that ""the people that could end the secrecy offshoreâ¦ are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it"". All you need to do is set up a shell company in one of the countries or jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists in name only, with no staff or office. It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately behind the business. It is impossible to say for sure, but estimates have ranged from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion, according to the ICIJ. The International Monetary Fund has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year. Ms Kumar said it is detrimental to the rest of society: ""The ability to hide money has a direct impact on your life... it affects your child's access to education, access to health, access to a home."" The UK has been criticised for allowing property to be owned by anonymous companies overseas. The government published draft legislation in 2018 that would require the ultimate owners of UK properties to be declared. But it is still waiting to be presented to MPs. A 2019 parliamentary report said the UK system attracts people ""such as money launderers, who may wish to use property to conceal illicit funds"". It said criminal investigations are often ""hindered"" because police cannot see who ultimately owns properties. The government recently raised the risk of money laundering through property from ""medium"" to ""high"". It says it's cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows.

"Will Renwick flies the Welsh flag on the summit of Snowdon Will Renwick's epic challenge to run up every mountain peak over 2,000ft (600m) in Wales has been fuelled by instant mash, noodles and chocolate bars. They are easy to carry and eat when you cannot find shops or pubs when you get hungry while in the middle of nowhere. Will has been clocking up at least 24 miles a day since starting on the 500-mile run from Swansea on 10 September. He is set to finish on Monday at Conwy Castle and it ""can't come soon enough"" since injuring his ankle on Thursday. It was sustained ""pushing against the wind"" during bad weather in Snowdonia. ""I'll be hobbling to the finish,"" he said, during a quick phone chat while dodging yet another downpour in a cafÃ© in Conwy county on Saturday morning. ""It is annoying because I have been feeling fit,"" he said. ""The finish line can't come soon enough."" Red sky over Maesglase mountain in Snowdonia - and a curious sheep He used the early part of the challenge as part of his training. He said running over the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons helped to improve his stamina so some days he was able to do in excess of 30 miles. ""How can you train for this kind of thing? I've got fit during the challenge,"" said Will, 31, from Llancarfan in the Vale of Glamorgan. Amputee's 13-hour crawl to reach Snowdon's summit Queues on Snowdon 'worst I can remember' He was a long-distance walker initially, having taken 63 days to navigate the 870-mile Wales Coast Path. And now he also runs ultra-marathon distances, such as completing a 100-mile route around the Isle of Man. But he said the latest challenge to climb 189 peaks in Wales back-to-back, carrying everything needed, has taken its toll on his body. Allow Twitter content?

""I look famished, I feel worn out, cold and hungry but I'm still going to do it,"" he said. He has been fuelling on pocket-size chocolate bars throughout the day and meals of mash or noodles because they are light to carry and quick to prepare. He spent four days carrying his own supplies over the peaks in mid Wales before he could find somewhere to stock up so, by the end of the stint, he was rationing his food.

Will Renwick takes a dip at Abergynolwyn, near Tywyn, Gwynedd He said the mountain ranges in Snowdonia had been the most challenging - mainly because the peaks in the Snowdon Massif and Glyderau ranges follow in quick succession, leaving little recovery time between each one.

Will, president of Ramblers Cymru, has been doing the run to raise funds for mental health charity Mind Over Mountains as he believes nature and the outdoors can help to improve people's sense of well-being. Will said as well as missing his girlfriend, he was most looking forward to taking a ""long bath"" as he has had to use rivers or streams to bathe when away from campsites. However, there have also been opportunities to shower thanks to ""plenty of rain"" along the route which is due to end at Conwy Castle on Monday at 11:00 BST, 24 days after he started.

She said: ""It is not unusual for a commercial office building to be held in a corporate vehicle or for vendors of such property not to want to dispose of the property separately."" The Blairs said ""the acquisition of a company comes with different tax consequences"" and they ""will of course be liable for capital gains tax on resale"". Lawyers for the Al Zayani family say their companies have complied with all UK laws past and present.

"The secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires has been exposed in one of the biggest leaks of financial documents. Some 35 current and former leaders and more than 300 public officials are featured in the files from offshore companies, dubbed the Pandora Papers. They reveal the King of Jordan secretly amassed Â£70m of UK and US property. They also show how ex-UK PM Tony Blair and his wife saved Â£312,000 in stamp duty when they bought a London office. The couple bought an offshore firm that owned the building. The leak also links Russian President Vladimir Putin to secret assets in Monaco, and shows the Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis - facing an election later this week - failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase two villas for Â£12m in the south of France. It is the latest in a string of leaks over the past seven years, following the FinCen Files, the Paradise Papers, the Panama Papers and LuxLeaks. A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak King of Jordan amassed Â£70m secret property empire Blairs saved Â£312,000 stamp duty in property deal Secret assets of Kenyan presidentâs family exposed The examination of the files is the largest organised by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),,externalwith more than 650 reporters taking part. BBC Panorama in a joint investigation with the Guardian and the other media partners have had access to nearly 12 million documents and files from 14 financial services companies in countries including the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Belize, Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Switzerland. Some figures are facing allegations of corruption, money laundering and global tax avoidance. But one of the biggest revelations is how prominent and wealthy people have been legally setting up companies to secretly buy property in the UK. The documents reveal the owners of some of the 95,000 offshore firms behind the purchases. It highlights the UK government's failure to introduce a register of offshore property owners despite repeated promises to do so, amid concerns some property buyers could be hiding money-laundering activities. The Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and his family, who have been accused of looting their own country, are one example. The investigation found the Aliyevs and their close associates have secretly been involved in property deals in the UK worth more than Â£400m. The revelations could prove embarrassing for the UK government, as the Aliyevs appear to have made a Â£31m profit after selling one of their London properties to the Crown Estate - the Queen's property empire that is managed by The Treasury and raises cash for the nation. Many of the transactions in the documents involve no legal wrongdoing. But Fergus Shiel, from the ICIJ, said: ""There's never been anything on this scale and it shows the reality of what offshore companies can offer to help people hide dodgy cash or avoid tax."" He added: ""They are using those offshore accounts, those offshore trusts, to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of property in other countries, and to enrich their own families, at the expense of their citizens."" The ICIJ believes the investigation is ""opening a box on a lot of things"" - hence the name Pandora Papers. The leaked financial documents show how theKing of Jordan secretly amassed a property empirein the UK and US worth more than Â£70m (over $100m). They identify a network of offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands and other tax havens used by Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein to buy 15 homes since he assumed power in 1999. They include Â£50m on three adjacent ocean view properties in Malibu, California, and properties in London and Ascot in the UK. His property interests have been built up as King Abdullah has been accused of presiding over an authoritarian regime, with protests taking place in recent years amid austerity measures and tax rises. Lawyers for King Abdullah said all the properties were bought with personal wealth, which he also uses to fund projects for Jordan's citizens. They said it was common practice for high profile individuals to purchase properties via offshore companies for privacy and security reasons. Among the other revelations in the Pandora Papers: Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta and six members of his familysecretly owned a network of offshore companies. They have been linked to 11 firms - one of which was valued as holding assets of $30m Members of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's inner circle, including cabinet ministers and their families, secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars The law firm founded by President Nicos Anastasiades of Cyprus appears to have provided fake owners to disguise the real owner of a series of offshore companies - a former Russian politician who had been accused of embezzlement. However, the law firm denies this Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky transferred his stake in a secret offshore company just before he won the 2019 election Ecuador President Guillermo Lasso, a former banker, replaced a Panamanian foundation that made monthly payments to his close family members with a trust based in South Dakota in the US There is no suggestion in the Pandora Papers that Tony and Cherie Blair were hiding their wealth. But documents show why stamp duty was not payable when the couple bought a Â£6.45m property. The former Labour prime minister and his barrister wife Cherieacquired the building in Marylebone, central London, in July 2017 by buying the offshore company that owned it. It is legal to acquire properties in the UK in this way and stamp duty does not have to be paid - but Mr Blair has previously been critical of tax loopholes. The townhouse in Marylebone, central London, is now home to Mrs Blair's legal consultancy, which advises governments around the world, as well as her foundation for women. Mrs Blair said the sellers had insisted they buy the house through the offshore company. She said they had brought the property back under UK rules and will be liable to pay capital gains tax if they sell it in future. The ultimate owners of the property were a family with political connections in Bahrain - but both parties say they did not initially know who they were dealing with. This Mayfair building was sold to a front company in 2009 Other documents show how Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family have secretly acquired UK property using offshore companies. The files show how the family - long accused of corruption in the European nation - bought 17 properties, including a Â£33m office block in London for the president's 11-year-old son Heydar Aliyev. The building in Mayfair was bought by a front company owned by a family friend of President Ilham Aliyev in 2009. It was transferred one month later to Heydar. The research also reveals how another office block owned by the family nearby was sold to the Crown Estate for Â£66m in 2018. The Crown Estate said it carried out the checks required in law at the time of purchase but is now looking into the matter. The UK government says it is cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires.

Weâll have more revelations tomorrow and from 07:00 BST weâll bring you the latest throughout the day here on the live page. And if you just canât get enough: Thanks for joining us, see you tomorrow. As we've mentioned, the BBC is one of more than 140 different media organisations involved in investigating the papers. Here's a snapshot of some of our partners' websites. In India...  The UK's Guardian newspaper... Radio France Internationale... And the Washington Post... Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta is one of the world leaders mentioned in the files Some 35 current and former world leaders were mentioned in the papers, which have been pored over by hundreds of journalists. Hereâs what some of our partner organisations have found: Still getting to grips with what the Pandora Papers are all about? Read our simple guidehere. Charities and campaigners have been responding to the Pandora Papers. Anti-poverty group Oxfam called the release ""another shocking exposÃ© of the oceans of money sloshing around the darkness of the worldâs tax havens that must prompt immediate action, as has long been promised"". The group's international tax policy lead Susana Ruiz called offshore finance ""a secret parallel system of capital"" that was ""open only to those with fat amounts of money and the greed to hoard it all untaxed"". She added: This is where our missing hospitals are. This is where the pay-packets sit of all the extra teachers and firefighters and public servants we need. Whenever a politician or business leader claims there is âno moneyâ to pay for climate damage and innovation, for more and better jobs, for a fair post-Covid recovery, for more overseas aid, they know where to look.  Big financial leaks like these are undoubtedly complicated. At their heart, they involve financial schemes most of us have never heard of, and people who might seem far removed from our day-to-day life. So why should you care? Fergus Shiel, from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)which organised the world-wide investigation of the files,external, says some people are using offshore accounts âto enrich their own families, at the expense of their citizensâ. And Lakshmi Kumar, from the think tank Global Financial Integrity, says the ability of people to hide money has a direct impact on all of our lives through, for example, lost tax revenues. âIt affects your child's access to education, access to health, access to a home,â she says. And Gerard Ryle - also from the ICIJ - explains that it shows âthe people that could end the secrecy offshore - could end what's going on - are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.â Some reaction now to the release of the Pandora Papers. One of the revelations is that Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family have secretly acquired a large amount of UK property using offshore companies. Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International called the papers a ""wake up call"" for the UK government. âOnce again Britainâs role as an enabler of global corruption and money laundering has been exposed with the same loopholes exploited to funnel suspect wealth into the country,"" said Duncan Hames, Director of Policy at Transparency International UK. ""Not only does this damage the UKâs reputation as a country governed by the rule of law, but it enriches corrupt elites around the world at the expense of their populations. No one benefits from this system but them."" The BBC approached the Aliyev family for comment but received no
response. The UK government says it is cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows. This Mayfair building was sold to a front company in 2009 The Pandora Papers also show how Azerbeijanâs ruling Aliyev family secretly acquired 17 properties â including a Â£33m London office block officially for the presidentâs 11-year-old son Heyder Aliyev. The family has been long accused of corruption in the central Asian nation. The building in Mayfair was bought in 2009 by a front company owned by a family friend of President Ilham Aliyev. It was transferred one month later to the presidentâs son, Hedyer. Another office block owned by the family was sold in 2018 for Â£66m to the Crown Estate â the Queenâs property empire that is managed by the Treasury and raises cash for the UK. When we asked the Crown Estate about the purchase, it said it carried out checks at the time but is now looking into the matter. Read the full storyhere. Itâs been 14 years since former Labour prime minister Tony Blair left No 10 with his wife Cherie by his side.Since then, Mr Blairis reported to havemade millions advising foreign governments and multinational companies. Although the full range of his business activities has never been disclosed, in 2016 Mr Blair was reported to have been paid Â£2m a year alone by bank JP Morgan after leaving office. He has since focused on his not-for-profit organisation which,according to its website,external, aims to âhelp political leaders build open, inclusive and prosperous societiesâ. Cherie is a human rights barrister and runs a legal advisory firm, Omnia Strategy, as well as a foundation for women. The couple acquired an office for her two organisations through an offshore company â a method she said was insisted on by those who sold it to them. As weâve just been saying, Tony Blair and his wife Cherie saved Â£312,000 in stamp duty tax in 2017 when buying a property in London. The four-floor building is now home to Mrs Blairâs legal advisory firm, Omnia Strategy, and her foundation for women. Letâs look at how they did it: Mrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way â but she said theyâd now brought it under UK control, meaning capital gains tax would be due if they sold it. The papers reveal how former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair saved Â£312,000 in stamp duty tax in 2017 when buying a London townhouse for Â£6.45m. Instead of buying the property directly - and paying the tax that comes with that - he and his wife Cherie bought an offshore company that owned the building. No laws were broken and thereâs no suggestion the Blairs hid their wealth, but Mr Blair has previously criticised people who âcan employ the right accountantsâ, saying âthe tax system is a haven of scams, perks, City deals and profitsâ. Mrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way but they had brought it under UK control â and that it would be liable for capital gains tax if it was resold. Read the full story on the Blairshere. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has pledged to investigate ""all our citizens mentioned in the Pandora Papers"" and take action if wrongdoing is found. It comes after the papers revealed how members of Mr Khan's inner circle, including cabinet ministers and their families, secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars. Welcoming the global investigation into the papers,Mr Khan said on Twitter,external: ""My over-two decades struggle has been premised on the belief that countries are not poor but corruption causes poverty because money is diverted from being invested in our people."" He added: ""I call on the international community to treat this grave injustice as similar to the climate change crisis."" Whatâs the story?The secret wealth of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and billionaires has been exposed in one of the biggest ever leaks of financial documents. What have they done?Many of the files involve no legal wrongdoing, but some figures face allegations of corruption, money laundering and global tax avoidance. Where can I read more?Our main storyhereruns through all the big findings - so far - and our simple guide to the story ishere. Why does this sound familiar?It is the latest in a string of leaks over the past seven years, following the FinCen Files, the Paradise Papers, the Panama Papers and LuxLeaks. As weâve been discussing,the King of Jordan has secretly acquired luxury homesin Malibu, California and Washington DC, as well as London and the English town of Ascot. In Malibu, California, he spent Â£50m ($68m) on three clifftop mansions According to California planning records, one will soon be rebuilt twice the size, and another will get a new swimming pool The kingâs properties also include apartments in Washington DC, where his son attended university A seven-bedroom apartment in this block was bought for Â£4.7m ($6.5m) in 2012 And in the UK, King Abdullah owns eight properties in London and south-east England, through offshore companies This includes these multi-million pound homes near Buckingham Palace. He bought the property on the left and three flats in the property on the right. When the BBC approached King Abdullah for comment, his lawyers said the information about his properties was not accurate or up to date. They said heâd bought them with his personal wealth. In short, pretty massive: almost 12 million leaked files make up the Pandora Papers. They come from 14 financial services companies in countries including the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Belize, Cyprus,  the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Switzerland. Combing through them has been the work of the biggest journalism partnership in history. Itâs taken 600 journalists - from more than half the worldâs countries - several months to pick out the stories youâll see over the next few days. King Abdullah has been married to Queen Rania since 1993 One of the people weâve been hearing about is the King of Jordan,who secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a string of properties in the UK and US. Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein has been King of Jordan for 22 years and is seen as a moderate Western ally in the Middle East. The 59-year-old rules a country of 10 million people and has the power to appoint governments and approve legislation. Jordan isnât a wealthy country and receives international aid. The British government is one of its biggest financial backers and is giving Â£650m over five years. King Abdullahâs sprawling property portfolio built up between 2003 and 2017. At the same time, he has been accused of presiding over an authoritarian regime at home - with protests taking place in recent years amid austerity measures and tax rises. Annelle Sheline, a Middle East analyst, says: âIt's just very, very difficult for the average Jordanian to achieve a basic level of home and family, and a good job. âSo to have it really thrown in Jordaniansâ faces that he's just been funneling money abroad all this time?  That would look really bad.â As we said earlier, lawyers for the king say heâs done nothing improper. They said heâd bought the houses with his personal wealth, which is also used to fund projects for Jordanians. The Pandora Papers investigation is the largest ever organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists â theyâre the group that looked into a string of other leaks you mightâve heard of including theFinCen Files(2020),Paradise Papers(2017) andPanama Papers(2016). âThereâs never been anything on this scale,â says Fergus Shiel, the ICIJâs managing editor. âIt shows the reality of what offshore companies can offer to help people hide dodgy cash or avoid tax."" And his colleague Gerard Ryle says: âWe are talking about some of the most famous people in the world that are in these documents. Presidents, prime ministers, government ministersâ¦ âWeâre not looking at a couple of million dollars here. Weâre looking at trillions of dollars.â One of the most powerful people named in the Pandora Papers is the King of Jordan. The leak reveals a network of secretly-owned companies used by Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein to spend more than Â£70m ($100m) on 15 homes since he became king in 1999.  The properties include three ocean-view homes in Malibu, California purchased for Â£50m ($68m) and properties in some of Londonâs most exclusive streets. The people who set up the companies for the king were careful not to identify him â in one internal document heâs called âYou know whoâ. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he had used his personal wealth to buy the properties and that there was nothing improper about him using offshore companies to do so. They also said that he uses his wealth to fund projects for Jordanâs citizens. Read our full storyhere. The papers are named after the Greek myth of Pandoraâs box. In the tale, Pandora opens a sealed box containing the forces of evil and suffering which, once released, were uncontainable. Gerard Ryle, the director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which organised the world-wide investigation of the files, says this leak was given the name because âwe're opening a box on a lot of thingsâ.

"Tony and Cherie Blair did not have to pay Â£312,000 in stamp duty when buying a Â£6.45m London townhouse, leaked documents show. The ex-Labour prime minister and his barrister wife bought the property as an office for her business in 2017 by buying the offshore firm that owned it. Mrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way but they had brought it under UK control. She said they would be liable to pay capital gains tax if they sell it. When the property was put up for sale, the ultimate owners were a family with political connections in Bahrain - but both parties say they did not initially know who they were dealing with. Mrs Blair said her husband's only involvement in the transaction was that the mortgage for the property used their joint income and capital. The revelation is contained in the Pandora Papers, a leak detailing the work of companies offering offshore financial services in the British Virgin Islands, Singapore, Panama, Belize, Switzerland and other countries. BBC Panorama in a joint investigation with the Guardian and other media partners have had access to nearly 12 million documents and files. King of Jordan amassed Â£70m secret UK-US property empire A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak Your guide to nine years of finance leaks Since leaving Downing Street in 2007, the Blairs have built up a significant property portfolio. Altogether they are reported to have spent more than Â£30m on 38 residential properties before they bought the office. Documents show how the way the property in Harcourt Street, Marylebone, was acquired in July 2017 saved the Blairs a bill for stamp duty. The four-floor building is now home to Mrs Blair's legal advisory firm, Omnia Strategy, and her foundation for women. The previous owner of Harcourt Street is listed in UK Land Registry records as Romanstone International Limited - a British Virgin Islands firm. Romanstone itself had been owned by another BVI company, whose shareholders were members of the Al Zayani family. Among them was a minister in Bahrain's government - Zayed Rashid Al Zayani, Bahrain's minister for industry, commerce and tourism. The leaked documents show the Blairs bought the building by setting up a UK company to acquire Romanstone. Mr and Mrs Blair each held a 50% stake in the British company. They closed the offshore company after the purchase. Buying the property in this way meant the Blairs did not have to pay stamp duty. Stamp duty is paid by the purchasers of a property or land over a certain price. The tax is not paid when a company owning a property is acquired because the shareholder of a company is switching hands, rather than the actual ownership of the property. Tony and Cherie Blair bought the four-floor building in 2017 No laws were broken in buying the Harcourt Street office but Mr Blair had previously been critical of tax loopholes, once saying ""the tax system is a haven of scams, perks, City deals and profits"". In his first speech as Labour leader in 1994, Mr Blair said: ""Millionaires with the right accountant pay nothing while pensioners pay VAT on fuel. ""Offshore trusts get tax relief while homeowners pay VAT on insurance premiums. We will create a tax system that is fair which is related to ability to pay."" Robert Palmer from campaign group Tax Justice UK told Panorama: ""It partly doesn't look great because most people cannot do the same thingâ¦ even if what the Blairs did was perfectly legal, perfectly legitimate in the business world, it feels instinctively really unfair because they got access to an advantage, a potential advantage that the rest of us don't have."" Mrs Blair stressed that Harcourt Ventures had been formed to bring Romanstone and its building under UK tax and regulatory rules. She said: ""It is not unusual for a commercial office building to be held in a corporate vehicle or for vendors of such property not to want to dispose of the property separately."" The Blairs said ""the acquisition of a company comes with different tax consequences"" and they ""will of course be liable for capital gains tax on resale"". Lawyers for the Al Zayani family say their companies have complied with all UK laws past and present. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

"The King of Jordan secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a property empire in the UK and US. Leaked financial documents identify a network of secretly-owned firms used by Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein to buy 15 homes since he assumed power in 1999. They included houses in Malibu, and in London and Ascot in the UK. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so. Jordan receives substantial international aid, including from the US and UK. The UK government is one of the regime's biggest financial backers, doubling its funding to Â£650m over five years in 2019. And King Abdullah is seen as a moderate Western ally in the Middle East. But his property interests have been built up between 2003 and 2017 as he has been accused of presiding over an authoritarian regime at home - with protests taking place in recent years at a time of austerity measures and tax rises. Secret wealth of leaders exposed in document leak Blairs saved Â£300,000 stamp duty in property deal A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak The Jordanian authorities announced a crackdown in June 2020 to target money being sent abroad by its citizens. One dissident has been quoted as saying King Abdullah appears to rule Jordan by ""remote control"" - and a former government employee suggested to Panorama he spends four to six months a year away from the country. King Abdullah has been married to Queen Rania since 1993 Born 30 January 1962, eldest son of King Hussein and his British born wife Princess Muna Al-Hussein Schooled in the UK and US, attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Served in the British Army and the Royal Jordanian Army Married Queen Rania in 1993 Backed Western military efforts following the September 11 attacks Promoted economic and social modernisation within Jordan but faced criticism over the economy, with austerity measures and tax rises sparking protests in 2018 The revelations about the King of Jordan are contained in newly-obtained financial documents dubbed the Pandora Papers. They detail the work of companies that offer secretive financial services - and the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian in the UK have worked with other media partners to access more than 12 million files from 14 companies in the British Virgin Islands, Belize, Panama, Hong Kong, Cyprus, Switzerland and other countries. King Abdullah also bought four apartments in Georgetown, an expensive part of Washington DC, between 2012 and 2014. It is possible the $16m purchases were connected to his son, Crown Prince Hussein, who was attending Georgetown University around the time. The seven-bedroom home sits among the multi-million dollar cliff-top properties overlooking the Pacific in the Point Dume peninsula of Malibu, California. Sir Anthony Hopkins, Julia Roberts, Simon Cowell, Gwyneth Paltrow and Barbra Streisand have all lived in the area. The property was bought for $33.5m in 2014 by Nabisco Holdings SA, a company in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) - a record price for the area at the time. Two different BVI companies bought the homes either side of the property in 2015 and 2017, taking the total spend to $68m - and all three are being developed into one huge property. The documents in the Pandora Papers reveal the three companies are among those represented by a Panama law firm, and all were secretly owned by the King of Jordan. An anonymous blogger who writes about celebrity house sales in California said at the time: ""Someone has gone to a hell of a lot of trouble to cover their tracks here. Yes, very rich people often like to stay anonymous. But this level of deliberate opacity is practically beyond anything we've ever witnessed."" The King of Jordan was able to to keep his property ownership secret because he used offshore companies to make the purchases. The people who set up the companies for the king were careful not to identify him, referring to him in one internal document as ""You know who"". Your guide to nine years of finance leaks Send us your questions about the Pandora Papers There are also suggestions that international efforts to improve financial transparency can face difficulties. The British Virgin Islands passed a law in 2017 - compelling the owners of all companies on the island to be identified on an internal register held by the government. But a document shows that eight months after the Beneficial Ownership Secure Search System Act came into force, a number of BVI companies linked to King Abdullah had still not submitted his details to the authorities. The king also does not appear to have been identified as a politically-exposed person - someone in a prominent public position - a requirement on financial firms under anti-corruption rules. Annelle Sheline, a Middle East analyst, suggests the revelations could have an impact in Jordan. She told Panorama: ""It's just very, very difficult for the average Jordanian to, achieve a basic level of home and family, and a good job. And so to have it really thrown in Jordanians' faces that he's just been funnelling money abroad all this time? That, that would look really bad."" Lawyers for King Abdullah said the information about his properties was not accurate or up to date. They said all his overseas properties were bought with his personal wealth, which he also uses to fund projects for Jordan's citizens. They added the offshore structures were not used to hide the king's wealth and it is common practice practice for high profile individuals and corporations to acquire and hold assets through such corporate structures for privacy and security reasons. They said the management is ""handled by professionals to ensure smooth running of day-to-day operations and compliance with all legal and financial obligations in the relevant jurisdiction in which they are incorporated"". It was not just Malibu, where the king secretly bought property. Eight were in London and south-east England, the Pandora Papers indicate. They included six houses on some of the capital's most exclusive streets - in Kensington and Belgravia. There were also two house in Ascot, Surrey. He also purchased the four flats in Georgetown, Washington DC. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

"The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents that reveals hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering by some of the world's rich and powerful. More than 600 journalists in 117 countries have been trawling through the files from 14 sources for months, finding stories that are being published this week. The data was obtained by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalin Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK. The Pandora Papers leak includes 6.4 million documents, almost three million images, more than a million emails and almost half-a-million spreadsheets. Stories revealed so far include: the owners of more than 1,500 UK properties bought using offshore firms, including individuals accused of corruption the Qatari ruling family whoavoided Â£18.5m tax on a London super-mansion Sir Philip and Lady Green went on a property spreeafter off-loading the BHS retail chain which went on to collapse the prominent Tory donor who wasinvolved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals the King of Jordan's Â£70m spending spreeon properties in the UK and US through secretly-owned companies Azerbaijan's leading family'shidden involvement in property deals in the UK worth more than Â£400m the Czech prime minister'sfailure to declare an offshore investment companyused to purchase two French villas for Â£12m how the family of Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta'ssecretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades The files expose how some of the most powerful people in the world - including more than 330 politicians from 90 countries - use secret offshore companies to hide their wealth. Lakshmi Kumar from US think-tank Global Financial Integrity explained that these people ""are able to funnel and siphon money away and hide it,"" often through the use of anonymous companies. The Pandora Papers reveal complex networks of companies that are set up across borders, often resulting in hidden ownership of money and assets. For example, someone may have a property in the UK, but own it via a chain of companies based in other countries, or ""offshore"". These offshore countries orterritoriesare where: it's easy to set up companies there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies there is low or no corporation tax The destinations are often called tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions. There is no definitive list of tax havens, but the most well known destinations include British Overseas Territories such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, as well as countries such as Switzerland and Singapore. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is often seen as unethical. The UK government says tax avoidance ""involves operating within the letter, but not the spirit, of the law"". There are also a number of legitimate reasons people may want to hold money and assets in different countries, such as protection from criminal attacks or guarding against unstable governments. Although having secretive offshore assets is not illegal, using a complex network of secret companies to move around money and assets is the perfect way to hide the proceeds of criminality. There have been repeated calls for politicians to make it harder to avoid tax or hide assets, particularly following previous leaks such asthe Panama Papers. But Mr Ryle said the Pandora Papers show that ""the people that could end the secrecy offshoreâ¦ are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it"". All you need to do is set up a shell company in one of the countries or jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists in name only, with no staff or office. It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately behind the business. It is impossible to say for sure, but estimates have ranged from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion, according to the ICIJ. The International Monetary Fund has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year. Ms Kumar said it is detrimental to the rest of society: ""The ability to hide money has a direct impact on your life... it affects your child's access to education, access to health, access to a home."" The UK has been criticised for allowing property to be owned by anonymous companies overseas. The government published draft legislation in 2018 that would require the ultimate owners of UK properties to be declared. But it is still waiting to be presented to MPs. A 2019 parliamentary report said the UK system attracts people ""such as money launderers, who may wish to use property to conceal illicit funds"". It said criminal investigations are often ""hindered"" because police cannot see who ultimately owns properties. The government recently raised the risk of money laundering through property from ""medium"" to ""high"". It says it's cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows.

"The financial secrets of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and celebrities has been exposed in another huge leak of financial documents. Dubbed the Pandora Papers it features almost 12 million files from companies providing offshore services in tax havens around the world. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has organised the biggest ever global investigation, spanning 117 countries and involving more than 600 journalists. In the UK the investigation has been led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian. The files are the latest in a series of whistleblower-led investigations that have rocked the world of finance in recent years. So let's round up the other major leaks of the past decade. In September 2020 theFinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banksto stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files included more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by financial institutions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, or FinCEN, a part of the US Treasury Department. They also include 17,641 records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and other sources. They were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ and 400 journalists around the world, including BBC Panorama, which led the investigation in the UK. A huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. Who was named?The documents contained details about investments made bythe Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance schemeused by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boysand showed thatFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. They also revealed how Apple protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jerseyand thatPrince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. Who leaked the data?The BBC does not know the identity of the source. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the ICIJ.Panoramaled research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries. A confidential settlement was later reachedbetween the BBC, the Guardian and Appleby over the reporting of the leaked documents, which Appleby said were taken by hackers. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement. Until Pandora this leak was seen as the daddy of them all in data size. If you thought the Wikileaks dump of sensitive diplomatic cables in 2010 was a big deal, this carried 1,500 times more data. SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung's ""brothers"". Despite surnames that sound exactly the same, these two leading lights of the Panama Papers investigation, Frederik Obermaier (L) and Bastian Obermayer, are not related The Panama Papers came about after an anonymous source contacted reporters at German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externalin 2015 and supplied encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business dealings. Overwhelmed by the scale of the dump, which eventually grew to 2.6 terabytes of data, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung called in theICIJ,external, which led to the involvement of about 100 other partner news organisations, including the BBC's Panorama. After more than a year of scrutiny, the ICIJ and its partners jointly published the Panama Papers on 3 April 2016,with the database of documents going online a month later. Who was named?Where do we start? A few of the news partners focused on how associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin shuffled cash around the globe. Not that the Russians cared much.The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan came to far stickier ends, the former quitting and the latter being thrown out of office by the Supreme Court. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. Who leaked the data?John Doe. Yes, we know. It's not a real name. In US crime series it is mostly used to label anonymous victims butMr (or Ms) Doe's manifesto, released a month after publication, reveals a self-styled revolutionary,external. The real identity is still unknown. Five months after the Panama Papers, the ICIJ published revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry. The 38GB cache revealed the offshore activities of ""prime ministers, ministers, princes and convicted felons"", it said.Former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted an ""oversight"" in failing to disclose her interest in an offshore company. This ICIJ investigation,involving hundreds of journalists from 45 countries,external,including BBC Panorama, went public in February 2015. It focused on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), a subsidiary of the banking giant, and so lifted the lid on dealings in a country where banking secrecy is taken for granted. The leaked files covered accounts up to the year 2007, linked with more than 100,000 individuals and legal entities from more than 200 countries. The ICIJ said the subsidiary had served ""those close to discredited regimes"" and ""clients who had been unfavourably named by the United Nations"". HSBC admitted that the ""compliance culture and standards of due diligence"" at the subsidiary at the time were ""lower than they are today"". Who was named?The ICIJ said HSBC had profited from ""arms dealers, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws"". It also cited those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Ben Ali and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Leaker in chief HervÃ© Falciani - indicted, held, released Who leaked the data?Actually, we know this one.The ICIJ investigation was based on data originally leaked by the French-Italian software engineer and whistleblower HervÃ© Falciani, though the ICIJ got it later from another source. From 2008 onwards he passed information on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) to French authorities, who in turn passed them to other relevant governments. Mr Falciani was indicted in Switzerland. He was held in detention in Spain but was later released and now lives in France. Or LuxLeaks for short.Another extensive ICIJ investigation,external, which revealed its findings in November 2014. It centred on how professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers helped multinational companies gain hundreds of favourable tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The ICIJ said multinationals had saved billions by channelling money through Luxembourg, sometimes at tax rates of less than 1%. One address in Luxembourg was home to more than 1,600 companies, it said. The leak of documents was first exposed in 2012after a joint investigation between Panorama and France2which lifted the lid on the tax agreements of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and media company Northern & Shell. Who was named?Pepsi, IKEA, AIG and Deutsche Bank were among those named. A second tranche of leaked documents said the Walt Disney Co and Skype had funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg subsidiaries. They and the other firms denied any wrongdoing. Jean-Claude Juncker had been PM of Luxembourg when it enacted many of its tax avoidance rules. He had been appointed president of the European Commission just a few days before the leak came out. He said he had not encouraged avoidance. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker says he is ""politically responsible for what happened"" Eurosceptics went to town and pushed a censure motion against him and his commission. It was rejected. But the EU did investigate, and by 2016 had proposed a yet-to-be realised common tax scheme for the EU. Who leaked the data?Frenchman Antoine Deltour, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee, was the main man, saying he had acted in the public interest. Another PwC employee, Raphael Halet, helped him. (L-R) Edouard Perrin, Raphael Halet and Antoine Deltour The pair, along with journalist Edouard Perrin, were all charged in Luxembourg after a PwC complaint.A first verdictwas later revisited, watering down sentences, withDeltour given a six-month suspended jail term which was later quashed. Halet received a small fine and Mr Perrin was acquitted. This was about a tenth of the size of the Panama Papers but was seen as the biggest exposÃ© of international tax fraud ever when the ICIJ and its news partners went public in November 2012 and April 2013. Some 2.5 million files revealed the names of more than 120,000 companies and trusts in hideaways such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands. BBC Panoramaexposed a flourishing tax evasion industry in the UKin an undercover investigation based on the files. Who was named?The usual suspects. A mix of politicians, government officials and their families, with the Russians notable, but also those in China, Azerbaijan, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia and Pakistan. The Philippines - in the form of the family of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos - get a dishonourable mention. To be fair, the ICIJ does point out that the leaks are not necessarily evidence of illegal actions. Who leaked the data?The ICIJ cites ""two financial service providers, a private bank in Jersey and the Bahamas corporate registry"" as the sources, but says nothing more other than it was ""data obtained"". The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires.

"Many petrol stations in the South East that have had fuel - such as this one in Ashford, Kent - have seen long queues Petrol supplies are still not getting to London and south-east England, with more than a fifth of forecourts still dry, retailers have said. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said it hoped the Army driving tankers would help increase fuel deliveries. But it said the ""crisis is virtually at an end"" in Scotland, Wales, the North and Midlands. Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier did not rule out supply chain problems continuing until Christmas. Fuel supply: Military to deliver petrol to UK garages from Monday Conservative conference: UK in period of adjustment after Brexit, says PM Brian Madderson, chairman of the PRA, said: ""The fuel is still not going to the pumps that need it most in London and the South East."" On Sunday morning up to 22% of filling stations in the UK's most populous region were dry and only 60% had both grades of fuel available. The PRA said only 6% of stations were dry in the Midlands, northern England and Scotland. Mr Madderson said the PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations, was ""disappointed that no concerted action is being taken to address the supply problems"" in the South. Filling stations need to get more information ahead of time about deliveries, he said. However, he said in the North there was a ""plentiful supply at filling stations"" and little queuing. Mr Madderson added he hoped the army being deployed ""will help to increase fuel deliveries"". From Monday military personnel will start to be available for hauliers to use, with more than 65 drivers available initially. There are plans for 200 members of the army to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers. A government spokesman said: ""Stocks in London and the South of England have been recovering at slightly slower rates than other parts of the UK, so we have begun deploying military personnel to boost supply in these areas."" ""More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England."" 23 September:BP temporarily closes some petrol stationsdue to a shortage of lorry drivers 25 September:After days of long queues at stations, with many running dry, the governmentannounces a temporary visa scheme, allowing 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK in the run-up to Christmas 27 September:The Army is put on standbyto help deliver fuel to stations hit by shortages 28 September:Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsays the situation at forecourts is ""stabilising"", while the PRA says there are ""early signs"" pressure is starting to ease at pumps 2 October:Despite a ""distinct improvement"" nationwide,the PRA says petrol supplies remain critical in London and south-east England Supermarket Sainsbury's said it was still seeing ""high demand"" for fuel at its petrol stations. ""We're working closely with our supplier to maintain supply and all our sites continue to receive fuel,"" a spokeswoman said. Many sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: The ""big lever marked uncontrolled immigration"" will not be pulled to solve the driver shortage On Sunday Boris Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that labour market problems would not be solved by pulling ""the big lever marked uncontrolled immigration"" to allow in large numbers of foreign workers. He insisted the lack of lorry drivers was not just a problem for the UK, and claimed the US, China, and some countries in Europe were having similar issues. However, there have been no reports of fuel problems or interruptions to food supply linked to driver shortages in those countries. The rush of people filling up their cars in the past week was triggered by reports that a shortage of tanker drivers was affecting deliveries. The prime minister said the UK economy was going through a ""period of adjustment"" and the way to get more HGV drivers was for the industry to ensure they were ""decently paid"". He added: ""We have got to make sure people come on stream as fast as we practically can. ""When people voted for change in 2016, when they voted for change again in 2019 as they did, they voted for the end of a broken model of the UK economy that relied on low wages and low skills and chronic low productivity. We are moving away from that."" More than a week on from the first forecourt queues and closures, what began as a problem mainly affecting Southern parts of the country has returned to being just that. Following limited supply issues caused by a tanker driver shortage, pleas not to panic buy were seemingly ignored. The resulting crisis has shown the impact a sudden hike in demand can have on the finely balanced supply chain. Measures aimed at helping the distribution system cope have included temporarilyrelaxing competition laws, so oil firms could better share information and target fuel deliveries. The situation appears to have improved markedly in many regions of the UK but less so in the densely-populated capital and the South East. Businesses, the government and of course millions of motorists will hope the deployment of military drivers from Monday helps to plug remaining gaps.

"(File Picture) Thousands of paedophiles have operated within the French Catholic Church since 1950, the head of a panel investigating abuses by church members says. Jean-Marc SauvÃ© told French media that the commission had found evidence of 2,900 to 3,200 abusers - out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics. ""That is a minimal estimate,"" he added. The commission is to release a lengthy report on Tuesday. It is based on church, court and police archives, as well as interviews with victims. The inquiry was commissioned by the French Catholic Church in 2018, following a number of scandals in other countries. VOICES:Ex-nuns share stories of Church abuse VATICAN REACTION:Pope condemns sex abuse 'atrocities' Mr SauvÃ©, a senior civil servant, told France's Le Monde newspaper that the panel had handed over evidence to prosecutors in 22 cases where criminal action could still be launched. He added that bishops and other senior church officials had been told of other allegations against people who were still alive. Commission members included doctors, historians, sociologists and theologians. More than 6,500 victims and witnesses were contacted over two and a half years. The final report is 2,500 pages long. This video can not be played Brigitte, a survivor of child sex abuse by a chaplain, explains why she is ready to speak now (From 2019) Christopher Lamb, of the Roman Catholic publication The Tablet, told the BBC that abuse scandals had plunged the Church into ""its greatest crisis in... 500 years"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr Show: ""People should trust the police"" The government ""will stop at nothing to make sure that we get more rapists behind bars"", Boris Johnson has said. The PM told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that prosecutions for rape and sexual violence were ""going wrong"". He added women should have confidence in the police, with the nation's officers ""overwhelmingly trustworthy"". The jailing of Wayne Couzens for Sarah Everard's murder has raised questions about women's safety, and trust in the police and criminal justice system. Couzens was a police officer in London at the time of Ms Everard's murder, and the Metropolitan Police is facing questions over its failure to stop him. What should you do if you are stopped by police? Police to be quizzed over Couzens' work at Commons Rape case blame game between police and CPS - report Asked by Andrew Marr whether he would launch an independent public inquiry into the case, Mr Johnson said he wanted the police watchdog to complete its review first. He said: ""We do need to look systemically at not just the Wayne Couzens case, but the whole handling of rape, domestic violence, sexual violence and female complaints about harassment, all together."" Speaking later, he added: ""There are delays taking place at every stage in the process. ""You know the reasons - it's all the complexities to do with people's mobile phones, the evidence that's produced by the defence, and all that kind of stuff. ""But, in the end, that is no excuse. We have to have these complaints properly dealt with."" Over the past five years, cases reported to police - and initially recorded as rape - have risen sharply. However, the proportion making it to court - known as prosecutions - in that time has more than halved,the BBC's Reality Check team found. Figures for 2019-20 show 1,439 suspects in cases when a rape had been alleged were convicted of rape or lesser offences in England and Wales, the lowest level since records began. This was down from 1,925 the previous year, despite a rise in reports of rape. Rape carries a penalty of between four and 19 years' custody, with a maximum of life imprisonment in limited circumstances, according to Sentencing Council guidelines. Boris Johnson responded to questions about whether funding cuts had had an impact on rape investigations, saying the government was ""investing massively in policing and crime and in all aspects of the justice system"". In 2020-21, the budget of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) was Â£9.5bn - an increase on the previous couple of years but still below where it was in 2010. Overall, between 2010 and 2020, the MoJ had a cut of about 25% to its budget, according to official spending figures. After the last budget in March 2021, the Institute for Government projected that spending on areas including police and crime would only increase by 1% each year once you adjust for rising prices after 2021-22. In the year to March 2021, just 1.5% of recorded rapes ended in a suspect being charged or issued with a summons - roughly half as many as five years ago. This has been attributed to funding cuts, as well as a number of other things - such as big court backlogs and victims being more likely to withdraw their complaints rather than go through the often intrusive court process. What's the truth about rape prosecutions? Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is also minister for women and equalities, said the criminal justice system and the culture within the police needed to change. ""It is wrong that women don't feel safe on our streets and I personally very much understand that,"" she told the BBC. ""We will only have a truly equal society when women feel as safe as men on the streets."" The Met has been criticised over its safety advice to women after it emerged Couzens used his position as an officer to falsely arrest and kidnap Ms Everard. The advice said women who were suspicious of lone plain-clothes police officers should shout out, flag down a bus, or knock on doors for help. Mr Johnson said women who were suspicious about they way they were being treated by a police officer should follow this advice. But he added: ""My view is that the police do - overwhelmingly - a wonderful job and what I want is the public, and women in particular, girls and young women, women of all ages, to trust the police. ""They are overwhelmingly trustworthy."" The murder of Sarah Everard sparked calls for more action to tackle violence against women The Met wasfacing further questionsover its handling of vetting procedures after it confirmed Couzens stood guard within Parliament on five occasions last year. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, requested an urgent meeting with the force's leadership ""to discuss how this person could have been deemed suitable for deployment here"". It followed the revelation there were two separate allegations of indecent exposure linked to Couzens - with one in the days leading up to Ms Everard's murder. Dame Lynne Owens, the outgoing director general of the National Crime Agency, said ""we, in policing, need to take a long hard look at ourselves"" after Couzens was jailed. Shewrote on Twitter,external: ""The many good people [in] policing, at all ranks & grades, need to be part of the solution though. ""They joined because they want to make a difference and they know the public needs confidence in them."" Why do so few rape cases go to court?

"Will Renwick flies the Welsh flag on the summit of Snowdon Will Renwick's epic challenge to run up every mountain peak over 2,000ft (600m) in Wales has been fuelled by instant mash, noodles and chocolate bars. They are easy to carry and eat when you cannot find shops or pubs when you get hungry while in the middle of nowhere. Will has been clocking up at least 24 miles a day since starting on the 500-mile run from Swansea on 10 September. He is set to finish on Monday at Conwy Castle and it ""can't come soon enough"" since injuring his ankle on Thursday. It was sustained ""pushing against the wind"" during bad weather in Snowdonia. ""I'll be hobbling to the finish,"" he said, during a quick phone chat while dodging yet another downpour in a cafÃ© in Conwy county on Saturday morning. ""It is annoying because I have been feeling fit,"" he said. ""The finish line can't come soon enough."" Red sky over Maesglase mountain in Snowdonia - and a curious sheep He used the early part of the challenge as part of his training. He said running over the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons helped to improve his stamina so some days he was able to do in excess of 30 miles. ""How can you train for this kind of thing?

He has been fuelling on pocket-size chocolate bars throughout the day and meals of mash or noodles because they are light to carry and quick to prepare. He spent four days carrying his own supplies over the peaks in mid Wales before he could find somewhere to stock up so, by the end of the stint, he was rationing his food.

"(File Picture) Thousands of paedophiles have operated within the French Catholic Church since 1950, the head of a panel investigating abuses by church members says. Jean-Marc SauvÃ© told French media that the commission had found evidence of 2,900 to 3,200 abusers - out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics. ""That is a minimal estimate,"" he added. The commission is to release a lengthy report on Tuesday. It is based on church, court and police archives, as well as interviews with victims. The inquiry was commissioned by the French Catholic Church in 2018, following a number of scandals in other countries. VOICES:Ex-nuns share stories of Church abuse VATICAN REACTION:Pope condemns sex abuse 'atrocities' Mr SauvÃ©, a senior civil servant, told France's Le Monde newspaper that the panel had handed over evidence to prosecutors in 22 cases where criminal action could still be launched. He added that bishops and other senior church officials had been told of other allegations against people who were still alive. Commission members included doctors, historians, sociologists and theologians. More than 6,500 victims and witnesses were contacted over two and a half years. The final report is 2,500 pages long. This video can not be played Brigitte, a survivor of child sex abuse by a chaplain, explains why she is ready to speak now (From 2019) Christopher Lamb, of the Roman Catholic publication The Tablet, told the BBC that abuse scandals had plunged the Church into ""its greatest crisis in... 500 years"".

"Welcome to the One Million Pound Club. To make the top ten donors to the Conservative Party since Boris Johnson became prime minister, you need to have stumped up a seven figure sum. At the top of the chart, by a considerable margin, the providers of one of the most memorable political images of the last few years. Boris Johnson at the wheel of a JCB, a polystyrene wall smashed, his 'Get Brexit Done' slogan in the mechanical shovel. JC Bamford Excavators Limited has given just over Â£2.5m in the last two years. Lord Bamford, the chairman of the family owned company, has personally given Â£100,000 since 2010, when the Conservatives returned to government. He became a Conservative peer in 2013. I've been trying to find out what motivates people to give money to the Conservative Party, how do they choose how much to give and how do they measure if it is worth it? Incidentally, I put all these questions to JCB, but Lord Bamford didn't want to talk to me. That, of course, is his prerogative - what he chooses to do with his own money is his own business. But collectively, these are important questions to explore - for they offer an insight into how our governing party is bankrolled, and by whom. It is also a window into the world of the super-rich, what motivates them to donate, and the context of some stark and big numbers you might occasionally read about. So who is willing to talk publicly? ""It is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask about."" Meet Alasdair Locke, a veteran of the shipping and oil and gas industries, and a multimillionaire. ""They will put you in everything you want,"" he says, when I ask what he gets in return. Mr Locke has agreed to talk to me on the record, where others said they would speak to me, but only if I protect their identity. Mr Locke says as a donor he may get heard, but wouldn't expect it to be acted upon He has donated Â£280,000 to the Conservative Party since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Electoral Commissionrules,externalmean any donation over Â£7,500 to a party has to be reported by that party, and the figure and the donor will be published. ""I can get access via the Leaders Group. It is usually senior ministers and 15 or 20 people. Sometimes in person. Sometimes on Zoom. The last thing I attended was a lunch with Michael Gove in July. It was all donors who were there."" To become a member of the Leaders Group, you have to have donated Â£50,000 in the last year. Two to three lunches a week are arranged, to which around a dozen donors are invited. Groups don't tend to be bigger than this, to ensure all those who turn up get a chance to feel part of something that isn't impersonal. Some donors are very regular attendees, others don't come to any. Does this amount to buying access, and influence? ""It is interesting, but I'm not sure we are that influential. Politicking doesn't really interest or excite me. I would reckon I do get heard, but I don't expect it to be acted upon,"" Mr Locke says. ""Politicians are always cautious, in any case. At the lunch with Michael Gove, I asked about trade relations with the US. There was no attempt by any of us to influence policy."" Mr Locke was drawn into political donations by a ""strong conviction"" for keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom. Alastair Locke said he became a Conservative donor to support the party's leader in Scotland Douglas Ross, and his predecessor Baroness Davidson. ""I started off with the Conservatives when they were facing oblivion in Scotland. I am an old fashioned One Nation Tory, there wouldn't be much between me and centrists in the Labour Party. ""I wanted to support the centre right unionist party. I wanted to move the Scottish Conservatives away from the patrician tweedy layered image, to involve people who people would vote for,"" he tells me. He is a big fan of the Scottish Conservative Leader Douglas Ross, and Baroness Davidson, a predecessor. It is not just the Leaders Group that donors can be a member of. There is the Treasurers Group, for those who have given Â£25,000, although I am told plenty of prospective members can be tempted to upgrade to the Leaders Group, as those with a spare 25 grand rattling around can often afford to double it. There is then the Advisory Board, for those who have given Â£250,000 or more in the last year. But how transparent is this? The short answer: not very. Yes, there is the legal obligation for donors' names and how much they have given to be published. But what they actually get for that money is much, much less clear, and less clear than it used to be. Back in 2012, there was a big row about the then Conservative co-treasurer, Peter Cruddas. He resigned as party co-treasurer after The Sunday Times suggested he was offering access to then Prime Minister David Cameron for a donation of Â£250,000 a year. But the following year he won Â£180,000 in damages in a libel victory against the newspaper. The newspaper's appeal succeeded in part and the damages were later reduced to Â£50,000. Peter Cruddas is sixth in the league table of Conservative donors since Boris Johnson became prime minister, having given Â£1.1m. In December last year, Mr Johnsonnominated him for a peerage, against the advice of The Lords Appointments Commission, describing the earlier allegations as ""historic and untrue"". After the row in 2012, David Cameron decided greater transparency was the answer, even if some internally felt donors were already being told they would be named by the Electoral Commission and a further step was unnecessary. But Mr Cameron pressed ahead, and the Tories began to publish a public register of donorswho attended private dinners with the then-PM.,external But then, in 2018, they stopped. And there has been nothing since. The former housing secretary Robert Jenrick got caught up in one of the most awkward of political binds possible with a donor last year. He found himself sitting next to businessman Richard Desmond at a Conservative fundraiser. Mr Desmond thengave the party more money after one of his housing developments was given the go ahead. Mr Jenrick said he regretted the contact and Downing Street supported him, at the time. He was sacked from the cabinet this month; one minister telling me his dismissal was far too late - he should have been shown the door a year earlier. A Conservative spokesperson didn't address the question of the register straight on, but they did say: ""Donations and donors to the party are declared to and published by the Electoral Commission as required by the law and this is freely and openly available on the Electoral Commission's website."" David Cameron pledged to publish a quarterly register of party donors who attended dinners at official residences. So what do donors get for their money? ""It does give me the chance to speak to some people,"" a very significant donor tells me privately. This includes chances to speak to the prime minister and chancellor, as theFinancial Times reported over the summer,external. But, when I ask if this represents value for money, I'm told: ""I'm not sure how you measure it, to tell you the truth. It doesn't amount to being involved in making policy."" This is where we get into a fascinating subtlety about very rich people and what they do with their money. This same donor offers an insight that all of my conversations tacked back to: he said his - by any conventional metric - vast donations to the Conservative Party, amounted to ""barely a flicker"" compared to the sums involved in the charitable work he does. This single example of giving is matched by the picture more broadly. The Conservative Party generates around Â£25m a year. Charities, collectively in the UK, are a multi billion pound sector, witharound 50 generating more than Â£100m a year,external. Some inside the party ponder how giving money to any political party could be perceived to be more noble, as a contribution to public life, rather than so often raising awkward and, usually, unanswered questions. Should party political donations be treated like donations to charity, which are subject to tax relief, called Gift Aid? Maybe, argue some, while acknowledging it would look self serving and so politically awkward. But let's get back to what motivates people to give money. Beyond access to ministers, and, for some, eventually, maybe a knighthood or a seat in the House of Lords (although their other work, in industry or for charity, might qualify them for this anyway), there is an X factor available here too. Auctioning off a weekend for two at a plush hotel in the Lake District doesn't tick any boxes for a donor who may just own that hotel anyway. But offer them a dinner at which the prime minister is speaking and there is, perhaps, a near equivalent in terms of social cachet to said donor having spent vast sums having a stratospherically famous rock star play privately at their 60th birthday party. Or there might be an auction lot for something with next to no monetary value, but which offers a rich anecdote. I'm told of one such auction, where a speech the prime minister was yet to even give was to be sold off and might fetch around Â£1,500. Think this through: it's a pile of A4 paper with words printed on it, which, by the time you receive it, is already in the public domain, and has been merely garnished with a prime ministerial scrawl, his signature. It might even turn out to be a speech which you barely agree with a word of. Or a complete dud. But, to those for whom material purchases have little added value, because they have all they could ever want, something that can hang on the back of a toilet door and comes with a story, and a smiley picture of you and the prime minister, might just be tempting. Questions will forever swirl about political parties and how they are funded. Where does the money comes from, who is giving it, how much, and to whom? Who are the donors? Why are they doing it, what are they getting out of it? The alternative, many people I spoke to said, was state funding of political parties: asking the taxpayer to pick up the tab for politics. In the grand scheme of public spending, the cost of this would be minimal, but most political parties would probably think twice, or more than twice, before attempting to sell the merits of a potential voter picking up their tab. As one donor said: ""It doesn't always look good. It really doesn't. But, intellectually, it is the least bad way of funding political parties."" And a Conservative spokesperson points out that the party is funded by membership, fundraising and donation, which are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published, and comply with the law. ""Fundraising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. The alternative is more taxpayer-funding of political campaigning, which would mean less money for frontline services like schools, police and hospitals.""

"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

"NI Secretary Brandon Lewis says negotiation is ""the right thing to do"" The Northern Ireland secretary has said he believes conditions have been met to trigger Article 16 although the government wants to work with the EU to get a ""sustainable"" long-term solution. Brandon Lewis said ""good faith"" was being shown to negotiate the best way forward. It comes aftera BBC News NI interviewwith the prime minister during which he did not rule out triggering Article 16. Boris Johnson said he wanted the EU to present proposals to fixthe protocol. The Northern Ireland Protocol helps prevent checks along the land border between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). Article 16 allows parts of the deal to be temporarily set aside. Mr Lewis toldBBC's Sunday Politics programmethat Article 16 conditions ""have been met"". However he said while the government could trigger Article 16 and will not rule it out, they do not want to. ""We are showing our good faith in wanting to negotiate a proper, sustainable, solution by not actually triggering it,"" he said. ""We have continued through this year to see different issues come up and we take the view that we need to fix the underlying problems."" He said giving space for negotiation was ""the right thing to do"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he believes the Northern Ireland Protocol could ""in principle work"" However he said the EU must come ""seriously to the table to have a proper conversation about how to get those core principals to work"". Mr Lewis said issues included the ""integral market of the UK"" and the people and businesses in Northern Ireland being able to access products in the way they always have been able to do. He said this needed to be done whilst protecting all strands ofthe Good Friday Agreementand taking responsibly for goods that are moving into the EU. ""We think we can do that but they (the EU) do need to come forward in a serious way to engage,"" he added. He said that if people in Northern Ireland cannot get access to the goods they you need as a consumer or business then that is a problem that must be resolved. Unionists have criticised the NI Protocol for effectively creating a border in the Irish Sea On Saturday, the Republic of Ireland's foreign affairs minister saidtriggering Article 16 to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol would be a ""hugely problematic backward step"". Simon Coveney said it would be a ""huge mistake"" as attempts are made to build trust between the negotiating teams. But he said it was unlikely the UK government would take the step. What's the Northern Ireland Protocol? DUP snubs second north-south meeting in days Labour leader calls on PM to step in over Protocol The Northern Ireland Protocol is a post-Brexit trade arrangement which was agreed by the UK and the EU in order to avoid the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland must still apply EU single market rules at its ports, in order to avoid the need for checks along the Irish land border as goods enter the EU. In practice, this means some products moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have been subject to new checks, which has angered many unionists who feel this is damaging trade, supply lines and Northern Ireland's position within the UK. Article 16 of the protocol allows the UK and the EU to suspend any part of the agreement that causes ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"".

"Will Renwick flies the Welsh flag on the summit of Snowdon Will Renwick's epic challenge to run up every mountain peak over 2,000ft (600m) in Wales has been fuelled by instant mash, noodles and chocolate bars. They are easy to carry and eat when you cannot find shops or pubs when you get hungry while in the middle of nowhere. Will has been clocking up at least 24 miles a day since starting on the 500-mile run from Swansea on 10 September. He is set to finish on Monday at Conwy Castle and it ""can't come soon enough"" since injuring his ankle on Thursday. It was sustained ""pushing against the wind"" during bad weather in Snowdonia. ""I'll be hobbling to the finish,"" he said, during a quick phone chat while dodging yet another downpour in a cafÃ© in Conwy county on Saturday morning. ""It is annoying because I have been feeling fit,"" he said. ""The finish line can't come soon enough."" Red sky over Maesglase mountain in Snowdonia - and a curious sheep He used the early part of the challenge as part of his training. He said running over the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons helped to improve his stamina so some days he was able to do in excess of 30 miles. ""How can you train for this kind of thing? I've got fit during the challenge,"" said Will, 31, from Llancarfan in the Vale of Glamorgan. Amputee's 13-hour crawl to reach Snowdon's summit Queues on Snowdon 'worst I can remember' He was a long-distance walker initially, having taken 63 days to navigate the 870-mile Wales Coast Path. And now he also runs ultra-marathon distances, such as completing a 100-mile route around the Isle of Man. But he said the latest challenge to climb 189 peaks in Wales back-to-back, carrying everything needed, has taken its toll on his body. Allow Twitter content?

""I look famished, I feel worn out, cold and hungry but I'm still going to do it,"" he said. He has been fuelling on pocket-size chocolate bars throughout the day and meals of mash or noodles because they are light to carry and quick to prepare. He spent four days carrying his own supplies over the peaks in mid Wales before he could find somewhere to stock up so, by the end of the stint, he was rationing his food. ""It was lonely and isolated,"" he said.

There was a hill farmer who insisted he stay overnight in his caravan, feeding him soup and cake, while at Aran Fawddwy near Bala, Gwynedd. Will Renwick takes a dip at Abergynolwyn, near Tywyn, Gwynedd He said the mountain ranges in Snowdonia had been the most challenging - mainly because the peaks in the Snowdon Massif and Glyderau ranges follow in quick succession, leaving little recovery time between each one. ""It's been good but the weather gods have been throwing everything against me."" Will, president of Ramblers Cymru, has been doing the run to raise funds for mental health charity Mind Over Mountains as he believes nature and the outdoors can help to improve people's sense of well-being. Will said as well as missing his girlfriend, he was most looking forward to taking a ""long bath"" as he has had to use rivers or streams to bathe when away from campsites. However, there have also been opportunities to shower thanks to ""plenty of rain"" along the route which is due to end at Conwy Castle on Monday at 11:00 BST, 24 days after he started.

"Specially designed barges were used in the construction of North Sea Link The world's longest under-sea electricity cable, transferring green power between Norway and the UK, has begun operation. The 450-mile (725km) cable connects Blyth in Northumberland with the Norwegian village of Kvilldal. At full 1,400 megawatt capacity it will import enough hydro-power to supply 1.4 million homes, National Grid said. National Grid Ventures president Cordi O'Hara said it was a ""remarkable feat of engineering"". She added: ""We had to go through mountains, fjords and across the North Sea to make this happen. ""North Sea Link (NSL) is also a great example of two countries working together to maximise their renewable energy resources for mutual benefit."" National Grid said the â¬1.6bn (Â£1.37bn) joint venture with Norwegian power operator Statnett would help the UK reduce carbon emissions by 23 million tonnes by 2030. It has four other power cables running to Belgium, France and the Netherlands and said 90% of energy imported in this way would be from zero carbon sources by 2030. The link from Blyth in Northumberland to Kvilldal in Norway took six years to build Hydropower in Norway and wind power in the UK are subject to weather conditions and fluctuations in demand. Using NSL, renewable power can be exported from the UK when wind generation is high and electricity demand low, or be imported from Norway when demand is high and wind generation low. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy minister Greg Hands said NSL enabled both countries to ""benefit from the flexibility and energy security that interconnectors provide"". He added: ""This pioneering partnership shows first-hand how crucial international cooperation will be in helping us to deliver on our net zero ambitions.""

"The care system is facing growing demands as a result of an ageing UK population Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announcedan extra tax to fund social carein England and help the NHS recover after the pandemic. Northern Ireland will receive an extra Â£400m to spend by 2024/25. The tax will begin as a 1.25% point rise in National Insurance from April 2022, becoming a separate tax in 2023. But how does social care work in Northern Ireland, and how is it funded? In Northern Ireland, if someone needs to go into a care home, they are expected to make a financial contribution towards the cost. The amount paid depends on the person's financial position - a financial assessment is done by a health trust. It takes into account any income the person has - that's things like state and private pensions, and any pension credits. Any benefits are also included. It examines outgoings, all savings and assets, including shares, bonds and trust funds. Up-to-date evidence of all assets for six months before being admitted to the home will have to be provided. Any property the person owns, either fully or in part, is also considered. NI MPs vote against social care tax hike What's the new Health and Social Care tax? In the case of a jointly owned home - if a couple are living in a property as their permanent full-time home before one of them goes into to a care home and the other continues to live there - the property won't be taken into account. This also includes a civil partner, a close relative who is over 60 or incapacitated, or one who is under 16. Currently, anyone who has assets of over Â£23,250, won't get any support towards the cost of their care. For anyone who has assets of below Â£14,250, it won't be included in the financial assessment. If the person has between Â£14,250 and Â£23,250, they contribute Â£1 per week for every Â£250 over Â£14,250. There's also a personal allowance of Â£27.19 from benefits, for things like toiletries or trips out. Most care homes in Northern Ireland are operated by private companies, so they can set their own weekly rate. Trusts have a set rate they will pay, known as the regional rate, which is set by the Department of Health. If someone chooses a care home which is more expensive than that at the regional rate, a third party - either a spouse or other family member - will be expected to make up the difference. If the person in the care home goes into hospital during the cost of their stay, they'll be expected to pay for or contribute to the costs in the usual way, as the care home place is being kept for their return. As most care homes in NI are private, owners can set their own prices It is against the law to transfer ownership of an asset to another person specifically to avoid paying care home fees and the trust may view it as the person depriving themselves of a capital asset in order to reduce the accommodation charge. If this is found to be the case, the trust may treat it as the person in the care home still having the asset and can recover the cost of care. Caring and supporting someone in their own home is known as domiciliary care. This may involve routine healthcare tasks, personal care and other domestic services. Unlike in England and Wales, recipients of domiciliary care in Northern Ireland and Scotland are not charged for a basic domiciliary care package. In England, to get your care paid for by your local council, you must have a very high level of need and also savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250. Below that level, the amount you pay reduces until you have less than Â£14,250, at which point the council pays for your care if you qualify. In 2002, Scotland introduced ""free personal and nursing care"" for anyone assessed as needing it. But that doesn't mean all care is free. In Scottish care homes, people get free care if they have savings or assets of less than Â£18,000. Those with savings and assets of between Â£18,000 and Â£28,750 have to fund part of their care. People with more than that have to fund their own care, apart from a Â£193.50 a week contribution towards personal care and Â£87.10 a week towards nursing care. In Wales, social care is means tested. No-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than Â£100 a week towards it. For those in care homes, people can have assets and savings (including the value of their home) up to Â£50,000 before they have to pay towards the service.

"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr Show: ""We don't want to raise taxes"" Boris Johnson says the UK is in a ""period of adjustment"" after Brexit and Covid as the country faces petrol shortages and supply chain issues. A lack of HGV drivers and high demandplunged the UK into a fuel crisislast week, with lengthy queues and closures. Worries persist about the cost of living, as food and energy prices rise,alongside cuts to universal credit. But the PM insisted his plan for a higher wage, higher skilled economy would offer a long-term solution. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on the first day of Conservative Party conference, Mr Johnson said: ""There will be a period of adjustment, but that is what I think we need to see."" He would not say if supply issues would affect Christmas, but later told reporters he was ""very confident"" the festive season would be ""considerably better"" than last year. A few thousand peopleheld an anti-government protest outside the event in Manchesteron Sunday, where the Tories will be hosting party members until Wednesday. PM vows economic change as Tory conference begins Who funds the Tory party and what's in it for them? The PM also refused to rule out raising taxes again just three weeks before Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces his annual Budget. He said he was a ""zealous opponent of unnecessary tax rises"", but warned the pandemic had hit the UK's economy like a ""fiscal meteorite"". Last month, the government announced it would beraising National Insurance to pay for health and social care. At the time, when asked whether he would rule out additional taxes, Mr Johnson said he couldgive an ""emotional commitment"" that he did not want to introduce further rises. Earlier this year Mr Sunak also froze income tax thresholds -leading to more people paying the levy- and the extra Â£20 weekly universal credit payment, brought in during the pandemic, is due to end this week. Asked on Sunday by Andrew Marr if he would raise taxes again, Mr Johnson replied: ""If I can possibly avoid it, I do not want to raise taxes again."" The PM added: ""I can tell you that you have no fiercer and more zealous opponent of unnecessary tax rises than me, but we have had to deal with a pandemic on a scale which this country has not seen before in our lifetimes and long before. ""We don't want to raise taxes, of course we don't, but what we will not do is be irresponsible with the public finances."" Cabinet members are warning against any further tax increases, with Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg telling a party conference fringe event that ""tax is about the highest level it has been since the war"" and ""we are at the upper reaches of the reasonableness of the tax burden"". He added: ""We are [at] about the limit of what taxes we can raise."" Tees Valley Tory Mayor Ben Houchen also called on the PM to avoid further tax rises, saying they would not be ""helpful"" for businesses coming out of the pandemic. Speaking to BBC News at the conference, he said: ""I appreciate it is a difficult job being the prime minister and chancellor [and] to balance the books. ""But if we want to support those businesses to create those jobs to put more money in people's pockets, I don't think tax rises are the way to go about it."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss insisted the government did not want to put additional tax burden on working people, saying growing the economy would ""pay the bill from Covid"". She told the BBC: ""None of us want to see taxes rise, we are a low tax party. We understand that it is enterprise that is going to deliver the opportunities and we need to keep the tax burden low at the same time as growing our economy."" Liz Truss made her first conference speech as foreign secretary on Sunday Asked about job shortages and supply issues in shops and on petrol forecourts, the PM insisted the lack of lorry drivers - affecting the delivery of goods - was not just a UK issue, claiming the United States and China were seeing similar problems, as well as some countries in Europe. And he said the petrol shortages were ""very largely driven by demand"", adding: ""I understand people's frustrations and I understand how infuriating it is when you turn up and can't get any. But we are making sure we have the supplementary drivers where necessary."" Mr Johnson called out those who wanted to ""go back to the tired, failed old model"" of ""reaching for the lever called uncontrolled immigration"" to bring people into the country to fill the job gaps. But he did not reject comments made by Mr Sunak, who toldthe Daily Mail,externalthe ""very real"" shortages could affect Christmas, Instead the PM said the country was going through a ""period of adjustment"" post-Brexit and needed to look to a future of ""better paid, better skilled jobs"" for British people. Mr Johnson added: ""What we had for decades was a system whereby [sectors like] the road haulage industry... were not investing in the truck stops, not improving conditions, not improving pay and we relied on very hard working people who were willing to come in, largely from European accession countries, to do that work under those conditions. ""What you need to do is make sure that people now invest in basic equipment, such as truck stops, and better pay. ""When people voted for change in 2016 [over Brexit] and when people voted for change again in 2019...they voted for the end of a broken model of the UK economy that relied on low wages and low skill and chronic low productivity and we are moving away from that."" Andrew Marr and Boris Johnson argued about what's happened to the average wage, with the prime minister saying we're finally seeing ""growth in wages, after more than 10 years of flat-lining"" but Andrew Marr saying that ""in real terms over the last three months wages have gone down, not up"". So, what's been happening? Real wages, a measure that takes account of rising prices, peaked just before the financial crash in 2008 and only returned to that level in August 2020. So, there has been a decade of little improvement overall. Rather than ""flatlining"" - as Mr Johnson claimed - it was actually roughly five years of falls followed by growth over most of the last five years. Last year saw record dips and jumps as the economy was shut down and then re-opened. But the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that growth may be stalling, with real wages looking lower in July than they were in April.

Lord Bamford, the chairman of the family owned company, has personally given Â£100,000 since 2010, when the Conservatives returned to government. He became a Conservative peer in 2013. I've been trying to find out what motivates people to give money to the Conservative Party, how do they choose how much to give and how do they measure if it is worth it? Incidentally, I put all these questions to JCB, but Lord Bamford didn't want to talk to me. That, of course, is his prerogative - what he chooses to do with his own money is his own business. But collectively, these are important questions to explore - for they offer an insight into how our governing party is bankrolled, and by whom. It is also a window into the world of the super-rich, what motivates them to donate, and the context of some stark and big numbers you might occasionally read about. So who is willing to talk publicly? ""It is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask about."" Meet Alasdair Locke, a veteran of the shipping and oil and gas industries, and a multimillionaire. ""They will put you in everything you want,"" he says, when I ask what he gets in return. Mr Locke has agreed to talk to me on the record, where others said they would speak to me, but only if I protect their identity. Mr Locke says as a donor he may get heard, but wouldn't expect it to be acted upon He has donated Â£280,000 to the Conservative Party since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Electoral Commissionrules,externalmean any donation over Â£7,500 to a party has to be reported by that party, and the figure and the donor will be published. ""I can get access via the Leaders Group. It is usually senior ministers and 15 or 20 people. Sometimes in person. Sometimes on Zoom. The last thing I attended was a lunch with Michael Gove in July. It was all donors who were there."" To become a member of the Leaders Group, you have to have donated Â£50,000 in the last year. Two to three lunches a week are arranged, to which around a dozen donors are invited. Groups don't tend to be bigger than this, to ensure all those who turn up get a chance to feel part of something that isn't impersonal. Some donors are very regular attendees, others don't come to any. Does this amount to buying access, and influence? ""It is interesting, but I'm not sure we are that influential. Politicking doesn't really interest or excite me. I would reckon I do get heard, but I don't expect it to be acted upon,"" Mr Locke says. ""Politicians are always cautious, in any case. At the lunch with Michael Gove, I asked about trade relations with the US. There was no attempt by any of us to influence policy."" Mr Locke was drawn into political donations by a ""strong conviction"" for keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom. Alastair Locke said he became a Conservative donor to support the party's leader in Scotland Douglas Ross, and his predecessor Baroness Davidson. ""I started off with the Conservatives when they were facing oblivion in Scotland. I am an old fashioned One Nation Tory, there wouldn't be much between me and centrists in the Labour Party. ""I wanted to support the centre right unionist party. I wanted to move the Scottish Conservatives away from the patrician tweedy layered image, to involve people who people would vote for,"" he tells me. He is a big fan of the Scottish Conservative Leader Douglas Ross, and Baroness Davidson, a predecessor. It is not just the Leaders Group that donors can be a member of. There is the Treasurers Group, for those who have given Â£25,000, although I am told plenty of prospective members can be tempted to upgrade to the Leaders Group, as those with a spare 25 grand rattling around can often afford to double it. There is then the Advisory Board, for those who have given Â£250,000 or more in the last year. But how transparent is this? The short answer: not very. Yes, there is the legal obligation for donors' names and how much they have given to be published. But what they actually get for that money is much, much less clear, and less clear than it used to be. Back in 2012, there was a big row about the then Conservative co-treasurer, Peter Cruddas. He resigned as party co-treasurer after The Sunday Times suggested he was offering access to then Prime Minister David Cameron for a donation of Â£250,000 a year. But the following year he won Â£180,000 in damages in a libel victory against the newspaper. The newspaper's appeal succeeded in part and the damages were later reduced to Â£50,000. Peter Cruddas is sixth in the league table of Conservative donors since Boris Johnson became prime minister, having given Â£1.1m. In December last year, Mr Johnsonnominated him for a peerage, against the advice of The Lords Appointments Commission, describing the earlier allegations as ""historic and untrue"". After the row in 2012, David Cameron decided greater transparency was the answer, even if some internally felt donors were already being told they would be named by the Electoral Commission and a further step was unnecessary. But Mr Cameron pressed ahead, and the Tories began to publish a public register of donorswho attended private dinners with the then-PM.,external But then, in 2018, they stopped. And there has been nothing since. The former housing secretary Robert Jenrick got caught up in one of the most awkward of political binds possible with a donor last year. He found himself sitting next to businessman Richard Desmond at a Conservative fundraiser. Mr Desmond thengave the party more money after one of his housing developments was given the go ahead. Mr Jenrick said he regretted the contact and Downing Street supported him, at the time. He was sacked from the cabinet this month; one minister telling me his dismissal was far too late - he should have been shown the door a year earlier. A Conservative spokesperson didn't address the question of the register straight on, but they did say: ""Donations and donors to the party are declared to and published by the Electoral Commission as required by the law and this is freely and openly available on the Electoral Commission's website."" David Cameron pledged to publish a quarterly register of party donors who attended dinners at official residences. So what do donors get for their money? ""It does give me the chance to speak to some people,"" a very significant donor tells me privately. This includes chances to speak to the prime minister and chancellor, as theFinancial Times reported over the summer,external. But, when I ask if this represents value for money, I'm told: ""I'm not sure how you measure it, to tell you the truth. It doesn't amount to being involved in making policy."" This is where we get into a fascinating subtlety about very rich people and what they do with their money. This same donor offers an insight that all of my conversations tacked back to: he said his - by any conventional metric - vast donations to the Conservative Party, amounted to ""barely a flicker"" compared to the sums involved in the charitable work he does. This single example of giving is matched by the picture more broadly. The Conservative Party generates around Â£25m a year. Charities, collectively in the UK, are a multi billion pound sector, witharound 50 generating more than Â£100m a year,external. Some inside the party ponder how giving money to any political party could be perceived to be more noble, as a contribution to public life, rather than so often raising awkward and, usually, unanswered questions. Should party political donations be treated like donations to charity, which are subject to tax relief, called Gift Aid? Maybe, argue some, while acknowledging it would look self serving and so politically awkward. But let's get back to what motivates people to give money. Beyond access to ministers, and, for some, eventually, maybe a knighthood or a seat in the House of Lords (although their other work, in industry or for charity, might qualify them for this anyway), there is an X factor available here too. Auctioning off a weekend for two at a plush hotel in the Lake District doesn't tick any boxes for a donor who may just own that hotel anyway. But offer them a dinner at which the prime minister is speaking and there is, perhaps, a near equivalent in terms of social cachet to said donor having spent vast sums having a stratospherically famous rock star play privately at their 60th birthday party. Or there might be an auction lot for something with next to no monetary value, but which offers a rich anecdote. I'm told of one such auction, where a speech the prime minister was yet to even give was to be sold off and might fetch around Â£1,500. Think this through: it's a pile of A4 paper with words printed on it, which, by the time you receive it, is already in the public domain, and has been merely garnished with a prime ministerial scrawl, his signature. It might even turn out to be a speech which you barely agree with a word of. Or a complete dud. But, to those for whom material purchases have little added value, because they have all they could ever want, something that can hang on the back of a toilet door and comes with a story, and a smiley picture of you and the prime minister, might just be tempting. Questions will forever swirl about political parties and how they are funded. Where does the money comes from, who is giving it, how much, and to whom? Who are the donors? Why are they doing it, what are they getting out of it? The alternative, many people I spoke to said, was state funding of political parties: asking the taxpayer to pick up the tab for politics. In the grand scheme of public spending, the cost of this would be minimal, but most political parties would probably think twice, or more than twice, before attempting to sell the merits of a potential voter picking up their tab. As one donor said: ""It doesn't always look good. It really doesn't. But, intellectually, it is the least bad way of funding political parties."" And a Conservative spokesperson points out that the party is funded by membership, fundraising and donation, which are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published, and comply with the law. ""Fundraising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. The alternative is more taxpayer-funding of political campaigning, which would mean less money for frontline services like schools, police and hospitals.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr Show: ""People should trust the police"" The government ""will stop at nothing to make sure that we get more rapists behind bars"", Boris Johnson has said. The PM told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that prosecutions for rape and sexual violence were ""going wrong"". He added women should have confidence in the police, with the nation's officers ""overwhelmingly trustworthy"". The jailing of Wayne Couzens for Sarah Everard's murder has raised questions about women's safety, and trust in the police and criminal justice system. Couzens was a police officer in London at the time of Ms Everard's murder, and the Metropolitan Police is facing questions over its failure to stop him. What should you do if you are stopped by police? Police to be quizzed over Couzens' work at Commons Rape case blame game between police and CPS - report Asked by Andrew Marr whether he would launch an independent public inquiry into the case, Mr Johnson said he wanted the police watchdog to complete its review first. He said: ""We do need to look systemically at not just the Wayne Couzens case, but the whole handling of rape, domestic violence, sexual violence and female complaints about harassment, all together."" Speaking later, he added: ""There are delays taking place at every stage in the process. ""You know the reasons - it's all the complexities to do with people's mobile phones, the evidence that's produced by the defence, and all that kind of stuff. ""But, in the end, that is no excuse. We have to have these complaints properly dealt with."" Over the past five years, cases reported to police - and initially recorded as rape - have risen sharply. However, the proportion making it to court - known as prosecutions - in that time has more than halved,the BBC's Reality Check team found. Figures for 2019-20 show 1,439 suspects in cases when a rape had been alleged were convicted of rape or lesser offences in England and Wales, the lowest level since records began. This was down from 1,925 the previous year, despite a rise in reports of rape. Rape carries a penalty of between four and 19 years' custody, with a maximum of life imprisonment in limited circumstances, according to Sentencing Council guidelines. Boris Johnson responded to questions about whether funding cuts had had an impact on rape investigations, saying the government was ""investing massively in policing and crime and in all aspects of the justice system"". In 2020-21, the budget of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) was Â£9.5bn - an increase on the previous couple of years but still below where it was in 2010. Overall, between 2010 and 2020, the MoJ had a cut of about 25% to its budget, according to official spending figures. After the last budget in March 2021, the Institute for Government projected that spending on areas including police and crime would only increase by 1% each year once you adjust for rising prices after 2021-22. In the year to March 2021, just 1.5% of recorded rapes ended in a suspect being charged or issued with a summons - roughly half as many as five years ago. This has been attributed to funding cuts, as well as a number of other things - such as big court backlogs and victims being more likely to withdraw their complaints rather than go through the often intrusive court process. What's the truth about rape prosecutions? Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is also minister for women and equalities, said the criminal justice system and the culture within the police needed to change. ""It is wrong that women don't feel safe on our streets and I personally very much understand that,"" she told the BBC. ""We will only have a truly equal society when women feel as safe as men on the streets."" The Met has been criticised over its safety advice to women after it emerged Couzens used his position as an officer to falsely arrest and kidnap Ms Everard. The advice said women who were suspicious of lone plain-clothes police officers should shout out, flag down a bus, or knock on doors for help. Mr Johnson said women who were suspicious about they way they were being treated by a police officer should follow this advice. But he added: ""My view is that the police do - overwhelmingly - a wonderful job and what I want is the public, and women in particular, girls and young women, women of all ages, to trust the police. ""They are overwhelmingly trustworthy."" The murder of Sarah Everard sparked calls for more action to tackle violence against women The Met wasfacing further questionsover its handling of vetting procedures after it confirmed Couzens stood guard within Parliament on five occasions last year. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, requested an urgent meeting with the force's leadership ""to discuss how this person could have been deemed suitable for deployment here"". It followed the revelation there were two separate allegations of indecent exposure linked to Couzens - with one in the days leading up to Ms Everard's murder. Dame Lynne Owens, the outgoing director general of the National Crime Agency, said ""we, in policing, need to take a long hard look at ourselves"" after Couzens was jailed. Shewrote on Twitter,external: ""The many good people [in] policing, at all ranks & grades, need to be part of the solution though. ""They joined because they want to make a difference and they know the public needs confidence in them."" Why do so few rape cases go to court?

"The home secretary will promise tougher powers to tackle demonstrators blocking motorways, after a string of protests by climate activists. At the Tory party conference this week, Priti Patel will announce plans for longer sentences and new powers for police to seize protesters' equipment. Climate group Insulate Britain has blocked the M1, M4 and M25 in protests over the last three weeks. Their campaign has already led to hundreds of arrests. On Sunday, the government took out a fresh injunction aimed at preventing activists obstructing traffic on motorways and main roads around London. It is the third such court order taken out by the National Highways agency in an attempt to stop demonstrations on major roads in south-east England. New injunction sought over motorway protests Insulate Britain protesters glue hands to M25 Priti Patel calls M25 climate protesters selfish Anyone breaking the injunction faces imprisonment or an unlimited fine. However, previous injunctions have failed to stop the protests. Ms Patel said the government would not ""tolerate guerrilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business"". Boris Johnsontold the Mail on Sunday,externalthat although the right to protest was ""sacrosanct"", there is ""no right to inflict chaos and misery on people trying to go about their lives"". ""This government will always stand on the side of the law-abiding majority, and ensure the toughest penalties possible for criminals who deliberately bring major roads to a standstill. ""We will give the police the powers they need to stop their reckless and selfish behaviour."" Insulate Britain's protests have included occupying roundabouts on the M25 Home Office sources said the government would seek to introduce the new powers by amending the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Thewide-ranging legislation, which already includes new police powers over protests, is making its way through Parliament. Ministers want to make obstructing a highway punishable by an unlimited fine, six months imprisonment, or both. It currently carries a maximum fine of Â£1,000. They also want to hand the police new powers to stop and search protesters suspected of carrying so-called ""lock-on"" equipment - such as glue or bike locks - used to secure themselves to protest sites. This would add to existing police powers to stop and search individuals for offensive weapons and items intended for committing theft, burglary or damage to property. Insulate Britain's campaign, which has been going for more than three weeks, has seen more than 300 arrests. The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, has previously vowed to continue campaigning despite arrests and injunctions. In an open latter to Ms Patel last week it said: ""You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere."" The campaigners want the government to insulate all homes across the UK by 2030 to help cut carbon emissions.

"United Airlines says it will fire staff who refuse a vaccine and don't qualify for an exemption The boss of United Airlines has told the BBC that firing staff who refuse to get a coronavirus vaccine is ""just the right thing to do"". Around 300 of the airline's 67,000 US based staff are yet to comply with the strict policy, after an initial deadline of 27 September. Vaccine hesitancy has been a hugely divisive issue in the US butPresident Biden recently made it easier for big companiesto take a tougher line. CEO Scott Kirby says United's strict policy is ""about saving lives"". He adds that ""when I retire someday, hopefully long in the future, I will look back at this and it will be one of the proudest moments of my career that we've made the tough decision, but the right decision to require vaccines."" More than 250 staff have complied with United's policy since last week's deadline. A further 2,000 employees have requested an exemption on medical or religious grounds. They haven't all been granted, but final numbers won't be clear until legal processes are resolved.

He points out that ""there's different vaccines in different parts of the world, every country has their own regulatory apparatus"". United's passengers numbers in the first half of 2021 were at only 48.8% of pre-pandemic levels ""I've never thought that we would get to a world where we had a single system that applied broadly, it'd be great if we could, just it was always impractical"".

""United, like the other big American carriers, have generally coped pretty well with the pandemic"" says Mr Charlton. He explains this is because ""around 75% of their operations are domestic travel which hasn't been disrupted as badly as international flights.

"David Weir, Brigid Kosgei and Shura Kitata will be on the start line as the London Marathon returns to the city's streets Virgin Money London Marathon Date:Sunday, 3 OctoberTime:08:50 BST (elite wheelchair race), 09:00 (elite women), 09:30 (elite men and mass start)Course:Blackheath to The Mall BBC coverage:Watch live on BBC Two from 08:00 and BBC One from 10:00 with uninterrupted coverage and extra streams on the Red Button and online; live text from 08:00. The London Marathon returns to the city's streets for the first full-scale staging of the race in more than two years on Sunday. More than 40,000 runners will join some of the world's best on the usual course that starts in Blackheath and finishes 26.2 miles later in the shadow of Buckingham Palace on The Mall. They will be joined by a similar number completing the distance 'virtually' via a tracking app on a course of their choosing. Last year, the race was shifted from it's usual April date as the coronavirus pandemic forced the suspension of sporting events worldwide. Last October, a small, elite fieldcompeted over 19 laps of a closed coursearound St James's Park, with the mass element of the event taking place remotely. London's race director Hugh Brasher said this year's event - 40 years on from the inaugural race in 1981 -""could easily be the most memorable ever"". ""It will be a moment of joy, of true emotion,"" he added. ""It is more than just a marathon. It is about bringing people together and that is what we have missed so much in the last 18 months."" This is all you need to know about Sunday's race. 'This could be the most memorable London Marathon ever' Forty London Marathons and counting - the story of an 'EverPresent' BBC Sport coverage details- and how to contact us with your stories Kenya's Brigid Kosgei was clear of the field in victory in 2020 Kenyan world record holder Brigid Kosgei is aiming for a third successive victory in the race after emphatic wins in 2019 and 2020. Germany's Katrin Dorre was the last athlete to complete such a treble in the women's race with wins between 1992 and 1994. She will face stiff competition with Israel's Lonah Salpeter, the seventh-fastest woman over the distance, and Kenya's reigning New York City Marathon champion Joyciline Jepkosgei hunting a first London win. Kosgei insists she is up for the challenge just eight weeks after winning Olympic silver in hot, humid conditions in Sapporo, Japan. ""After one week, I was well recovered,"" she told BBC Sport. ""The big reason is I like too much London. I love London. I like the course. The way they welcome us. Even the race organisers. I like the place and how they cheer us on the way."" Charlotte Purdue and Natasha Cockram, the first Briton in the 2019 and 2020 races respectively, are aiming to qualify for next year's World Championships in Oregon. This video can not be played London Marathon 2020: Kosgei defends title as Hall finishes second in thrilling sprint finish Purdue, the fourth-fastest British woman over the distance, was bitterly disappointed to miss out on selection for the Tokyo Olympics,feeling she was wrongly overlooked on medical grounds. ""I was really annoyed and angry but as soon as I had London as a focus I just channelled all my energy into London,"" she told BBC Sport. ""Now I'm all in on this race on Sunday."" In last year's men's race, Ethiopia's Shura Kitata explained howhe had hit the breakfast buffet hardto power himself to a surprise victory over Kenyan great Eliud Kipchoge. Here's hoping the elite athletes' hotel has stocked up on pastries because Kitata is back to defend his crown. ""Last year's win had very great meaning because Eliud is such a famous, strong runner,"" said Kitata. This video can not be played London Marathon 2020: Kitata wins the men's race after amazing sprint ""It has brought me strength in my psychological and physical preparation, and also a lot of attention from the public as well."" Kipchoge, who had won four of the previous five London Marathons before 2020, is absent this time, with Britain's Mo Farah also missing after failing to qualify for Tokyo 2020 on the track and suffering a stress fracture in this foot. However, Ethiopia's Birhanu Legese, the third-fastest man of all time over the distance, is in the field along with compatriot and world silver medallist Mosinet Geremew. Hug's 'Ferrari' chair is an edge - Weir 'I'm running with the man who saved my life' Great Britain's eight-time men's wheelchair winner David Weir competes in his 22nd London Marathon but is up against Switzerland's in-form Marcel Hug, who won four golds, including the marathon title, at Tokyo 2020. American Daniel Romanchuk, a hugely impressive winner in 2019, is also in the field along with Canada's defending champion Brent Lakatos. The 2020 race took place away from crowds With more than240,000 positive Covid tests across the United Kingdom,externalin the seven days before race week, there are still precautions in place for the race. All runners must provide a negative lateral flow test before they are allowed to line up in London and are being encouraged to bring only one other person to spectate and support them in person. Stewards will ask people to move along the course if large crowds gather at any point. The race will start with smaller waves of runners released over 90 minutes, and the usual baggage system, which takes warm-up kit from the start to the finish, has been streamlined to reduce the chance of transmission. Organisers insist fuel supply problems should not be an issue, encouraging runners to use public transport for their journeys to the start and back home. ""Those services have been the best way for people to get to the event in its history and will remain that way,"" said Brasher. This video can not be played How the London Marathon achieves sustainability Electric lead vehicles at the front of the race, compostable drinks cups, goodie bags at the finish line made out of sugar cane instead of plastic. The London Marathon has introduced a host of measures to mitigate the waste and carbon produced by the race. The race has become a draw for runners all over the world with 84,125 overseas applications to run in the 2020 race. Organisers have introduced a carbon levy to help offset those international runners' journeys to the start line. They have also helped fund tree-planting projects in east London and Kenya which absorb carbon dioxide. There have also been changes to improve the experience of runners at the back of the field after some of 2019's slowest runners reportedbeing insulted by officialsand finding the clean-up operation taking place ahead of them. This video can not be played 2019: Pacer Liz Ayres tells Victoria Derbyshire programme that slower runners were called ""fat"" and ""slow"" by contractors. There will be 50-strong team of 'tailwalkers' who will walk the course at eight-hour pace accompanied by a DJ providing motivational music. There will also be additional officials on hand about every 400m from 16 miles onwards to support any runners struggling to complete the course.

"Welcome to the One Million Pound Club. To make the top ten donors to the Conservative Party since Boris Johnson became prime minister, you need to have stumped up a seven figure sum. At the top of the chart, by a considerable margin, the providers of one of the most memorable political images of the last few years. Boris Johnson at the wheel of a JCB, a polystyrene wall smashed, his 'Get Brexit Done' slogan in the mechanical shovel. JC Bamford Excavators Limited has given just over Â£2.5m in the last two years. Lord Bamford, the chairman of the family owned company, has personally given Â£100,000 since 2010, when the Conservatives returned to government. He became a Conservative peer in 2013. I've been trying to find out what motivates people to give money to the Conservative Party, how do they choose how much to give and how do they measure if it is worth it? Incidentally, I put all these questions to JCB, but Lord Bamford didn't want to talk to me. That, of course, is his prerogative - what he chooses to do with his own money is his own business. But collectively, these are important questions to explore - for they offer an insight into how our governing party is bankrolled, and by whom. It is also a window into the world of the super-rich, what motivates them to donate, and the context of some stark and big numbers you might occasionally read about. So who is willing to talk publicly? ""It is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask about."" Meet Alasdair Locke, a veteran of the shipping and oil and gas industries, and a multimillionaire. ""They will put you in everything you want,"" he says, when I ask what he gets in return. Mr Locke has agreed to talk to me on the record, where others said they would speak to me, but only if I protect their identity. Mr Locke says as a donor he may get heard, but wouldn't expect it to be acted upon He has donated Â£280,000 to the Conservative Party since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Electoral Commissionrules,externalmean any donation over Â£7,500 to a party has to be reported by that party, and the figure and the donor will be published. ""I can get access via the Leaders Group. It is usually senior ministers and 15 or 20 people. Sometimes in person. Sometimes on Zoom. The last thing I attended was a lunch with Michael Gove in July. It was all donors who were there."" To become a member of the Leaders Group, you have to have donated Â£50,000 in the last year. Two to three lunches a week are arranged, to which around a dozen donors are invited. Groups don't tend to be bigger than this, to ensure all those who turn up get a chance to feel part of something that isn't impersonal. Some donors are very regular attendees, others don't come to any. Does this amount to buying access, and influence? ""It is interesting, but I'm not sure we are that influential. Politicking doesn't really interest or excite me. I would reckon I do get heard, but I don't expect it to be acted upon,"" Mr Locke says. ""Politicians are always cautious, in any case. At the lunch with Michael Gove, I asked about trade relations with the US. There was no attempt by any of us to influence policy."" Mr Locke was drawn into political donations by a ""strong conviction"" for keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom. Alastair Locke said he became a Conservative donor to support the party's leader in Scotland Douglas Ross, and his predecessor Baroness Davidson. ""I started off with the Conservatives when they were facing oblivion in Scotland. I am an old fashioned One Nation Tory, there wouldn't be much between me and centrists in the Labour Party. ""I wanted to support the centre right unionist party. I wanted to move the Scottish Conservatives away from the patrician tweedy layered image, to involve people who people would vote for,"" he tells me. He is a big fan of the Scottish Conservative Leader Douglas Ross, and Baroness Davidson, a predecessor. It is not just the Leaders Group that donors can be a member of. There is the Treasurers Group, for those who have given Â£25,000, although I am told plenty of prospective members can be tempted to upgrade to the Leaders Group, as those with a spare 25 grand rattling around can often afford to double it. There is then the Advisory Board, for those who have given Â£250,000 or more in the last year. But how transparent is this? The short answer: not very. Yes, there is the legal obligation for donors' names and how much they have given to be published. But what they actually get for that money is much, much less clear, and less clear than it used to be. Back in 2012, there was a big row about the then Conservative co-treasurer, Peter Cruddas. He resigned as party co-treasurer after The Sunday Times suggested he was offering access to then Prime Minister David Cameron for a donation of Â£250,000 a year. But the following year he won Â£180,000 in damages in a libel victory against the newspaper. The newspaper's appeal succeeded in part and the damages were later reduced to Â£50,000. Peter Cruddas is sixth in the league table of Conservative donors since Boris Johnson became prime minister, having given Â£1.1m. In December last year, Mr Johnsonnominated him for a peerage, against the advice of The Lords Appointments Commission, describing the earlier allegations as ""historic and untrue"". After the row in 2012, David Cameron decided greater transparency was the answer, even if some internally felt donors were already being told they would be named by the Electoral Commission and a further step was unnecessary. But Mr Cameron pressed ahead, and the Tories began to publish a public register of donorswho attended private dinners with the then-PM.,external But then, in 2018, they stopped. And there has been nothing since. The former housing secretary Robert Jenrick got caught up in one of the most awkward of political binds possible with a donor last year. He found himself sitting next to businessman Richard Desmond at a Conservative fundraiser. Mr Desmond thengave the party more money after one of his housing developments was given the go ahead. Mr Jenrick said he regretted the contact and Downing Street supported him, at the time. He was sacked from the cabinet this month; one minister telling me his dismissal was far too late - he should have been shown the door a year earlier. A Conservative spokesperson didn't address the question of the register straight on, but they did say: ""Donations and donors to the party are declared to and published by the Electoral Commission as required by the law and this is freely and openly available on the Electoral Commission's website."" David Cameron pledged to publish a quarterly register of party donors who attended dinners at official residences. So what do donors get for their money? ""It does give me the chance to speak to some people,"" a very significant donor tells me privately. This includes chances to speak to the prime minister and chancellor, as theFinancial Times reported over the summer,external. But, when I ask if this represents value for money, I'm told: ""I'm not sure how you measure it, to tell you the truth. It doesn't amount to being involved in making policy."" This is where we get into a fascinating subtlety about very rich people and what they do with their money. This same donor offers an insight that all of my conversations tacked back to: he said his - by any conventional metric - vast donations to the Conservative Party, amounted to ""barely a flicker"" compared to the sums involved in the charitable work he does. This single example of giving is matched by the picture more broadly. The Conservative Party generates around Â£25m a year. Charities, collectively in the UK, are a multi billion pound sector, witharound 50 generating more than Â£100m a year,external. Some inside the party ponder how giving money to any political party could be perceived to be more noble, as a contribution to public life, rather than so often raising awkward and, usually, unanswered questions. Should party political donations be treated like donations to charity, which are subject to tax relief, called Gift Aid? Maybe, argue some, while acknowledging it would look self serving and so politically awkward. But let's get back to what motivates people to give money. Beyond access to ministers, and, for some, eventually, maybe a knighthood or a seat in the House of Lords (although their other work, in industry or for charity, might qualify them for this anyway), there is an X factor available here too. Auctioning off a weekend for two at a plush hotel in the Lake District doesn't tick any boxes for a donor who may just own that hotel anyway. But offer them a dinner at which the prime minister is speaking and there is, perhaps, a near equivalent in terms of social cachet to said donor having spent vast sums having a stratospherically famous rock star play privately at their 60th birthday party. Or there might be an auction lot for something with next to no monetary value, but which offers a rich anecdote. I'm told of one such auction, where a speech the prime minister was yet to even give was to be sold off and might fetch around Â£1,500. Think this through: it's a pile of A4 paper with words printed on it, which, by the time you receive it, is already in the public domain, and has been merely garnished with a prime ministerial scrawl, his signature. It might even turn out to be a speech which you barely agree with a word of. Or a complete dud. But, to those for whom material purchases have little added value, because they have all they could ever want, something that can hang on the back of a toilet door and comes with a story, and a smiley picture of you and the prime minister, might just be tempting. Questions will forever swirl about political parties and how they are funded. Where does the money comes from, who is giving it, how much, and to whom? Who are the donors? Why are they doing it, what are they getting out of it? The alternative, many people I spoke to said, was state funding of political parties: asking the taxpayer to pick up the tab for politics. In the grand scheme of public spending, the cost of this would be minimal, but most political parties would probably think twice, or more than twice, before attempting to sell the merits of a potential voter picking up their tab. As one donor said: ""It doesn't always look good. It really doesn't. But, intellectually, it is the least bad way of funding political parties."" And a Conservative spokesperson points out that the party is funded by membership, fundraising and donation, which are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published, and comply with the law. ""Fundraising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. The alternative is more taxpayer-funding of political campaigning, which would mean less money for frontline services like schools, police and hospitals.""
