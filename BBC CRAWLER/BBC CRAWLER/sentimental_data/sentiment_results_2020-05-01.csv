"The leader of the UN's health body (file photo) expressed concern for nations with vulnerable health systems The World Health Organization says it ""didn't waste time"" responding to the coronavirus after facing criticism for its handling of the outbreak. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the WHO's declaration of the virus as an international health emergency on 30 January gave ""enough time for the rest of the world to respond"". At the time there were only 82 cases outside China and no deaths. Today there are more than 3.2m cases and 234,000 deaths recorded worldwide. US President Donald Trump has said the WHO ""really blew"" its response and accused it of bias towards China. The US is the global health body's largest single funder and President Trump says he will halt funding. Speaking at a news conference on Friday Dr Tedros offered a vigorous defence of how the organisation responded. He insisted the WHO used the time before the declaration wisely, including visiting China to learn more about the virus at its origin. Dr Tedros confirmed that the pandemic remained a ""public health emergency of international concern"", three months after it was declared one. Such a declaration is made under an ""extraordinary"" event and requires a global response. Dr Tedros described ""grave"" worries over the potential impact of the virus as it accelerates in countries with weaker health systems.

"The National Trust has closed its houses, such as Blickling Hall and Estate, to visitors during the coronavirus pandemic The National Trust has warned it could lose up to Â£200m this year following the coronavirus outbreak - putting some of its key projects at risk. The conservation charity has already paused work to clean rivers, prevent upland flooding and improve soil. It has called on government to offer the same financial support to nature, wildlife and environmental groups that it has to other businesses. The trust says the lockdown has shown the value of access to green space. The National Trust, which is the UK's largest conservation charity, looks after more than 300 historic houses and almost 800 miles of coastline across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, its director Hilary McGrady urged ministers to use the recovery from the virus to prioritise ""green growth"" and carbon reduction. The trust, which marks its 125th anniversary this year, has closed its gated gardens and parks as well as its houses, cafes and shops to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. At the end of March, the conservation charity was also forced toclose all of its car parks. AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Ms McGrady said the coronavirus lockdown in the UK had ""clearly shown"" that people ""want and need access to nature-rich green space near where they live"". But she said the sharp drop in revenue faced by the charity has already led to the pausing of key environmental programmes like cleaning rivers, flood prevention and soil improvement. Ms McGrady said that the trust's plan to plant 20 million trees to tackle climate change and create green areas for people near towns and cities ""must not go the same way"". The trust has also committed to becoming carbon net zero by 2030. ""[Business Secretary] Alok Sharma has written to retail and manufacturing businesses to thank them for their efforts and set out a programme of support,"" Ms McGrady said. ""Ministers now urgently need to address nature, wildlife and environmental organisations with an immediate offer of support, and set out how the sector will contribute towards its green recovery plan."" Ms McGrady added: ""On a practical level, this means urgent and more creative solutions to climate change. ""More trees and naturalised rivers can help us deal better with the devastating [...] flooding experienced by large sections of the country this year - a problem that will not go away. ""And a rapid shift to farming that regenerates our natural environment, improves biodiversity and captures and stores carbon remains one of our most urgent challenges."" She called for a green economic recovery plan, saying spending should reduce carbon emissions and boost public health ""through clean air"".

"Tracy Dykes says carers ""need to be geared up"" to protect their clients From personal care to meal preparation, every day many thousands of vulnerable people depend on receiving care in their own homes. Often it is provided by domiciliary carers from private companies who make several visits a day, but with personal protective equipment (PPE) stocks stretched, some agencies have been turning to online suppliers. One care company says it paid Â£60,000 up front for PPE, but ""the stock never came"". Meanwhile, a health trust said it had seen prices rise in what it calls ""blatant profiteering"". Carers are at obvious risk of catching or spreading Covid-19, so it is vital they wear PPE like aprons, gloves and masks. Tracy Dykes, who looks after elderly people in their own homes in Nantwich, Cheshire, says for workers like her ""going in protecting ourselves is one thing, but we need to protect our clients"". ""It's their lives we are protecting, so we need to be geared up, prepared to protect them."" But the agency which employs her has been running low on PPE. Rachel Simpson says buying PPE online is ""like the Wild West"" AMG Nursing and Care Services has nine branches across the Midlands, North West England and North Wales and has 1,500 carers on its books. It needs to supply them all with stock including gloves, masks and aprons. Each carer changes their PPE several times a day to maintain hygiene, so the agency needs regular supplies in high quantities. AMG has been unable to get PPE from its usual supplier, which itself is out of stock, and the company is also unable to secure enough equipment purely through the NHS supply chain. As a result, managers say they have had no option but to try and buy PPE online. PPE portals have sprung up in response to the demand, but not all websites are responsible for the deals which are listed on them. Rachel Simpson, AMG's operations director, says it is ""like the Wild West"". ""We're in a situation where we don't know who we're dealing with. ""We've put in an order for 100,000 masks at Â£60,000. We had to pay upfront, as we are required to do with all suppliers at the moment, and the stock never came."" AMG has been unable to get PPE from its usual supplier, leading to low stocks There has also been a boom in spam emails offering PPE. Nick Hulme, chief executive of East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, says he has ""been inundated with offers of PPE both from this country and abroad"". ""I probably get between 10 and 15 emails a day offering me all sorts of PPE that I know isn't available."" Whether the stock exists or not, much of the PPE being advertised is sold at exorbitant prices. Mr Hulme says he was ""recently approached by a company that we've previously used offering coveralls for Â£16.50"". ""Because we've used them before, I was able to look at their previous catalogue, and in January they were charging Â£2. ""There's no amount of supply chain issues that could demand that sort of increase and this for me was blatant profiteering. ""It's completely unacceptable"". Private care companies are more exposed to the risks of buying PPE in the open marketplace than facilities like hospitals which can source stock through the NHS supply chain. But across the board there is a concern that when lockdown eventually eases, the demand for face masks will surge, making them even harder to get hold of. As of 26 April, more than one billion pieces of PPE have been delivered to health and care settings across the UK,according to the government, including 36.3 million items of PPE to designated wholesalers for onward sale to social care providers. The government has also released Â£3.6bn in funding to local authorities - which are in charge of providing social care - with instructions that most of this should reach the adult social-care sector.

"People living in more deprived areas of England and Wales are more likely to die with coronavirus than those in more affluent places, new figures suggest. Office for National Statistics analysis,externalshows there were 55 deaths for every 100,000 people in the poorest parts of England, compared with 25 in the wealthiest areas. Mortality rates are normally higher in poorer areas. But the ONS said coronavirus appeared to be adding to the problem. ""This is something that we are worried about and looking at,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Hancock said his department was looking into the various ways the virus impacts different groups to understand it ""as much as we possibly can"". How many confirmed cases are there in your area? How deadly is the coronavirus? Ethnic breakdown of London deaths revealed 'We go hungry so we can feed our children' Across the country, the highest rates of deaths have been in urban areas where lots of people live. The overall mortality rate in London has been almost double that of the next highest region. The data also shows the Covid-19 mortality rate in the most deprived areas of England has been higher among men, with 76.7 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 39.6 per 100,000 women. ""General mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas, but so far Covid-19 appears to be taking them higher still,"" said Nick Stripe, ONS head of health analysis. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the report showed the virus thrived on inequality. ""Ministers must target health inequalities with an overarching strategy to tackle the wider social determinants of ill-health,"" he said. The ONS used the Index of Multiple Deprivation, a relative measure of poverty last updated in 2019. The index takes into account factors such as an area's income, employment, crime and health deprivation and disability. The ONS studied the 20,283 deaths involving Covid-19 that took place between 1 March and 17 April. In England, it found the mortality rate in the most deprived areas was 55.1 deaths per 100,000 population, while the rate was 25.3 deaths per 100,000 in the least deprived areas. In Wales, statisticians found the most deprived fifth of areas had a mortality rate of 44.6 deaths per 100,000 population, almost twice as high as the rate for the least deprived areas of 23.2 deaths per 100,000. It also found: South-west England had the lowest Covid-19 mortality rate, with 16.4 deaths per 100,000 population The council areas with the highest Covid-19 mortality rates were all in London. Newham had the highest rate with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent at 141.5 and Hackney at 127.4 David Finch, a senior fellow at the Health Foundation, said people in deprived areas were at higher risk of exposure to Covid-19 because they were likely to live in cramped housing conditions. He said those people were also more likely to have one or more long-term health condition, meaning they would be at greater risk of suffering severe symptoms from the virus if exposed. Chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's Javed Khan said the ONS study was ""worrying"" but ""unfortunately not surprising"". ""Vulnerable children and families - and those already experiencing disadvantage - risk becoming the forgotten victims,"" he added. ""Without intervention, this crisis will be devastating for a whole generation - their mental health, safety, education and job prospects are on the line."" In a statement, the government said it had commissioned urgent work from Public Health England to understand the different factors that could influence the way someone was affected by the virus and would set out more details in due course. ""We are ensuring financial support for the poorest in society by increasing universal credit payments and speeding up the payment of statutory sick pay, as well as introducing the coronavirus job-retention scheme, the self-employment income support scheme, mortgage holidays and greater protection for renters."" The ONS analysis comes as a separate study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says coronavirus patients from black African backgrounds in England and Walesare dying at more than triple the rate of white Britons. The IFS said a higher proportion of people from ethnic minority backgrounds lived in areas hit harder by Covid-19. Deaths in London hit Blitz levels Cases in your area How deadly is the coronavirus?

"Tesla boss Elon Musk wiped $14bn (Â£11bn) off the carmaker's value after tweeting its share price was too high. It also knocked $3bn off Mr Musk's own stake in Tesla as investors promptly bailed out of the company. ""Tesla stock price too high imo,"" he said in one of several tweets that included a vow to sell his possessions. In other tweets, he said his girlfriend was mad at him, while another simply read: ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light of consciousness."" In 2018, a tweet about Tesla's future on the New York stock market led to regulators fining the company $20m and Mr Musk agreeing to have all further posts on the platform pre-screened by lawyers. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported it had asked the billionaire if he was joking about the share price tweet and whether it had been vetted, receiving the reply ""No"". Tesla's share price has surged this year, putting the electric carmaker's value at close to $100bn, a mark that would trigger a bonus payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to the entrepreneur.

""We view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek and it's Elon being Elon. It's certainly a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and [Wall] Street clearly is frustrated,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives told Reuters news agency. In 2018, Mr Musk tweeted that he may have secured funding to possibly remove Tesla from the stock market and take it private, which again led to swings in the share price. The Securities and Exchange Commission judged it a market-moving comment, fined him and forced Tesla to put in place checks to ensure it did not happen again. But last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Mr Musk intended to defraud them. Allow Twitter content?

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says his pledge of 100,000 tests a day has been met, with 122,347 tests carried out yesterday Scotland's chief examiner Fiona Robertson reassures pupils that grades this year will be based on ""all activity throughout the year"" BBC Scotland News Many say they would be uncomfortable leaving home even if restrictions were lifted. As we end our live coverage of the latest coronavirus developments in Scotland, here is a summary of today's headlines:  Our live coverage will resume in the morning. See you then. Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter Edinburgh landlords are calling on council officials to waive council tax on properties which are lying empty due to the coronavirus lockdown. Landlords are unable to conduct viewings of their flats to prospective tenants during the restrictions. Currently they only receive a 10% discount if the flat is empty. John Davidson, 40, lost both his tenants at his two flats in Edinburgh's Dalry and Stockbridge when the lockdown was announced. He said: ""Normally they are really easy to rent out but I'm not allowed to do viewings just now so I've been left picking up the bills. I'm desperate to rent them out. âYou would think that while we are all in this together the council tax would be waived on empty flats.â As we approach the end of our live coverage for today, take a look at some of Your Pictures of Scotland this week.

Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter Edinburgh Council is banning traffic from three city roads to
make more space for pedestrians and cyclists during the coronavirus lockdown. The bottom of Silverknowes Road, heading towards the Cramond foreshore promenade, has been closed, while Braid Road and Links Gardens will shut from Sunday. It is one of the first local
authorities in the UK to introduce emergency measures to help pedestrians and
cyclists to travel safely while observing physical distancing guidance. Adam McVey, City of Edinburgh Council
leader, said: ""The way we move around the city has changed significantly
over recent weeks and it's clear that we need to respond to this. ""We've been working closely with
the Scottish government to develop measures to help pedestrians and cyclists
travel safely while remaining socially distant."" Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent More than 1,600 companies have offered to help the Scottish government with vital supplies during the coronavirus crisis, with factories re-purposing production lines to manufacture much-needed kit. Skyrora, in Loanhead, Midlothian, develops satellite launchers but switched production to face shields and is turning rocket fuel into hand sanitizer. Business operations manager Derek Harris said âIt was a bit more of a challenge than we expected. At first we thought we can make these and hand them out but then we realised we needed to get the correct licences and source the correct customers. âWe worked closely with the government and local care homes and our team deployed into different areas and we made it work.â Berry BPI in Greenock lost contracts to China years ago. It is now producing hundred of thousands of NHS gowns and millions of aprons every week. Chief executive Andrew Green said: âWe saw a need. We saw that hospitals were likely to run out of these things, before it happened. We used to make these products, we know how to make them, so we were keen to help.â You can see more on this onReporting Scotland on BBC One Scotland at 1830. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's national clinical director does not think that easing the lockdown will be achieved by relaxing rules for younger people first. Prof Jason Leitch was responding to a suggestion by Sir David Spiegelhalter of  Cambrige University. ""We certainly aren't ruling anything out, but it feels like such a difficult thing to do for society that I don't think it will be top of the list of things to do,"" Prof Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""But I can understand why public health professionals like him should absolutely enter the debate about what we should or shouldn't do."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's national clinical director has pleaded with the public not to think they can start ""doing more"" outside their homes. ""The data does suggest there is a small increase in car traffic - we are not quite sure why that is,"" Prof Jason Leitch told BBC Radio Scotland. People have warned against anything other than 'essential' travel ""Right at the beginning, we said, 'if your life is normal, you have misunderstood'. And now I think we're saying, 'if your life is changing, you have misunderstood'. ""If you think you can do more, you have misunderstood where we are in this pandemic curve, because we are not out of it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prof Jason Leitch was responding to a BBC Radio Scotland listener who said she had been left in pain because of a lack of lignocaine treatment after the health service concentrated on treating Covid-19 cases and emergencies. ""Because of our good work, the health service has not been overwhelmed and we are beginning to think and plan about what we will be reintroducing,"" he said. Prof Leitch stressed that those suffering chronic pain and cancer would be among the first to see treatment resume but warned that ""we won't see anything like a normal service for a long time"".

Fiona WalkerBBC Scotland Dr Malcolm Sim There may be no known cure for coronavirus as yet, but people all over the world are working hard to find treatments. BBC Scotland was given access to NHS trials at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Glasgow today where they are trying new and existing drugs to see if they can help save lives. âI suspect thereâs not going to be a magic bullet that makes people better from Covid,â says Dr Malcolm Sim, an intensive care consultant. âBut it could be that different treatments given at the right time affect different aspects of the disease process.â Fiona Young has recovered from Covid-19 We also talked to Fiona Young, a Zumba teacher, who has been through the disease. âItâs scary to know you canât just take a pill,â she says. âYou would feel so much better. It would be such a relief if you could take something.â The studies are looking at quicker recovery times, whether patients can avoid intensive care or being put on a ventilator. Ultimately, they hope to save lives. âWe have no proven treatments that definitely work at the moment. So hereâs hoping. Dr Malcolm Sim, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Reality Check Having set a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April, the government now says it reached 122,347 tests on Wednesday (the last day of the month). The government had been averaging around 20,000 tests a day but this increased significantly over the last week. When home testing kits became a significant part of the testing strategy last week, the Department of Health began counting those sent out as part of its daily test figures. So, it doesnât mean the test was actually used by someone on that day - or even received. Previously, only instances in which the swab had been processed through a lab were counted as a test. But the new definition - added on 27 April - included tests ""posted to an individual at home"". On 29 April, the definition was extended yet further to also encompass ""tests sent to... satellite testing locations"". According to figures released on 30 April, home testing kits accounted for over 18,000 of the daily tests, or a quarter of the total. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suggestion that the UK is ""past the peak"" of the Covid-19 outbreak has been described as premature by Scotland's national clinical director. ""I think it is really, really dangerous and tricky language to use,"" Prof Jason Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland. Echoing today's view from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, he says: ""I think we are on the peak. I think we are in that process of turning a corner. Think of Ben Nevis to Arthur's Seat. I think we are on Arthur's Seat and coming down the other side, just, but it is very fragile. ""I think the Prime Minister and the three first ministers have done their best to be open with the country. His language is more flowery than mine, but that is Boris Johnson rather than right or wrong."" However, Prof Leitch adds that ""any suggestion that you can go out this weekend and behave any differently from last week is absolutely wrong. Of that, I am certain."" UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says increasing testing is only the first part of the government's approach, and it will now move towards track and tracing steps. Mr Hancock says tracking who has the virus and who they have been in contact with will drive the infection rate down, and ""the lower it is the more effective it will be"". ""Our goal must be freedom,"" says the health secretary. ""We will not lift measures until it is safe to do so, but we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom."" Follow therest of the briefing here. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Expanding the amount oftesting for Covid-19 in Scotland's care homescould not have been announced earlier than today because the capacity was not there in the system, Scottish Care chief executive Donald Maskill insists. Dr Macaskill admitted the number of deaths in Scottish care homes ""were extremely distressing"" and that ""clearly there will be lessons to be learned and we will do things differently in the future"" as ""we have been overtaken by the global shortage in PPE"". However, he told BBC Radio Scotland that politicians, care providers and frontline workers were doing their best and stressed that ""we also have to remember that the vast majority - over 80% - of even people in their 90s who develop this disease still go on to survive"". ""Even individuals who are receiving end of life treatment can go on and beat this virus,"" he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has just started the UK government's daily coronavirus briefing. He says a further 739 people have died since yesterday, bringing the total across all sectors in the UK to 27,510. He also says the government met its target of 100,000 tests by the end of April, reporting that 122,347 tests were carried out yesterday. You can follow thewhole briefing here. Since lockdown began a debate has been ongoing around cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR is an emergency treatment that tries to restart a person's heart or breathing and its most important components are chest compressions to pump blood around the body, and rescue breaths to provide oxygen, often referred to as the 'kiss of life'. Since the lockdown began health officials have recommended not to use mouth-to-mouth CPR because of the risk of catching a potentially high dosage of Covid-19. But, according to the Resuscitation Council UK, chest compressions are still permitted for members of the public, provided they follow the correct steps. Readmore here. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Today's announcement that testing in care homes is to be expanded to all residents and staff that have one confirmed case of Covid-19""will make an inordinate difference"" according to Scottish Care chief executive Dr Donald Macaskill. ""Scottish Care was calling for this on Wednesday, so we're absolutely delighted,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I agree with the first minister that testing is not a panacea, but it is an additional tool in our battle against coronavirus."" Dr Macaskill, whose body represents the independent care
sector, pointed out that growing evidence shows that, if there is one case, other residents or staff could be infected with the virus, even if they are not yet showing symptoms. ""The announcement will go a long way to give assurance to families and other residents and staff,"" he added. Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News Police Scotland is receiving more calls from the public despite the coronavirus lockdown. A Scottish Police Authority paper revealed there was an initial drop in the volume in the days after the restrictions were introduced. But a report, by Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs for theAudit Risk & Assurance Committee,external, said: ""Call volume
has however increased, and is now higher than average in
comparison to last year with a large amount of these calls from
members of the public looking for advice and guidance on the new
Covid regulations."" At the weekend it emergedrecorded crime in Scotlandis down more than a quarter since 23 March. But public nuisance type incidents - mainly people reporting breaches of social distancing guidelines - have more than doubled compared to this time last year. Looking ahead, the report noted: ""Police Scotland is preparing for the medium and longer term implications of Covid-19 and the possible impacts of a number of scenarios e.g. warmer weather or continuation, relaxation or cessation of current social distancing measures.""

"A return to how life was at the start of 2020 is some way off. Even when lockdown restrictions are eased, coronavirus will affect our lives in many ways. What will struggle to get back to how it was before, and what might change for ever? Twelve BBC correspondents offer their thoughts. From Zooming clients to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups, digital platforms have become the only way for many of us to work, get fit or be educated and entertained. We're more relaxed about screen time hours for us and our kids, a huge culture shift from just a few weeks ago. It feels unlikely that'll disappear overnight. We now know the infrastructure can cope, on the whole. There have been wobbles, likeMonday's Virgin Media outage,but broadband providers and mobile phone networks have handled the big surge in traffic. In March, BT said it was""well within manageable limits"",and it is still intending toroll out ultrafast full-fibre broadbandto 227 rural communities across the UK in coming months. Going forward, with lines between home and work blurred like never before, we'll need to think carefully about which platforms we use and what we say on them. Still, video conferencing, once the poor relation to face-to-face meetings in the corporate world, is - for the moment - the norm. Remember that meme: ""This meeting could have been an email""? Perhaps it's finally within reach. Retail was already having a tough time.The lockdown and its ripple effectswill speed up the huge structural changes under way in our High Streets. It's now all about survival of the fittest. Businesses in good financial health, and able to give customers what they want, will prosper. But weaker players - already grappling with falling sales, rising costs and intense competition - will fall by the wayside during the next 18 months. But there's also a more immediate question. How many outlets will reopen at all? Some small firms may simply run out of cash and throw in the towel. Some larger retailers are also in administration. Many others will be looking at the profitability of stores and whether theycould hand the keys back to landlords. After lockdown, there'll be an immediate sales bounce and stores are likely to lower prices to shift stock. But it may be short-lived if people have been made redundant and are unable to spend. Fashion relies heavily on shoppers with spare cash and many of us will have endured the past weeks buying hardly any clothes at all - and survived! It will be interesting to see if shoppers rethink their habits and priorities. Covid-19 is the greatest shock to business for a century. Emergency measures forced on reluctant companies will form part of future thinking. Questions such as ""do we need large city office space with staff relying on crowded public transport?"" will be asked. Home-working could make the rush hour history, which might then affect property values in satellite ""commuter towns"". Staff will also demand more from employers in terms of flexibility, facilities and safety at work. Companies may start hoarding cashto survive another crisis. Just as the banks became permanently less profitable after the 2007-08 financial crash - because they were forced to hold more base capital before lending - firms post-Covid-19 could be less inclined to invest. That will stifle growth. The digital transformation of business will get faster, with more automation and artificial intelligence to approve loans, profile customers, control stock and improve delivery. Supply chains will be shorter, more resilient and possibly more local - but there are pluses and minuses to that. Economic nationalism, when governments try to protect their economies by cutting imports and investments from other nations, is popular right now - but some warn it results in a selfish and damaging ""beggar thy neighbour"" approach. Finally, international institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization and the European Union may be challenged to up their games - or go away. We all hope for a return to business as usual. It's not going to happen. Someairlines might not survive this crisis.Others could perish in the aftermath. And those that come through it will be smaller. There will be,at least in the medium term, fewer flights.That trend will be driven by people and businesses having less money to spend and video conferencing becoming the new norm. Initially, there may also be nervousness about flying in the wake of a global pandemic. Thermal imaging cameras, which check your temperature as you walk through,could become commonplace at airportsand even railway stations to try to reassure passengers and staff. A smaller aviation market means ticket prices could rise. After weeks of staying at home many of us will be itching to travel, but global travel by plane, train or boat might have to change. For example, EasyJet says itplans to initially leave middle seats emptyso passengers aren't too close to each other - and tickets for a plane with lots of empty seats will be more expensive. The number of people on trains, tubes and tramsis likely to be lower than at pre-crisis levels,as some work will continue to be done at home. The daily commute isn't great for social distancing and rail bosses are working out how to manage things when the government eases restrictions. Independent and green modes of transport such as cycling and,once legalised, electric scootersshould become more popular - although some commuters might jump in the car. The school day normally has its own rhythm and routine punctuated by lessons, bells and breaks. Now more than 90% of the planet's children are out of classes,according to United Nations agency Unesco.,externalThe disruption will ripple for years. Teaching has moved online, with digital lessons on a scale never seen - highlighting concerns that digital poverty is locking children out of learning. Even in a major economy such as the UK, a significant minority don't have ready access to a device of their own, which they can use for schoolwork. Ofcom estimates that 59% of 12 to 15-year-olds have their own tablet,while 83%  have a smartphone. However, some disadvantaged teenagers in England will be able to borrow laptops to help them study at home,thanks to help from the Department for Education.This temporary solution may need to become long term though, which is one legacy of this pandemic. UK universities face other challenges. They're globally connected and have successfully marketed the value of a British degree around the world. Mainland China alone is used to sending 120,000 students to the UK each year. That number will fall, as will numbers from other countries. The appetite to study far from family will not be as strong as it once was. Research by the University and College Union,externalsuggests the combination of an immediate drop in international students this year, and UK students deciding to delay or not enrol at all, could cost universities Â£2.5bn and lead to 30,000 job losses. Sweet air and tranquil roads - in the grimmest of circumstances, the coronavirus lockdown offers a sense of how a greener world might feel. Levels of the gas nitrogen dioxide, linked to a wide range of health conditions, fell across parts of China andEurope as traffic flows diminished.And the rise of online meetings has shown what can be achieved without travel and has saved lots of carbon in the process. What happens next though is open to question. One scenario is that the world repeats the fossil fuel frenzy that followed the banking crisis, unleashing pent-up demand for oil and coal. Governments know this response well as a method to revive flagging economies. Another option is for a more sustainable recovery, with policies to encourage a low-carbon future. This would see determined pushes for renewable energy, public transport and home energy efficiency. It was meant to be a big year to try to halt the damage we're doing to the natural world and to cut the gasesdriving up temperatures to dangerous levels.That agenda, and the tough choices needed, might not be getting much attention - but they have not gone away. In fact, the pandemic has shown us how governments can act when they need to - and how willingly people can respond. The issue is whether a similar drive can be directed to what the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres calls the""deeper emergency"" of the environment. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly famously said: ""Some people believe football is a matter of life and death... it is much, much more important than that."" He was joking, of course, but now, more than ever, football's relevance has been put into perspective. However, sport is a serious pleasure for many. It supports an industry employing hundreds of thousands and has been affected like never before. Eventshave fallen like dominoes.Some, like the Olympics, have been postponed, while others, like Wimbledon, have been cancelled completely. Training schedules have been ripped up and staff furloughed. Players are taking wage cuts and broadcasters are warning of lost earnings in the hundreds of millions. In future, social distancing will be a massive headache for sporting governing bodies. How can close contact physical sports, like rugby, continue? Even playing behind closed doors presents a myriad of problems. An English Premier League football season without a champion was once unthinkable, but now the campaignhangs in the balance.Even if sport can return this year, the global recession likely to follow will surely affect business for years, especially in areas liketransfer fees, wages, broadcast deals and prize money. For millions of fans, weekends are now very different. Moments of unbelievable effort and sporting talent often ripple through the nation, providing collective ""did you see it?"" experiences. The future of sport, without those moments and the fans to watch, looks very different indeed. The arts sector is split 50-50 about the post-pandemic future, between the optimists and the pessimists. The upbeat half think the UK arts scene will come back stronger than ever, providing an eager population with longed-for shared experiences and feel-good content. Cinemas, theatres, concert halls, museums and galleries will thrive on a flowering of creativity, a response to the dark days of the virus. Plus, there will be new converts who discovered all that splendid free arts contentmade available onlineduring lockdown. The One Man Two Guvnors stage production was streamed for free online by the National Theatre The pessimists fear grassroots venues- historical suppliers of fresh talent - will perish in a new era of austerity budgets. Local councils will sell off artworks, and thousands of jobs will be lost. A sector once known for dynamism and imagination will become conservative and risk-averse. I suspect the reality will settle somewhere between the two. The post-lockdown transition from closed to bustling venues won't be straightforward. Social distancing is likely to limit activity. Producers will need time to rehearse and finish productions. There'll also be size limits on film and TV crews making new content. Reruns could be a staple for a while. But let's not forget the UK's creative industries have long been strong economic driving forces. They are world renowned and full of talented individuals. It's going to be tough, but I'd back the arts and entertainment sector to not only keep us amused and intellectually sustained, but also to lead from the front. It's generally accepted the experience of living through the 1930s depression and World War Two shaped the so-called Greatest Generation - a cohort of Britons noted for resilience, prudence, humility, work ethic and sense of duty. They are qualities people see in the Queen and in 100-year-old Captain Tom Moore,who marched up and down his gardenfor the NHS. It's hoped the Thursday night clapping for key workers is the sound of a nation discovering itself again and, denied the luxury of self-indulgence, our eyes are opened to what really matters. Lockdown, it is said, hasunblocked a spring of neighbourlinessthat will flow long after restrictions are lifted. Perhaps. But our suspended life in lockdown could be incubating a grievance that, when released, triggers angry questions, a search for blame, and demands for reprisals. Economic hardship will strain social ties. That's the real test for this generation - not ""can we keep our temper in lockdown?"" but ""can we quietly repair our social fabric in the tough times?"". The fear is that our behavioural norms will have become infected by distress and hardship, that we will emerge more individual and less together. The hope must be that our society, like a virus, is mutating into something stronger. ""This pandemic has shone a spotlight on the overlooked and undervalued corners of society."" The words of the director of the World Health Organization in Europe, Dr Hans Kluge, as he described the shocking death toll in care homes across the continent. His sentiment will chime with many who have constantly warned about the looming care crisis in the UK, particularly in England. An ageing population, years of underfunding, low pay, staff shortages and the failure of successive governments to reform the system, has left the sector on its knees. Many staff looking after older and disabled people - in care homes and in the community - will say they felt forgotten when the pandemic first took hold. The focus on the NHS was not surprising, but they were caring for those particularly vulnerable to the virus. Thestruggle to get protective equipment,andslowness of testing in the community in England,have become symbols of their distress. Questions will be asked about the apparent failure to prioritise support to the care front-line, and what it may have cost in lives. Then, we'll have a choice to make. Do we recognise, value and fund a properly integrated system that provides support in the community? Or, as our memories become hazy, will we again allow the importance of this type of care to fade into the background? Even before Covid-19 claimed its first victim,the US-China trade war was threatening the progress of globalisation. International supply chains bring perks - more choice, lower prices and, for some, higher incomes - but also job losses in the higher-wage West. This pandemic has exposed other vulnerabilities. There's the reliance on three countries - the US, China and Germany -to provide 40% of personal protective gear,external, and also businesses' dependency on single sources for vital components. There'll be a rethink of what products are ""strategic"", key to a nation's survival. They might be produced closer to home or alternative suppliers sought. But key to a recovery will be job creation and keeping down living costs. The former means that, however uneasy, governments may have to tolerate China's continued investment around the globe. As for the latter, businesses need to keep costs low, and overseas sourcing of non-essential will continue. Some of the biggest brands, including H&M, have committed to helping workers in factories thousands of miles away to keep supply chains functioning. Those companies were already looking beyond China to lower cost nations such as Vietnam, Ethiopia and Bangladesh - countries which will work even harder to attract foreign customers. China's factories are firing back up, but who's buying? Currently, demand from locked-down customers has slumped. Tradecould drop by a third this year.But it will bounce back, globalisation will continue - and the competition to be the world's production line will intensify. Catastrophe inevitably produces new priorities, even if old geo-political tensions remain. The pandemic has demonstrated, yet again, that global questions require global solutions. But it has also shown that governments' first responses have been national. China and the UShave squared up to each otherover Beijing's responsibility for the pandemic, nations have closed borders, and there has beenunseemly competition for medical resources. Multinational organisations have fared poorly. The EU apologised to Italy for its limited support and President Trump attacked the World Health Organization for being too close to Beijing. Those who see these building blocks of global order as outdated have more ammunition. Beijing's position is contradictory. It's the source of the virus and the global provider of much of the equipment to fight it, so expect the ""China problem"" to be a focus for Western governments. How do they rely less on Chinese goods and resist Beijing's efforts to get the world to play by its rules - while still pursuing co-operation on problems like climate change and, yes, future pandemics? There'll be a lot less money in defence budgets for shiny new weaponry - with security being redefined because of the extraordinary weaknesses revealed by the pandemic. National security capability will be judged by stockpiled medical equipment and preparedness for the next pandemic or environmental catastrophe, not just on how many tank brigades can be deployed.

"Deborah Braham seen wearing a homemade visor following an ""extraordinary"" response to her appeal A doctor who urged volunteers to make visors for NHS staff due to a shortage at her hospital says she is ""overwhelmed"" by the response. More than 75,000 face shields have been produced just weeks after Deborah Braham appealed for help on WhatsApp. The Visor Army project spread on social media and has found support among high-profile TV and fashion celebrities. It comes after a BBC investigation found the government failed to buy protective kit to cope with a pandemic. Panoramarevealed this week there were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bagsin the government's stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK. Some NHS staff say they are being put at risk because of the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). The government said it has taken the right steps and is doing everything it can to increase stocks while the NHS trust which manages Hammersmith Hospital in west London, where Dr Braham is based, said it was grateful to community groups for their support. Dr Braham, a consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine, first put out a call to friends on WhatsApp with instructions that had been passed on to her on how to make visors. ""I just thought it would be something they could do with their kids, stuck at home, like an activity but helping at the same time,"" she told the BBC. Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags NHS dashboard to predict protective gear shortages NHS doctor who pleaded for PPE dies To begin with, a handful of people got involved, buying their own materials from craft shops, making the visors at home and delivering them to Dr Braham's house. Then, as word spread, the number of volunteers - and visors - grew. A Facebook group - calledVisor Army - Make A Visor. Save A Hero,external- was set up on 1 April to channel interest from members of the public. ""Initially it was just people I knew who came on board, then it was people I didn't know,"" Dr Braham said. ""Within a short time this whole thing had grown so big with so many people wanting to help. ""It's given a lot of people a real sense of purpose and contribution in what are very difficult times. It's been a real community effort and I cannot thank these people enough."" The home-made visors are stored and sanitised at a collection point... ...before being distributed to hospitals and other health care facilities The visors are made from acetate, foam and elastic and the operation relies on donations to cover the cost of materials.

LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The project has also picked up support from a number of celebrities, including TV presenter Jonathan Ross, Fred Sirieix of Channel 4's First Dates, and The Apprentice star Claude Littner, as well as acclaimed hatmaker Philip Treacy. ""Philip Treacy was really keen,"" Dr Braham said, ""and when we had issues with the design he gave us advice, which was very helpful. After Philip, other milliners got on board, including the British Hat Guild. ""They should have been doing London Hat Week but instead they're making visors."" Allow Twitter content?

The visors are stored at a facility where they are sanitised before being delivered to some 13 hospitals in London and south-east England, as well as doctors' surgeries and care homes. Dr Braham said around 50,000 have been used so far. The importance of visors to medics lies in the fact that, unlike medical goggles, they provide protection for the whole of the face. Without them, doctors and nurses are at high risk of being contaminated by aerosolised particles containing the virus during procedures such as intubation or when they are caring for patients on ventilators. The lack of visors mean in some cases medics have been re-using rather than discarding them after single use, as is generally considered good practice. Dr Braham is now trying to launch a similar drive to make much-needed medical gowns - a protective garment worn over scrubs - something she says is more expensive and would require many more volunteers. Suitable fabric is also in short supply. The homemade visors are being used in hospitals, doctors' surgeries and care homes The Visor Army project is one of a number of grassroots initiatives to make PPE which have sprung up since the coronavirus crisis erupted. Schools and colleges have used 3D printers to make components for visors, while other community groups have been making visors, as well as sewing scrubs, or protective clothing worn by medics and health workers.

"This video can not be played WATCH: 'One of two things happened' US President Donald Trump has appeared to undercut his own intelligence agencies by suggesting he has seen evidence coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. Earlier the US national intelligence director's office said it was still investigating how the virus began. But the office said it had determined Covid-19 ""was not manmade or genetically modified"". China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19. Since emerging in China last year, the virus has killed 230,000 people worldwide including 63,000 in the US. Simple ways you can help during the pandemic Has US tested more than rest of world combined? The pandemic has seen at least 3.2 million people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan. At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: ""Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?"" ""Yes, I have. Yes, I have,"" said the president, without specifying. ""And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China."" Asked later to clarify his comment, he said:  ""I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that."" This video can not be played Michigan protesters decry Covid-19 state of emergency He also told reporters: ""Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose? ""I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer."" Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on,unnamed officials told NBC News.,external In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the ""wide scientific consensus"" regarding Covid-19's natural origins. Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release idea? China and the US trade coronavirus conspiracy theories ""The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan."" It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory. Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats. The foundation of the Wuhan lab boosted China's international prestige Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (Â£35m), the lab opened in 2015.Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon,external, Nature journal reports. It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety Level 4 lab with links to similar labs around the world. Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing. On Wednesday, he suggestedChina wanted him to losehis re-election bid in November. He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body. Can we trust China claims of virus success? China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. According to the Washington Post,the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially,external. Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations. In January,he called US intelligence agencies ""naive"" on Iranand dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election in 2016, when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign. Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despiteUS charges brought against Russian citizens. President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead. Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight. China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game. Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.

"The government will release a series of papers next week outlining its approach on how to safely and gradually restart the economy. It invited submissions by Thursday from businesses, trade bodies, unions and other workers representatives on how best to slowly restart the UK economy. It's thought the proposals will not be split bluntly by sector but by working environment. But there is no confirmed date yet for when such a restart will occur. Unions, large firms and business groups have been consulted on seven areas: Outdoor work - including agriculture, construction and energy Non-food retail - high street Transport and logistics Manufacturing - including food processing and engineering Indoor work - offices, laboratories, call centres Work in the home - plumbers, painters and decorators, carers Hospitality and leisure - pubs clubs restaurants cinemas theatres The position papers are expected to comprise a set of broad guidelines based on these discussions, which will not be too prescriptive as to be inflexible, and given it would be impossible to examine individual premises, it's thought companies will be allowed to self-certify they are in compliance with the guidelines. The government wants to involve unions and the Health and Safety executive to endorse the plans and to both get buy-in from workers, and provide a channel for any worker concerns at the new arrangements. The principles may not necessarily insist that workers strictly observe a two-metre social distancing rule. In situations where workers may be required to be closer than two metres, the guidelines may insist on mitigating measures such as wearing protective masks or clothing, or where possible work back-to-back, rather than face-to-face. Union sources say these are very early principles and would not, on their own, create a satisfactory basis for a return to work. They have said much more detailed technical work will be required. There are some sectors which the government has acknowledged will be unable to function at any significant level for many weeks and possibly months to come, in particular hospitality and leisure. AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Simon Emeny, the boss of Fullers, which operates 400 pubs and restaurants, has told the BBC that reopening under social distancing rules would be worse than staying closed. ""Think of the practical problems of going to the loo, being served at the bar, a plate of food at your table. Also few people would want to come,"" he said. ""It would mean our revenue would be down by as much as 80%, but our costs would go up, so it's actually more catastrophic to open under socially distant guidelines than it is being closed down."" That means there will be some very serious questions for the Treasury, on how long it is willing or able to continue to pay millions of furloughed workers wages, under a job retention scheme that some estimate is currently costing up to a billion pounds a day. Coronavirus: Fewer loans approved as firms rush to get lifeline Wetherspoons plans to open pubs in June BA may not reopen at Gatwick once pandemic passes There is also the question of how much demand there will be for the products and services the reopened businesses will produce and provide. Car factories and showrooms may reopen - but how many people are in the mood for a big ticket purchase like that right now. Industry bodies accept that returning to work will be a difficult and delicate exercise - both operationally for business and emotionally for many workers. Union leaders have told the BBC there are isolated incidents in which some of their members who have already returned to work have been subjected to abuse from people in their own community, fearful workers could be bringing the virus back with them from their places of work. The government has paid tribute to the public for largely adhering to a simple and often repeated message: ""stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"". It has very effectively drummed in a mindset of risk aversion. That messaging may prove hard to ""refine"", as the government has put it. Closing the gates and furloughing millions of workers was a huge, but widely considered necessary government intervention into the private sector. Opening the gates again may prove to be one of the most complex challenges this virus has thrown at us yet.

"Many polled say they are obeying government advice due to fears of catching the virus When lockdown first started in the UK in the final week of March there was widespread support for the measures aimed at controlling the coronavirus. But have attitudes changed? The country is currently in its seventh week of the greatest curbs on daily life since World War Two. The prime minister says the government will proceed with ""maximum caution""regarding easing restrictions, when he speaks to the country on Sunday evening.However, surveys suggest a significant majority of the British public believe they could cope with the restrictions for another couple of months. A new YouGov poll,externalfinds eight in 10 Britons (82%) reckon they could easily continue with the current lockdown until June. Almost two-thirds (63%) say they would manage well until July, but 50% say they would struggle if they were still stuck indoors until August. For the moment, there is not a public clamour for lockdown to end. Another recent poll showed many would be uncomfortable leaving home, even if restrictions were lifted in a month's time. More than 60% would be uncomfortable about going out to bars and restaurants or using public transport,the Ipsos Mori survey suggested.,external More than 40% would still be reluctant to go shopping or send their children to school and more than 30% would be worried about going to work or meeting friends. The vast majority of people in the UK are obeying the lockdown rules - not because they have been ordered to by the government but because they don't want to catch or spread the virus. Very few actively like being in lockdown, though. Responses to a series of surveys over the last month suggest the country has gone from apprehension at the start through to dejection as the economy shrank and the death toll mounted. People have moved on to frustration in the most recent analysis as restrictions begin to grind and reality dawns as to how long they may last. More people are on the roads than at the beginning of lockdown There is no question that lockdown places a significant strain on households, but is the increasing frustration and boredom translating into exasperation?  Are we reaching the point where people will start to ignore the rules? Some newspapers and politicians have been suggesting the social distancing restrictions are beginning to fray, but the evidence points to a high level of compliance remaining. There have been reports of a slight increase in numbers using their cars, but it is not clear what the reason for that might be.  In part, it may be because more businesses are finding ways to open up and people are returning to work. During the sunny Easter period more people returned to parks and green spaces,Google data suggests,external, although police said the vast majority sought to obey social distancing rules and activity was still well below pre-lockdown levels. Boris Johnson says UK is past the peak of the outbreak How will coronavirus change the way we live? Analysis of surveys conducted by King's College in London suggests there are three broad groups when it comes to lockdown: accepting, suffering and resisting. Just under half of people - 48% - are characterised as accepting, following the rules and coping reasonably well.  At 44%, slightly fewer say they are struggling, often losing sleep, feeling anxious or depressed, but still overwhelmingly trying to obey all the rules. The remaining 9% are resistant to the lockdown, with many of those believing too much fuss is being made about the virus and admitting they are less likely to follow the restrictions. Younger people were more than twice as likely as over 65s to say they were not coping with lockdown People tend to think social isolation will be most difficult for older people, but the survey evidence suggests the opposite is true.  A survey conducted for insight company Britain Thinks finds 42% of 18-24-year-olds say they were not coping with lockdown, more than twice the proportion of those aged over 65. Older people, of course, are likely to have seen less of a change to their lifestyle than the young.  Their housing and income are likely to be more secure.  Their social lives are less about going out to crowded bars and clubs, festivals and sports events. Women appear to be struggling more than men in lockdown, perhaps a consequence of the tendency for them to take on a greater share of domestic responsibilities. Unsurprisingly, poorer people are finding it tougher than those on higher incomes. About 20% of people are worried about their mental health in lockdown, with 11% concerned about anxiety and 7% with concerns about depression, according to a survey conducted for the Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity MQ. The behavioural science that forms part of the government's thinking on the lockdown warned before the restrictions came in that people would struggle to stick to the rules for prolonged periods. However, experts have been struck by how compliant the British public have remained. Other countries, notably the US, have seenvery public rebellions against the restrictions, but here the call to stay home to protect the NHS and save lives seems to have been greeted with very widespread and consistent support.

"People living in more deprived areas of England and Wales are more likely to die with coronavirus than those in more affluent places, new figures suggest. Office for National Statistics analysis,externalshows there were 55 deaths for every 100,000 people in the poorest parts of England, compared with 25 in the wealthiest areas. Mortality rates are normally higher in poorer areas. But the ONS said coronavirus appeared to be adding to the problem. ""This is something that we are worried about and looking at,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Hancock said his department was looking into the various ways the virus impacts different groups to understand it ""as much as we possibly can"". How many confirmed cases are there in your area? How deadly is the coronavirus? Ethnic breakdown of London deaths revealed 'We go hungry so we can feed our children' Across the country, the highest rates of deaths have been in urban areas where lots of people live. The overall mortality rate in London has been almost double that of the next highest region. The data also shows the Covid-19 mortality rate in the most deprived areas of England has been higher among men, with 76.7 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 39.6 per 100,000 women. ""General mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas, but so far Covid-19 appears to be taking them higher still,"" said Nick Stripe, ONS head of health analysis. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the report showed the virus thrived on inequality. ""Ministers must target health inequalities with an overarching strategy to tackle the wider social determinants of ill-health,"" he said. The ONS used the Index of Multiple Deprivation, a relative measure of poverty last updated in 2019. The index takes into account factors such as an area's income, employment, crime and health deprivation and disability. The ONS studied the 20,283 deaths involving Covid-19 that took place between 1 March and 17 April. In England, it found the mortality rate in the most deprived areas was 55.1 deaths per 100,000 population, while the rate was 25.3 deaths per 100,000 in the least deprived areas. In Wales, statisticians found the most deprived fifth of areas had a mortality rate of 44.6 deaths per 100,000 population, almost twice as high as the rate for the least deprived areas of 23.2 deaths per 100,000. It also found: South-west England had the lowest Covid-19 mortality rate, with 16.4 deaths per 100,000 population The council areas with the highest Covid-19 mortality rates were all in London. Newham had the highest rate with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent at 141.5 and Hackney at 127.4 David Finch, a senior fellow at the Health Foundation, said people in deprived areas were at higher risk of exposure to Covid-19 because they were likely to live in cramped housing conditions. He said those people were also more likely to have one or more long-term health condition, meaning they would be at greater risk of suffering severe symptoms from the virus if exposed. Chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's Javed Khan said the ONS study was ""worrying"" but ""unfortunately not surprising"". ""Vulnerable children and families - and those already experiencing disadvantage - risk becoming the forgotten victims,"" he added. ""Without intervention, this crisis will be devastating for a whole generation - their mental health, safety, education and job prospects are on the line."" In a statement, the government said it had commissioned urgent work from Public Health England to understand the different factors that could influence the way someone was affected by the virus and would set out more details in due course.

"Gordon Park was found guilty in 2005 and killed himself in prison in 2010 Three senior judges have rejected a posthumous appeal against the conviction of Gordon Park, the so-called ""Lady in the Lake"" killer. The body of his wife Carol was found in Coniston Water in the Lake District in 1997, 21 years after she disappeared. Park was convicted of murder in 2005 and killed himself in prison in 2010. The case, brought by his son, Jeremy Park, was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, which said there was ""no reason to doubt the safety of the conviction"". The family said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision. Carol Park's body was found 21 years after she disappeared from Leece in Cumbria The appeal was referred to the court by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) and argued the Crown Prosecution Service did not disclose evidence in the trial which would have undermined the credibility of a prison inmate, who claimed Park had confessed to his wife's murder. It also cast doubt on the prosecution's claim Park's ice axe might have been the murder weapon, citing two dental experts who agreed it could not have caused injuries to his wife's teeth. However, the court said the evidence in the case was ""very strong"". Mr Justice Sweeney, who delivered the ruling, said: ""We have no doubt as to the safety of the conviction."" Analysis -Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent It's a tough task to overturn a conviction, especially when an appeal has already failed, as it did in this case in 2008. This most recent appeal relied on new expert evidence and the prosecution's failure to disclose certain material. The three judges weighed it up carefully but Mr Justice Sweeney's meticulous 81-page ruling is crystal clear that it didn't come close to denting the ""very strong"" circumstantial evidence against Park. It will surely prove to be the final word on the murder of the Lady in the Lake. Mrs Park was 30 when she vanished from Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness, in July 1976. Her husband did not report her disappearance for six weeks, claiming she had gone to live with another man. The mother of three's remains were found by amateur divers in 1997, wrapped in bags and tied with rope. Park was charged with her murder, but the case was dropped in 1998. However, following fresh evidence he was found guilty at Manchester Crown Court in 2005, and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 15 years. Park, who always maintained his innocence, hanged himself in his cell on his 66th birthday in January 2010. Gordon and Carol Park were married for nine years CCRC lawyers told a hearing in November 2019 that prosecution lawyers had failed to share evidence with the defence at Park's trial, casting doubt on the safety of his conviction. However, the Court of Appeal dismissed the case, citing the length of time it took Park to report his wife missing, his failure to contact friends or family about her, and that he made no attempt to check the joint bank account or put a stop on it. He had also failed to make the usual child care arrangements at the beginning of term when his wife, a teacher, would have gone back to work. There was also evidence that Park, the owner of a sailing dinghy, had skills in all the sailing knots used to tie the body, and knowledge of the area of the lake where the body was dumped. A statement issued on behalf of his family said: ""The family, friends and supporters of Gordon Park, and Carol Park's children, are disappointed with today's decision. ""Having exhausted all options, we are now left without the closure we were all hoping for. ""The judgment marks the end of our fight to clear his name.""

"A return to how life was at the start of 2020 is some way off. Even when lockdown restrictions are eased, coronavirus will affect our lives in many ways. What will struggle to get back to how it was before, and what might change for ever? Twelve BBC correspondents offer their thoughts. From Zooming clients to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups, digital platforms have become the only way for many of us to work, get fit or be educated and entertained. We're more relaxed about screen time hours for us and our kids, a huge culture shift from just a few weeks ago. It feels unlikely that'll disappear overnight. We now know the infrastructure can cope, on the whole. There have been wobbles, likeMonday's Virgin Media outage,but broadband providers and mobile phone networks have handled the big surge in traffic. In March, BT said it was""well within manageable limits"",and it is still intending toroll out ultrafast full-fibre broadbandto 227 rural communities across the UK in coming months. Going forward, with lines between home and work blurred like never before, we'll need to think carefully about which platforms we use and what we say on them. Still, video conferencing, once the poor relation to face-to-face meetings in the corporate world, is - for the moment - the norm. Remember that meme: ""This meeting could have been an email""? Perhaps it's finally within reach. Retail was already having a tough time.The lockdown and its ripple effectswill speed up the huge structural changes under way in our High Streets. It's now all about survival of the fittest. Businesses in good financial health, and able to give customers what they want, will prosper. But weaker players - already grappling with falling sales, rising costs and intense competition - will fall by the wayside during the next 18 months. But there's also a more immediate question. How many outlets will reopen at all? Some small firms may simply run out of cash and throw in the towel. Some larger retailers are also in administration. Many others will be looking at the profitability of stores and whether theycould hand the keys back to landlords. After lockdown, there'll be an immediate sales bounce and stores are likely to lower prices to shift stock. But it may be short-lived if people have been made redundant and are unable to spend. Fashion relies heavily on shoppers with spare cash and many of us will have endured the past weeks buying hardly any clothes at all - and survived! It will be interesting to see if shoppers rethink their habits and priorities. Covid-19 is the greatest shock to business for a century. Emergency measures forced on reluctant companies will form part of future thinking. Questions such as ""do we need large city office space with staff relying on crowded public transport?"" will be asked. Home-working could make the rush hour history, which might then affect property values in satellite ""commuter towns"". Staff will also demand more from employers in terms of flexibility, facilities and safety at work. Companies may start hoarding cashto survive another crisis. Just as the banks became permanently less profitable after the 2007-08 financial crash - because they were forced to hold more base capital before lending - firms post-Covid-19 could be less inclined to invest. That will stifle growth. The digital transformation of business will get faster, with more automation and artificial intelligence to approve loans, profile customers, control stock and improve delivery. Supply chains will be shorter, more resilient and possibly more local - but there are pluses and minuses to that. Economic nationalism, when governments try to protect their economies by cutting imports and investments from other nations, is popular right now - but some warn it results in a selfish and damaging ""beggar thy neighbour"" approach. Finally, international institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization and the European Union may be challenged to up their games - or go away. We all hope for a return to business as usual. It's not going to happen. Someairlines might not survive this crisis.Others could perish in the aftermath. And those that come through it will be smaller. There will be,at least in the medium term, fewer flights.That trend will be driven by people and businesses having less money to spend and video conferencing becoming the new norm. Initially, there may also be nervousness about flying in the wake of a global pandemic. Thermal imaging cameras, which check your temperature as you walk through,could become commonplace at airportsand even railway stations to try to reassure passengers and staff. A smaller aviation market means ticket prices could rise. After weeks of staying at home many of us will be itching to travel, but global travel by plane, train or boat might have to change. For example, EasyJet says itplans to initially leave middle seats emptyso passengers aren't too close to each other - and tickets for a plane with lots of empty seats will be more expensive. The number of people on trains, tubes and tramsis likely to be lower than at pre-crisis levels,as some work will continue to be done at home. The daily commute isn't great for social distancing and rail bosses are working out how to manage things when the government eases restrictions. Independent and green modes of transport such as cycling and,once legalised, electric scootersshould become more popular - although some commuters might jump in the car. The school day normally has its own rhythm and routine punctuated by lessons, bells and breaks. Now more than 90% of the planet's children are out of classes,according to United Nations agency Unesco.,externalThe disruption will ripple for years. Teaching has moved online, with digital lessons on a scale never seen - highlighting concerns that digital poverty is locking children out of learning. Even in a major economy such as the UK, a significant minority don't have ready access to a device of their own, which they can use for schoolwork. Ofcom estimates that 59% of 12 to 15-year-olds have their own tablet,while 83%  have a smartphone. However, some disadvantaged teenagers in England will be able to borrow laptops to help them study at home,thanks to help from the Department for Education.This temporary solution may need to become long term though, which is one legacy of this pandemic. UK universities face other challenges. They're globally connected and have successfully marketed the value of a British degree around the world. Mainland China alone is used to sending 120,000 students to the UK each year. That number will fall, as will numbers from other countries. The appetite to study far from family will not be as strong as it once was. Research by the University and College Union,externalsuggests the combination of an immediate drop in international students this year, and UK students deciding to delay or not enrol at all, could cost universities Â£2.5bn and lead to 30,000 job losses. Sweet air and tranquil roads - in the grimmest of circumstances, the coronavirus lockdown offers a sense of how a greener world might feel. Levels of the gas nitrogen dioxide, linked to a wide range of health conditions, fell across parts of China andEurope as traffic flows diminished.And the rise of online meetings has shown what can be achieved without travel and has saved lots of carbon in the process. What happens next though is open to question. One scenario is that the world repeats the fossil fuel frenzy that followed the banking crisis, unleashing pent-up demand for oil and coal. Governments know this response well as a method to revive flagging economies. Another option is for a more sustainable recovery, with policies to encourage a low-carbon future. This would see determined pushes for renewable energy, public transport and home energy efficiency. It was meant to be a big year to try to halt the damage we're doing to the natural world and to cut the gasesdriving up temperatures to dangerous levels.That agenda, and the tough choices needed, might not be getting much attention - but they have not gone away. In fact, the pandemic has shown us how governments can act when they need to - and how willingly people can respond. The issue is whether a similar drive can be directed to what the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres calls the""deeper emergency"" of the environment. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly famously said: ""Some people believe football is a matter of life and death... it is much, much more important than that."" He was joking, of course, but now, more than ever, football's relevance has been put into perspective. However, sport is a serious pleasure for many. It supports an industry employing hundreds of thousands and has been affected like never before. Eventshave fallen like dominoes.Some, like the Olympics, have been postponed, while others, like Wimbledon, have been cancelled completely. Training schedules have been ripped up and staff furloughed. Players are taking wage cuts and broadcasters are warning of lost earnings in the hundreds of millions. In future, social distancing will be a massive headache for sporting governing bodies. How can close contact physical sports, like rugby, continue? Even playing behind closed doors presents a myriad of problems. An English Premier League football season without a champion was once unthinkable, but now the campaignhangs in the balance.Even if sport can return this year, the global recession likely to follow will surely affect business for years, especially in areas liketransfer fees, wages, broadcast deals and prize money. For millions of fans, weekends are now very different. Moments of unbelievable effort and sporting talent often ripple through the nation, providing collective ""did you see it?"" experiences. The future of sport, without those moments and the fans to watch, looks very different indeed. The arts sector is split 50-50 about the post-pandemic future, between the optimists and the pessimists. The upbeat half think the UK arts scene will come back stronger than ever, providing an eager population with longed-for shared experiences and feel-good content. Cinemas, theatres, concert halls, museums and galleries will thrive on a flowering of creativity, a response to the dark days of the virus. Plus, there will be new converts who discovered all that splendid free arts contentmade available onlineduring lockdown. The One Man Two Guvnors stage production was streamed for free online by the National Theatre The pessimists fear grassroots venues- historical suppliers of fresh talent - will perish in a new era of austerity budgets. Local councils will sell off artworks, and thousands of jobs will be lost. A sector once known for dynamism and imagination will become conservative and risk-averse. I suspect the reality will settle somewhere between the two. The post-lockdown transition from closed to bustling venues won't be straightforward. Social distancing is likely to limit activity. Producers will need time to rehearse and finish productions. There'll also be size limits on film and TV crews making new content. Reruns could be a staple for a while. But let's not forget the UK's creative industries have long been strong economic driving forces. They are world renowned and full of talented individuals. It's going to be tough, but I'd back the arts and entertainment sector to not only keep us amused and intellectually sustained, but also to lead from the front. It's generally accepted the experience of living through the 1930s depression and World War Two shaped the so-called Greatest Generation - a cohort of Britons noted for resilience, prudence, humility, work ethic and sense of duty. They are qualities people see in the Queen and in 100-year-old Captain Tom Moore,who marched up and down his gardenfor the NHS. It's hoped the Thursday night clapping for key workers is the sound of a nation discovering itself again and, denied the luxury of self-indulgence, our eyes are opened to what really matters. Lockdown, it is said, hasunblocked a spring of neighbourlinessthat will flow long after restrictions are lifted. Perhaps. But our suspended life in lockdown could be incubating a grievance that, when released, triggers angry questions, a search for blame, and demands for reprisals. Economic hardship will strain social ties. That's the real test for this generation - not ""can we keep our temper in lockdown?"" but ""can we quietly repair our social fabric in the tough times?"". The fear is that our behavioural norms will have become infected by distress and hardship, that we will emerge more individual and less together. The hope must be that our society, like a virus, is mutating into something stronger. ""This pandemic has shone a spotlight on the overlooked and undervalued corners of society."" The words of the director of the World Health Organization in Europe, Dr Hans Kluge, as he described the shocking death toll in care homes across the continent. His sentiment will chime with many who have constantly warned about the looming care crisis in the UK, particularly in England. An ageing population, years of underfunding, low pay, staff shortages and the failure of successive governments to reform the system, has left the sector on its knees. Many staff looking after older and disabled people - in care homes and in the community - will say they felt forgotten when the pandemic first took hold. The focus on the NHS was not surprising, but they were caring for those particularly vulnerable to the virus. Thestruggle to get protective equipment,andslowness of testing in the community in England,have become symbols of their distress. Questions will be asked about the apparent failure to prioritise support to the care front-line, and what it may have cost in lives. Then, we'll have a choice to make. Do we recognise, value and fund a properly integrated system that provides support in the community? Or, as our memories become hazy, will we again allow the importance of this type of care to fade into the background? Even before Covid-19 claimed its first victim,the US-China trade war was threatening the progress of globalisation. International supply chains bring perks - more choice, lower prices and, for some, higher incomes - but also job losses in the higher-wage West. This pandemic has exposed other vulnerabilities. There's the reliance on three countries - the US, China and Germany -to provide 40% of personal protective gear,external, and also businesses' dependency on single sources for vital components. There'll be a rethink of what products are ""strategic"", key to a nation's survival. They might be produced closer to home or alternative suppliers sought. But key to a recovery will be job creation and keeping down living costs. The former means that, however uneasy, governments may have to tolerate China's continued investment around the globe. As for the latter, businesses need to keep costs low, and overseas sourcing of non-essential will continue. Some of the biggest brands, including H&M, have committed to helping workers in factories thousands of miles away to keep supply chains functioning. Those companies were already looking beyond China to lower cost nations such as Vietnam, Ethiopia and Bangladesh - countries which will work even harder to attract foreign customers. China's factories are firing back up, but who's buying? Currently, demand from locked-down customers has slumped. Tradecould drop by a third this year.But it will bounce back, globalisation will continue - and the competition to be the world's production line will intensify. Catastrophe inevitably produces new priorities, even if old geo-political tensions remain. The pandemic has demonstrated, yet again, that global questions require global solutions. But it has also shown that governments' first responses have been national. China and the UShave squared up to each otherover Beijing's responsibility for the pandemic, nations have closed borders, and there has beenunseemly competition for medical resources. Multinational organisations have fared poorly. The EU apologised to Italy for its limited support and President Trump attacked the World Health Organization for being too close to Beijing. Those who see these building blocks of global order as outdated have more ammunition. Beijing's position is contradictory. It's the source of the virus and the global provider of much of the equipment to fight it, so expect the ""China problem"" to be a focus for Western governments. How do they rely less on Chinese goods and resist Beijing's efforts to get the world to play by its rules - while still pursuing co-operation on problems like climate change and, yes, future pandemics? There'll be a lot less money in defence budgets for shiny new weaponry - with security being redefined because of the extraordinary weaknesses revealed by the pandemic. National security capability will be judged by stockpiled medical equipment and preparedness for the next pandemic or environmental catastrophe, not just on how many tank brigades can be deployed.

"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has cut his pay by 50% for the rest of the year Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said it will take up to six months to refund passengers for flights cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. He told the BBC the airline was struggling to process a backlog of 25 million refunds with reduced staff. However, he pledged: ""If you want a cash refund, you will receive a cash refund."" Ryanair is set to cut 3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce - as it restructures to cope with the coronavirus crisis. It said the 3,000 posts under threat were mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs. There are likely to be pay cuts of up to 20% for remaining staff, the airline added. Mr O'Leary told the BBC that the planned cuts were ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"". He said that if a vaccine was not found, ""we may have to announce more cuts and deeper cuts in future"". Leaving middle seat empty is idiotic, says Ryanair 'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't' Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund? Brian Strutton, the general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""There has been no warning or consultation by Ryanair about the 3,000 potential job losses and this is miserable news for pilots and staff who have taken pay cuts under the government job retention scheme. ""Ryanair seems to have done a U-turn on its ability to weather the Covid storm."" The restructuring could involve closing some UK regional hubs, Mr O'Leary said, but he would not say which ones were at risk. He said Ryanair hoped to announce details of job losses and pay cuts by 1 July. Mr O'Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend it for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021. Litigation lawyer Jonathan Compton, a partner at law firm DMH Stallard, took issue with the idea that ticket refunds could be delayed. ""Where a flight is cancelled, the legal position is clear, the airline must provide a full refund within seven working days,"" he said. ""Regulators need to get more active here. The relevant regulator is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA must start instructing airlines to start making refunds, no ifs or buts, and it needs to do this now."" Ryanair said it expected to report a net loss of more than â¬100m (Â£87m) for the first three months of the year, with further losses in the second quarter. In a sideswipe at rivals, it said its return to scheduled services would be rendered more difficult by competing with flag carrier airlines, ""who will be financing below cost selling with the benefit of over â¬30bn in unlawful state aid, in breach of both EU state aid and competition rules"". Ryanair said it had entered the coronavirus crisis with reserves of almost â¬4bn in cash and continued to ""actively manage"" those resources in order to survive the pandemic. Mr O'Leary described airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France and Alitalia as ""subsidy junkies running around Europe hoovering up state aid"". Meanwhile, Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air is resuming flights from Luton airport starting on Friday, but passengers will be required to wear masks while on board. The airline is among the first European carriers to begin restoring services that have been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. The flights will be heading for destinations in Spain, Portugal, Israel, Slovakia, Serbia, Romania and Hungary. But Wizz Air warned that because of ""rapid changes in travel restrictions, the list might be adapted"". The move comes despite unchanged advice from the Foreign Office against all foreign non-essential travel. In another development, London's Heathrow airport, normally the busiest in Europe, has said it expects passenger numbers to have fallen 97% in April as demand slumped. Numbers fell 18.8% to 14.6 million during the first three months of the year, the airport said. But it added: ""Heathrow remains open - and continues operating safely to help people get home and to secure vital supply lines for the UK."" Financially, it was ""robust"", it said. ""Heathrow has Â£3.2bn in liquidity, sufficient to maintain the business at least over the next 12 months, even with no passengers,"" it added. Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme that until a coronavirus vaccine could be developed, airports would have to introduce measures to minimise infection once lockdowns started to ease. ""What this might include - and this needs to be agreed with governments and the aviation sector - is a combination of measures and that might include some kind of health screening as you come into the terminal so that perhaps if that's a temperature check, if you have a high temperature, you may not be allowed to fly,"" he said. ""As you go through the airport, you will probably be wearing a face mask, as people from Asia have been doing ever since Sars came out."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Business correspondents Kevin Peachey and Katie Prescott answered your questions Answers touch on unemployment, housing, jobs and travel Press play on top of page to watch live-streamed answers Send a question on your finances to YourQuestions@bbc.co.uk Close to 1m people in UK applied for benefits in only two weeks Global economy expected to shrink by at least 3% this year Roland Hughes, Andrew Humphrey, Alice Cuddy, Kris Bramwell and Martha Buckley Weâre wrapping up our live coverage now, but youâll still be able to watch Katie and Kevin answer your questions by clicking the play button above. We hope their answers were useful and weâll be back again to answer more of your money questions in the coming weeks. For now, if thereâs more youâd like to know, here are our best guides: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter What's going to happen to the housing market when the pandemic finishes? I'm afraid my crystal ball has smashed. There's no point making forecasts at the moment. The number of sales has dropped off a cliff. Lots of sales were cancelled. The peak of that was on 23 March - the day the restrictions on movement were announced. What's difficult to tell is if there's a lot less activity, how that translates to prices. There are different views from different people - get 10 economists in a room, you'll get 11 answers. There are people saying prices will fall, there are others saying because there's so much government support in place it could bounce back quite quickly. Towards the end of his answers, Kevin said there is a lot of talk about how the economy might start to emerge out of lockdown. Our business editorSimon Jack has more on this on our site today- there's no confirmed date yet for when such a restart will occur. The government invited submissions by Thursday from businesses, trade bodies, unions and other workers representatives on how best to slowly restart the UK economy. It's not clear yet if workers will be made to strictly observe a two-metre social distancing rule. In situations where workers may be required to be closer than two metres, the guidelines may insist on mitigating measures such as wearing protective masks or clothing, or where possible working back-to-back, rather than face-to-face. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Small business director pay as a company dividend has been excluded from the financial support - why?Tom Elliot, Witham, Cambs Yes that is the case - it's the decision of the government. They would say it's quite difficult to work out what's your salary and what's other parts of the business. This is if you're self-employed and you've set up a limited company, so you're not a sole trader any more, you're a limited company. There have been tax advantages to this in the past. You may pay yourself a salary, you may also pay yourself a bit in dividends. If you take a salary that's the bit you can pay yourself under this self-employed support scheme but if you pay yourself in dividends, that's the bit you can't claim. There's been lots of people getting in touch to say that's not fair. There's a big petition about this but at the moment we're not seeing any movement. We're not talking just about big businesses here but some really quite small businesses, I've written about painters and decorators in this situation. Of course some people would say this is tax-payers' money we're talking about and if you've taken advantage of tax rules in the past, this is it coming back to haunt you now. Our Q&A has finished, but the full feed will still be available above, and we'll keep pulling together the answers in this part of our live coverage. We're going to aim to do more of these sessions focusing on your financial questions, so if you have any questions you would like us to answer,please send them on via this page  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter What is the likelihood of getting a job after university? University students are in the same situation as lots and lots of people trying to work out what to do next. They can fall back on the benefits system if needs be, and some will have jobs already even if they're part time. Maybe there's an opportunity there for some help from their employer. A lot of the people worried about jobs are going to be falling back on savings as well if they're there. We know from previous research though that lots of people don't have much in way of savings for a rainy day. This is not a rainy day, this is an absolute downpour for some people's finances. Savers have had a rough deal too. They won't get much in the way of interest but their savings are protected. If you are really struggling financially, people have been generous. People have been giving money to charities that have been giving grants to people. It's well worth searching for some of those if you're in real financial hardship. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter I have had a voucher from my holiday firm and they have now gone into liquidation. Where do I stand here? - Linda Jayne This is really hard. The voucher issue is really interesting - it's come up a lot with flights as well. The concern is, as has happened here, that if the company folds that voucher might not be worth anything. And that is true. People are seeking refunds for that very reason. Is it actually a voucher? If it is then you might have to go down a different avenue. If you used a credit card to buy the holiday then you can make a complaint and claim it back from the credit card company. If you've got a refund credit note then that's different from a voucher. A refund credit note is much more protected - you're much more likely to get your money back even if the company has folded. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter What financial assistance is being offered to those with zero hours contracts? -Laura Main, Bristol If you are on a zero hours contract you can still be furloughed. You can still be part of this scheme. Here's the techy bit - You do need to be on a payroll and you do need to pay tax through PAYE. If you're on a zero hours contract with a particular business or a particular employer, or with an agency then you need to go to them and say ""don't forget us"". You can be furloughed in this scheme. Not everybody is going to be covered in that scenario, and so they will still have to fall back on the benefits system. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Can I still claim Universal Credit even though I have been furloughed? - Stephen Ritchie, Barrow-in-Furness Universal credit is this all encompassing benefit. What you are paid in universal credit depends on your circumstances. If you're on a low income, you can claim universal credit. The amount you receive depends on lots of circumstances like if you have children, and if you've got savings and so on. If you've been furloughed that doesn't change. If you're on a low income in furlough or out of furlough, then there is a chance you can still claim universal credit. It's very much a scheme based on what's coming in and it's different for different people. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter I'm shielding for 12 weeks. What financial support, if any, will be in place to assist me if the JRS (job retention scheme) stops at end of May?-John Martin, Maidstone I'm going to start with some good news. The job retention scheme is going to continue until the end of June so that might help you, John, to get you through the isolation period and after that perhaps you might be able to get back into work.  As Katie just said, itâs not exactly a term we were familiar with months ago: furloughing. But now millions of people around the world, including here in the UK, are depending on the scheme that helps firms pay staff who canât do their jobs. Weâve pulled togetherthis guide to furloughing, include how to apply and what you are and arenât allowed to do while furloughed.  Our personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey and business correspondent Katie Prescott are taking your questions on your finance live - just click the play button at the top of this page. The impact is already being felt. In the two weeks up to 1 April, close to a million people applied for the universal credit benefit and that number will only have risen over the past month. Last week, the British Chamber of Commerce said 71% of private firms had furloughed staff - let them go temporarily - since lockdown started. The BCC also said that 59% of firms had cash reserves of only three months or less. It wonât be clear yet what the full cost of the pandemic will be to the UK economy. Each furloughed worker has been entitled to up to Â£2,500 a month (which is likely to make up the biggest expense for the government) but the economy will also suffer from a huge drop in VAT and tax revenues. Of course, the UK isnât the only country thatâs suffering. It and many others are expected to enter recession this year, and the International Monetary Fund has warned this will be the biggest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Hereâs our guide to how coronavirus has impacted the worldâs economy. Since lockdown measures were introduced across the UK on 23 March, almost six weeks ago, all our lives have changed. But perhaps one of the most serious side-effects has been to people's finances. Many people have had to figure out, at short notice, how to live with much less money than before. Itâs also left plenty of other questions: What exactly are your rights as an employee? Should you go ahead with buying a house? Will you get money back for your holiday? Here at BBC News, weâve received more than 740 questions from you about your finances in the past two days. So from 12:00 BST, our personal finance correspondentKevin Peacheyand business correspondentKatie Prescottwill answer some of those questions via a live stream (at the top of this page). We hope it helps make things a little clearer. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.057941005

We hope their answers were useful and weâll be back again to answer more of your money questions in the coming weeks. For now, if thereâs more youâd like to know, here are our best guides: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter What's going to happen to the housing market when the pandemic finishes? I'm afraid my crystal ball has smashed. There's no point making forecasts at the moment. The number of sales has dropped off a cliff. Lots of sales were cancelled. The peak of that was on 23 March - the day the restrictions on movement were announced. What's difficult to tell is if there's a lot less activity, how that translates to prices. There are different views from different people - get 10 economists in a room, you'll get 11 answers. There are people saying prices will fall, there are others saying because there's so much government support in place it could bounce back quite quickly. Towards the end of his answers, Kevin said there is a lot of talk about how the economy might start to emerge out of lockdown. Our business editorSimon Jack has more on this on our site today- there's no confirmed date yet for when such a restart will occur. The government invited submissions by Thursday from businesses, trade bodies, unions and other workers representatives on how best to slowly restart the UK economy. It's not clear yet if workers will be made to strictly observe a two-metre social distancing rule. In situations where workers may be required to be closer than two metres, the guidelines may insist on mitigating measures such as wearing protective masks or clothing, or where possible working back-to-back, rather than face-to-face. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Small business director pay as a company dividend has been excluded from the financial support - why?Tom Elliot, Witham, Cambs Yes that is the case - it's the decision of the government. They would say it's quite difficult to work out what's your salary and what's other parts of the business. This is if you're self-employed and you've set up a limited company, so you're not a sole trader any more, you're a limited company. There have been tax advantages to this in the past. You may pay yourself a salary, you may also pay yourself a bit in dividends. If you take a salary that's the bit you can pay yourself under this self-employed support scheme but if you pay yourself in dividends, that's the bit you can't claim. There's been lots of people getting in touch to say that's not fair. There's a big petition about this but at the moment we're not seeing any movement. We're not talking just about big businesses here but some really quite small businesses, I've written about painters and decorators in this situation. Of course some people would say this is tax-payers' money we're talking about and if you've taken advantage of tax rules in the past, this is it coming back to haunt you now. Our Q&A has finished, but the full feed will still be available above, and we'll keep pulling together the answers in this part of our live coverage. We're going to aim to do more of these sessions focusing on your financial questions, so if you have any questions you would like us to answer,please send them on via this page  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter What is the likelihood of getting a job after university? University students are in the same situation as lots and lots of people trying to work out what to do next. They can fall back on the benefits system if needs be, and some will have jobs already even if they're part time. Maybe there's an opportunity there for some help from their employer. A lot of the people worried about jobs are going to be falling back on savings as well if they're there. We know from previous research though that lots of people don't have much in way of savings for a rainy day. This is not a rainy day, this is an absolute downpour for some people's finances. Savers have had a rough deal too. They won't get much in the way of interest but their savings are protected. If you are really struggling financially, people have been generous. People have been giving money to charities that have been giving grants to people. It's well worth searching for some of those if you're in real financial hardship. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter I have had a voucher from my holiday firm and they have now gone into liquidation. Where do I stand here? - Linda Jayne This is really hard. The voucher issue is really interesting - it's come up a lot with flights as well. The concern is, as has happened here, that if the company folds that voucher might not be worth anything. And that is true. People are seeking refunds for that very reason. Is it actually a voucher? If it is then you might have to go down a different avenue. If you used a credit card to buy the holiday then you can make a complaint and claim it back from the credit card company. If you've got a refund credit note then that's different from a voucher. A refund credit note is much more protected - you're much more likely to get your money back even if the company has folded. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter What financial assistance is being offered to those with zero hours contracts? -Laura Main, Bristol If you are on a zero hours contract you can still be furloughed. You can still be part of this scheme. Here's the techy bit - You do need to be on a payroll and you do need to pay tax through PAYE. If you're on a zero hours contract with a particular business or a particular employer, or with an agency then you need to go to them and say ""don't forget us"". You can be furloughed in this scheme. Not everybody is going to be covered in that scenario, and so they will still have to fall back on the benefits system. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Can I still claim Universal Credit even though I have been furloughed? - Stephen Ritchie, Barrow-in-Furness Universal credit is this all encompassing benefit. What you are paid in universal credit depends on your circumstances. If you're on a low income, you can claim universal credit. The amount you receive depends on lots of circumstances like if you have children, and if you've got savings and so on. If you've been furloughed that doesn't change.

"Deborah Braham seen wearing a homemade visor following an ""extraordinary"" response to her appeal A doctor who urged volunteers to make visors for NHS staff due to a shortage at her hospital says she is ""overwhelmed"" by the response. More than 75,000 face shields have been produced just weeks after Deborah Braham appealed for help on WhatsApp. The Visor Army project spread on social media and has found support among high-profile TV and fashion celebrities. It comes after a BBC investigation found the government failed to buy protective kit to cope with a pandemic. Panoramarevealed this week there were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bagsin the government's stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK. Some NHS staff say they are being put at risk because of the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). The government said it has taken the right steps and is doing everything it can to increase stocks while the NHS trust which manages Hammersmith Hospital in west London, where Dr Braham is based, said it was grateful to community groups for their support. Dr Braham, a consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine, first put out a call to friends on WhatsApp with instructions that had been passed on to her on how to make visors. ""I just thought it would be something they could do with their kids, stuck at home, like an activity but helping at the same time,"" she told the BBC. Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags NHS dashboard to predict protective gear shortages NHS doctor who pleaded for PPE dies To begin with, a handful of people got involved, buying their own materials from craft shops, making the visors at home and delivering them to Dr Braham's house. Then, as word spread, the number of volunteers - and visors - grew. A Facebook group - calledVisor Army - Make A Visor. Save A Hero,external- was set up on 1 April to channel interest from members of the public. ""Initially it was just people I knew who came on board, then it was people I didn't know,"" Dr Braham said. ""Within a short time this whole thing had grown so big with so many people wanting to help. ""It's given a lot of people a real sense of purpose and contribution in what are very difficult times. It's been a real community effort and I cannot thank these people enough.""

The visors are stored at a facility where they are sanitised before being delivered to some 13 hospitals in London and south-east England, as well as doctors' surgeries and care homes. Dr Braham said around 50,000 have been used so far. The importance of visors to medics lies in the fact that, unlike medical goggles, they provide protection for the whole of the face. Without them, doctors and nurses are at high risk of being contaminated by aerosolised particles containing the virus during procedures such as intubation or when they are caring for patients on ventilators. The lack of visors mean in some cases medics have been re-using rather than discarding them after single use, as is generally considered good practice. Dr Braham is now trying to launch a similar drive to make much-needed medical gowns - a protective garment worn over scrubs - something she says is more expensive and would require many more volunteers. Suitable fabric is also in short supply. The homemade visors are being used in hospitals, doctors' surgeries and care homes The Visor Army project is one of a number of grassroots initiatives to make PPE which have sprung up since the coronavirus crisis erupted.

As we end our live coverage of the latest coronavirus developments in Scotland, here is a summary of today's headlines:  Our live coverage will resume in the morning. See you then. Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter Edinburgh landlords are calling on council officials to waive council tax on properties which are lying empty due to the coronavirus lockdown. Landlords are unable to conduct viewings of their flats to prospective tenants during the restrictions. Currently they only receive a 10% discount if the flat is empty. John Davidson, 40, lost both his tenants at his two flats in Edinburgh's Dalry and Stockbridge when the lockdown was announced. He said: ""Normally they are really easy to rent out but I'm not allowed to do viewings just now so I've been left picking up the bills. I'm desperate to rent them out. âYou would think that while we are all in this together the council tax would be waived on empty flats.â As we approach the end of our live coverage for today, take a look at some of Your Pictures of Scotland this week.

Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter Edinburgh Council is banning traffic from three city roads to
make more space for pedestrians and cyclists during the coronavirus lockdown. The bottom of Silverknowes Road, heading towards the Cramond foreshore promenade, has been closed, while Braid Road and Links Gardens will shut from Sunday. It is one of the first local
authorities in the UK to introduce emergency measures to help pedestrians and
cyclists to travel safely while observing physical distancing guidance. Adam McVey, City of Edinburgh Council
leader, said: ""The way we move around the city has changed significantly
over recent weeks and it's clear that we need to respond to this. ""We've been working closely with
the Scottish government to develop measures to help pedestrians and cyclists
travel safely while remaining socially distant."" Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent More than 1,600 companies have offered to help the Scottish government with vital supplies during the coronavirus crisis, with factories re-purposing production lines to manufacture much-needed kit. Skyrora, in Loanhead, Midlothian, develops satellite launchers but switched production to face shields and is turning rocket fuel into hand sanitizer. Business operations manager Derek Harris said âIt was a bit more of a challenge than we expected. At first we thought we can make these and hand them out but then we realised we needed to get the correct licences and source the correct customers. âWe worked closely with the government and local care homes and our team deployed into different areas and we made it work.â Berry BPI in Greenock lost contracts to China years ago. It is now producing hundred of thousands of NHS gowns and millions of aprons every week. Chief executive Andrew Green said: âWe saw a need. We saw that hospitals were likely to run out of these things, before it happened. We used to make these products, we know how to make them, so we were keen to help.â You can see more on this onReporting Scotland on BBC One Scotland at 1830. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's national clinical director does not think that easing the lockdown will be achieved by relaxing rules for younger people first. Prof Jason Leitch was responding to a suggestion by Sir David Spiegelhalter of  Cambrige University. ""We certainly aren't ruling anything out, but it feels like such a difficult thing to do for society that I don't think it will be top of the list of things to do,"" Prof Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""But I can understand why public health professionals like him should absolutely enter the debate about what we should or shouldn't do."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's national clinical director has pleaded with the public not to think they can start ""doing more"" outside their homes. ""The data does suggest there is a small increase in car traffic - we are not quite sure why that is,"" Prof Jason Leitch told BBC Radio Scotland. People have warned against anything other than 'essential' travel ""Right at the beginning, we said, 'if your life is normal, you have misunderstood'. And now I think we're saying, 'if your life is changing, you have misunderstood'. ""If you think you can do more, you have misunderstood where we are in this pandemic curve, because we are not out of it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fiona WalkerBBC Scotland Dr Malcolm Sim There may be no known cure for coronavirus as yet, but people all over the world are working hard to find treatments. BBC Scotland was given access to NHS trials at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Glasgow today where they are trying new and existing drugs to see if they can help save lives. âI suspect thereâs not going to be a magic bullet that makes people better from Covid,â says Dr Malcolm Sim, an intensive care consultant. âBut it could be that different treatments given at the right time affect different aspects of the disease process.â Fiona Young has recovered from Covid-19 We also talked to Fiona Young, a Zumba teacher, who has been through the disease. âItâs scary to know you canât just take a pill,â she says. âYou would feel so much better. It would be such a relief if you could take something.â The studies are looking at quicker recovery times, whether patients can avoid intensive care or being put on a ventilator. Ultimately, they hope to save lives. âWe have no proven treatments that definitely work at the moment. So hereâs hoping. Dr Malcolm Sim, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Reality Check Having set a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April, the government now says it reached 122,347 tests on Wednesday (the last day of the month). The government had been averaging around 20,000 tests a day but this increased significantly over the last week. When home testing kits became a significant part of the testing strategy last week, the Department of Health began counting those sent out as part of its daily test figures. So, it doesnât mean the test was actually used by someone on that day - or even received. Previously, only instances in which the swab had been processed through a lab were counted as a test. But the new definition - added on 27 April - included tests ""posted to an individual at home"". On 29 April, the definition was extended yet further to also encompass ""tests sent to... satellite testing locations"". According to figures released on 30 April, home testing kits accounted for over 18,000 of the daily tests, or a quarter of the total. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suggestion that the UK is ""past the peak"" of the Covid-19 outbreak has been described as premature by Scotland's national clinical director. ""I think it is really, really dangerous and tricky language to use,"" Prof Jason Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland. Echoing today's view from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, he says: ""I think we are on the peak. I think we are in that process of turning a corner. Think of Ben Nevis to Arthur's Seat. I think we are on Arthur's Seat and coming down the other side, just, but it is very fragile. ""I think the Prime Minister and the three first ministers have done their best to be open with the country. His language is more flowery than mine, but that is Boris Johnson rather than right or wrong."" However, Prof Leitch adds that ""any suggestion that you can go out this weekend and behave any differently from last week is absolutely wrong. Of that, I am certain."" UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says increasing testing is only the first part of the government's approach, and it will now move towards track and tracing steps. Mr Hancock says tracking who has the virus and who they have been in contact with will drive the infection rate down, and ""the lower it is the more effective it will be"". ""Our goal must be freedom,"" says the health secretary. ""We will not lift measures until it is safe to do so, but we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom."" Follow therest of the briefing here. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Expanding the amount oftesting for Covid-19 in Scotland's care homescould not have been announced earlier than today because the capacity was not there in the system, Scottish Care chief executive Donald Maskill insists. Dr Macaskill admitted the number of deaths in Scottish care homes ""were extremely distressing"" and that ""clearly there will be lessons to be learned and we will do things differently in the future"" as ""we have been overtaken by the global shortage in PPE"". However, he told BBC Radio Scotland that politicians, care providers and frontline workers were doing their best and stressed that ""we also have to remember that the vast majority - over 80% - of even people in their 90s who develop this disease still go on to survive"". ""Even individuals who are receiving end of life treatment can go on and beat this virus,"" he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has just started the UK government's daily coronavirus briefing. He says a further 739 people have died since yesterday, bringing the total across all sectors in the UK to 27,510. He also says the government met its target of 100,000 tests by the end of April, reporting that 122,347 tests were carried out yesterday. You can follow thewhole briefing here. Since lockdown began a debate has been ongoing around cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR is an emergency treatment that tries to restart a person's heart or breathing and its most important components are chest compressions to pump blood around the body, and rescue breaths to provide oxygen, often referred to as the 'kiss of life'. Since the lockdown began health officials have recommended not to use mouth-to-mouth CPR because of the risk of catching a potentially high dosage of Covid-19. But, according to the Resuscitation Council UK, chest compressions are still permitted for members of the public, provided they follow the correct steps. Readmore here.

""I agree with the first minister that testing is not a panacea, but it is an additional tool in our battle against coronavirus."" Dr Macaskill, whose body represents the independent care
sector, pointed out that growing evidence shows that, if there is one case, other residents or staff could be infected with the virus, even if they are not yet showing symptoms. ""The announcement will go a long way to give assurance to families and other residents and staff,"" he added.

Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News Police Scotland is receiving more calls from the public despite the coronavirus lockdown. A Scottish Police Authority paper revealed there was an initial drop in the volume in the days after the restrictions were introduced. But a report, by Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs for theAudit Risk & Assurance Committee,external, said: ""Call volume
has however increased, and is now higher than average in
comparison to last year with a large amount of these calls from

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlines plans to ramp up coronavirus testing, especially in care homes Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government has met and exceeded the target of 3,500 tests per day in NHS labs The first minister says that, with UK government tests in Scotland, the total capacity is now 8,350 per day and will increase to more than 10,000 next week. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says his pledge of 100,000 tests a day has been met, with 122,347 tests carried out yesterday Scotland's chief examiner Fiona Robertson reassures pupils that grades this year will be based on ""all activity throughout the year"" BBC Scotland News Many say they would be uncomfortable leaving home even if restrictions were lifted. As we end our live coverage of the latest coronavirus developments in Scotland, here is a summary of today's headlines:  Our live coverage will resume in the morning. See you then. Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter Edinburgh landlords are calling on council officials to waive council tax on properties which are lying empty due to the coronavirus lockdown. Landlords are unable to conduct viewings of their flats to prospective tenants during the restrictions. Currently they only receive a 10% discount if the flat is empty. John Davidson, 40, lost both his tenants at his two flats in Edinburgh's Dalry and Stockbridge when the lockdown was announced. He said: ""Normally they are really easy to rent out but I'm not allowed to do viewings just now so I've been left picking up the bills. I'm desperate to rent them out. âYou would think that while we are all in this together the council tax would be waived on empty flats.â As we approach the end of our live coverage for today, take a look at some of Your Pictures of Scotland this week.

Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter Edinburgh Council is banning traffic from three city roads to
make more space for pedestrians and cyclists during the coronavirus lockdown. The bottom of Silverknowes Road, heading towards the Cramond foreshore promenade, has been closed, while Braid Road and Links Gardens will shut from Sunday. It is one of the first local
authorities in the UK to introduce emergency measures to help pedestrians and
cyclists to travel safely while observing physical distancing guidance. Adam McVey, City of Edinburgh Council
leader, said: ""The way we move around the city has changed significantly
over recent weeks and it's clear that we need to respond to this. ""We've been working closely with
the Scottish government to develop measures to help pedestrians and cyclists
travel safely while remaining socially distant."" Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent More than 1,600 companies have offered to help the Scottish government with vital supplies during the coronavirus crisis, with factories re-purposing production lines to manufacture much-needed kit. Skyrora, in Loanhead, Midlothian, develops satellite launchers but switched production to face shields and is turning rocket fuel into hand sanitizer. Business operations manager Derek Harris said âIt was a bit more of a challenge than we expected. At first we thought we can make these and hand them out but then we realised we needed to get the correct licences and source the correct customers. âWe worked closely with the government and local care homes and our team deployed into different areas and we made it work.â Berry BPI in Greenock lost contracts to China years ago. It is now producing hundred of thousands of NHS gowns and millions of aprons every week. Chief executive Andrew Green said: âWe saw a need. We saw that hospitals were likely to run out of these things, before it happened. We used to make these products, we know how to make them, so we were keen to help.â You can see more on this onReporting Scotland on BBC One Scotland at 1830. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's national clinical director does not think that easing the lockdown will be achieved by relaxing rules for younger people first. Prof Jason Leitch was responding to a suggestion by Sir David Spiegelhalter of  Cambrige University. ""We certainly aren't ruling anything out, but it feels like such a difficult thing to do for society that I don't think it will be top of the list of things to do,"" Prof Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""But I can understand why public health professionals like him should absolutely enter the debate about what we should or shouldn't do."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's national clinical director has pleaded with the public not to think they can start ""doing more"" outside their homes. ""The data does suggest there is a small increase in car traffic - we are not quite sure why that is,"" Prof Jason Leitch told BBC Radio Scotland. People have warned against anything other than 'essential' travel ""Right at the beginning, we said, 'if your life is normal, you have misunderstood'. And now I think we're saying, 'if your life is changing, you have misunderstood'. ""If you think you can do more, you have misunderstood where we are in this pandemic curve, because we are not out of it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Because of our good work, the health service has not been overwhelmed and we are beginning to think and plan about what we will be reintroducing,"" he said.

Fiona WalkerBBC Scotland Dr Malcolm Sim There may be no known cure for coronavirus as yet, but people all over the world are working hard to find treatments. BBC Scotland was given access to NHS trials at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Glasgow today where they are trying new and existing drugs to see if they can help save lives. âI suspect thereâs not going to be a magic bullet that makes people better from Covid,â says Dr Malcolm Sim, an intensive care consultant. âBut it could be that different treatments given at the right time affect different aspects of the disease process.â Fiona Young has recovered from Covid-19 We also talked to Fiona Young, a Zumba teacher, who has been through the disease. âItâs scary to know you canât just take a pill,â she says. âYou would feel so much better. It would be such a relief if you could take something.â The studies are looking at quicker recovery times, whether patients can avoid intensive care or being put on a ventilator. Ultimately, they hope to save lives. âWe have no proven treatments that definitely work at the moment. So hereâs hoping. Dr Malcolm Sim, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Reality Check Having set a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April, the government now says it reached 122,347 tests on Wednesday (the last day of the month). The government had been averaging around 20,000 tests a day but this increased significantly over the last week. When home testing kits became a significant part of the testing strategy last week, the Department of Health began counting those sent out as part of its daily test figures. So, it doesnât mean the test was actually used by someone on that day - or even received. Previously, only instances in which the swab had been processed through a lab were counted as a test. But the new definition - added on 27 April - included tests ""posted to an individual at home"". On 29 April, the definition was extended yet further to also encompass ""tests sent to... satellite testing locations"". According to figures released on 30 April, home testing kits accounted for over 18,000 of the daily tests, or a quarter of the total. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suggestion that the UK is ""past the peak"" of the Covid-19 outbreak has been described as premature by Scotland's national clinical director. ""I think it is really, really dangerous and tricky language to use,"" Prof Jason Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland. Echoing today's view from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, he says: ""I think we are on the peak. I think we are in that process of turning a corner. Think of Ben Nevis to Arthur's Seat. I think we are on Arthur's Seat and coming down the other side, just, but it is very fragile. ""I think the Prime Minister and the three first ministers have done their best to be open with the country. His language is more flowery than mine, but that is Boris Johnson rather than right or wrong."" However, Prof Leitch adds that ""any suggestion that you can go out this weekend and behave any differently from last week is absolutely wrong. Of that, I am certain."" UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says increasing testing is only the first part of the government's approach, and it will now move towards track and tracing steps. Mr Hancock says tracking who has the virus and who they have been in contact with will drive the infection rate down, and ""the lower it is the more effective it will be"". ""Our goal must be freedom,"" says the health secretary. ""We will not lift measures until it is safe to do so, but we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom."" Follow therest of the briefing here. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Expanding the amount oftesting for Covid-19 in Scotland's care homescould not have been announced earlier than today because the capacity was not there in the system, Scottish Care chief executive Donald Maskill insists. Dr Macaskill admitted the number of deaths in Scottish care homes ""were extremely distressing"" and that ""clearly there will be lessons to be learned and we will do things differently in the future"" as ""we have been overtaken by the global shortage in PPE"". However, he told BBC Radio Scotland that politicians, care providers and frontline workers were doing their best and stressed that ""we also have to remember that the vast majority - over 80% - of even people in their 90s who develop this disease still go on to survive"". ""Even individuals who are receiving end of life treatment can go on and beat this virus,"" he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has just started the UK government's daily coronavirus briefing. He says a further 739 people have died since yesterday, bringing the total across all sectors in the UK to 27,510. He also says the government met its target of 100,000 tests by the end of April, reporting that 122,347 tests were carried out yesterday. You can follow thewhole briefing here. Since lockdown began a debate has been ongoing around cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR is an emergency treatment that tries to restart a person's heart or breathing and its most important components are chest compressions to pump blood around the body, and rescue breaths to provide oxygen, often referred to as the 'kiss of life'. Since the lockdown began health officials have recommended not to use mouth-to-mouth CPR because of the risk of catching a potentially high dosage of Covid-19. But, according to the Resuscitation Council UK, chest compressions are still permitted for members of the public, provided they follow the correct steps. Readmore here. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Today's announcement that testing in care homes is to be expanded to all residents and staff that have one confirmed case of Covid-19""will make an inordinate difference"" according to Scottish Care chief executive Dr Donald Macaskill. ""Scottish Care was calling for this on Wednesday, so we're absolutely delighted,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I agree with the first minister that testing is not a panacea, but it is an additional tool in our battle against coronavirus."" Dr Macaskill, whose body represents the independent care
sector, pointed out that growing evidence shows that, if there is one case, other residents or staff could be infected with the virus, even if they are not yet showing symptoms. ""The announcement will go a long way to give assurance to families and other residents and staff,"" he added.

"Business correspondents Kevin Peachey and Katie Prescott answered your questions Answers touch on unemployment, housing, jobs and travel Press play on top of page to watch live-streamed answers Send a question on your finances to YourQuestions@bbc.co.uk Close to 1m people in UK applied for benefits in only two weeks Global economy expected to shrink by at least 3% this year Roland Hughes, Andrew Humphrey, Alice Cuddy, Kris Bramwell and Martha Buckley Weâre wrapping up our live coverage now, but youâll still be able to watch Katie and Kevin answer your questions by clicking the play button above. We hope their answers were useful and weâll be back again to answer more of your money questions in the coming weeks. For now, if thereâs more youâd like to know, here are our best guides: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter What's going to happen to the housing market when the pandemic finishes? I'm afraid my crystal ball has smashed. There's no point making forecasts at the moment. The number of sales has dropped off a cliff. Lots of sales were cancelled. The peak of that was on 23 March - the day the restrictions on movement were announced. What's difficult to tell is if there's a lot less activity, how that translates to prices. There are different views from different people - get 10 economists in a room, you'll get 11 answers. There are people saying prices will fall, there are others saying because there's so much government support in place it could bounce back quite quickly. Towards the end of his answers, Kevin said there is a lot of talk about how the economy might start to emerge out of lockdown. Our business editorSimon Jack has more on this on our site today- there's no confirmed date yet for when such a restart will occur. The government invited submissions by Thursday from businesses, trade bodies, unions and other workers representatives on how best to slowly restart the UK economy. It's not clear yet if workers will be made to strictly observe a two-metre social distancing rule. In situations where workers may be required to be closer than two metres, the guidelines may insist on mitigating measures such as wearing protective masks or clothing, or where possible working back-to-back, rather than face-to-face. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Small business director pay as a company dividend has been excluded from the financial support - why?Tom Elliot, Witham, Cambs Yes that is the case - it's the decision of the government. They would say it's quite difficult to work out what's your salary and what's other parts of the business. This is if you're self-employed and you've set up a limited company, so you're not a sole trader any more, you're a limited company. There have been tax advantages to this in the past. You may pay yourself a salary, you may also pay yourself a bit in dividends. If you take a salary that's the bit you can pay yourself under this self-employed support scheme but if you pay yourself in dividends, that's the bit you can't claim. There's been lots of people getting in touch to say that's not fair. There's a big petition about this but at the moment we're not seeing any movement. We're not talking just about big businesses here but some really quite small businesses, I've written about painters and decorators in this situation. Of course some people would say this is tax-payers' money we're talking about and if you've taken advantage of tax rules in the past, this is it coming back to haunt you now. Our Q&A has finished, but the full feed will still be available above, and we'll keep pulling together the answers in this part of our live coverage. We're going to aim to do more of these sessions focusing on your financial questions, so if you have any questions you would like us to answer,please send them on via this page  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter What is the likelihood of getting a job after university? University students are in the same situation as lots and lots of people trying to work out what to do next. They can fall back on the benefits system if needs be, and some will have jobs already even if they're part time. Maybe there's an opportunity there for some help from their employer. A lot of the people worried about jobs are going to be falling back on savings as well if they're there. We know from previous research though that lots of people don't have much in way of savings for a rainy day. This is not a rainy day, this is an absolute downpour for some people's finances. Savers have had a rough deal too. They won't get much in the way of interest but their savings are protected. If you are really struggling financially, people have been generous. People have been giving money to charities that have been giving grants to people. It's well worth searching for some of those if you're in real financial hardship. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter I have had a voucher from my holiday firm and they have now gone into liquidation. Where do I stand here? - Linda Jayne This is really hard. The voucher issue is really interesting - it's come up a lot with flights as well. The concern is, as has happened here, that if the company folds that voucher might not be worth anything. And that is true. People are seeking refunds for that very reason. Is it actually a voucher? If it is then you might have to go down a different avenue. If you used a credit card to buy the holiday then you can make a complaint and claim it back from the credit card company. If you've got a refund credit note then that's different from a voucher. A refund credit note is much more protected - you're much more likely to get your money back even if the company has folded. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter What financial assistance is being offered to those with zero hours contracts? -Laura Main, Bristol If you are on a zero hours contract you can still be furloughed. You can still be part of this scheme. Here's the techy bit - You do need to be on a payroll and you do need to pay tax through PAYE. If you're on a zero hours contract with a particular business or a particular employer, or with an agency then you need to go to them and say ""don't forget us"". You can be furloughed in this scheme. Not everybody is going to be covered in that scenario, and so they will still have to fall back on the benefits system. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Can I still claim Universal Credit even though I have been furloughed? - Stephen Ritchie, Barrow-in-Furness Universal credit is this all encompassing benefit. What you are paid in universal credit depends on your circumstances. If you're on a low income, you can claim universal credit. The amount you receive depends on lots of circumstances like if you have children, and if you've got savings and so on. If you've been furloughed that doesn't change. If you're on a low income in furlough or out of furlough, then there is a chance you can still claim universal credit. It's very much a scheme based on what's coming in and it's different for different people. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter I'm shielding for 12 weeks. What financial support, if any, will be in place to assist me if the JRS (job retention scheme) stops at end of May?-John Martin, Maidstone I'm going to start with some good news. The job retention scheme is going to continue until the end of June so that might help you, John, to get you through the isolation period and after that perhaps you might be able to get back into work.  As Katie just said, itâs not exactly a term we were familiar with months ago: furloughing. But now millions of people around the world, including here in the UK, are depending on the scheme that helps firms pay staff who canât do their jobs. Weâve pulled togetherthis guide to furloughing, include how to apply and what you are and arenât allowed to do while furloughed.  Our personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey and business correspondent Katie Prescott are taking your questions on your finance live - just click the play button at the top of this page. The impact is already being felt. In the two weeks up to 1 April, close to a million people applied for the universal credit benefit and that number will only have risen over the past month. Last week, the British Chamber of Commerce said 71% of private firms had furloughed staff - let them go temporarily - since lockdown started. The BCC also said that 59% of firms had cash reserves of only three months or less. It wonât be clear yet what the full cost of the pandemic will be to the UK economy. Each furloughed worker has been entitled to up to Â£2,500 a month (which is likely to make up the biggest expense for the government) but the economy will also suffer from a huge drop in VAT and tax revenues. Of course, the UK isnât the only country thatâs suffering. It and many others are expected to enter recession this year, and the International Monetary Fund has warned this will be the biggest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Hereâs our guide to how coronavirus has impacted the worldâs economy. Since lockdown measures were introduced across the UK on 23 March, almost six weeks ago, all our lives have changed. But perhaps one of the most serious side-effects has been to people's finances. Many people have had to figure out, at short notice, how to live with much less money than before. Itâs also left plenty of other questions: What exactly are your rights as an employee? Should you go ahead with buying a house? Will you get money back for your holiday? Here at BBC News, weâve received more than 740 questions from you about your finances in the past two days. So from 12:00 BST, our personal finance correspondentKevin Peacheyand business correspondentKatie Prescottwill answer some of those questions via a live stream (at the top of this page). We hope it helps make things a little clearer. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.74809325
"This video can not be played WATCH: 'One of two things happened' US President Donald Trump has appeared to undercut his own intelligence agencies by suggesting he has seen evidence coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. Earlier the US national intelligence director's office said it was still investigating how the virus began. But the office said it had determined Covid-19 ""was not manmade or genetically modified"". China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19. Since emerging in China last year, the virus has killed 230,000 people worldwide including 63,000 in the US. Simple ways you can help during the pandemic Has US tested more than rest of world combined? The pandemic has seen at least 3.2 million people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan. At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: ""Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?"" ""Yes, I have. Yes, I have,"" said the president, without specifying. ""And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China."" Asked later to clarify his comment, he said:  ""I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that."" This video can not be played Michigan protesters decry Covid-19 state of emergency He also told reporters: ""Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose? ""I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer."" Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on,unnamed officials told NBC News.,external In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the ""wide scientific consensus"" regarding Covid-19's natural origins. Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release idea? China and the US trade coronavirus conspiracy theories ""The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan."" It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory. Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats. The foundation of the Wuhan lab boosted China's international prestige Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (Â£35m), the lab opened in 2015.Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon,external, Nature journal reports. It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety Level 4 lab with links to similar labs around the world. Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing. On Wednesday, he suggestedChina wanted him to losehis re-election bid in November. He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body. Can we trust China claims of virus success? China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. According to the Washington Post,the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially,external. Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations. In January,he called US intelligence agencies ""naive"" on Iranand dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election in 2016, when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign. Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despiteUS charges brought against Russian citizens. President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead. Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight. China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game. Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.

"""I don't think I have ever set foot in a Waitrose"" - Amie Smith, with her family Many families are struggling to put food on the table as the coronavirus lockdown robs them of their income.A report by food bank charities,externalpoints to an alarming rise in the number of people in need of essential supplies. How are they coping and what more can be done to help? ""We have gone without meals so the children can eat. It isn't nice when you are feeling hungry and you open the cupboard and there is nothing in there for you."" Amie Smith and her partner Marcus were just about getting by before the coronavirus lockdown. Now they have had to give up their zero hours contract jobs and are relying on universal credit payments, food vouchers from the government and the occasional food parcel from local schools. Their biggest daily struggle is finding enough food in the shops for their four children, aged two to 13. Families still wait for free school meal vouchers 'Emergency food' for families with nothing to eat 'Bare cupboards' as food bank use rises in pandemic The family is getting by on a weekly food budget of about Â£30. The children are entitled to free school meals, which translate into food vouchers during lockdown, but they can't find anywhere to spend them. Amie says she has about Â£200 worth of vouchers, from the government's free school meal voucher scheme. But none of them is for stores in her south London neighbourhood and she is unable to use public transport during the pandemic for health reasons. She is frustrated by the offer of vouchers from what she sees as upmarket stores like Marks & Spencer and Waitrose. ""I don't think I have ever set foot in a Waitrose in my life,"" she said. Their car has broken down, so they find themselves using local convenience stores - which charge higher prices. ""It's becoming very expensive. I just paid Â£5 for 30 eggs. That was the cheapest we could find."" Reid-Angel, two, and Bree, 11, are learning to cope with life in lockdown Labour is calling on the government to ""expand which shops are able to accept free school meal vouchers to include those supermarkets most present in our poorest communities"". Underthe current scheme,external, run by private contractor Edenred, every eligible child is entitled to Â£15 a week in vouchers for food from a selection of supermarkets:  Aldi, McColl's, Morrisons, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Waitrose and M&S. The government says it recognises it may not be convenient for some families to visit one of these shops. It is ""working to see if additional supermarkets can be added to this list"". In the meantime, it is advising schools to prepare food parcels for pupils on free meals. People are seeking help from food banks in record numbers Many families - who may not have children on free school meals - are turning to food banks for essential supplies. This is putting an enormous strain on charities that provide them. A new report by the UK's biggest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, said it handed out 81% more emergency food parcels in the last two weeks of March, than at the same time last year. People struggling with the amount of income they were receiving from working or benefits was the main reason for the increase, the trust said. ""Like a tidal wave gathering pace, an economic crisis is sweeping towards us, but we don't all have lifeboats,"" said chief executive Emma Revie. Sonya Johnson, who runs Ediblelinks, an independent food bank in Warwickshire, has noticed a big increase in families with previously comfortable incomes seeking help. ""There are fresh faces coming through the door,"" she said. ""People who really don't want to be here, who have never used a food bank but suddenly find themselves at a point of crisis."" These new clients tend to be small-business owners, or sole traders, such a hairdressers or cafe proprietors. They are waiting for universal credit payments or money from the government's business loan scheme. The food bank has experienced a 20% increase in demand week-on-week since coronavirus took hold. Extreme financial hardship exists even outside a global pandemic. Debt charity Christians Against Poverty says one in 10 of its clients live without a bed or mattress, or skip meals on a daily basis. It, and others in the sector, fear coronavirus will mean more people living like this - perhaps for the first time. Payment ""holidays"" put off, rather than cancel, regular bills such as rent or council tax. There is concern people are simply piling up unmanageable debt for the future. But there is support. Credit unions can offer low-cost loans for small amounts. People are also donating generously in this crisis and some of that money is given in grants so those in crippling hardship can put food on the table. Charity Turn2us hasa search tool to check eligibility,externalfor these non-repayable grants. The Child Poverty Action Group has also launcheda tool to help people find,externalsupport during the pandemic. No government has had to cope with a crisis on this scale in peacetime and poverty campaigners have welcomed actions to help those in most need, through the benefits system. But a group of charities, including the Trussell Trust, is calling now for a coronavirus emergency income support scheme. They say many families need money urgently, to prevent them being from being ""swept into destitution"". A government spokesman said it was ""committed to supporting all those affected... through these unprecedented times"". ""We've implemented an enormous package of measures to do so, including income protection schemes and mortgage holidays For those in most need, we've injected more than Â£6.5bn into the welfare system, including an increase to universal credit of up to Â£1,040 a year. No-one has to wait five weeks for money as urgent payments are available."" Amie and Marcus are just about managing to feed their children each day. But they are worried what the future holds, if they can't get back to work soon. ""There have been times when we have had nothing but maybe beans on toast to give them,"" says Amie. ""We have to remind ourselves that there are people out there with absolutely nothing. We should be grateful for what we have."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlines plans to ramp up coronavirus testing, especially in care homes Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government has met and exceeded the target of 3,500 tests per day in NHS labs The first minister says that, with UK government tests in Scotland, the total capacity is now 8,350 per day and will increase to more than 10,000 next week. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says his pledge of 100,000 tests a day has been met, with 122,347 tests carried out yesterday Scotland's chief examiner Fiona Robertson reassures pupils that grades this year will be based on ""all activity throughout the year"" BBC Scotland News Many say they would be uncomfortable leaving home even if restrictions were lifted. As we end our live coverage of the latest coronavirus developments in Scotland, here is a summary of today's headlines:  Our live coverage will resume in the morning. See you then. Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter Edinburgh landlords are calling on council officials to waive council tax on properties which are lying empty due to the coronavirus lockdown. Landlords are unable to conduct viewings of their flats to prospective tenants during the restrictions. Currently they only receive a 10% discount if the flat is empty. John Davidson, 40, lost both his tenants at his two flats in Edinburgh's Dalry and Stockbridge when the lockdown was announced. He said: ""Normally they are really easy to rent out but I'm not allowed to do viewings just now so I've been left picking up the bills. I'm desperate to rent them out. âYou would think that while we are all in this together the council tax would be waived on empty flats.â As we approach the end of our live coverage for today, take a look at some of Your Pictures of Scotland this week.

Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter Edinburgh Council is banning traffic from three city roads to
make more space for pedestrians and cyclists during the coronavirus lockdown. The bottom of Silverknowes Road, heading towards the Cramond foreshore promenade, has been closed, while Braid Road and Links Gardens will shut from Sunday. It is one of the first local
authorities in the UK to introduce emergency measures to help pedestrians and
cyclists to travel safely while observing physical distancing guidance. Adam McVey, City of Edinburgh Council
leader, said: ""The way we move around the city has changed significantly
over recent weeks and it's clear that we need to respond to this. ""We've been working closely with
the Scottish government to develop measures to help pedestrians and cyclists
travel safely while remaining socially distant."" Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent More than 1,600 companies have offered to help the Scottish government with vital supplies during the coronavirus crisis, with factories re-purposing production lines to manufacture much-needed kit. Skyrora, in Loanhead, Midlothian, develops satellite launchers but switched production to face shields and is turning rocket fuel into hand sanitizer. Business operations manager Derek Harris said âIt was a bit more of a challenge than we expected. At first we thought we can make these and hand them out but then we realised we needed to get the correct licences and source the correct customers. âWe worked closely with the government and local care homes and our team deployed into different areas and we made it work.â Berry BPI in Greenock lost contracts to China years ago. It is now producing hundred of thousands of NHS gowns and millions of aprons every week. Chief executive Andrew Green said: âWe saw a need. We saw that hospitals were likely to run out of these things, before it happened. We used to make these products, we know how to make them, so we were keen to help.â You can see more on this onReporting Scotland on BBC One Scotland at 1830. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's national clinical director does not think that easing the lockdown will be achieved by relaxing rules for younger people first. Prof Jason Leitch was responding to a suggestion by Sir David Spiegelhalter of  Cambrige University. ""We certainly aren't ruling anything out, but it feels like such a difficult thing to do for society that I don't think it will be top of the list of things to do,"" Prof Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""But I can understand why public health professionals like him should absolutely enter the debate about what we should or shouldn't do."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's national clinical director has pleaded with the public not to think they can start ""doing more"" outside their homes. ""The data does suggest there is a small increase in car traffic - we are not quite sure why that is,"" Prof Jason Leitch told BBC Radio Scotland. People have warned against anything other than 'essential' travel ""Right at the beginning, we said, 'if your life is normal, you have misunderstood'. And now I think we're saying, 'if your life is changing, you have misunderstood'. ""If you think you can do more, you have misunderstood where we are in this pandemic curve, because we are not out of it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Because of our good work, the health service has not been overwhelmed and we are beginning to think and plan about what we will be reintroducing,"" he said. Prof Leitch stressed that those suffering chronic pain and cancer would be among the first to see treatment resume but warned that ""we won't see anything like a normal service for a long time"".

Fiona WalkerBBC Scotland Dr Malcolm Sim There may be no known cure for coronavirus as yet, but people all over the world are working hard to find treatments. BBC Scotland was given access to NHS trials at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Glasgow today where they are trying new and existing drugs to see if they can help save lives. âI suspect thereâs not going to be a magic bullet that makes people better from Covid,â says Dr Malcolm Sim, an intensive care consultant. âBut it could be that different treatments given at the right time affect different aspects of the disease process.â Fiona Young has recovered from Covid-19 We also talked to Fiona Young, a Zumba teacher, who has been through the disease. âItâs scary to know you canât just take a pill,â she says. âYou would feel so much better. It would be such a relief if you could take something.â The studies are looking at quicker recovery times, whether patients can avoid intensive care or being put on a ventilator. Ultimately, they hope to save lives. âWe have no proven treatments that definitely work at the moment. So hereâs hoping. Dr Malcolm Sim, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Reality Check Having set a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April, the government now says it reached 122,347 tests on Wednesday (the last day of the month). The government had been averaging around 20,000 tests a day but this increased significantly over the last week. When home testing kits became a significant part of the testing strategy last week, the Department of Health began counting those sent out as part of its daily test figures. So, it doesnât mean the test was actually used by someone on that day - or even received. Previously, only instances in which the swab had been processed through a lab were counted as a test. But the new definition - added on 27 April - included tests ""posted to an individual at home"". On 29 April, the definition was extended yet further to also encompass ""tests sent to... satellite testing locations"". According to figures released on 30 April, home testing kits accounted for over 18,000 of the daily tests, or a quarter of the total. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suggestion that the UK is ""past the peak"" of the Covid-19 outbreak has been described as premature by Scotland's national clinical director. ""I think it is really, really dangerous and tricky language to use,"" Prof Jason Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland. Echoing today's view from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, he says: ""I think we are on the peak. I think we are in that process of turning a corner. Think of Ben Nevis to Arthur's Seat. I think we are on Arthur's Seat and coming down the other side, just, but it is very fragile. ""I think the Prime Minister and the three first ministers have done their best to be open with the country. His language is more flowery than mine, but that is Boris Johnson rather than right or wrong."" However, Prof Leitch adds that ""any suggestion that you can go out this weekend and behave any differently from last week is absolutely wrong. Of that, I am certain."" UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says increasing testing is only the first part of the government's approach, and it will now move towards track and tracing steps. Mr Hancock says tracking who has the virus and who they have been in contact with will drive the infection rate down, and ""the lower it is the more effective it will be"". ""Our goal must be freedom,"" says the health secretary. ""We will not lift measures until it is safe to do so, but we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom."" Follow therest of the briefing here. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Expanding the amount oftesting for Covid-19 in Scotland's care homescould not have been announced earlier than today because the capacity was not there in the system, Scottish Care chief executive Donald Maskill insists. Dr Macaskill admitted the number of deaths in Scottish care homes ""were extremely distressing"" and that ""clearly there will be lessons to be learned and we will do things differently in the future"" as ""we have been overtaken by the global shortage in PPE"". However, he told BBC Radio Scotland that politicians, care providers and frontline workers were doing their best and stressed that ""we also have to remember that the vast majority - over 80% - of even people in their 90s who develop this disease still go on to survive"". ""Even individuals who are receiving end of life treatment can go on and beat this virus,"" he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has just started the UK government's daily coronavirus briefing. He says a further 739 people have died since yesterday, bringing the total across all sectors in the UK to 27,510. He also says the government met its target of 100,000 tests by the end of April, reporting that 122,347 tests were carried out yesterday. You can follow thewhole briefing here. Since lockdown began a debate has been ongoing around cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR is an emergency treatment that tries to restart a person's heart or breathing and its most important components are chest compressions to pump blood around the body, and rescue breaths to provide oxygen, often referred to as the 'kiss of life'. Since the lockdown began health officials have recommended not to use mouth-to-mouth CPR because of the risk of catching a potentially high dosage of Covid-19. But, according to the Resuscitation Council UK, chest compressions are still permitted for members of the public, provided they follow the correct steps. Readmore here. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Today's announcement that testing in care homes is to be expanded to all residents and staff that have one confirmed case of Covid-19""will make an inordinate difference"" according to Scottish Care chief executive Dr Donald Macaskill. ""Scottish Care was calling for this on Wednesday, so we're absolutely delighted,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I agree with the first minister that testing is not a panacea, but it is an additional tool in our battle against coronavirus."" Dr Macaskill, whose body represents the independent care
sector, pointed out that growing evidence shows that, if there is one case, other residents or staff could be infected with the virus, even if they are not yet showing symptoms. ""The announcement will go a long way to give assurance to families and other residents and staff,"" he added. Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News Police Scotland is receiving more calls from the public despite the coronavirus lockdown. A Scottish Police Authority paper revealed there was an initial drop in the volume in the days after the restrictions were introduced. But a report, by Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs for theAudit Risk & Assurance Committee,external, said: ""Call volume
has however increased, and is now higher than average in
comparison to last year with a large amount of these calls from
members of the public looking for advice and guidance on the new
Covid regulations."" At the weekend it emergedrecorded crime in Scotlandis down more than a quarter since 23 March. But public nuisance type incidents - mainly people reporting breaches of social distancing guidelines - have more than doubled compared to this time last year. Looking ahead, the report noted: ""Police Scotland is preparing for the medium and longer term implications of Covid-19 and the possible impacts of a number of scenarios e.g. warmer weather or continuation, relaxation or cessation of current social distancing measures.""

"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has cut his pay by 50% for the rest of the year Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said it will take up to six months to refund passengers for flights cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. He told the BBC the airline was struggling to process a backlog of 25 million refunds with reduced staff. However, he pledged: ""If you want a cash refund, you will receive a cash refund."" Ryanair is set to cut 3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce - as it restructures to cope with the coronavirus crisis. It said the 3,000 posts under threat were mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs. There are likely to be pay cuts of up to 20% for remaining staff, the airline added. Mr O'Leary told the BBC that the planned cuts were ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"". He said that if a vaccine was not found, ""we may have to announce more cuts and deeper cuts in future"". Leaving middle seat empty is idiotic, says Ryanair 'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't' Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund? Brian Strutton, the general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""There has been no warning or consultation by Ryanair about the 3,000 potential job losses and this is miserable news for pilots and staff who have taken pay cuts under the government job retention scheme. ""Ryanair seems to have done a U-turn on its ability to weather the Covid storm."" The restructuring could involve closing some UK regional hubs, Mr O'Leary said, but he would not say which ones were at risk. He said Ryanair hoped to announce details of job losses and pay cuts by 1 July. Mr O'Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend it for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021. Litigation lawyer Jonathan Compton, a partner at law firm DMH Stallard, took issue with the idea that ticket refunds could be delayed. ""Where a flight is cancelled, the legal position is clear, the airline must provide a full refund within seven working days,"" he said. ""Regulators need to get more active here. The relevant regulator is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA must start instructing airlines to start making refunds, no ifs or buts, and it needs to do this now."" Ryanair said it expected to report a net loss of more than â¬100m (Â£87m) for the first three months of the year, with further losses in the second quarter. In a sideswipe at rivals, it said its return to scheduled services would be rendered more difficult by competing with flag carrier airlines, ""who will be financing below cost selling with the benefit of over â¬30bn in unlawful state aid, in breach of both EU state aid and competition rules"". Ryanair said it had entered the coronavirus crisis with reserves of almost â¬4bn in cash and continued to ""actively manage"" those resources in order to survive the pandemic. Mr O'Leary described airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France and Alitalia as ""subsidy junkies running around Europe hoovering up state aid"". Meanwhile, Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air is resuming flights from Luton airport starting on Friday, but passengers will be required to wear masks while on board. The airline is among the first European carriers to begin restoring services that have been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. The flights will be heading for destinations in Spain, Portugal, Israel, Slovakia, Serbia, Romania and Hungary. But Wizz Air warned that because of ""rapid changes in travel restrictions, the list might be adapted"". The move comes despite unchanged advice from the Foreign Office against all foreign non-essential travel. In another development, London's Heathrow airport, normally the busiest in Europe, has said it expects passenger numbers to have fallen 97% in April as demand slumped. Numbers fell 18.8% to 14.6 million during the first three months of the year, the airport said. But it added: ""Heathrow remains open - and continues operating safely to help people get home and to secure vital supply lines for the UK."" Financially, it was ""robust"", it said. ""Heathrow has Â£3.2bn in liquidity, sufficient to maintain the business at least over the next 12 months, even with no passengers,"" it added. Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme that until a coronavirus vaccine could be developed, airports would have to introduce measures to minimise infection once lockdowns started to ease. ""What this might include - and this needs to be agreed with governments and the aviation sector - is a combination of measures and that might include some kind of health screening as you come into the terminal so that perhaps if that's a temperature check, if you have a high temperature, you may not be allowed to fly,"" he said.

"""I don't think I have ever set foot in a Waitrose"" - Amie Smith, with her family Many families are struggling to put food on the table as the coronavirus lockdown robs them of their income.A report by food bank charities,externalpoints to an alarming rise in the number of people in need of essential supplies. How are they coping and what more can be done to help? ""We have gone without meals so the children can eat. It isn't nice when you are feeling hungry and you open the cupboard and there is nothing in there for you."" Amie Smith and her partner Marcus were just about getting by before the coronavirus lockdown. Now they have had to give up their zero hours contract jobs and are relying on universal credit payments, food vouchers from the government and the occasional food parcel from local schools. Their biggest daily struggle is finding enough food in the shops for their four children, aged two to 13. Families still wait for free school meal vouchers 'Emergency food' for families with nothing to eat 'Bare cupboards' as food bank use rises in pandemic The family is getting by on a weekly food budget of about Â£30. The children are entitled to free school meals, which translate into food vouchers during lockdown, but they can't find anywhere to spend them. Amie says she has about Â£200 worth of vouchers, from the government's free school meal voucher scheme. But none of them is for stores in her south London neighbourhood and she is unable to use public transport during the pandemic for health reasons. She is frustrated by the offer of vouchers from what she sees as upmarket stores like Marks & Spencer and Waitrose. ""I don't think I have ever set foot in a Waitrose in my life,"" she said. Their car has broken down, so they find themselves using local convenience stores - which charge higher prices. ""It's becoming very expensive. I just paid Â£5 for 30 eggs. That was the cheapest we could find."" Reid-Angel, two, and Bree, 11, are learning to cope with life in lockdown Labour is calling on the government to ""expand which shops are able to accept free school meal vouchers to include those supermarkets most present in our poorest communities"". Underthe current scheme,external, run by private contractor Edenred, every eligible child is entitled to Â£15 a week in vouchers for food from a selection of supermarkets:  Aldi, McColl's, Morrisons, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Waitrose and M&S. The government says it recognises it may not be convenient for some families to visit one of these shops. It is ""working to see if additional supermarkets can be added to this list"". In the meantime, it is advising schools to prepare food parcels for pupils on free meals. People are seeking help from food banks in record numbers Many families - who may not have children on free school meals - are turning to food banks for essential supplies. This is putting an enormous strain on charities that provide them. A new report by the UK's biggest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, said it handed out 81% more emergency food parcels in the last two weeks of March, than at the same time last year. People struggling with the amount of income they were receiving from working or benefits was the main reason for the increase, the trust said. ""Like a tidal wave gathering pace, an economic crisis is sweeping towards us, but we don't all have lifeboats,"" said chief executive Emma Revie. Sonya Johnson, who runs Ediblelinks, an independent food bank in Warwickshire, has noticed a big increase in families with previously comfortable incomes seeking help. ""There are fresh faces coming through the door,"" she said. ""People who really don't want to be here, who have never used a food bank but suddenly find themselves at a point of crisis."" These new clients tend to be small-business owners, or sole traders, such a hairdressers or cafe proprietors. They are waiting for universal credit payments or money from the government's business loan scheme. The food bank has experienced a 20% increase in demand week-on-week since coronavirus took hold. Extreme financial hardship exists even outside a global pandemic. Debt charity Christians Against Poverty says one in 10 of its clients live without a bed or mattress, or skip meals on a daily basis. It, and others in the sector, fear coronavirus will mean more people living like this - perhaps for the first time. Payment ""holidays"" put off, rather than cancel, regular bills such as rent or council tax. There is concern people are simply piling up unmanageable debt for the future. But there is support. Credit unions can offer low-cost loans for small amounts. People are also donating generously in this crisis and some of that money is given in grants so those in crippling hardship can put food on the table. Charity Turn2us hasa search tool to check eligibility,externalfor these non-repayable grants. The Child Poverty Action Group has also launcheda tool to help people find,externalsupport during the pandemic. No government has had to cope with a crisis on this scale in peacetime and poverty campaigners have welcomed actions to help those in most need, through the benefits system. But a group of charities, including the Trussell Trust, is calling now for a coronavirus emergency income support scheme. They say many families need money urgently, to prevent them being from being ""swept into destitution"". A government spokesman said it was ""committed to supporting all those affected... through these unprecedented times"". ""We've implemented an enormous package of measures to do so, including income protection schemes and mortgage holidays For those in most need, we've injected more than Â£6.5bn into the welfare system, including an increase to universal credit of up to Â£1,040 a year. No-one has to wait five weeks for money as urgent payments are available."" Amie and Marcus are just about managing to feed their children each day. But they are worried what the future holds, if they can't get back to work soon. ""There have been times when we have had nothing but maybe beans on toast to give them,"" says Amie. ""We have to remind ourselves that there are people out there with absolutely nothing. We should be grateful for what we have."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Many polled say they are obeying government advice due to fears of catching the virus When lockdown first started in the UK in the final week of March there was widespread support for the measures aimed at controlling the coronavirus. But have attitudes changed? The country is currently in its seventh week of the greatest curbs on daily life since World War Two. The prime minister says the government will proceed with ""maximum caution""regarding easing restrictions, when he speaks to the country on Sunday evening.However, surveys suggest a significant majority of the British public believe they could cope with the restrictions for another couple of months. A new YouGov poll,externalfinds eight in 10 Britons (82%) reckon they could easily continue with the current lockdown until June. Almost two-thirds (63%) say they would manage well until July, but 50% say they would struggle if they were still stuck indoors until August. For the moment, there is not a public clamour for lockdown to end. Another recent poll showed many would be uncomfortable leaving home, even if restrictions were lifted in a month's time. More than 60% would be uncomfortable about going out to bars and restaurants or using public transport,the Ipsos Mori survey suggested.,external More than 40% would still be reluctant to go shopping or send their children to school and more than 30% would be worried about going to work or meeting friends. The vast majority of people in the UK are obeying the lockdown rules - not because they have been ordered to by the government but because they don't want to catch or spread the virus. Very few actively like being in lockdown, though. Responses to a series of surveys over the last month suggest the country has gone from apprehension at the start through to dejection as the economy shrank and the death toll mounted. People have moved on to frustration in the most recent analysis as restrictions begin to grind and reality dawns as to how long they may last. More people are on the roads than at the beginning of lockdown There is no question that lockdown places a significant strain on households, but is the increasing frustration and boredom translating into exasperation?  Are we reaching the point where people will start to ignore the rules? Some newspapers and politicians have been suggesting the social distancing restrictions are beginning to fray, but the evidence points to a high level of compliance remaining. There have been reports of a slight increase in numbers using their cars, but it is not clear what the reason for that might be.  In part, it may be because more businesses are finding ways to open up and people are returning to work. During the sunny Easter period more people returned to parks and green spaces,Google data suggests,external, although police said the vast majority sought to obey social distancing rules and activity was still well below pre-lockdown levels. Boris Johnson says UK is past the peak of the outbreak How will coronavirus change the way we live? Analysis of surveys conducted by King's College in London suggests there are three broad groups when it comes to lockdown: accepting, suffering and resisting. Just under half of people - 48% - are characterised as accepting, following the rules and coping reasonably well.  At 44%, slightly fewer say they are struggling, often losing sleep, feeling anxious or depressed, but still overwhelmingly trying to obey all the rules. The remaining 9% are resistant to the lockdown, with many of those believing too much fuss is being made about the virus and admitting they are less likely to follow the restrictions. Younger people were more than twice as likely as over 65s to say they were not coping with lockdown People tend to think social isolation will be most difficult for older people, but the survey evidence suggests the opposite is true.  A survey conducted for insight company Britain Thinks finds 42% of 18-24-year-olds say they were not coping with lockdown, more than twice the proportion of those aged over 65. Older people, of course, are likely to have seen less of a change to their lifestyle than the young.  Their housing and income are likely to be more secure.  Their social lives are less about going out to crowded bars and clubs, festivals and sports events. Women appear to be struggling more than men in lockdown, perhaps a consequence of the tendency for them to take on a greater share of domestic responsibilities. Unsurprisingly, poorer people are finding it tougher than those on higher incomes. About 20% of people are worried about their mental health in lockdown, with 11% concerned about anxiety and 7% with concerns about depression, according to a survey conducted for the Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity MQ. The behavioural science that forms part of the government's thinking on the lockdown warned before the restrictions came in that people would struggle to stick to the rules for prolonged periods. However, experts have been struck by how compliant the British public have remained. Other countries, notably the US, have seenvery public rebellions against the restrictions, but here the call to stay home to protect the NHS and save lives seems to have been greeted with very widespread and consistent support.

"The prices of staple goods in Afghanistan are rising fast in the lockdown, aid agencies warn More than seven million children in Afghanistan are at risk of hunger as food prices soar due to the coronavirus pandemic, a report warns. A Save the Children spokesman said the country faced a ""perfect storm of hunger, disease and death"" unless the international community took action. The charity said a third of the population, which includes 7.3 million children, was facing food shortages. The UN recently included Afghanistan in a list of countries at risk of famine. The organisation's World Food Programme (WFP) warnedthe world was facing a ""hunger pandemic"". Afghanistan has suffered almost two decades of war since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001, leaving it with a fractured and impoverished healthcare system. The porous borders where the virus cannot be controlled Five of the countries most at risk from famine Nowruz festival overshadowed by outbreak As cases of coronavirus spread, the government imposed a lockdown in the capital, Kabul, at the end of March and other provinces quickly followed. Movement other than shopping for basic necessities is severely restricted and travelling between cities is banned. Save the Children said the price of food was rising just at the time when children needed adequate daily nutrition to help strengthen their immune systems. Even before the pandemic it was estimated that more than five million Afghan children needed some form of humanitarian support. Latest UN surveys indicate that about two million children aged under five face extreme hunger. Citing figures from the WFP, the report said the price of wheat flour and cooking oil in Afghanistan's main city markets had risen by up to 23% in the past month as demand outstripped supply. The cost of rice, sugar and pulses had increased by between 7%-12%. Coupled with rising prices, the wages of daily labourers are falling as the lockdown caused work to dry up. ""A large portion of the Afghan workforce relies on the informal sector, with no safety nets when work is scarce,"" the report says. With just 0.3 doctors per 1,000 people, Afghanistan's sick and malnourished children are less likely to receive the life-saving treatment they need to survive, Save the Children warned. Timothy Bishop, the charity's country director in Afghanistan, said that for many Afghans the biggest impact of the pandemic would not be the virus itself, but the hunger caused by lockdown measures and a breakdown in supply lines. Health workers in Kabul are trying to stem the number of coronavirus infections ""We are deeply concerned that this pandemic will lead to a perfect storm of hunger, disease and death in Afghanistan unless the world takes action now,"" he said. ""We are facing the very real risk that children could die from starvation. What we need is for the international community to urgently fly in food supplies to be distributed to some of the most vulnerable communities in the country. We also urge the Afghan government to facilitate the rapid distribution of food, despite the nationwide lockdown."" He added: ""Afghan children have suffered enough. Most have known nothing but conflict in their lives. We cannot allow Covid-19 to further rob them of their futures."" So far, Afghanistan has not been among countries most severely affected by the virus, reporting 2,171 cases and 64 deaths. However, it has limited access to testing and the true numbers are believed to be higher. Experts warn that any sudden spike in infections would quickly overwhelm Afghanistan's fragile health system. Kabul's famous Darul Aman Palace is being used as a temporary clinic for Covid-19 patients Its porous borders have raised fears of an unchecked spread of the virus. In March, more than 150,000 Afghans spontaneously returned from Iran, one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus, and tens of thousands have also recently returned from Pakistan. The first confirmed case came at the end of February in Herat province, which borders Iran. Earlier this month, dozens of members ofstaff working at Afghanistan's presidential palace in Kabul reportedly tested positivefor coronavirus. The Afghan government did not comment on the reports and there was no suggestion that President Ashraf Ghani himself had been infected.

"Apple saw growth for the first three months of the year, as falling device sales in China were offset by demand for its streaming services due to the coronavirus lockdown. Sales climbed to $58.3bn (Â£46.2bn), up from $58bn in the same period in 2019 and beating expectations of $54.5bn. Apple boss Tim Cook said the firm saw a ""record for streaming"" and ""phenomenal"" growth in the online store. He added that ""China is headed in the right direction"". Despite the coronavirus lockdown hurting iPhone supply due to Chinese factories closing, and a drop in demand for devices in China - a major market for Apple - during February and March, Mr Cook told investors in an earnings call on Thursday: ""I don't think I can remember a quarter where I've been prouder of Apple."" Apple said iPhone sales for the quarter fell 7.2% to $28.9bn, compared to $31bn in the previous year. However, its wearables, home and accessories division - which produces the Apple Watch and AirPods - rose 22.5% to $6.3bn, while services - such as subscriptions to Apple Music and Apple TV - jumped 16.6% to $13.3bn like-for-like. Although business in China has not fully rebounded, Apple said all of its stores in the country had reopened by mid-March and sales were improving. NHS rejects Apple-Google coronavirus app plan Apple and Google accelerate coronavirus contact tracing apps plan Coronavirus: Apple and France in stand-off over contact-tracing app Net income for the six months ending 28 March 2020 rose 6.2% to $33.5bn, up from $25.9bn in the same period in 2019. Mr Cook said Apple was in a strong position and that its supply chain was ""robust"" and ""back up and running at full-throttle at the end of March"". Tim Cook said the lockdown in China had not damaged Apple's global supply chain ""While we can't say for certain how many chapters are in this book, we can be assured that the ending will be a good one,"" he told investors. Apple said it would not be issuing forecasts for the following quarter, given the ongoing uncertainties of the lockdown, which has seen its sales move online or to curb-side pick-ups. Research firm eMarketer's principal analyst Yoram Wurmser said Apple's performance was ""pretty solid"". ""Growth of 1% in this environment is impressive, particularly given some of the extent of Apple's exposure to the earlier lockdowns in Asia,"" said Mr Wurmser. ""The biggest bright spot for Apple was services, which grew 17% year-over-year. As people spent more time on their phones while locked away at home, they clearly were spending more money in the App Store and on some of the subscription services offered by Apple, including Apple Music and Arcade."" According to Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, the rise in demand for wearables and services is an encouraging one for Apple, given recent lacklustre iPhone sales growth. ""Despite plenty of talk around services, Apple is still very much a hardware business. And even before coronavirus, conditions weren't perfect,"" she said. Ms Lund-Yates added that Apple's decision to price the new iPhone SE at half the cost of some of Apple's most recent models is a good way to convince customers to upgrade during the lockdown.

"This video can not be played Brian May on re-making We Are The Champions for the NHS Brian May says the failure to stockpile crucial protective equipment ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic is ""heartbreaking and horrendous"". The Queen star told the BBC he was ""angry and sad"" that healthcare workers were ""expected to go in and risk their lives"" without proper protection. ""People have died. Young people who had their whole lives ahead of them. I find it absolutely heartbreaking,"" he said. The government said it was ""determined to overcome the challenges"" with PPE.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We're determined urgently to overcome those challenges that have become so infuriating. I'm not going to minimise the logistical problems we have faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people at the right time, both in the NHS and in care homes."" He added: ""Everyone responsible for tackling these problems is throwing everything at it, heart and soul, night and day, to get it right. And we're making huge progress."" Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? May was speaking as Queen released a new version of their hit single We Are The Champions in support of frontline healthcare workers.

Brian May on 40 years of Bohemian Rhapsody: 'I still listen to it in the car' Queen reprise Live Aid set at bushfire concert Music artists unite for Live Lounge charity single Queen's single came about after the band's tour was postponed due to the coronavirus earlier this year. ""I isolated very early on,"" May told the BBC. ""To me, it was a no brainer. ""This virus was about to invade, the only weapon we had was to have less human interaction. So I thought, I'm doing it for the sake of my own health and for the sake of my family, and for the sake of everyone, really."" The guitarist said the new song was recorded on iPhones and laptops To pass the time, he started sharing tutorials on how to play some of Queen's most popular songs,including Bohemian Rhapsody,external, on Instagram. Those lessons morphed into jam sessions with fans; and eventually May teamed up with Taylor to play We Are The Champions. The guitarist said he had an ""inkling"" it could become something bigger, but it wasn't until Lambert added his vocals that the plan crystallised. ""I sent an email round to everyone and said, 'You know, we can change the odd word, if we like, to make it mean something different,' and we had the medics in mind because we're out there clapping every Thursday night. ""So I thought, 'Well, what can you change? Should it be like. 'You've paid your dues?' ""[Then] Adam went in there and he just changed those couple of words in the last chorus. So instead of 'we are the champions it became 'you are the champions'. ""We all went 'Yes, that's right. That's just a nice little subtle change'. ""It means that we are all applauding you, because you are now the champions. You are the warriors that are saving humanity on this planet."" The single, which is released on Friday 1 May, stems from those original sessions, with overdubs from May and Queen's touring bassist Neil Fairclough. ""It was all recorded on iPhones and laptops,"" May confessed. ""But it  just shows you don't have to have a multi-million dollar studio to make a record."" Queen and Adam Lambert performing on Instagram Coincidentally, We Are The Champions was originally inspired by You'll Never Walk Alone, which has become an unofficial anthem of unity during the coronavirus pandemic. At the height of their success in 1977, the band played a gig at Bingley Hall in Stafford - and when singer Freddie Mercury left the stage, the crowd started singing the Rodgers & Hammerstein song in the hope of getting an encore. ""I can still remember Freddie's face going, 'What is this? We should be embracing it, we should be loving it and encouraging it,'"" May recalled. ""So I think at that moment We Are The Champions was born, and We Will Rock You was born - because we were consciously involving our audience from that point on. ""I love that. I love that about Queen and I'm proud of the fact that we've kind of generated a community in our audience. It's brilliant."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played Brian May on re-making We Are The Champions for the NHS Brian May says the failure to stockpile crucial protective equipment ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic is ""heartbreaking and horrendous"". The Queen star told the BBC he was ""angry and sad"" that healthcare workers were ""expected to go in and risk their lives"" without proper protection. ""People have died. Young people who had their whole lives ahead of them. I find it absolutely heartbreaking,"" he said. The government said it was ""determined to overcome the challenges"" with PPE. ABBC Panorama investigationthis week discovered that there were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK. More than 100 NHS and healthcare workers known to have died with the virus during the outbreak. ""I think we as a nation have to be ashamed that we were not prepared,"" said May. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We're determined urgently to overcome those challenges that have become so infuriating. I'm not going to minimise the logistical problems we have faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people at the right time, both in the NHS and in care homes."" He added: ""Everyone responsible for tackling these problems is throwing everything at it, heart and soul, night and day, to get it right. And we're making huge progress."" Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? May was speaking as Queen released a new version of their hit single We Are The Champions in support of frontline healthcare workers. Re-titled You Are The Champions, the single was put together under lockdown with May and drummer Roger Taylor playing in London, and touring singer Adam Lambert recording his vocals in LA. Proceeds will go to the World Health Organisation's Covid-19 fund, which supports medics around the world. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"Amazon sales surged in the first three months of the year, as the coronavirus lockdown boosted demand for the firm's groceries, online marketplace and cloud computing services. Sales in the quarter jumped 26% year-on-year and the firm said they could rise another 28% in the next. But the demand has strained the internet giant. It said it would spend roughly $4bn (Â£3.2bn) on coronavirus measures through June. Those costs reflect increased worker pay, purchases of masks and other protective gear, expenses related to cleaning and less efficient warehouses, as the firm implements social distancing measures. ""The current crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon's business as never before, but it's also the hardest time we've ever faced,"" said Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. ""If you're a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat because we're not thinking small,"" he said. ""I'm confident that our long term-oriented shareowners will understand and embrace our approach."" Amazon boss Jeff Bezos adds $24bn to fortune Amazon workers strike over virus protection 'Not smart' memo shows Amazon's union stance Amazon, with its dominance in e-commerce, video streaming and cloud computing services, plus its acquisition of the Whole Foods supermarket chain, is well poised to benefit from the changes to consumer habits forced by the pandemic. The online giant reported gains across the company.  The e-commerce business rose 24%, while sales at its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services - a significant profit driver - jumped 33%. Even its advertising unit fared well. And at Whole Foods, which Amazon purchased in 2017, sales climbed about 8%. That performance presents a sharp contrast to many other companies, which are reeling amid forced closures and plunging consumer spending as economists forecast the world's sharpest slowdown since the 1930s. ""It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone,"" said Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali. ""A lot of physical stores around the world were closed and that drives a lot of people online and they are a huge beneficiary of online."" From a customer perspective, Ms Kodali said Amazon's performance has been somewhat lacking, with slower shipping times and many items out of stock. Its brand has also taken a beating, as workers around the world complain of inadequate safety precautions. Amazon's brand has taken a beating amid worker concerns about safety Despite those issues, Ms Kodali said she expected the firm to maintain its advantage over the long term, as rivals suffering losses due to closures are prevented from making investments that would help them compete. ""All signs point toward Amazon continuing to win - not because of anything that Amazon has done, but because of what the others can't do,"" she said. Amazon has scrambled to adjust its operations in reaction to the coronavirus risks. The company has hired 175,000 people in its fulfilment and delivery network and nearly doubled the Whole Foods stores that offer pick-up services. On Thursday, the firm said it had purchased 100 million face masks and 31,000 thermometers, which it is using for daily temperature checks. But the firm's expenses have shot up, with shipping costs alone surging 49% to nearly $11bn. This weighed on the firm's profits, which fell 29% from a year earlier to $2.5bn, lower than analysts had expected. Shares, which have surged more than 30% this year, slumped in after-hours trade. But the firm will be able to benefit long term from shifts happening now, like increased online grocery shopping, said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at eMarketer, ""It would be very short-term thinking to just look at what happens in this quarter alone,"" he said. Despite economic weakness, Amazon's sales are relatively ""immunised"" from declines for now, he added. ""If we come out of this in a deep recession and people can get back to normal in terms of bricks and mortar buying, then that's when Amazon like everyone else, will take a hit,"" he said.

"This video can not be played WATCH: 'One of two things happened' US President Donald Trump has appeared to undercut his own intelligence agencies by suggesting he has seen evidence coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. Earlier the US national intelligence director's office said it was still investigating how the virus began. But the office said it had determined Covid-19 ""was not manmade or genetically modified"". China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19. Since emerging in China last year, the virus has killed 230,000 people worldwide including 63,000 in the US. Simple ways you can help during the pandemic Has US tested more than rest of world combined? The pandemic has seen at least 3.2 million people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan. At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: ""Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?"" ""Yes, I have. Yes, I have,"" said the president, without specifying. ""And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China."" Asked later to clarify his comment, he said:  ""I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that."" This video can not be played Michigan protesters decry Covid-19 state of emergency He also told reporters: ""Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose? ""I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer."" Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on,unnamed officials told NBC News.,external In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the ""wide scientific consensus"" regarding Covid-19's natural origins. Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release idea? China and the US trade coronavirus conspiracy theories ""The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan."" It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory. Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats. The foundation of the Wuhan lab boosted China's international prestige Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (Â£35m), the lab opened in 2015.Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon,external, Nature journal reports. It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety Level 4 lab with links to similar labs around the world. Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing. On Wednesday, he suggestedChina wanted him to losehis re-election bid in November. He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body. Can we trust China claims of virus success? China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. According to the Washington Post,the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially,external. Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations. In January,he called US intelligence agencies ""naive"" on Iranand dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election in 2016, when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign. Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despiteUS charges brought against Russian citizens. President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead. Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight. China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game. Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.
