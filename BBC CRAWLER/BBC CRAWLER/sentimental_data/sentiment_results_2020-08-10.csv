"The 2,000-tonne machines will make a tunnel under the Chilterns starting in 2021 Two tunnelling machines bought to help build HS2 have been unveiled by the firm behind the high-speed rail line. The excavators will bore a 10 mile (16km) tunnel through part of the Chilterns, from a site near the M25 to near South Heath in Buckinghamshire, HS2 Ltd chief executive Mark Thurston said the machines would ""be a defining moment in the history of HS2"". But campaigners said HS2 was ""decimating countryside and creating a huge financial burden"". The two 2,000-tonne machines, built at a factory in Germany, will dig as deep as 80m (262ft) below ground. They have been named Cecilia and Florence, after Buckinghamshire-born astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin and Florence Nightingale, following a public vote from a shortlist of suggestions made by local schoolchildren. The site near Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, next to the M25, where the tunnel will start has been cleared The plans for HS2 were first outlined more than a decade ago. The initial stage, due to be completed between 2028-31, will connect London and the West Midlands, while the second section will extend into the East Midlands and north of England. HS2 minister Andrew Stephenson said: ""HS2 will provide better, more reliable connections that truly level up our country, boosting economic growth and sharing opportunities."" Florence will be launched in early 2021, with Cecilia beginning the other half of the tunnel about a month later. Both machines are 170m (558ft) long and have been designed for the chalk and flint under the Chilterns. They will run almost non-stop and are expected to take about three years to excavate the tunnel, which will be lined with concrete. When will HS2 open and how much will it cost? Six reasons why HS2 is so expensive Engineers move 2,750-tonne HS2 bridge on to M42 In May,a report by MPs found the project was ""badly off course""and accused HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport of lacking transparency and undermining public confidence. Campaigners against HS2 staged aweek-long protest along the line's routein June, saying funds for the project should be used for the country's economic recovery following the coronavirus lockdown instead.

"Steve Easterbrook, pictured with company mascot Ronald McDonald, the month he became head of McDonald's in 2015 McDonald's has taken new legal action against former chief executive Steve Easterbrook, accusing him of lying about sexual relationships with staff. The company fired Mr Easterbrook last year after finding he had a consensual relationship with an employee. But the firm says further investigation found the British executive had three additional relationships with staff, about which he lied to the board. McDonald's is suing to recover his pay-off, reportedly worth $40m (Â£35m). The fast food giant prohibits ""any kind of intimate relationship between employees in a direct or indirect reporting relationship"". At the time of Mr Easterbrook's removal in November, McDonald's said it had evidence of only of a non-physical, consensual relationship, consisting of intimate text messages and video calls. It agreed to terminate Mr Easterbrook's contract ""without cause"", fearing a protracted legal battle, according to the firm's legal filing. But after receiving a tip from an employee in July, the fast food giant started a second investigation, which uncovered ""undisputable evidence"" of three other sexual relationships. McDonald's boss fired after dating employee McDonald's workers file $500m sexual harassment suit It says investigators found nude photographs sent from Mr Easterbrook's company email account as well as messages showing that he approved a grant of company shares worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to one of the employees ""shortly after their first sexual encounter"". McDonald's said that had it been aware of this information, it would not have approved his multi-million dollar pay-off. McDonald's said it did not initially find the photos and messages because Mr Easterbrook had deleted them from his phone. The second investigation also searched company servers. It said Mr Easterbrook violated his duty to the company by lying when asked about his behaviour in an effort to secure a bigger severance package, committing fraud. Mr Easterbrook, who is divorced, could not immediately be reached for comment. At the time of his dismissal, he acknowledged a relationship in an email to staff, calling it a ""mistake"". ""Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,"" he wrote. McDonald's claims Steve Easterbrook lied Mr Easterbrook, a UK citizen who grew up in Watford, Hertfordshire, led McDonald's from March 2015 to November 2019, after previously leading its UK operations. He was widely credited with revitalising the firm's menus, remodelling stores and using better ingredients. The value of its shares more than doubled during his tenure in the US. Last year, he received more than $17m in total compensation. The size of Mr Easterbrook's severance package had drawn earlier pushback, including from a shareholder advisory group. The firm has also faced accusations that it has not taken sexual harassment seriously. In April, US workers filed a class-action lawsuit against McDonald's, accusing the fast food giant of fostering ""systemic sexual harassment"". A global coalition of labour unions filed a similar complaint with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in May. At the time, one of the organisers, Sue Longley, general secretary of the International Union of Foodworkers, said the firm had a ""culture rotten from the top"".

"Melting permafrost in Alaska and other northern regions could unleash large amounts of warming gases from peatlands The world's peatlands will become a large source of greenhouse gases as temperatures rise this century, say scientists. Right now, huge amounts of carbon are stored in boggy, often frozen regions stretching across northern parts of the world. But much of the permanently frozen land will thaw this century, say experts. This will release warming gases at a rate that could be 30-50% greater than previous estimates. UK peat emissions could cancel forest benefits Widespread drying of European peatlands Lockdown has 'negligible' impact on temperatures Significant jump in Emperor penguins numbers Stretching across vast regions of the northern half of the world, peatlands play an important role in the global climate system. Over thousands of years, they have accumulated large amounts of carbon and nitrogen, which has helped keep the Earth cool. The eroding edge of a permafrost peat plateau in the western Russian Arctic Scientists, though, are keenly aware that peatlands - including the nearly half that are permanently frozen - are very vulnerable to rising temperatures. But, until now, a lack of accurate maps has made it difficult to fully estimate the impact of climate on peat. Using data compiled from more than 7,000 field observations, the authors of this new study were able to generate the most accurate maps to date of the peatlands, their depth and the amount of warming gases they contain. They show that the boggy terrain covers 3.7 million sq kilometres (1.42 million sq miles). A degrading permafrost peat mound in Sweden The researchers say the northern peatlands store around 415 gigatonnes of carbon. That's roughly equivalent to 46 years of current global CO2 emissions. In their study, the authors projected that the peatlands would become a major source of CO2 as the world warms up. One key question is when this will happen. ""Unfortunately, we cannot put exact times to these numbers so far, the models are not that advanced yet,"" said lead author Gustaf Hugelius from Stockholm University, Sweden. ""But my best estimate is that this shift will occur in the second half of this century."" So what would be the likely impact of this thawing? The report authors say that their new estimate of the carbon emitted through thawing, and from losses of peat into rivers and streams, is 30-50% greater than in previous projections of carbon losses from permafrost thawing. An aerial view of peatland in Siberia If this new peatland estimate is included with all the estimates for permafrost melting, it is projected to equal the annual emissions of the EU and UK by 2100. ""The only way to limit the permafrost carbon feedback is to reduce global warming,"" said Dr Hugelius. ""Because the Arctic warms twice as fast as the rest of the globe, the higher warming pathways that we are on now are devastating for the permanently frozen parts of the globe."" While the future for peatlands frozen or otherwise, in a warmer world is undeniably difficult. it is not without hope. Experts say that with the right investment to protect and restore non-frozen peatlands, the bogs can continue to soak up and store large amounts of CO2. Similarly, as frozen peat thaws out it starts to become capable of growing plants and storing warming gases. While the new study says it might take a couple of centuries for peatlands to start absorbing large amounts of CO2, others believe it might happen much sooner., ""If the climate warms and the conditions are better for the vegetation, vegetation can respond in a matter of decades,"" said Clifton Bain, who is the director of theIUCN UK Peatland Programme,external. ""We've seen in the UK when you destroy a peatland and rip away the surface vegetation and drain it, if you re-wet it and there's a source of sphagnum moss there, they will re grow within a matter of decades. So, it is possible in the right conditions for the bulk vegetation to recover very quickly."" Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"Manchester United have won 21 penalties in all competitions this season - the most for any side in Europe's top five leagues Manchester United needed an extra-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes to finally see off a spirited FC Copenhagen and set up a potential Europa League semi-final against Wolves. United were poor for much of the first half in the heat of Cologne but still had a penalty overturned and a goal ruled out by the Video Assistant Referee. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side improved and dominated the second half but could find no way past inspired goalkeeper Karl-Johan Johnsson, with Fernandes and Mason Greenwood also each hitting the post and Marcus Rashford having another effort disallowed. Fernandes finally broke through in familiar style, keeping cool to drive in United's 21st spot-kick of the season at the start of the extra period to extend their marathon season by another week. Johnsson was magnificent between the posts for Copenhagen - ending the night with 13 saves as United rained down 26 efforts on goal all told - while the Danish runners-up failed to have a single shot on target. United - who won this competition four seasons ago - will now face either Premier League rivals Wolves or Europa League specialists Sevilla in the last four in Dusseldorf on Sunday night. Follow reaction from Manchester United v FC Copenhagen, plus Inter Milan v Bayer Leverkusen Europa League 'final eight' begins - all you need to know Three hundred and sixty-four days after Solskjaer started his first full season in charge of United, he is now two games away from a possible first trophy. The January signing of Fernandes has already delivered a third-placed finish and Champions League football and the Portuguese midfielder was again the eventual difference maker on a draining night in scorching heat. The temperature was still 32C at kick-off at 9pm local time and United made a poor start - Fred's error almost letting in Mohammed Daramy, before Brandon Williams had to head away from the goal-line. But despite their lethargy, United always carried a threat and were briefly awarded a penalty for a shove at a set-piece before VAR flagged an offside in the build-up. Greenwood finished brilliantly off the far post but the strike was correctly called back for another offside before Solskjaer witnessed a far better second half. Greenwood fired against the post again, with his left foot this time, Rashford tapping in but again from an offside position before Fernandes thundered a shot against the opposite post from range. Johnsson's individual showreel then threatened to throw a spanner in the works. Perhaps the Swedish keeper's best save denied Anthony Martial, who eventually won the decisive penalty thanks to a push from former Brentford defender Andreas Bjelland. Fernandes fired into the corner without his trademark hop on approach to ensure a 17th European semi-final for United. Karl-Johan Johnsson made 13 saves this evening, the joint-most by a goalkeeper in a single Europa League game since the competition's re-branding in 2009-10.

"Jonathan Mok posted a selfie and another photo of his injuries on Facebook A 15-year-old boy has admitted attacking a student from Singapore who was told ""we don't want your coronavirus in our country"". Jonathan Mok, 23, was beaten up on Oxford Street near Tottenham Court Road Tube station on 24 February. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court to wounding or grievous bodily harm without intent. He will be sentenced at the same court next month. Prosecutor Beata Murphy said the teenager had been with a group of friends when they saw UCL  student Mr Mok walking along Oxford Street just after 21:00 GMT. She added: ""He [the victim] heard someone say something about coronavirus and he turned around and was told 'don't you look at me'. ""He was then punched in the face... until a passerby said to stop assaulting Mr Mok. ""He believes he was targeted because of ethnicity."" Jonathan Mok had been walking home after having dinner in central London Images of Mr Mok's bruised and swollen eye posted on Facebook were shared thousands of times following the attack. X-rays showed he had suffered a complicated fracture to his nose and also to his cheekbone. Mrs Murphy said during his police interviews the boy was ""silent"" until CCTV images were shown to him when he said ""you can't even see me hit him"". Defence barrister Gerard Pitt said the boy was not charged with racially aggravated assault. District Judge Nicholas Rimmer adjourned sentencing until 7 September for a report to be prepared. Afterwards the Crown Prosecution Service's Daniel Kavanagh said the attack was ""vicious and completely unprovoked"". ""He was clearly targeted in this hate crime because of his ethnic appearance.

"Diners used the ""eat out to help out"" scheme more than 10.5 million times in its first week, the Treasury has said. Under the scheme, which is intended to boost the struggling hospitality sector, the government pays for 50% of a meal eaten at a cafe, restaurant or pub on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. The discount, which is due to run through August, is capped at Â£10. Treasury estimates put the average claim at close to Â£5, making the cost of the policy around Â£50m so far. HMRC said that, as of 9 August, it had received 10,540,394 claims under the scheme. Chancellor Rishi Sunak described the figures as ""amazing"", adding those using the scheme were helping support the hospitality sector. How can I use the 'eat out to help out' scheme? 'We've had 15,000 bookings for eat out to help out' The government has set aside Â£500m to fund the policy. And it has already led to an increase in the number of people visiting High Streets across the country, according to Springboard, which measures footfall figures. It said the number of people in retail destinations after 18:00 BST last Monday, the first day of the scheme, was 19% higher than the week before. Meanwhile lunchtime visits were up 10%. However, visits to High Streets are still down significantly compared to the same time last year. The Treasury said that 83,068 restaurants had signed up to the scheme. They include fast-fast food chains like McDonald's and KFC as well as lots of local, independent pubs, restaurants and cafes. Government figures show that 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and that 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector. ""Britons are eating out to help out in big numbers,"" said Mr Sunak. ""And they aren't just getting a great deal - they're supporting the almost 2 million people employed in this sector,"" he said. The discount is only on food and soft drinks eaten on the premises, so it does not apply to takeaways. There is no limit on how many times the discount can be used in August, or for how many people, including children. Will the 'eat out to help out scheme' be extended?

"This video can not be played Lebanese government resigns as public anger grows Lebanon's government has resigned amid mounting anger over the explosion on Tuesday that devastated parts of Beirut and left more than 200 people dead. The announcement was made in a national TV address by Prime Minister Hassan Diab on Monday evening. Many people have accused the country's leaders of culpability through their alleged negligence and corruption. Protesters have taken to the streets and clashed with police for a third straight day. The massive blast was caused by the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at the port for years. President Michel Aoun has asked the government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet is formed. Mr Diab, who was appointed prime minister in January after months of deadlock, said his government had ""gone to great lengths to lay out a road map to save the country"". But corruption in Lebanon was ""bigger than the state"" itself, and ""a very thick and thorny wall separates us from change; a wall fortified by a class that is resorting to all dirty methods in order to resist and preserve its gains"", he said. Why Lebanon is in crisis ""They knew that we pose a threat to them, and that the success of this government means a real change in this long-ruling class whose corruption has asphyxiated the country,"" he added. ""Today we follow the will of the people in their demand to hold accountable those responsible for the disaster that has been in hiding for seven years, and their desire for real change,"" Mr Diab said. Protesters angry about corruption threw fireworks in Beirut on Monday The prime minister presented himself in the speech as a reforming leader blocked by endemic corruption dating back years, BBC Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman says. Parliament will now have to decide on a new prime minister - a process involving the same sectarian politics at the root of protesters' discontent, our correspondent adds. It is unlikely to be a smooth or quick process due to the country's complex political system. Power in Lebanon is shared between leaders representing the country's different religious groups. Additionally, following the end of the 1975-1990 civil war a number of warlords entered politics and still control large parts of the country's political, economic and social sectors. Many protesters blame this entrenched system for the country's corruption. This video can not be played Starting with the epicentre, we follow how the 4 August blast ripped through the city, bringing life to a halt On Monday police clashed with angry residents as protests continued in the capital following the government's resignation. Footage showed protesters gathering near barriers leading to the parliament building as security forces fired tear gas at them. The death toll from last week's explosion has risen to 220 with 110 people still missing, Beirut city governor Marwan Abboud was quoted by the al-Marsad Online news website as saying. Many foreign workers and lorry drivers were among the missing, he told Al Jadeed TV channel. Riot police fired weapons during anti-government protests in Beirut The huge blast damaged buildings in a radius of several kilometres in Beirut, leaving more than 200,000 people homeless or living in homes with no windows or doors. Officials estimate that the explosion caused more than $3bn (Â£2.3bn) of damage and that Lebanon's collective economic losses may amount to $15bn. The country was already suffering a major economic downturn before the explosion, with families pushed into poverty and hunger. The inferno and the mystery ship Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images 'We don't have dreams any more' What we know about the blast Discontent in Lebanon has been brewing for years. In late 2019, a plan to tax Whatsapp calls spilled over into mass protests against economic turmoil and corruption, which eventually led to the government's resignation. Coronavirus had curbed the protests, but the financial situation has continued to worsen and last Tuesday's explosion was seen by many as the deadly result of years of corruption and mismanagement. Police and protesters clashed in Beirut on Monday The government's plans to investigate were not enough for many  who have lost all faith in the political elite. Before the cabinet's resignation, a number of ministers had already offered to step down. But the end of this government does not necessarily mean an end to the anger. Last year's protests led to the formation of the government which has now been forced to step down over the same accusations of corruption.

"Melting permafrost in Alaska and other northern regions could unleash large amounts of warming gases from peatlands The world's peatlands will become a large source of greenhouse gases as temperatures rise this century, say scientists. Right now, huge amounts of carbon are stored in boggy, often frozen regions stretching across northern parts of the world. But much of the permanently frozen land will thaw this century, say experts. This will release warming gases at a rate that could be 30-50% greater than previous estimates. UK peat emissions could cancel forest benefits Widespread drying of European peatlands Lockdown has 'negligible' impact on temperatures Significant jump in Emperor penguins numbers Stretching across vast regions of the northern half of the world, peatlands play an important role in the global climate system. Over thousands of years, they have accumulated large amounts of carbon and nitrogen, which has helped keep the Earth cool. The eroding edge of a permafrost peat plateau in the western Russian Arctic Scientists, though, are keenly aware that peatlands - including the nearly half that are permanently frozen - are very vulnerable to rising temperatures. But, until now, a lack of accurate maps has made it difficult to fully estimate the impact of climate on peat. Using data compiled from more than 7,000 field observations, the authors of this new study were able to generate the most accurate maps to date of the peatlands, their depth and the amount of warming gases they contain. They show that the boggy terrain covers 3.7 million sq kilometres (1.42 million sq miles). A degrading permafrost peat mound in Sweden The researchers say the northern peatlands store around 415 gigatonnes of carbon. That's roughly equivalent to 46 years of current global CO2 emissions. In their study, the authors projected that the peatlands would become a major source of CO2 as the world warms up. One key question is when this will happen. ""Unfortunately, we cannot put exact times to these numbers so far, the models are not that advanced yet,"" said lead author Gustaf Hugelius from Stockholm University, Sweden. ""But my best estimate is that this shift will occur in the second half of this century."" So what would be the likely impact of this thawing? The report authors say that their new estimate of the carbon emitted through thawing, and from losses of peat into rivers and streams, is 30-50% greater than in previous projections of carbon losses from permafrost thawing. An aerial view of peatland in Siberia If this new peatland estimate is included with all the estimates for permafrost melting, it is projected to equal the annual emissions of the EU and UK by 2100. ""The only way to limit the permafrost carbon feedback is to reduce global warming,"" said Dr Hugelius. ""Because the Arctic warms twice as fast as the rest of the globe, the higher warming pathways that we are on now are devastating for the permanently frozen parts of the globe."" While the future for peatlands frozen or otherwise, in a warmer world is undeniably difficult. it is not without hope. Experts say that with the right investment to protect and restore non-frozen peatlands, the bogs can continue to soak up and store large amounts of CO2. Similarly, as frozen peat thaws out it starts to become capable of growing plants and storing warming gases. While the new study says it might take a couple of centuries for peatlands to start absorbing large amounts of CO2, others believe it might happen much sooner., ""If the climate warms and the conditions are better for the vegetation, vegetation can respond in a matter of decades,"" said Clifton Bain, who is the director of theIUCN UK Peatland Programme,external. ""We've seen in the UK when you destroy a peatland and rip away the surface vegetation and drain it, if you re-wet it and there's a source of sphagnum moss there, they will re grow within a matter of decades. So, it is possible in the right conditions for the bulk vegetation to recover very quickly."" Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

We're about to pause our live coverage for the day - thank you for joining us. Here is a round-up of the day's biggest developments from across the globe: Florida on Monday reported just over 4,200 new cases - the lowest new case count in the state since 23 June. The Sunshine State also reported 91 additional deaths. Last month, Florida was one of several US states seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases, at one point seeing consecutive days with over 10,000 new cases. Critics blamed a hasty reopening and lack of statewide regulations for the rise. While this signals a positive trend, Florida isn't out of the woods yet - there are still more than 30,000 residents in hospital for Covid-19, though emergency department visits have also been on the decline in the last two weeks. In all, more than 530,000 Floridians have tested positive for the virus and more than 8,000 have died. The state's positive test rate is also dropping, but remains high. Florida Senator Marco Rubio said the numbers were ""good news"" but cautioned: ""We need to stay on this track and not let complacency put us back in another surge."" The artistic director of London's Young Vic Theatre, Kwame Kwei-Armah, has said a woman removed her mask to cough in the face of his 15-year-old son on public transport. The director and playwright, who is black, tweeted about the incident, saying the white women then ran off the train shouting, ""this is what you people do"". He added that he was ""relieved"" his son had subsequently tested negative for coronavirus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Will GrantBBC News, Havana Cuba has registered its highest daily number of coronavirus cases after a recent rise in local transmission. The health ministry reported 93 cases just as the capital Havana re-entered a period of tighter restrictions. The recent spike in numbers comes after Cuba appeared to have successfully controlled the outbreak. While just 93 positive cases in 24 hours might be considered an enviable figure by countries where the pandemic is at its most fierce, in Cuba it represents a step backwards. Having recently registered no cases and no deaths from Covid-19 on one day a few weeks back, the island has gradually slid back to a situation where it has recorded its highest daily figure. Havana is facing a tightening of controls. Under the governmentâs phased system of restrictions, public transport has been suspended, inter-provincial travel prohibited, bars and restaurants ordered shut and the beaches closed. Fortunately, for the time being, deaths have not risen from the 88 people who had died from the virus by the beginning of the month. However, the effort to see tourism pick up has suffered a setback, further worsening the islandâs dire economic outlook for this year. Joshua NevettBBC News Dr Firass Abiad said his hospital was ""close to capacity"" Lebanonâs main Covid-19 hospital in Beirut is âclose to capacityâ after a spike in infections and last weekâs explosion led to an influx of patients, its director has said. Dr Firass Abiad, chief executive of Rafic Hariri University Hospital, told the BBC there has been an exponential rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Lebanon recently. A further 294 virus infections were recorded on Sunday, the biggest increase yet over a 24-hour period,according to Lebanonâs health ministry,external. More than 100 new infections have been recorded every day since 21 July, placing strain on Lebanonâs healthcare system. âObviously weâre extremely close to capacity, especially when it comes to ICU beds. Weâre working within the 90% plus occupancy rate,â Dr Abiad said. âThis is worrisome because we have to factor in what happened after the explosion.â The explosion, which killed more than 200 people and caused widespread destruction, made it difficult for people to abide by coronavirus regulations, like social distancing, Dr Abiad said. This will probably âaugment the rise in Covid-19 cases weâre already seeingâ, Dr Abiad added.

But the coronavirus rules vary from school to school across Germany, as education is a matter for each federal state. At Graues Kloster, a private school in Berlin, masks are worn in the classroom, as well as in corridors and other communal areas. Masks and social distancing are being hotly debated in Germany, even as classes resume. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The government will be reducing the number of people employed to track down contacts of those who have tested positive for
coronavirus from 18,000 to 12,000. NHS Test and Trace, working with Public
Health England, will put greater emphasis on contact tracing at a local level, with local authorities getting their own dedicated teams. In May, Health Secretary Matt Hancock
announced that an âarmyâ of contact tracers would be recruited for England's test
and trace service. Early on, there were reports that new recruits were sitting
idle â with one telling the BBC that she spent her time watching Netflix. Some 6,000 of them are now being stood down in England.
More of their work will be conducted by local staff with knowledge of their
area. The Department of Health has said that this is to provide a âmore
tailored approachâ which has been successfully trialled in Blackburn, Luton and
Leicester. But critics will see it as the latest example of
the government departing from its centralised approach to tackling the
outbreak. Plans to launch a national app to identify potentially infected people have been repeatedly delayed. Now the
top-down high-tech strategy for contact tracing is making way for what
seasoned local public health officials describe as old fashioned âshoe leather
epidemiologyâ. This relies on people with local knowledge collecting
information by going door-to-door on foot. Read the full story here. Young people in the US continue to be most affected by the economic crash caused by Covid-19, with one new report putting the figure for unemployed millennials on par with the number of Americans who have been infected. The Wall Street Journal reports that 4.8m millenials have lost their job due to the shutdown, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis. More than 5m Americans have tested positive for Covid-19., more than a quarter of all the cases in the world. Millennials are less likely to have savings, and more likely to lose their job amid the pandemic, experts say. A further 21 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK, taking the total number of people who have died after testing positive for the virus to 46,526. Public Health England said 69 historical deaths had been removed from the total because the individuals were later found not to have been positive for Covid-19. The latest government figures,externalalso showed 816 new cases had been recorded. Earlier we reported there had been eight deaths recorded today, due to partially updated information on the government's coronavirus data dashboard. Jonathan Mok posted a selfie and another photo of his injuries on Facebook A 15-year-old boy has admitted attacking a student from Singapore who was told ""we don't want your coronavirus in our country"". Jonathan Mok, 23, was beaten up on Oxford Street near Tottenham Court Road Tube station in London on 24 February. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court to wounding or grievous bodily harm without intent. He will be sentenced at the same court next month. Prosecutor Beata Murphy said the teenager had been with a group of friends when they saw UCL student Mr Mok walking along Oxford Street just after 21:00 GMT. She added: ""He [the victim] heard someone say something about coronavirus and he turned around and was told 'don't you look at me'. ""He was then punched in the face... until a passerby said to stop assaulting Mr Mok. ""He believes he was targeted because of ethnicity."" Read more here. From today face coveringsare compulsory in shops and other enclosed spaces in Northern Ireland. The move was broadly welcomed by both shoppers and retailers in east Belfast. One customer said she found wearing a face covering ""difficult"" but felt it was something she would have to get used to. Mark Thompson, whose partner is a health worker, said he has been wearing a face covering since the start of the pandemic and is glad that more people will doing the same. ""I think it's a bit irresponsible if you don't wear a mask, specifically in shops,"" he said. Stephen Bradley, who is a business owner in Belfast city centre, said: ""We are leaving the onus on the individual."" ""We have masks on ourselves when we are in the shop to make people feel as safe as possible,"" he added. However, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has said the primary responsibility for enforcement will lie with shops owners - and the force would only use enforcement ""as a last resort"", with fines of up to Â£60 for those who don't comply.

deployed 43,000 volunteers to assist in preventing the spread of the pandemic, the International Red Cross says. It comes after North Korean leader Kim Jong- un declared an emergency in July,  and imposed a lockdown on the city of Kaesong. State media said thata man who defected to South Korea in 2017 had returnedand was showing symptoms of Covid-19. The secretive state had previously not reported any virus cases andKim Jong-un hailed his country's ""shining success"" in dealing with Covid-19. However, experts say that it is unlikely the country had zero virus cases. There have been rumours of Covid-19 cases in North Korea for months, but the country's tightly-controlled society and state media have made them impossible to confirm, analysts say. Joshua NevettJournalist, BBC World Online More than 200 people are believed to have been killed by Tuesday's explosion The director of Lebanon's main Covid-19 hospital has told the BBC that he believes people angered by last week's blast are not
listening to government coronavirus rules. ""Weâre seeing is that people are becoming very tired and very angry,"" said Dr Firass Abiad, director of Rafic Hariri University Hospital. ""This is not conducive to
asking them to follow certain rules. Whatever the government comes out and
says, I donât think the people will follow those rules."" A lot of staff that could
have been allocated to fighting Covid-19 are now being required to take care of people injured in the explosion, he added. ""Because weâre a Covid
hospital, we had to take care of Covid patients from another hospital that was
damaged. So at the same time we were receiving Covid patients from that
hospital and casualties from the blast,"" Dr Abiad said. ""If that explosion did not
happen, we might have had more staff available,"" he added. Louise CullenBBC News NI Eligibility for anyone currently on the waiting list for fertility treatment in Northern Ireland is to be extended by a year, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. A phased return of services began at the Regional Fertility Centre earlier, after being suspended in March. Staff will contact patients when their appointments can resume, with opening hours extended to provide as many safe appointments as possible. Health Minister Robin Swann said the extension to eligibility would remove the pressure for women who would otherwise breach the upper age limit before receiving treatment.

Some, like statistician Paul Hewson, have turned to websites providing artificial office noise for help. The sites, which provide background noises of things like printers and coffee machines, as well as people chatting, have attracted millions of hits during the crisis. ""Having the background office chatter means when I really need to concentrate I can,"" Mr Hewson told the BBC. ""I don't know whether it's the office sound that works or just having a feeling of human contact.""

Four of the biggest pantomimes in London will not go ahead this year because of continued uncertainty over when indoor performances can restart without social distancing. Hackney Empire, Lyric Hammersmith Theatre, Queen's Theatre Hornchurch
and Theatre Royal Stratford East have all announced they are postponing their annual Christmas pantomime until 2021. Last year's shows were attended by more than 145,000 people in total and they usually employ 285 freelance artists, including writers, directors, designers, actors, technicians and stage management. The production process for such performances would normally have begun at the start of August. But the theatres have said that without a confirmed date from the government for when indoor performances can resume without social distancing to make the shows economically viable, they will have to postpone. The government has announced a Â£1.5bn support package for the arts industry - but last month the return of socially-distanced indoor performances in Englandwas delayed because of a rise in coronavirus cases. A number of other pantomimes across the country, including at the Birmingham Hippodrome and the Blackpool Grand Theatre, have already been cancelled. BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live's Your Call programme asked listeners whether holidaying at home is good for the UK, as people head to traditional British tourist spots.In some places, local residents have complained about littering and poor social distancing.

"This video can not be played Lebanese government resigns as public anger grows Lebanon's government has resigned amid mounting anger over the explosion on Tuesday that devastated parts of Beirut and left more than 200 people dead. The announcement was made in a national TV address by Prime Minister Hassan Diab on Monday evening. Many people have accused the country's leaders of culpability through their alleged negligence and corruption. Protesters have taken to the streets and clashed with police for a third straight day. The massive blast was caused by the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at the port for years. President Michel Aoun has asked the government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet is formed. Mr Diab, who was appointed prime minister in January after months of deadlock, said his government had ""gone to great lengths to lay out a road map to save the country"". But corruption in Lebanon was ""bigger than the state"" itself, and ""a very thick and thorny wall separates us from change; a wall fortified by a class that is resorting to all dirty methods in order to resist and preserve its gains"", he said. Why Lebanon is in crisis ""They knew that we pose a threat to them, and that the success of this government means a real change in this long-ruling class whose corruption has asphyxiated the country,"" he added. ""Today we follow the will of the people in their demand to hold accountable those responsible for the disaster that has been in hiding for seven years, and their desire for real change,"" Mr Diab said. Protesters angry about corruption threw fireworks in Beirut on Monday The prime minister presented himself in the speech as a reforming leader blocked by endemic corruption dating back years, BBC Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman says. Parliament will now have to decide on a new prime minister - a process involving the same sectarian politics at the root of protesters' discontent, our correspondent adds. It is unlikely to be a smooth or quick process due to the country's complex political system. Power in Lebanon is shared between leaders representing the country's different religious groups. Additionally, following the end of the 1975-1990 civil war a number of warlords entered politics and still control large parts of the country's political, economic and social sectors. Many protesters blame this entrenched system for the country's corruption. This video can not be played Starting with the epicentre, we follow how the 4 August blast ripped through the city, bringing life to a halt On Monday police clashed with angry residents as protests continued in the capital following the government's resignation. Footage showed protesters gathering near barriers leading to the parliament building as security forces fired tear gas at them. The death toll from last week's explosion has risen to 220 with 110 people still missing, Beirut city governor Marwan Abboud was quoted by the al-Marsad Online news website as saying. Many foreign workers and lorry drivers were among the missing, he told Al Jadeed TV channel. Riot police fired weapons during anti-government protests in Beirut The huge blast damaged buildings in a radius of several kilometres in Beirut, leaving more than 200,000 people homeless or living in homes with no windows or doors. Officials estimate that the explosion caused more than $3bn (Â£2.3bn) of damage and that Lebanon's collective economic losses may amount to $15bn. The country was already suffering a major economic downturn before the explosion, with families pushed into poverty and hunger. The inferno and the mystery ship Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images 'We don't have dreams any more' What we know about the blast Discontent in Lebanon has been brewing for years. In late 2019, a plan to tax Whatsapp calls spilled over into mass protests against economic turmoil and corruption, which eventually led to the government's resignation. Coronavirus had curbed the protests, but the financial situation has continued to worsen and last Tuesday's explosion was seen by many as the deadly result of years of corruption and mismanagement. Police and protesters clashed in Beirut on Monday The government's plans to investigate were not enough for many  who have lost all faith in the political elite. Before the cabinet's resignation, a number of ministers had already offered to step down. But the end of this government does not necessarily mean an end to the anger. Last year's protests led to the formation of the government which has now been forced to step down over the same accusations of corruption.

Mr Lai's Apple Daily newspaper offices were raided on Monday over allegations of collusion with foreign forces. His case is the most high-profile arrest so far under a controversial security law imposed by China in June. Mr Lai has been a prominent pro-democracy voice and a supporter of protests that erupted last year.

Another activist, Andy Li, was also arrested,ITV said in a statement.,external The sweep of arrests has raised fears that China will use its newly implemented security law to undertake a broad crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists and media figures. Mr Law said on Twitter that his ""worst fears"" were being realised,external, adding that the arrests represented the ""end of freedom of press in Hong Kong"". ""The national security law is quashing the freedom of our society, spreading politics of fear,"" he said. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong The sight of nearly 200 police officers raiding the newsroom of Apple Daily, the biggest pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong, is a shocking one for many here and a sign that things are changing rapidly. One Apple Daily employee told me that his colleagues were calm and had seen this coming when the National Security Law was passed. Mr Lai has been a very vocal critic of both the Hong Kong government and of Beijing's increasingly assertive presence in the territory. For that, China's official news media have often branded him the leader of the ""Gang of Four"" which incites unrest in the city. Beijing was also infuriated when he met US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year. But while Next Media has often been criticised for its sensationalism, it remains one of the very few media outlets with an owner who has no business interest in mainland China. The newspaper, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, is already under financial strain. The paper has said it will get today's issue out on time but if its flamboyant owner is silenced it is unclear whether it will survive. The businessman is estimated to be worth more than $1bn (Â£766m). Having made his initial fortune in the clothing industry, he later ventured into media and founded the newspaper Apple Daily, which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership. In 2019 the daily was the most-read paid newspaper in the territory, both in print and online, according to the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Mr Lai has also been an activist against Beijing's increasingly tight grip on Hong Kong. In 2019 he supported the reform protests and participated in the demonstrations. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai: China's security law 'spells the death knell for Hong Kong' (Interview from June 2020) On 30 June, when the security law was passed, Mr Lai told the BBC that this ""spells the death knell for Hong Kong"". He warned that Hong Kong would become as corrupt as mainland China because ""without the rule of law, people who do business here will have no protection"". In a separate interview with the AFP news agency, Mr Lai said: ""I'm prepared for prison. If it comes, I will have the opportunity to read books I haven't read. The only thing I can do is to be positive."" Unnamed sources within Apple Daily are cited as saying the company was ""arranging lawyers"", seeing the situation as ""straight harassment"". Hong Kong police have raided the building of Next Digital and Apple Daily Steven Butler, Asia programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the arrest ""bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong's national security law would be used to suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom"". ""Jimmy Lai should be released at once and any charges dropped,"" he said. Wang Dan, dissident and exiled student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, said on social media that the arrest ""was expected"" but ""very outrageous because his two sons were also arrested, which was obviously an attempt by the authorities to destroy Lai's will through family ties"". ""I call on the international community to take immediate action."" Hong Kong has had a high degree of autonomy since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and its residents have had a far higher level of freedom of speech and media than people on the mainland. But the law's key provisions include that crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison. It makes it easier to punish protesters, and reduces Hong Kong's autonomy. In 2019, there were waves of anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong The law also gives Beijing powers to shape life in the former British colony in a way it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech. China has said the new law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest. There have been two previous waves of arrests since the law was passed by Beijing on 30 June. The first one saw several protesters arrested the next day, as they staged a demonstration. On 30 July,four students and former pro-independence activists were arrestedunder the law. Other activists, like Mr Law, fled the city before the security law came into force. Mr Law is currently in the UK but media reports are suggesting thatChinese authorities are seeking the arrest of him and other activists in exile.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK should work with France over channel crossings. The UK needs to consider changes to asylum laws to deter migrants from crossing the English Channel, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said it was currently ""very, very difficult"" to legally return people who arrive in the UK from France using small boats. More than 4,000 people have successfully crossed the English Channel this way so far this year. Immigration Minister Chris Philp is in Paris for talks with French officials. He has been accompanied by the UK's newly appointed Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney, to discuss how to reduce the number of migrant crossings. The UK government has said it wants to work with the French authorities to make the route ""unviable"". Speaking ahead of the meeting, the UK's former national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the UK may need to pay for increased enforcement along the French coast. What happens to migrants found in the Channel? Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? Inquiry launched into Channel migrant crossings ""The French do have 300km of coastline facing the UK which is quite hard to police and I think a lot of the money they are asking for is to reinforce mobile patrols up and down those beaches to stop people even getting into these boats,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Johnson pledged to work with the French authorities to discourage people from making the ""dangerous"" journey across the channel. But he added the UK also needed to look at ""the panoply of laws that an illegal immigrant has at his or her disposal that allow them to stay here"". The Ministry of Defence said on Monday it had sent an RAF Atlas transport aircraft to help Border Force spot small boats trying to cross the Channel. The Home Officehad asked defence chiefsfor help to deal with migrants making the crossing. This video can not be played The men and women on the boat told the BBC's Simon Jones they were from Syria Since Thursday, more than 600 people have been intercepted on the route. Downing Street said Border Force was looking at a ""range of options,"" including new measures, to stop boats entering British waters. The UK is currently following EU asylum law during its 11-month post-Brexit transition period following its departure from the bloc in January. This includes the so-calledDublin regulation, which states that a person's asylum claim can be transferred to the first member state they entered. The PM's spokesman said the UK wanted to replace the ""inflexible and rigid"" regulation with a new agreement on returns after December. This video can not be played Migrants setting out to sea 20 miles east of Calais were filmed by a BBC team on Saturday He added that the current Dublin rules, whichput a time limit,externalon transfers, could be ""abused by both migrants and their lawyers to frustrate the returns of those who have no right to be here"". In a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Monday, 23 Tory MPs and two peers said the UK should refuse to sign up to a ""similar agreement"" to Dublin after December. The group said ministers should do ""whatever it takes"" to deal with the problem, saying many of their constituents were angry that migrants had been put up in ""expensive hotels"" and given ""immediate access"" to financial support. Ms Patel went out on a police boat patrol during her visit to Dover on Monday. Dover MP Nathalie Elphicke, who was not one of the signatories, said Tuesday's talks were welcome but engagement at a higher level was needed to enable boats to be safely turned around and returned to France. ""There is no reason we can't come to an agreement with France on returns,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's really important we work with the French on this issue as it's a joint issue."" Ms Patel, who met her opposite number GÃ©rald Darmanin last month, has said the UK is committed to ""shutting down"" the route and dismantling the criminal gangs facilitating the illegal crossings. Speaking during a visit to Dover on Monday, she said the current situation was ""totally unacceptable"" and the UK and France need to work together to address what was a ""shared challenge"". The French government says it has deployed extra resources to detect and intercept boats before they set out, leading to a ten-fold increase in the number of crossings being prevented. Intelligence co-operation with the UK has been stepped up while plans to strengthen control of the main crossing points are being finalised, the country's interior ministry added. Since the demolition of the infamous 'Jungle' nearly four years ago, French authorities have been successful in stopping other large-scale camps from forming. But migrants do still arrive in Calais; they are just more scattered. Greater security measures - including a wall built along the motorway with UK funding - have made it more difficult for migrants to stow away on lorries. But that's led the people smugglers to increasingly turn to using the equally risky method of small boats. The UK and France have worked closely on this for close to two decades. The Treaty of Le Touquet which effectively 'moved' the UK border to Calais (and the French border to Dover) to allow checks to happen before crossings, was signed in 2003. But they can't change geography. Calais remains a magnet because it is only 20 miles from the UK - on a clear day in Dover, you can see the headlights of French traffic on the other side of the sea. No amount of planes, walls or Navy deployments can alter that. Quite apart from the humanitarian issue here, there is added political pressure for the UK government. David Cameron was pretty roundly criticised for suggesting in 2016 that Brexit would mean the French would pull out of bilateral agreements and we'd see ""Jungles"" popping up on the South coast of England. There's certainly no indication of that, but there's no doubt that the images of dinghies landing on Kent's beaches will be a difficult one for a government that has set huge store by its promise to 'take back control' of immigration.

"The education secretary visited a school in Rutherglen on results day Education Secretary John Swinney has said he has ""heard the anger of students"" over school qualifications. Mr Swinney, who faces a no-confidence vote in the Scottish parliament, said he would make a statement on Tuesday. In it, he will set out how he intends to address the concerns of students and their parents. With no exams because of coronavirus, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) downgraded many of the assessments made by teachers. The SQA was accused of disproportionately affecting the results of pupils from schools which have previously presented fewer successful pupils for exams. School pupils protest over SQA exam results Medical dream 'in tatters' after results downgraded Thousands of pupils have exam grades lowered Speaking ahead of the statement, scheduled for the week schools resume after lockdown, Mr Swinney said: ""I have heard the anger of students who feel their hard work has been taken away from them and I am determined to address it. ""These are unprecedented times and as we have said throughout this pandemic, we will not get everything right first time. Every student deserves a grade that reflects the work they have done, and that is what I want to achieve."" The education secretary said he had been ""engaged in detailed discussions over the way forward"", promising to act quickly to give certainty to young people. He added: ""I will set out on Tuesday how we intend to achieve that."" Pupils and parents took part in demonstrations after the results were announced When the Scottish parliament resumes this week, Scottish Labour will table a motion of no-confidence in Mr Swinney, which the Conservatives will support. The Scottish Greens have indicated they would consider backing the motion. Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said Mr Swinney ""needs to go"". ""It's taken John Swinney five days to even admit this fiasco is his responsibility,"" he said. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross also called on the first minister to remove Mr Swinney. And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""An admission of error is step one in resolving this major issue but the detailed solution is what matters."" In a Sunday Times article, former SNP minister Alex Neil said the Scottish government ""must reverse the decisions it made about examination results that saw the poorest children in many of the most deprived areas downgraded on the altar of a manufactured algorithm prepared in secret"". Schools in Scotland are to resume this week for the first time since March. All pupils will be provided with full-time education. Education authorities have been preparing procedures and modifying the layout of school buildings to minimise the risk of Covid-19 transmission. Are your or your child's grades being reviewed by SQA?

"Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended A straight A pupil's dreams of medical school have been destroyed with the arrival of a single text message. Olivia Biggart achieved five As in her Higher prelims and was predicted by her teachers to be awarded the same when her results arrived on Tuesday morning. But despite having spent the summer studying for the University Clinical Aptitude Test (Ucat), she was awarded two As and three Bs. Olivia, 16, believes she was downgraded because of where she lives. Scotland's exam results day has been marred by disappointment for thousands of pupils who received worse grades than they had been expecting. It emerged that exam body the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) had lowered 125,000 estimated grades - a quarter of the total. Thousands of pupils have exam grades lowered How grades were worked out for Scottish pupils Candidates were already apprehensive after official exams were cancelled for the first time in history due to the coronavirus. Results were worked out using estimates made by teachers, based on the pupil's performance over the school year. But a national moderation system meant that many pupils received lower grades than originally estimated. David Biggart believes his daughter would have been awarded different grades if her school was in an affluent area Many claimed they suffered because they are from less affluent areas. Olivia's father, David Biggart believes his daughter was one of them. The family lives in Motherwell in North Lanarkshire. Mr Biggart said: ""It is a small school and in a poorer catchment area. Olivia got seven As in her Nat 5 exams. She was in fifth year doing maths, English, chemistry, physics and PE. The school predicted five As and that is what they submitted to the SQA. ""We had increased our expectations based on Olivia's prelims, researching medical schools. ""Olivia has been studying all summer for the Ucat medical test to study medicine at university, but all her dreams are now in tatters as a result of the SQA and their treatment of poorer schools and high achieving pupils at those schools. ""I am absolutely livid at the SQA."" Mr Biggart said he strongly believed it would not be the case if his daughter achieved the same predicted results but went to a school in a more affluent area. ""I called the school and they were devastated for her and the rest of the pupils they felt had been unfairly treated. I worry for those who maybe expected three C grades and were given nothing."" He said: ""She got 85% in her maths prelim and her teacher suggested a maths-related career. She has never scored a B in maths. It goes against everything. I feel distraught for her after how hard she worked over the summer."" Olivia told the BBC she was not expecting the results she got. Many pupils chose to receive their results electronically on Tuesday morning She said: ""I was not too stressed when I woke up. I thought I knew what to expect. I saw the A for chemistry and thought it was okay but then came the Bs. I was really shocked."" The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system. Asked about the process at her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""What we want to make sure is that this year's results have the degree of credibility that means that they are not so out of sync with previous years that people are going to look at them and say 'they don't make any sense'. ""As much as I would love to be in the position of standing here credibly saying that 85% of the 20% in the most deprived areas had passed Higher, given that it was 65% last year, that would raise a real credibility issue."" Education Secretary John Swinney said pupils had shown ""tremendous resilience"" Education Secretary John Swinney stressed that approximately 90% of moderation ""involved a change of just one grade"". He added: ""We've maintained the overwhelming majority of estimates that have been put forward by teachers and the changes that have been made are essentially those fine-grained judgments that are required to be made on an annual basis."" He said the SQA would ensure ""sufficient resources were in place"" forthe free appeals process,external, allowing teachers and pupils to challenge specific results. SQA chief examining officer Fiona Robertson said it was not possible to determine why the overall estimated grades were higher than previous years, adding: ""There may be several reasons why estimates were above historic attainment, which has been relatively stable over time. ""Some teachers and lecturers may have been optimistic, given the circumstances of this year, or may have believed, correctly or incorrectly, that this cohort of candidates may have achieved better grades due to a range of factors.""

"Bye bye ball pools: The fun but tricky-to-clean attractions may disappear amid the Covid-19 pandemic They are the salvation of a rainy day - where children can fearlessly fling themselves up and down brightly-coloured, spongy mats as parents seek solace with coffee and a chat, the latter usually drowned out by deafening, delirious-with-happiness screams. But soft play centres face being wiped out amid the coronavirus pandemic as one of the last industries to have a proposed opening date. In the last three weeks, at least 15 have closed their doors permanently and many more are set to follow. More than 25,000 people have signed the #RescueIndoorPlay petition, calling on the government to make a decision on reopening or offer more financial support to the UK's 1,100 centres, which employ 30,000 people. There is also concern among operators about the impact closure could have on families with young children, which rely on soft play centres for sanity and socialisation. ""I feel for children and parents' mental health,"" says Helen Whittington, who has started a crowdfunder to replace ""tricky to clean"" ball pools at DJ Jungles in St Albans and Hemel Hempstead with new sensory areas that would enable social distancing. ""We have baby classes, NCT meets and are a place for people to socialise - postnatal depression could increase and children lose the confidence to mix and make friends, share and take turns."" Helen Whittington says soft play centres are vital for children's and parents' mental health Simon Bridgland made the heartbreaking decision to close Big Fun House in Canterbury at the beginning of July, which he'd run for six years. The announcement was met with an ""outpouring of love"" from customers on his Facebook page. ""I was blown away by the volume of comments,"" he says. It was not an easy decision to make, with 17 staff losing their jobs. ""We'd not had any income whatsoever since March. Soft play isn't the gold mine people think it is - you make your money in winter to get through the summer months. Most are in big warehouses and cost a lot of money to keep going."" Only last year he opened a Â£50,000 go kart track which had just a few months of use. Instead, he has decided to diversify. Mr Bridgland runs Snowflakes Day Nursery on the same site, and is going to extend it into what was Big Fun House. Children will have the run of the place and its facilities. The go kart track at Big Fun House was only installed last year ""It's going to be one hell of a nursery, what with the sheer volume of space and lots of unique features. ""Personally, I think soft play is dead. The kids, they can't social distance. So we were left with no option but to repurpose the centre."" Another owner reworking their business is Ellis Potter, managing director of the Riverside Hub in Northampton, who is soon to get a delivery of 80 tonnes of play sand for a pop-up beach on the car park. ""It's cost us about Â£1,000 a day just to stand still with the doors closed, which is a serious chunk of money,"" he says. ""We've received hundreds of emails from parents who want to bring a sense of normality back to their children's lives, because it's the children that are being affected in all of this. ""We've implemented massive hygiene and safety measures, and spent tens of thousands of pounds with air sterilisation and antibacterial fogging - all the things that we can do to keep safe but the government are just not having it. They just won't let us open indoor play. Ellis Potter has had ""literally hundreds of emails"" from parents who say their children have been missing out ""We've 60 staff on furlough who are apprehensive about the future, and we want to give them some clarity. There's been some very dark times but emails and Facebook messages from customers have kept us going."" Mikey Johnson, assistant manager of Jungleland in Telford, said the lack of clarity for soft play centres was ""diabolical"". Takings went down 90 per cent in the week before lockdown as worried families stayed at home. Within a week it was zero. As the pandemic took hold, Jungleland became a drop-off point for a local food bank. ""Hundreds of families"" were helped by the pop-up food bank at Jungleland, which sent supplies to Telford Crisis Support In March the firm had 26 members of staff. Now eight remain on furlough, all eyes on the next government announcement. ""At the minute it's an unknown,"" said Mr Johnson. ""Even if we have a date, it's the rebuilding period after that. ""We'd probably be working at half capacity, and that's just not a viable business. We need bums on seats. It's just a waiting game."" 'It's devastating news' - the firms still closed Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact 'My hotel is losing about Â£40,000 a month' Representatives from the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions (BALPPA) - many in furry costumes - descended on 10 Downing Street recently to raise awareness of their #RescueIndoorPlay campaign. The pandemic meant they weren't allowed to physically hand in a petition, but that is gathering pace on Change.org. ""We've had a huge amount of support from people who use these centres all the time - they are embedded in our local communities,"" said Paul Kelly, chief executive of BALPPA. ""We want the government to tell us the date we can reopen, or tell us why we can't. There are 1,100 centres and I can't see them surviving if we don't hear something soon. ""We are heading for a cliff edge."" Lizzie Elston, 45 from Harpenden, mum to Oliver, eight, is among those who are backing the campaign. Oliver Elston's mum says she would have ""no hesitation"" taking him to soft play because she knows how seriously they are taking cleanliness ""The benefits of soft play are massive. Oliver's not into organised sport - we've tried to get him into rugby or cricket, but he's at his happiest when he's jumping off things just being a ninja,"" she says. ""He's always absolutely loved soft play - just being a lunatic - so it is brilliant as a parent because you can have a coffee with friends and know he's safe, either by himself or with friends. It's so important for his physical and mental wellbeing just not being in front of a screen. ""It can't be overestimated, the importance of soft play - it helps how they develop, how they learn and socialise, so it's critically important for their mental health.""

"Steve Easterbrook, pictured with company mascot Ronald McDonald, the month he became head of McDonald's in 2015 McDonald's has taken new legal action against former chief executive Steve Easterbrook, accusing him of lying about sexual relationships with staff. The company fired Mr Easterbrook last year after finding he had a consensual relationship with an employee. But the firm says further investigation found the British executive had three additional relationships with staff, about which he lied to the board. McDonald's is suing to recover his pay-off, reportedly worth $40m (Â£35m). The fast food giant prohibits ""any kind of intimate relationship between employees in a direct or indirect reporting relationship"". At the time of Mr Easterbrook's removal in November, McDonald's said it had evidence of only of a non-physical, consensual relationship, consisting of intimate text messages and video calls. It agreed to terminate Mr Easterbrook's contract ""without cause"", fearing a protracted legal battle, according to the firm's legal filing. But after receiving a tip from an employee in July, the fast food giant started a second investigation, which uncovered ""undisputable evidence"" of three other sexual relationships. McDonald's boss fired after dating employee McDonald's workers file $500m sexual harassment suit It says investigators found nude photographs sent from Mr Easterbrook's company email account as well as messages showing that he approved a grant of company shares worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to one of the employees ""shortly after their first sexual encounter"". McDonald's said that had it been aware of this information, it would not have approved his multi-million dollar pay-off. McDonald's said it did not initially find the photos and messages because Mr Easterbrook had deleted them from his phone. The second investigation also searched company servers. It said Mr Easterbrook violated his duty to the company by lying when asked about his behaviour in an effort to secure a bigger severance package, committing fraud. Mr Easterbrook, who is divorced, could not immediately be reached for comment. At the time of his dismissal, he acknowledged a relationship in an email to staff, calling it a ""mistake"". ""Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,"" he wrote. McDonald's claims Steve Easterbrook lied Mr Easterbrook, a UK citizen who grew up in Watford, Hertfordshire, led McDonald's from March 2015 to November 2019, after previously leading its UK operations. He was widely credited with revitalising the firm's menus, remodelling stores and using better ingredients. The value of its shares more than doubled during his tenure in the US. Last year, he received more than $17m in total compensation. The size of Mr Easterbrook's severance package had drawn earlier pushback, including from a shareholder advisory group. The firm has also faced accusations that it has not taken sexual harassment seriously. In April, US workers filed a class-action lawsuit against McDonald's, accusing the fast food giant of fostering ""systemic sexual harassment"". A global coalition of labour unions filed a similar complaint with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in May. At the time, one of the organisers, Sue Longley, general secretary of the International Union of Foodworkers, said the firm had a ""culture rotten from the top"".

"Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended A straight A pupil's dreams of medical school have been destroyed with the arrival of a single text message. Olivia Biggart achieved five As in her Higher prelims and was predicted by her teachers to be awarded the same when her results arrived on Tuesday morning. But despite having spent the summer studying for the University Clinical Aptitude Test (Ucat), she was awarded two As and three Bs. Olivia, 16, believes she was downgraded because of where she lives. Scotland's exam results day has been marred by disappointment for thousands of pupils who received worse grades than they had been expecting. It emerged that exam body the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) had lowered 125,000 estimated grades - a quarter of the total. Thousands of pupils have exam grades lowered How grades were worked out for Scottish pupils Candidates were already apprehensive after official exams were cancelled for the first time in history due to the coronavirus. Results were worked out using estimates made by teachers, based on the pupil's performance over the school year. But a national moderation system meant that many pupils received lower grades than originally estimated. David Biggart believes his daughter would have been awarded different grades if her school was in an affluent area Many claimed they suffered because they are from less affluent areas. Olivia's father, David Biggart believes his daughter was one of them. The family lives in Motherwell in North Lanarkshire. Mr Biggart said: ""It is a small school and in a poorer catchment area. Olivia got seven As in her Nat 5 exams. She was in fifth year doing maths, English, chemistry, physics and PE. The school predicted five As and that is what they submitted to the SQA. ""We had increased our expectations based on Olivia's prelims, researching medical schools. ""Olivia has been studying all summer for the Ucat medical test to study medicine at university, but all her dreams are now in tatters as a result of the SQA and their treatment of poorer schools and high achieving pupils at those schools. ""I am absolutely livid at the SQA."" Mr Biggart said he strongly believed it would not be the case if his daughter achieved the same predicted results but went to a school in a more affluent area. ""I called the school and they were devastated for her and the rest of the pupils they felt had been unfairly treated. I worry for those who maybe expected three C grades and were given nothing."" He said: ""She got 85% in her maths prelim and her teacher suggested a maths-related career. She has never scored a B in maths. It goes against everything. I feel distraught for her after how hard she worked over the summer."" Olivia told the BBC she was not expecting the results she got. Many pupils chose to receive their results electronically on Tuesday morning She said: ""I was not too stressed when I woke up. I thought I knew what to expect. I saw the A for chemistry and thought it was okay but then came the Bs. I was really shocked."" The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system. Asked about the process at her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""What we want to make sure is that this year's results have the degree of credibility that means that they are not so out of sync with previous years that people are going to look at them and say 'they don't make any sense'. ""As much as I would love to be in the position of standing here credibly saying that 85% of the 20% in the most deprived areas had passed Higher, given that it was 65% last year, that would raise a real credibility issue."" Education Secretary John Swinney said pupils had shown ""tremendous resilience"" Education Secretary John Swinney stressed that approximately 90% of moderation ""involved a change of just one grade"". He added: ""We've maintained the overwhelming majority of estimates that have been put forward by teachers and the changes that have been made are essentially those fine-grained judgments that are required to be made on an annual basis."" He said the SQA would ensure ""sufficient resources were in place"" forthe free appeals process,external, allowing teachers and pupils to challenge specific results. SQA chief examining officer Fiona Robertson said it was not possible to determine why the overall estimated grades were higher than previous years, adding: ""There may be several reasons why estimates were above historic attainment, which has been relatively stable over time. ""Some teachers and lecturers may have been optimistic, given the circumstances of this year, or may have believed, correctly or incorrectly, that this cohort of candidates may have achieved better grades due to a range of factors.""

"This video can not be played The men and women on the boat told the BBC's Simon Jones they were from Syria Using Royal Navy ships to help stop migrants crossing the English Channel is ""dangerous"" and ""won't change anything"", a Calais politician says. On Saturday theHome Office asked defence chiefsfor help to make crossings in small boats ""unviable"". The Home Office says 18 Syrian migrants in a boat were picked up by Border Force on Monday morning. More than 4,000 people have successfully crossed the Channel from France in small boats so far this year. Pierre-Henri Dumont, the National Assembly member for Calais, told the BBC: ""What is the British navy going to do if it sees a small boat? Is it going to shoot the boat? Is it going to enter French waters? ""It's a political measure to show some kind of muscle but technically speaking it won't change anything."" In response to Mr Dumont's comments, a Ministry of Defence (MoD) source said: ""To imply that the UK navy would operate outside of UK and international laws and norms is dangerous and misleading. ""The military will support the Home Office in their work to combat Channel crossings."" The Syrian migrants were picked up by Border Force and taken to Dover Mr Dumont said the French authorities needed to monitor about 300 miles of coastline if they were to stop migrants launching small boats from French shores. ""We are already trying to do whatever we can. We can't have a camera and police officer every 10 metres."" The MoD says it has sent an RAF Atlas aircraft with spotters on board to help Border Force operations in the Channel. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Home Secretary Priti Patel was in Dover on Monday and was seen disembarking from a police boat that had been in the English Channel earlier in the morning. A spokesman for the Home Office said she joined Kent Police to see first-hand Border Force operations at sea and witness CPV Hunter and HMC Protector on patrol in the Dover Straits. She also met with Chief Constable of Kent Police, Alan Pughsley. Ms Patel said: ""The number of illegal small boat crossings we have seen recently is totally unacceptable. ""Our operational partners are dealing with complex challenges associated with them and collectively with the French we need make this route unviable. ""Across Government we are absolutely committed to shutting down this route and we will bring down the criminal gangs that facilitate these illegal crossings."" Helen Catt, BBC News Since the demolition of the infamous ""Jungle"" nearly four years ago, French authorities have been successful in stopping other large scale camps from forming. But migrants do still arrive in Calais, they are just more scattered. Greater security measures - including a wall built along the motorway with UK funding - have made it more difficult for migrants to stow away on lorries. In response, people smugglers have increasingly turned to the equally risky method of crossing in small boats. The French and UK governments have worked closely on this for something approaching two decades; the Treaty of Le Touquet which effectively moved the UK border to Calais (and the French border to Dover) to allow checks to happen before crossings, was signed in 2003. But they can't change geography. Calais remains a magnet because it is only 20 miles from the UK - on a clear day in Dover, you can see the headlights of French traffic on the other side of the sea. No amount of planes, walls or navy deployments can alter that. Quite apart from the humanitarian issue, there is added political pressure for the UK government. David Cameron was pretty roundly criticised for suggesting in 2016 that Brexit would mean the French would pull out of bilateral agreements and ""Jungle-style"" camps would appear on the south coast of England. There's certainly no indication of that but there's no doubt that the images of dinghies landing on Kent's beaches will be a difficult one for a government that has set huge store by its promise to ""take back control"" of immigration. More than 700 people were intercepted crossing the English Channel last week, including 235 -the record for a single day- on Thursday. Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? Immigration minister Chris Philp is due to go to Paris this week to demand stronger measures from French authorities. He said he wanted to make the route ""completely unviable"" so migrants ""will have no incentive to come to northern France or attempt the crossing in the first place"". Mr Philp added he also wanted to ""return as many migrants who have arrived as possible"", adding there were ""returns flights planned in the coming days"". This video can not be played Migrants setting out to sea 20 miles east of Calais were filmed by a BBC team on Saturday Sir David Normington, former permanent secretary at the Home Office, told the BBC the ""only solution"" was to work with French officials to ""persuade them to intensify their efforts"" to stop the migrants leaving France. ""If it takes money to help the French increase their resources and their manpower then that will have to be done,"" he said. Sir David said he was ""sceptical"" about the deployment of the Royal Navy. ""If the navy is going to push boats back, it will have to go into French water to do that, and then you can only do that with the permission of the French government."" The prime minister said he wanted to work with the French to stop the activity of ""cruel"" criminal gangs taking migrants across the English Channel. ""We need to look at the means by which they are coming here, we need to stop them, working with the French, we need to stop them from getting across the Channel,"" Boris Johnson said. ""But number two we need to look at the legal framework that we have, all the panoply of laws that an illegal immigrant has at his or her disposal that allow them to stay here and we need to look at what we can do to change that.""

"This video can not be played Hong Kong arrests media tycoon Jimmy Lai The Hong Kong business tycoon Jimmy Lai has been arrested along with other pro-democracy and media figures, raising fears of a broad crackdown by China. Mr Lai's Apple Daily newspaper offices were raided on Monday over allegations of collusion with foreign forces. His case is the most high-profile arrest so far under a controversial security law imposed by China in June. Mr Lai has been a prominent pro-democracy voice and a supporter of protests that erupted last year. In Februarythe 71-year-old, who also holds UK citizenship, was charged with illegal assembly and intimidation.He was granted police bail. Jimmy Lai: Rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice Hong Kong security law: What is it and is it worrying? The Hong Kong residents ready to leave for the UK Chinese state media outlet the Global Times on Monday described Mr Lai as ""riot supporter"" and his publications as having been ""instigating hatred, spreading rumours and smearing Hong Kong authorities and the mainland for years"". Scores of police were seen entering the offices Apple Daily and Mr Lai was led through the offices in handcuffs. According to the Global Times, two of his sons as well as two senior executives of Next Digital, a media company founded by Mr Lai, were also arrested. Hong Kong police confirmed that they had arrested 10 people - nine men and one woman - aged between 23 and 72. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reports said that police gathered hours later on Monday at the house of prominent pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow. Fellow activist Nathan Law wrote in a post on Twitter that Ms Chow had been arrested. ""Agnes Chow is arrested under National Security Law and we are still acquiring information about the content of the arrests. Horrible day,"" he wrote. And UK-based ITV News reported that Wilson Li, a freelance journalist who worked with the channel, had been arrested, also on suspicion of collusion with foreign powers. Another activist, Andy Li, was also arrested,ITV said in a statement.,external The sweep of arrests has raised fears that China will use its newly implemented security law to undertake a broad crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists and media figures. Mr Law said on Twitter that his ""worst fears"" were being realised,external, adding that the arrests represented the ""end of freedom of press in Hong Kong"". ""The national security law is quashing the freedom of our society, spreading politics of fear,"" he said. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong The sight of nearly 200 police officers raiding the newsroom of Apple Daily, the biggest pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong, is a shocking one for many here and a sign that things are changing rapidly. One Apple Daily employee told me that his colleagues were calm and had seen this coming when the National Security Law was passed. Mr Lai has been a very vocal critic of both the Hong Kong government and of Beijing's increasingly assertive presence in the territory. For that, China's official news media have often branded him the leader of the ""Gang of Four"" which incites unrest in the city. Beijing was also infuriated when he met US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year. But while Next Media has often been criticised for its sensationalism, it remains one of the very few media outlets with an owner who has no business interest in mainland China. The newspaper, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, is already under financial strain. The paper has said it will get today's issue out on time but if its flamboyant owner is silenced it is unclear whether it will survive. The businessman is estimated to be worth more than $1bn (Â£766m). Having made his initial fortune in the clothing industry, he later ventured into media and founded the newspaper Apple Daily, which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership. In 2019 the daily was the most-read paid newspaper in the territory, both in print and online, according to the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Mr Lai has also been an activist against Beijing's increasingly tight grip on Hong Kong. In 2019 he supported the reform protests and participated in the demonstrations. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai: China's security law 'spells the death knell for Hong Kong' (Interview from June 2020) On 30 June, when the security law was passed, Mr Lai told the BBC that this ""spells the death knell for Hong Kong"". He warned that Hong Kong would become as corrupt as mainland China because ""without the rule of law, people who do business here will have no protection"". In a separate interview with the AFP news agency, Mr Lai said: ""I'm prepared for prison. If it comes, I will have the opportunity to read books I haven't read. The only thing I can do is to be positive."" Unnamed sources within Apple Daily are cited as saying the company was ""arranging lawyers"", seeing the situation as ""straight harassment"". Hong Kong police have raided the building of Next Digital and Apple Daily Steven Butler, Asia programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the arrest ""bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong's national security law would be used to suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom"". ""Jimmy Lai should be released at once and any charges dropped,"" he said. Wang Dan, dissident and exiled student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, said on social media that the arrest ""was expected"" but ""very outrageous because his two sons were also arrested, which was obviously an attempt by the authorities to destroy Lai's will through family ties"". ""I call on the international community to take immediate action."" Hong Kong has had a high degree of autonomy since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and its residents have had a far higher level of freedom of speech and media than people on the mainland. But the law's key provisions include that crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison. It makes it easier to punish protesters, and reduces Hong Kong's autonomy. In 2019, there were waves of anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong The law also gives Beijing powers to shape life in the former British colony in a way it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech. China has said the new law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest. There have been two previous waves of arrests since the law was passed by Beijing on 30 June. The first one saw several protesters arrested the next day, as they staged a demonstration. On 30 July,four students and former pro-independence activists were arrestedunder the law. Other activists, like Mr Law, fled the city before the security law came into force. Mr Law is currently in the UK but media reports are suggesting thatChinese authorities are seeking the arrest of him and other activists in exile.

"The education secretary visited a school in Rutherglen on results day Education Secretary John Swinney has said he has ""heard the anger of students"" over school qualifications. Mr Swinney, who faces a no-confidence vote in the Scottish parliament, said he would make a statement on Tuesday. In it, he will set out how he intends to address the concerns of students and their parents. With no exams because of coronavirus, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) downgraded many of the assessments made by teachers. The SQA was accused of disproportionately affecting the results of pupils from schools which have previously presented fewer successful pupils for exams. School pupils protest over SQA exam results Medical dream 'in tatters' after results downgraded Thousands of pupils have exam grades lowered Speaking ahead of the statement, scheduled for the week schools resume after lockdown, Mr Swinney said: ""I have heard the anger of students who feel their hard work has been taken away from them and I am determined to address it. ""These are unprecedented times and as we have said throughout this pandemic, we will not get everything right first time. Every student deserves a grade that reflects the work they have done, and that is what I want to achieve."" The education secretary said he had been ""engaged in detailed discussions over the way forward"", promising to act quickly to give certainty to young people. He added: ""I will set out on Tuesday how we intend to achieve that."" Pupils and parents took part in demonstrations after the results were announced When the Scottish parliament resumes this week, Scottish Labour will table a motion of no-confidence in Mr Swinney, which the Conservatives will support. The Scottish Greens have indicated they would consider backing the motion. Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said Mr Swinney ""needs to go"". ""It's taken John Swinney five days to even admit this fiasco is his responsibility,"" he said. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross also called on the first minister to remove Mr Swinney. And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""An admission of error is step one in resolving this major issue but the detailed solution is what matters."" In a Sunday Times article, former SNP minister Alex Neil said the Scottish government ""must reverse the decisions it made about examination results that saw the poorest children in many of the most deprived areas downgraded on the altar of a manufactured algorithm prepared in secret"". Schools in Scotland are to resume this week for the first time since March. All pupils will be provided with full-time education. Education authorities have been preparing procedures and modifying the layout of school buildings to minimise the risk of Covid-19 transmission. Are your or your child's grades being reviewed by SQA?

"The driver got herself out of the vehicle through a rear door A two-year-old boy was injured when a van crashed into a house in Birmingham. The child, who was inside the property on Chatham Road, Northfield, was treated for minor injuries at the scene following the crash at about 07:15 BST. His mother said she panicked as she could not initially reach her son after there was a loud bang and a cloud of dust as they were walking downstairs. The van driver was also treated for minor injuries and has been taken to hospital. According to the family, who did not want to be identified, the van crashed through the front door and the porch before coming to rest in the property's hallway. Another child, who had been upstairs at the time, and the woman's partner walked out of the house unscathed.

"One in three UK employers expect to make staff redundant between July and September, a survey suggests. The research by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and recruiter Adecco shows a 50% jump in the number of employers expecting to cut jobs compared to three months ago. In the private sector, 38% of firms plan to make redundancies, compared to 16% in the public sector. Firms with plans to hire rose - but numbers were down on past years. There have been an increasing number of job cuts as the coronavirus pandemic wiped more than a quarter off UK economic output. In the month leading up to 9 July, more than 2,000 employers were asked whether they planned to make redundancies. While 33% said they did expect to let staff go, another 49% said they planned to hire in the three months until the end of September. That indicated an increase in confidence compared to the previous quarter when just 40% said they planned to take on new staff. However, that figure was still ""well below"" levels seen in previous years, the report's authors said. And the proportion of employers planning to hire, relative to those expecting to let go of staff, had fallen to its lowest level since 2013 when the survey began in its current form, they said. Events producer William Bird has been made redundant after four years with his firm William Bird, 27, had been working as an assistant producer at an events agency in London that creates tailored experiences for big brands. He was furloughed in April, and then at the end of June, he was told that he was being made redundant, after four years with the firm. ""Unfortunately, right now members of the public do not feel safe to attend events... so at the end of June, I was told that my company had done everything to try to retain me, but due to the lack of work coming in, they didn't have the financial backing to keep me on,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bird said it had been a ""difficult year in general"", as his mother passed away from cancer a few weeks into lockdown. ""It's been really upsetting and stressful. I've gone from having a tragedy in the family, to looking for work, and at the end of August I'm going to have to move out from the flat I rent in London with my girlfriend because we can't afford it anymore,"" he said. He says he only received three weeks' of redundancy pay as he was on rolling contracts during his first year with the firm. And he is upset that his month of notice in July was paid at the 80% furlough rate, rather than the full salary listed in his contract. The only consolation to the situation, says Mr Bird, is that his firm didn't want to let him go: ""They told me that this wasn't performance-based at all, and that they were making difficult decisions for the future of the company, with the hope that after the industry recovered, they'd love to offer me my job back."" Gerwyn Davies, an advisor at the CIPD, predicted a ""sombre autumn for jobs"". ""This is the weakest set of data we've seen for several years,"" he said. ""Until now, redundancies have been low - no doubt due to the Job Retention Scheme - but we expect to see more redundancies come through this autumn, especially in the private sector once the scheme closes. ""Hiring confidence is rising tentatively, but this probably won't be enough to offset the rise in redundancies and the number of new graduates and school leavers entering the labour market over the next few months."" What are my rights if I am made redundant? Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting' It comes as data from the Centre for Retail Research suggests that more than 22,000 restaurant jobs have been slashed already this year. That is more than double the number announced throughout the entire of 2019. Last week Pizza Express said it was considering closing 67 of its UK restaurants, which would mean the loss of 1,100 jobs. Meanwhile, Byron has announced 651 job cuts; the Casual Dining Group, which owns Bella Italia and Cafe Rouge, is to put 1,909 out of work and the owner of Upper Crust, SSP, has said 5,000 jobs are at risk. It comes asfigures obtained by the BBC showedthe number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, A Freedom of Information request shows that in June 1,778 firms said were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In June 2019, only 345 firms had plans to cut 24,000 jobs. Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting' What are my rights if I am made redundant?

"There is little evidence of coronavirus being transmitted in schools, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said. Mr Williamson said the government was being guided by the best science as it accelerated plans to reopen schools to all pupils in England next month. Government advisers have warned the nation may have reached the limit of what can be reopened in society safely. But Mr Williamson suggested an upcoming study would support the government's position on reopening schools. His comments come afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the reopening of schools- after months without in-person education - was the ""national priority"" of the government. Could reopening schools spread coronavirus? How will schools reopen fully? Moral duty to get all children back in school - PM The prime minister, who visited a school in East London on Monday, is understood to have made it clear that schools should shut last in any future local lockdowns - after businesses including shops and pubs. The current plan is for most children across the country to be back in class by next month. Guidance on reopening schoolshas been published for England.,externalThere are also separate plans forWales,Northern IrelandandScotland, where schools are scheduled to return from Tuesday. Schools across the UK closed on 20 March, except to children of key workers or vulnerable children. On 1 June, they began a limited reopening for early years pupils, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. The Association of School and College Leaders said guidance from the government was not clear, and schools were having to make their own contingency plans for any possible resurgence of coronavirus. It said teachers might teach students on a week-on, week-off basis in that situation. But care minister Helen Whately told BBC Breakfast: ""Our priority is to make sure that children are fully back in school come the autumn."" She said the government wanted to keep schools open in the event of local lockdowns, adding that staff and pupils would ""immediately have access to testing"" if they showed symptoms. Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said ""rota systems appear to make very little difference"" to the level of risk. In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said opening up schools was ""one of the least risky things we can do"" when it comes to easing lockdown. By Rachel Schraer, health reporter The evidence is clear that children are much less likely to become very ill from coronavirus than adults. What role they play in spreading the virus to others, though, is less clear. A review of 18 studies suggested children might be half as likely as adults to pass on the virus. But schools do not just bring children together - teachers, parents at school gates and other knock-on effects like more people on public transport or in offices could also influence the spread of the virus. While we have not fully solved the question of whether children are biologically less capable of passing on the virus, the safety of re-opening schools depends on other factors, too. The strength of the contact-tracing system and how well social distancing can be managed will be crucial in whether re-opening schools will cause cases to spike. The education secretary said the ""latest research, which is expected to be published later this year - one of the largest studies on the coronavirus in schools in the world"", would make it ""clear there is little evidence that the virus is transmitted at school"". He is believed to be referring to a forthcoming report to be released by Public Health England. Gavin Williamson said a coronavirus study supported the government's decision to reopen schools In a statement issued on Sunday evening, Mr Williamson also said there was ""growing confidence among parents about their children returning"" to the classroom. ""This is down to the hard work of school staff across the country who are putting in place a range of protective measures to prepare to welcome back all pupils at the start of term,"" he said. But some parents have told the BBC of their concerns at the plans. Jo, a mother of two who works as a support staff member at a secondary school in south-east England, said: ""I'm terrified of sending my children back to school. I'm frightened that [those in] schools are not wearing masks, not facing desks forward."" She questioned whether head teachers would ""have the courage to send home unwell children on arrival"". ""At my school, we have been given a brief outline of the plans for when the school reopens, but things are changing all the time,"" she added. ""There are too many questions and not enough answers."" Email us athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Meanwhile, Labour called for a ""rapid reform"" of the test and trace system, suggesting local health protection teams were more effective than national call centres. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Labour's Andy Burnham, told BBC Breakfast that England's contact tracing system ""isn't yet good enough"" for pupils to return to school in September. He said the government must give local authorities resources to carry out some of the contract tracing and ""give all employers in the country the ability [to support employees] to self-isolate on full pay"".

Figures released last week by the Department of Health and Social Care showed that local teams continued to be more successful than call centre workers when it came to reaching close contacts of people who tested positive for coronavirus. In a letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth and shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves raised concerns that the current model was ""not fit for purpose"".

"The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced an increase in the amount of stamp duty paid by second-home buyers, landlords and companies. The higher rate paid on additional properties will rise from 3% to 5% from 31 October. There had been speculation the the government might cancel a planned cut in residential stamp duty thresholds in March 2025, but it has not done so. Budget 2024: Key points at-a-glance How the Budget will affect you and your money Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) isa tax due if if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland,external. You pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 don't pay stamp duty. This was doubled from Â£125,000 under Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. The threshold is Â£425,000 for those buying their first property. This was raised from Â£300,000 as part of the mini-Budget. These higher thresholds will end in March 2025, when they are expected to revert to previous levels. Â£0-Â£250,000 (Â£425,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£250,001-Â£925,000 = 5% Â£925,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m+ = 12% If you already own a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and you buy another (or a part of one),you have to pay an additional 3% on top of the rates above,external. This will rise to 5% from 31 October. The single rate of stamp duty charged when firms buy dwellings worth more than Â£500,000 will also increase from 15% to 17%. Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)raised Â£15.4bn for the government in the 2022/23 financial year,external, a 9% increase on the Â£14.1bn raised in 2021/22. Calculate how much SDLT you will have to pay,external In Scotland, the current rates for theLand and Buildings Transaction Tax,external(LBTT) are: Â£0-Â£145,000 (Â£175,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£145,001-Â£250,000 = 2% Â£250,001-Â£325,000 = 5% Â£325,001-Â£750,000 = 10% Â£750,001+ = 12% Purchasers who already have a residential property also have to payan Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS),externalon top of LBTT if their share of the new property is worth Â£40,000 or more. The ADS is 6% of the purchase price. This includes people buying a second home, a rental property or a holiday home. Calculate how much LBTT you will have to pay,external In Wales the current standard rates forLand Transaction Tax,external(LTT) are: Â£0-Â£225,000 = 0% Â£225, 001-Â£400,000 = 6% Â£400,001-Â£750,000 = 7.5% Â£750,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m + = 12% Purchasers usually have to pay the higher rate of LTT if they: buy a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and already own one or more other properties The higher rates of LTT are: Â£0-Â£180,000 = 4% Â£180,001-Â£250,000 = 7.5% Â£250,001-Â£400,000 = 9% Â£400,001-Â£750,000 = 11.5% Â£750,0001-Â£1,500,000 14% Â£1.5m + = 16% Calculate how much LTT you will have to pay,external You have 14 days to pay stamp duty from the date of completion in England and Northern Ireland. In Scotland and Wales you have 30 days from the point of purchase. If it takes longer, you could face a fine, or be charged interest on the duty you owe. House buyers often pay via their solicitors, but you can also pay directly online, or by cheque or cash in many banks. It is also possible to add stamp duty to mortgage loans and increase your debt to cover the cost of the tax, but you could end up paying significantly more in interest payments.

"This video can not be played Hong Kong arrests media tycoon Jimmy Lai The Hong Kong business tycoon Jimmy Lai has been arrested along with other pro-democracy and media figures, raising fears of a broad crackdown by China. Mr Lai's Apple Daily newspaper offices were raided on Monday over allegations of collusion with foreign forces. His case is the most high-profile arrest so far under a controversial security law imposed by China in June. Mr Lai has been a prominent pro-democracy voice and a supporter of protests that erupted last year. In Februarythe 71-year-old, who also holds UK citizenship, was charged with illegal assembly and intimidation.He was granted police bail. Jimmy Lai: Rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice Hong Kong security law: What is it and is it worrying? The Hong Kong residents ready to leave for the UK Chinese state media outlet the Global Times on Monday described Mr Lai as ""riot supporter"" and his publications as having been ""instigating hatred, spreading rumours and smearing Hong Kong authorities and the mainland for years"". Scores of police were seen entering the offices Apple Daily and Mr Lai was led through the offices in handcuffs. According to the Global Times, two of his sons as well as two senior executives of Next Digital, a media company founded by Mr Lai, were also arrested. Hong Kong police confirmed that they had arrested 10 people - nine men and one woman - aged between 23 and 72. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And UK-based ITV News reported that Wilson Li, a freelance journalist who worked with the channel, had been arrested, also on suspicion of collusion with foreign powers. Another activist, Andy Li, was also arrested,ITV said in a statement.,external The sweep of arrests has raised fears that China will use its newly implemented security law to undertake a broad crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists and media figures. Mr Law said on Twitter that his ""worst fears"" were being realised,external, adding that the arrests represented the ""end of freedom of press in Hong Kong"". ""The national security law is quashing the freedom of our society, spreading politics of fear,"" he said. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong The sight of nearly 200 police officers raiding the newsroom of Apple Daily, the biggest pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong, is a shocking one for many here and a sign that things are changing rapidly. One Apple Daily employee told me that his colleagues were calm and had seen this coming when the National Security Law was passed. Mr Lai has been a very vocal critic of both the Hong Kong government and of Beijing's increasingly assertive presence in the territory. For that, China's official news media have often branded him the leader of the ""Gang of Four"" which incites unrest in the city. Beijing was also infuriated when he met US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year. But while Next Media has often been criticised for its sensationalism, it remains one of the very few media outlets with an owner who has no business interest in mainland China. The newspaper, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, is already under financial strain. The paper has said it will get today's issue out on time but if its flamboyant owner is silenced it is unclear whether it will survive. The businessman is estimated to be worth more than $1bn (Â£766m). Having made his initial fortune in the clothing industry, he later ventured into media and founded the newspaper Apple Daily, which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership. In 2019 the daily was the most-read paid newspaper in the territory, both in print and online, according to the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Mr Lai has also been an activist against Beijing's increasingly tight grip on Hong Kong. In 2019 he supported the reform protests and participated in the demonstrations. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai: China's security law 'spells the death knell for Hong Kong' (Interview from June 2020) On 30 June, when the security law was passed, Mr Lai told the BBC that this ""spells the death knell for Hong Kong"". He warned that Hong Kong would become as corrupt as mainland China because ""without the rule of law, people who do business here will have no protection"". In a separate interview with the AFP news agency, Mr Lai said: ""I'm prepared for prison. If it comes, I will have the opportunity to read books I haven't read. The only thing I can do is to be positive."" Unnamed sources within Apple Daily are cited as saying the company was ""arranging lawyers"", seeing the situation as ""straight harassment"". Hong Kong police have raided the building of Next Digital and Apple Daily Steven Butler, Asia programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the arrest ""bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong's national security law would be used to suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom"". ""Jimmy Lai should be released at once and any charges dropped,"" he said. Wang Dan, dissident and exiled student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, said on social media that the arrest ""was expected"" but ""very outrageous because his two sons were also arrested, which was obviously an attempt by the authorities to destroy Lai's will through family ties"". ""I call on the international community to take immediate action."" Hong Kong has had a high degree of autonomy since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and its residents have had a far higher level of freedom of speech and media than people on the mainland. But the law's key provisions include that crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison. It makes it easier to punish protesters, and reduces Hong Kong's autonomy. In 2019, there were waves of anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong The law also gives Beijing powers to shape life in the former British colony in a way it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech. China has said the new law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest. There have been two previous waves of arrests since the law was passed by Beijing on 30 June. The first one saw several protesters arrested the next day, as they staged a demonstration. On 30 July,four students and former pro-independence activists were arrestedunder the law. Other activists, like Mr Law, fled the city before the security law came into force. Mr Law is currently in the UK but media reports are suggesting thatChinese authorities are seeking the arrest of him and other activists in exile.

"Dawn Butler said she was pulled over by police while travelling through Hackney A Labour MP has accused police of racially profiling her after she was stopped while travelling in a car in east London. Former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butlertweeted she had been pulled over in Hackney,externaland had recorded the stop. The MP for Brent Central said police had to ""stop associating being black and driving a nice car with crime"". The Met said the stop was a mistake caused by an officer incorrectly entering the car's registration number. She told the Press Association: ""It's obviously racial profiling. ""We know that the police is institutionally racist and what we have to do is weed that out. We have to stop seeing black with crime. We have to stop associating being black and driving a nice car with crime."" The BMW was being driven by a male friend, who is also black, and it was pulled over by two police cars, Ms Butler said. She said officers said the car was registered in North Yorkshire and took the car keys while checking the registration. They then admitted there had been a mistake, that it was registered to the driver, and apologised, she said. Her footage of the stop, which happened at about 12:00 BST on Sunday, showed an officer saying police were carrying out searches because of ""gang and knife crime"". She is heard in the video telling the officers: ""It is really quite irritating. It's like you cannot drive around and enjoy a Sunday afternoon whilst black, because you're going to be stopped by police."" She goes on to say: ""If you are driving outside the area, I think that's a ridiculous reason to stop. ""If you are profiling people who are driving in a certain type of car, that's an inappropriate reason to stop, and if you are profiling people because of the colour of their skin, that's an inappropriate reason to stop."" One of the officers in the video tells her: ""I appreciate everything you say and I do apologise for wasting your time."" Ch Supt Roy Smithtweeted earlier,externalto say he had spoken to the MP who had ""given me a very balanced account of the incident"". The Met Police officer added the force ""are listening"" to concerns she had about the police stop and the officers involved, and she was ""quite entitled to raise them"". Last month the Met apologised after stopping and searching Team GB athletes Bianca Williams and Ricardo dos Santos In a statement the police force said: ""Prior to stopping the vehicle, an officer incorrectly entered the registration into a police computer which identified the car as registered to an address in Yorkshire. ""Upon stopping the vehicle and speaking with the driver, it quickly became apparent that the registration had been entered incorrectly and was registered to the driver in London. ""Once the mistake was realised the officer sought to explain this to the occupants; they were then allowed on their way. ""No searches were carried out on any individuals."" The force said ""one of the occupants"" had been contacted by a senior officer and they had discussed ""subsequent interaction as well as feedback regarding the stop"". It added: ""We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter further with the occupants if they wish to do so."" The statement did not explain why the registration was entered in the first place. In the video, one officer can be heard saying the initial search returned a car of the same make, model and colour but registered to North Yorkshire. Ms Butler questioned the officer, asking for the police to share the registration they initially searched for. ""It's exhausting doing things whilst black,"" she told PA. ""Because you're just doing every day things and you have to explain yourself away or justify the reason why you're driving through Hackney. It's exhausting and I'm tired of it."" This week Ms Butlerwas named by Vogue magazine,externalas one of the 25 most influential women for her support of Black Lives Matter protests. She has previously described how her backing of the anti-racism movement had led to threats on her office and staff, andlast month had to shut her headquarters for safety reasons.

"Victoria has recorded over 100 deaths in the past week Australia has recorded its deadliest day of the coronavirus pandemic amid a second wave of infections in Melbourne. Victoria state - of which Melbourne is the capital - reported 19 deaths on Monday. Victoria has now seen about two-thirds of Australia's total 314 deaths and approximately 21,400 cases. But the number of daily infections - though still in the hundreds - has dropped in recent days, prompting hope that a strict lockdown is working. Melbourne's second lockdown began over a month ago, but residents have been subject to a night-time curfew and stricter requirements since 3 August. Melbourne lockdown to keep a million workers home Melbourne police 'attacked and baited' over curfew Workers must carry a permit to leave home, and all non-essential businesses have been shut. Mask-wearing in public is also compulsory. Victoria reported 322 new cases on Monday, down from a high of 725 recorded five days ago. Other states reported few or no cases. More than 100 deaths have been recorded in Victoria in just the past week as hospital admission rates also rise. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said it was too early to tell if the state was at a turning point, but ""we're certainly seeing some greater stability"" following the stricter measures. ""It's always better to be lower than the previous day, but it is only one day's data,"" he said. Most deaths have been linked to outbreaks in nearly 100 aged care homes in the state. How an aged care crisis seized 'ill-prepared' Australia But a man in his 30s was among last week's victims - prompting authorities to urge young people to take greater care. In neighbouring New South Wales (NSW), which has seen small virus clusters in Sydney, the state government urged young people to restrict their social activities. Queensland, which has closed its border to NSW and Victoria,said on Monday it appeared to have avoided an outbreak, two weeks after travellers brought the virus back from Melbourne. Australia has still fared better than many countries overall due to effective suppression measures early in the pandemic. But since June - when most Australians emerged from a first lockdown - the outbreak in Melbourne has spiralled. How did the virus re-emerge in Australia? Why did Melbourne's lockdown fail to prevent more cases? Infections there make up more than 70% of Australia's total cases since the pandemic began. The outbreak is suspected to have begun with breaches in hotel quarantine of infected travellers returning from overseas. In recent days, medical groups have raised alarm over the growing number of healthcare workers falling sick with the virus. There are now over 700 such cases. A survey of physicians showed 20% of doctors in hospitals were having to source their own protective gear.

"Morikawa becomes the ninth player to win the US PGA championship on debut US PGA Championship, final round leaderboard -13C Morikawa (US);-11P Casey (Eng), D Johnson (US);-10M Wolff, B DeChambeau, T Finau, S Scheffler (all US), J Day (Aus);-9J Rose (Eng) Selected others:-7J Rahm (Spa),-4I Poulter (Eng);-3T Fleetwood (Eng), B Koepka (US);-2R McIlroy (NI);-1J Thomas (US), T Woods (US);+3R MacIntyre (Sco), S Lowry (Ire) Full leaderboard American Collin Morikawa emerged from a stacked leaderboard to win the 2020 US PGA Championship after a flawless final round in San Francisco. At one point on the back nine, six players shared the lead - but an eagle two on the 16th saw Morikawa go clear. The world number 12, playing in just his second major, carded a six-under 64 at TPC Harding Park to reach 13 under. England's Paul Casey was two shots back in a tie for second with overnight leader Dustin Johnson after a 66. Like Morikawa, Matthew Wolff was another unheralded American to rise through the field on Sunday, shooting a 65 to finish on 10 under. He tied for fourth with compatriots Bryson DeChambeau and Tony Finau, plus Australia's Jason Day, who all carded 66s on a nail-biting final day that made a mockery of concerns over how competitive the year's first major would be with no fans. Justin Rose hit a 67 to finish a shot further back after being three behind the lead overnight, along with fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who slipped to three under. Two-time defending champion Brooks Koepka trailed Johnson by two heading into the final round, but the American stumbled to a four-over 74 to also finish on three under. Morikawa wins US PGA - as it happened After a flawless final round, Morikawa's only blemish came when managed to drop the lid as he lifted the Wanamaker Trophy Heading into the final day, all the talk was of another potential battle between Johnson and Koepka after the latter held off his Ryder Cup team-mate to clinchlast year's US PGA. And Koepka cranked up their friendly rivalry by belittling Johnson's solitary major win after day three, saying: ""I like my chances. When I've been in this position before I've capitalised."" Yet Koepka did not factor in the leaderboard logjam as another American stole the show, one who is in just his second year on the PGA Tour. Remarkably, 23-year-old Morikawa has more victories on the tour than missed cuts, and was second at the Charles Schwab Challenge in June beforewinning last month's Workday Charity Open. He did not appear on the radar until shooting a 65 to go two off the lead on day three at Harding Park, just 20 miles from where he went to college at the University of California in Berkeley. But as Johnson tried to hold off the chasing pack, Morikawa moved into the fray with three birdies in his first 10 holes. He then chipped in for a birdie on the par-four 14th to become the first man to reach 11 under and, despite being joined by Casey, he hit the shot of the week from the 16th tee. Morikawa hit it to within seven feet on the par four and held his nerve to sink the eagle putt and put himself on the brink of becoming just the ninth player to win the US PGA on their debut, and the first since Keegan Bradley in 2011. ""It's amazing,"" said Morikawa, who grew up in Los Angeles. ""As a little kid, watching all these professionals, this is always what I've wanted to do. ""I felt very comfortable from the start, as an amateur, junior golfer, turning professional last year. But to finally close it off and come out here in San Francisco, pretty much my second home where I spent the past four years, it's pretty special."" Paul Casey missed out on becoming the oldest first-time major winner since 1967 Morikawa was four years old when Paul Casey claimed his first European Tour win in 2001, and since then the Englishman has seldom dropped out of the world's top 50. There has never been any doubt over his ability, it was whether he could produce when it really mattered - a major championship. The 43-year-old has yet to win a Players Championship or World Golf Championship event and his previous best in a major was a tie for third at the 2010 Open. Yet he remains one of the most consistent players on the tour and, after two wins last year, he travelled to San Francisco as world number 28. After a first round of 68, he said he felt more confident with caddie John McLaren back on the bag and having finished the third round two off the lead, there was genuine belief this could be his time. Three birdies in his first 10 holes on Sunday put Casey in contention to become England's first US PGA Championship winner since 1919 - and the oldest first-time major winner since 1967. But he dropped a shot at the 13th after overcooking his approach, and despite responding with two more birdies, Casey graciously said Morikawa deserved victory after that ""glorious"" tee shot. Paul Casey:""I played wonderful golf, but Collin thoroughly deserves it. I mean, what a shot he hit on 16, just awesome golf. There's nothing you can do except tip your cap to that. ""I'm very, very happy. It's been a great week, a strange week obviously missing the fans.""

"One in three UK employers expect to make staff redundant between July and September, a survey suggests. The research by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and recruiter Adecco shows a 50% jump in the number of employers expecting to cut jobs compared to three months ago. In the private sector, 38% of firms plan to make redundancies, compared to 16% in the public sector. Firms with plans to hire rose - but numbers were down on past years. There have been an increasing number of job cuts as the coronavirus pandemic wiped more than a quarter off UK economic output. In the month leading up to 9 July, more than 2,000 employers were asked whether they planned to make redundancies. While 33% said they did expect to let staff go, another 49% said they planned to hire in the three months until the end of September. That indicated an increase in confidence compared to the previous quarter when just 40% said they planned to take on new staff. However, that figure was still ""well below"" levels seen in previous years, the report's authors said. And the proportion of employers planning to hire, relative to those expecting to let go of staff, had fallen to its lowest level since 2013 when the survey began in its current form, they said. Events producer William Bird has been made redundant after four years with his firm William Bird, 27, had been working as an assistant producer at an events agency in London that creates tailored experiences for big brands. He was furloughed in April, and then at the end of June, he was told that he was being made redundant, after four years with the firm. ""Unfortunately, right now members of the public do not feel safe to attend events... so at the end of June, I was told that my company had done everything to try to retain me, but due to the lack of work coming in, they didn't have the financial backing to keep me on,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bird said it had been a ""difficult year in general"", as his mother passed away from cancer a few weeks into lockdown. ""It's been really upsetting and stressful. I've gone from having a tragedy in the family, to looking for work, and at the end of August I'm going to have to move out from the flat I rent in London with my girlfriend because we can't afford it anymore,"" he said. He says he only received three weeks' of redundancy pay as he was on rolling contracts during his first year with the firm. And he is upset that his month of notice in July was paid at the 80% furlough rate, rather than the full salary listed in his contract. The only consolation to the situation, says Mr Bird, is that his firm didn't want to let him go: ""They told me that this wasn't performance-based at all, and that they were making difficult decisions for the future of the company, with the hope that after the industry recovered, they'd love to offer me my job back."" Gerwyn Davies, an advisor at the CIPD, predicted a ""sombre autumn for jobs"". ""This is the weakest set of data we've seen for several years,"" he said. ""Until now, redundancies have been low - no doubt due to the Job Retention Scheme - but we expect to see more redundancies come through this autumn, especially in the private sector once the scheme closes. ""Hiring confidence is rising tentatively, but this probably won't be enough to offset the rise in redundancies and the number of new graduates and school leavers entering the labour market over the next few months."" What are my rights if I am made redundant? Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting' It comes as data from the Centre for Retail Research suggests that more than 22,000 restaurant jobs have been slashed already this year. That is more than double the number announced throughout the entire of 2019. Last week Pizza Express said it was considering closing 67 of its UK restaurants, which would mean the loss of 1,100 jobs. Meanwhile, Byron has announced 651 job cuts; the Casual Dining Group, which owns Bella Italia and Cafe Rouge, is to put 1,909 out of work and the owner of Upper Crust, SSP, has said 5,000 jobs are at risk. It comes asfigures obtained by the BBC showedthe number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, A Freedom of Information request shows that in June 1,778 firms said were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In June 2019, only 345 firms had plans to cut 24,000 jobs. Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting' What are my rights if I am made redundant?

"This video can not be played Hong Kong arrests media tycoon Jimmy Lai The Hong Kong business tycoon Jimmy Lai has been arrested along with other pro-democracy and media figures, raising fears of a broad crackdown by China. Mr Lai's Apple Daily newspaper offices were raided on Monday over allegations of collusion with foreign forces. His case is the most high-profile arrest so far under a controversial security law imposed by China in June. Mr Lai has been a prominent pro-democracy voice and a supporter of protests that erupted last year. In Februarythe 71-year-old, who also holds UK citizenship, was charged with illegal assembly and intimidation.He was granted police bail. Jimmy Lai: Rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice Hong Kong security law: What is it and is it worrying? The Hong Kong residents ready to leave for the UK Chinese state media outlet the Global Times on Monday described Mr Lai as ""riot supporter"" and his publications as having been ""instigating hatred, spreading rumours and smearing Hong Kong authorities and the mainland for years"". Scores of police were seen entering the offices Apple Daily and Mr Lai was led through the offices in handcuffs. According to the Global Times, two of his sons as well as two senior executives of Next Digital, a media company founded by Mr Lai, were also arrested. Hong Kong police confirmed that they had arrested 10 people - nine men and one woman - aged between 23 and 72. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reports said that police gathered hours later on Monday at the house of prominent pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow. Fellow activist Nathan Law wrote in a post on Twitter that Ms Chow had been arrested. ""Agnes Chow is arrested under National Security Law and we are still acquiring information about the content of the arrests. Horrible day,"" he wrote. And UK-based ITV News reported that Wilson Li, a freelance journalist who worked with the channel, had been arrested, also on suspicion of collusion with foreign powers. Another activist, Andy Li, was also arrested,ITV said in a statement.,external The sweep of arrests has raised fears that China will use its newly implemented security law to undertake a broad crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists and media figures. Mr Law said on Twitter that his ""worst fears"" were being realised,external, adding that the arrests represented the ""end of freedom of press in Hong Kong"". ""The national security law is quashing the freedom of our society, spreading politics of fear,"" he said. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong The sight of nearly 200 police officers raiding the newsroom of Apple Daily, the biggest pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong, is a shocking one for many here and a sign that things are changing rapidly. One Apple Daily employee told me that his colleagues were calm and had seen this coming when the National Security Law was passed. Mr Lai has been a very vocal critic of both the Hong Kong government and of Beijing's increasingly assertive presence in the territory. For that, China's official news media have often branded him the leader of the ""Gang of Four"" which incites unrest in the city. Beijing was also infuriated when he met US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year. But while Next Media has often been criticised for its sensationalism, it remains one of the very few media outlets with an owner who has no business interest in mainland China. The newspaper, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, is already under financial strain. The paper has said it will get today's issue out on time but if its flamboyant owner is silenced it is unclear whether it will survive. The businessman is estimated to be worth more than $1bn (Â£766m). Having made his initial fortune in the clothing industry, he later ventured into media and founded the newspaper Apple Daily, which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership. In 2019 the daily was the most-read paid newspaper in the territory, both in print and online, according to the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Mr Lai has also been an activist against Beijing's increasingly tight grip on Hong Kong. In 2019 he supported the reform protests and participated in the demonstrations. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai: China's security law 'spells the death knell for Hong Kong' (Interview from June 2020) On 30 June, when the security law was passed, Mr Lai told the BBC that this ""spells the death knell for Hong Kong"". He warned that Hong Kong would become as corrupt as mainland China because ""without the rule of law, people who do business here will have no protection"". In a separate interview with the AFP news agency, Mr Lai said: ""I'm prepared for prison. If it comes, I will have the opportunity to read books I haven't read. The only thing I can do is to be positive."" Unnamed sources within Apple Daily are cited as saying the company was ""arranging lawyers"", seeing the situation as ""straight harassment"". Hong Kong police have raided the building of Next Digital and Apple Daily Steven Butler, Asia programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the arrest ""bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong's national security law would be used to suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom"". ""Jimmy Lai should be released at once and any charges dropped,"" he said. Wang Dan, dissident and exiled student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, said on social media that the arrest ""was expected"" but ""very outrageous because his two sons were also arrested, which was obviously an attempt by the authorities to destroy Lai's will through family ties"". ""I call on the international community to take immediate action."" Hong Kong has had a high degree of autonomy since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and its residents have had a far higher level of freedom of speech and media than people on the mainland. But the law's key provisions include that crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison. It makes it easier to punish protesters, and reduces Hong Kong's autonomy. In 2019, there were waves of anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong The law also gives Beijing powers to shape life in the former British colony in a way it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech. China has said the new law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest. There have been two previous waves of arrests since the law was passed by Beijing on 30 June. The first one saw several protesters arrested the next day, as they staged a demonstration. On 30 July,four students and former pro-independence activists were arrestedunder the law. Other activists, like Mr Law, fled the city before the security law came into force. Mr Law is currently in the UK but media reports are suggesting thatChinese authorities are seeking the arrest of him and other activists in exile.

We're about to pause our live coverage for the day - thank you for joining us. Here is a round-up of the day's biggest developments from across the globe: Florida on Monday reported just over 4,200 new cases - the lowest new case count in the state since 23 June. The Sunshine State also reported 91 additional deaths. Last month, Florida was one of several US states seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases, at one point seeing consecutive days with over 10,000 new cases. Critics blamed a hasty reopening and lack of statewide regulations for the rise. While this signals a positive trend, Florida isn't out of the woods yet - there are still more than 30,000 residents in hospital for Covid-19, though emergency department visits have also been on the decline in the last two weeks. In all, more than 530,000 Floridians have tested positive for the virus and more than 8,000 have died. The state's positive test rate is also dropping, but remains high. Florida Senator Marco Rubio said the numbers were ""good news"" but cautioned: ""We need to stay on this track and not let complacency put us back in another surge."" The artistic director of London's Young Vic Theatre, Kwame Kwei-Armah, has said a woman removed her mask to cough in the face of his 15-year-old son on public transport. The director and playwright, who is black, tweeted about the incident, saying the white women then ran off the train shouting, ""this is what you people do"". He added that he was ""relieved"" his son had subsequently tested negative for coronavirus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Will GrantBBC News, Havana Cuba has registered its highest daily number of coronavirus cases after a recent rise in local transmission. The health ministry reported 93 cases just as the capital Havana re-entered a period of tighter restrictions. The recent spike in numbers comes after Cuba appeared to have successfully controlled the outbreak. While just 93 positive cases in 24 hours might be considered an enviable figure by countries where the pandemic is at its most fierce, in Cuba it represents a step backwards. Having recently registered no cases and no deaths from Covid-19 on one day a few weeks back, the island has gradually slid back to a situation where it has recorded its highest daily figure. Havana is facing a tightening of controls. Under the governmentâs phased system of restrictions, public transport has been suspended, inter-provincial travel prohibited, bars and restaurants ordered shut and the beaches closed. Fortunately, for the time being, deaths have not risen from the 88 people who had died from the virus by the beginning of the month. However, the effort to see tourism pick up has suffered a setback, further worsening the islandâs dire economic outlook for this year. Joshua NevettBBC News Dr Firass Abiad said his hospital was ""close to capacity"" Lebanonâs main Covid-19 hospital in Beirut is âclose to capacityâ after a spike in infections and last weekâs explosion led to an influx of patients, its director has said. Dr Firass Abiad, chief executive of Rafic Hariri University Hospital, told the BBC there has been an exponential rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Lebanon recently. A further 294 virus infections were recorded on Sunday, the biggest increase yet over a 24-hour period,according to Lebanonâs health ministry,external. More than 100 new infections have been recorded every day since 21 July, placing strain on Lebanonâs healthcare system. âObviously weâre extremely close to capacity, especially when it comes to ICU beds. Weâre working within the 90% plus occupancy rate,â Dr Abiad said. âThis is worrisome because we have to factor in what happened after the explosion.â The explosion, which killed more than 200 people and caused widespread destruction, made it difficult for people to abide by coronavirus regulations, like social distancing, Dr Abiad said. This will probably âaugment the rise in Covid-19 cases weâre already seeingâ, Dr Abiad added.

But the coronavirus rules vary from school to school across Germany, as education is a matter for each federal state. At Graues Kloster, a private school in Berlin, masks are worn in the classroom, as well as in corridors and other communal areas. Masks and social distancing are being hotly debated in Germany, even as classes resume. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The government will be reducing the number of people employed to track down contacts of those who have tested positive for
coronavirus from 18,000 to 12,000. NHS Test and Trace, working with Public
Health England, will put greater emphasis on contact tracing at a local level, with local authorities getting their own dedicated teams. In May, Health Secretary Matt Hancock
announced that an âarmyâ of contact tracers would be recruited for England's test
and trace service. Early on, there were reports that new recruits were sitting
idle â with one telling the BBC that she spent her time watching Netflix. Some 6,000 of them are now being stood down in England.
More of their work will be conducted by local staff with knowledge of their
area. The Department of Health has said that this is to provide a âmore
tailored approachâ which has been successfully trialled in Blackburn, Luton and
Leicester. But critics will see it as the latest example of
the government departing from its centralised approach to tackling the
outbreak. Plans to launch a national app to identify potentially infected people have been repeatedly delayed. Now the
top-down high-tech strategy for contact tracing is making way for what
seasoned local public health officials describe as old fashioned âshoe leather
epidemiologyâ. This relies on people with local knowledge collecting
information by going door-to-door on foot. Read the full story here. Young people in the US continue to be most affected by the economic crash caused by Covid-19, with one new report putting the figure for unemployed millennials on par with the number of Americans who have been infected. The Wall Street Journal reports that 4.8m millenials have lost their job due to the shutdown, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis. More than 5m Americans have tested positive for Covid-19., more than a quarter of all the cases in the world. Millennials are less likely to have savings, and more likely to lose their job amid the pandemic, experts say. A further 21 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK, taking the total number of people who have died after testing positive for the virus to 46,526. Public Health England said 69 historical deaths had been removed from the total because the individuals were later found not to have been positive for Covid-19. The latest government figures,externalalso showed 816 new cases had been recorded. Earlier we reported there had been eight deaths recorded today, due to partially updated information on the government's coronavirus data dashboard. Jonathan Mok posted a selfie and another photo of his injuries on Facebook A 15-year-old boy has admitted attacking a student from Singapore who was told ""we don't want your coronavirus in our country"". Jonathan Mok, 23, was beaten up on Oxford Street near Tottenham Court Road Tube station in London on 24 February. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court to wounding or grievous bodily harm without intent. He will be sentenced at the same court next month. Prosecutor Beata Murphy said the teenager had been with a group of friends when they saw UCL student Mr Mok walking along Oxford Street just after 21:00 GMT. She added: ""He [the victim] heard someone say something about coronavirus and he turned around and was told 'don't you look at me'. ""He was then punched in the face... until a passerby said to stop assaulting Mr Mok. ""He believes he was targeted because of ethnicity."" Read more here. From today face coveringsare compulsory in shops and other enclosed spaces in Northern Ireland. The move was broadly welcomed by both shoppers and retailers in east Belfast. One customer said she found wearing a face covering ""difficult"" but felt it was something she would have to get used to. Mark Thompson, whose partner is a health worker, said he has been wearing a face covering since the start of the pandemic and is glad that more people will doing the same. ""I think it's a bit irresponsible if you don't wear a mask, specifically in shops,"" he said. Stephen Bradley, who is a business owner in Belfast city centre, said: ""We are leaving the onus on the individual."" ""We have masks on ourselves when we are in the shop to make people feel as safe as possible,"" he added. However, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has said the primary responsibility for enforcement will lie with shops owners - and the force would only use enforcement ""as a last resort"", with fines of up to Â£60 for those who don't comply.

deployed 43,000 volunteers to assist in preventing the spread of the pandemic, the International Red Cross says. It comes after North Korean leader Kim Jong- un declared an emergency in July,  and imposed a lockdown on the city of Kaesong. State media said thata man who defected to South Korea in 2017 had returnedand was showing symptoms of Covid-19. The secretive state had previously not reported any virus cases andKim Jong-un hailed his country's ""shining success"" in dealing with Covid-19. However, experts say that it is unlikely the country had zero virus cases. There have been rumours of Covid-19 cases in North Korea for months, but the country's tightly-controlled society and state media have made them impossible to confirm, analysts say. Joshua NevettJournalist, BBC World Online More than 200 people are believed to have been killed by Tuesday's explosion The director of Lebanon's main Covid-19 hospital has told the BBC that he believes people angered by last week's blast are not
listening to government coronavirus rules. ""Weâre seeing is that people are becoming very tired and very angry,"" said Dr Firass Abiad, director of Rafic Hariri University Hospital. ""This is not conducive to
asking them to follow certain rules. Whatever the government comes out and
says, I donât think the people will follow those rules."" A lot of staff that could
have been allocated to fighting Covid-19 are now being required to take care of people injured in the explosion, he added. ""Because weâre a Covid
hospital, we had to take care of Covid patients from another hospital that was
damaged. So at the same time we were receiving Covid patients from that
hospital and casualties from the blast,"" Dr Abiad said. ""If that explosion did not
happen, we might have had more staff available,"" he added. Louise CullenBBC News NI Eligibility for anyone currently on the waiting list for fertility treatment in Northern Ireland is to be extended by a year, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. A phased return of services began at the Regional Fertility Centre earlier, after being suspended in March. Staff will contact patients when their appointments can resume, with opening hours extended to provide as many safe appointments as possible. Health Minister Robin Swann said the extension to eligibility would remove the pressure for women who would otherwise breach the upper age limit before receiving treatment.

Four of the biggest pantomimes in London will not go ahead this year because of continued uncertainty over when indoor performances can restart without social distancing. Hackney Empire, Lyric Hammersmith Theatre, Queen's Theatre Hornchurch
and Theatre Royal Stratford East have all announced they are postponing their annual Christmas pantomime until 2021. Last year's shows were attended by more than 145,000 people in total and they usually employ 285 freelance artists, including writers, directors, designers, actors, technicians and stage management. The production process for such performances would normally have begun at the start of August. But the theatres have said that without a confirmed date from the government for when indoor performances can resume without social distancing to make the shows economically viable, they will have to postpone. The government has announced a Â£1.5bn support package for the arts industry - but last month the return of socially-distanced indoor performances in Englandwas delayed because of a rise in coronavirus cases. A number of other pantomimes across the country, including at the Birmingham Hippodrome and the Blackpool Grand Theatre, have already been cancelled.

"Funding of up to Â£172m for thousands more apprentice nurses in England has been unveiled by the government. The Department of Health and Social Care said the money will allow healthcare employers to take on up to 2,000 nursing degree apprentices every year over the next four years. It said this will help make the career more accessible. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the move but said the plans did not go far enough. Nursing apprenticeships offer an alternative to full-time university courses, allowing people to earn a salary while their tuition costs are paid. At the end of the programmes - which usually take four years - apprentices are able to qualify as fully registered nurses. The government said its funding would enable more employers to meet the costs of taking on apprentices and help it deliver its target of 50,000 more nurses by 2024-25. Both the NHS and other healthcare employers will receive Â£8,300 per placement per year for new and existing apprenticeships under the scheme. It comes as the number of people looking for information on nursing on the NHS careers website rose by 138% between March and June, the DHSC said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I'm thrilled to see a rising interest in nursing careers, but we must ensure this fantastic career is truly diverse and open to all."" Gillian Keegan, apprenticeships and skills minister said: ""Apprenticeships are an excellent way for anyone, regardless of their background, to kick start their career or to progress."" Can the NHS boost nurse numbers by 50,000? Nurses' leaders urge 'care for those caring' 'We try our best as nurses, but it's not enough' However, Mike Adams, the Royal College of Nursing's director for England, said wider investment was needed to educate enough registered nurses. The union called on ministers to scrap tuition fees for nursing students who choose to train at university. He added: ""It is also the case that a full-time, three-year nursing degree remains the fastest way to deliver a registered nurse through education."" NHS and social care employers currently train around 1,000 nurse apprentices every year. Nurses were among thousands of NHS workers who took to the streets across the UK on Saturday to demand better wages for staff. Can the NHS boost nurse numbers by 50,000?

"Twitter has approached TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to express an interest in buying its US operations, according to reports. Video-sharing platform TikTok has been at the centre of fierce debate in recent weeks and takeover talk. Last week US Donald Trump ordered firms to stop doing business with TikTok within 45 days over security concerns. Tech giant Microsoft is the front-runner to buy TikTok but now Twitter has emerged as a possible suitor. But it remains unclear whether Twitter can afford to buy TikTok from its Chinese owners and can complete a deal within the 45-day window, according to sources quoted in theWall Street Journal,external. The value of TikTok's US operations are unclear but estimates put it at tens of billions of dollars. Twitter's market capitalisation is about $29bn (Â£22bn), dwarfed by Microsoft's at more than $1.6tn. But experts believe a possible Twitter deal would face less regulatory scrutiny than Microsoft's. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on a possible deal while TikTok didn't respond immediately when contacted by the BBC. TikTok threatens legal action against Trump US ban Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? Trump demands US cut of Microsoft TikTok deal Last Friday, Mr Trump ordered US firms to stop doing business with the Chinese app within 45 days. The Trump administration claims that the Chinese government has access to user information gathered by TikTok, which the firm has consistently denied. In response to the US president's executive order, TikTok has threatened legal action against the US saying it was ""shocked"" by the move. The US government also unveiled a ban on Chinese-owned messaging app WeChat as tensions escalate between the two countries. Mr Trump said last week he would support Microsoft's efforts to buy TikTok's US operations if the government got a ""substantial portion"" of the proceeds. He has set a deadline of 15 September for the deal to be completed or the ban will go ahead. Microsoft said it ""will move quickly to pursue discussions"" for TikTok's operations in the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. ""Even if the deal goes through, be it Microsoft or Twitter taking a substantial stake in TikTok, what remains to be seen is how both parties are going to move forward operationally,"" said communications expert Sharon Koh. ""It will also take a tumultuous effort for both organisations to meander through the political sensitivities,"" she added.

"Funding of up to Â£172m for thousands more apprentice nurses in England has been unveiled by the government. The Department of Health and Social Care said the money will allow healthcare employers to take on up to 2,000 nursing degree apprentices every year over the next four years. It said this will help make the career more accessible. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the move but said the plans did not go far enough. Nursing apprenticeships offer an alternative to full-time university courses, allowing people to earn a salary while their tuition costs are paid. At the end of the programmes - which usually take four years - apprentices are able to qualify as fully registered nurses. The government said its funding would enable more employers to meet the costs of taking on apprentices and help it deliver its target of 50,000 more nurses by 2024-25. Both the NHS and other healthcare employers will receive Â£8,300 per placement per year for new and existing apprenticeships under the scheme. It comes as the number of people looking for information on nursing on the NHS careers website rose by 138% between March and June, the DHSC said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I'm thrilled to see a rising interest in nursing careers, but we must ensure this fantastic career is truly diverse and open to all."" Gillian Keegan, apprenticeships and skills minister said: ""Apprenticeships are an excellent way for anyone, regardless of their background, to kick start their career or to progress."" Can the NHS boost nurse numbers by 50,000? Nurses' leaders urge 'care for those caring' 'We try our best as nurses, but it's not enough' However, Mike Adams, the Royal College of Nursing's director for England, said wider investment was needed to educate enough registered nurses. The union called on ministers to scrap tuition fees for nursing students who choose to train at university. He added: ""It is also the case that a full-time, three-year nursing degree remains the fastest way to deliver a registered nurse through education."" NHS and social care employers currently train around 1,000 nurse apprentices every year. Nurses were among thousands of NHS workers who took to the streets across the UK on Saturday to demand better wages for staff. Can the NHS boost nurse numbers by 50,000?

"A 12-year-old girl has died after getting into difficulty in a river near Loch Lomond. Emergency services were called to the area around Balloch Bridge on the River Leven at 18.45 on Sunday following reports that the girl had fallen into the water. A major search was carried out involving two rescue helicopters, a police underwater unit, the fire service and rescue boats. The body was found three hours later. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""Around 9.45pm, the young girl was recovered from the water. Sadly she was pronounced dead at the scene.

"Morikawa becomes the ninth player to win the US PGA championship on debut US PGA Championship, final round leaderboard -13C Morikawa (US);-11P Casey (Eng), D Johnson (US);-10M Wolff, B DeChambeau, T Finau, S Scheffler (all US), J Day (Aus);-9J Rose (Eng) Selected others:-7J Rahm (Spa),-4I Poulter (Eng);-3T Fleetwood (Eng), B Koepka (US);-2R McIlroy (NI);-1J Thomas (US), T Woods (US);+3R MacIntyre (Sco), S Lowry (Ire) Full leaderboard American Collin Morikawa emerged from a stacked leaderboard to win the 2020 US PGA Championship after a flawless final round in San Francisco. At one point on the back nine, six players shared the lead - but an eagle two on the 16th saw Morikawa go clear. The world number 12, playing in just his second major, carded a six-under 64 at TPC Harding Park to reach 13 under. England's Paul Casey was two shots back in a tie for second with overnight leader Dustin Johnson after a 66. Like Morikawa, Matthew Wolff was another unheralded American to rise through the field on Sunday, shooting a 65 to finish on 10 under. He tied for fourth with compatriots Bryson DeChambeau and Tony Finau, plus Australia's Jason Day, who all carded 66s on a nail-biting final day that made a mockery of concerns over how competitive the year's first major would be with no fans. Justin Rose hit a 67 to finish a shot further back after being three behind the lead overnight, along with fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who slipped to three under. Two-time defending champion Brooks Koepka trailed Johnson by two heading into the final round, but the American stumbled to a four-over 74 to also finish on three under. Morikawa wins US PGA - as it happened After a flawless final round, Morikawa's only blemish came when managed to drop the lid as he lifted the Wanamaker Trophy Heading into the final day, all the talk was of another potential battle between Johnson and Koepka after the latter held off his Ryder Cup team-mate to clinchlast year's US PGA. And Koepka cranked up their friendly rivalry by belittling Johnson's solitary major win after day three, saying: ""I like my chances. When I've been in this position before I've capitalised."" Yet Koepka did not factor in the leaderboard logjam as another American stole the show, one who is in just his second year on the PGA Tour. Remarkably, 23-year-old Morikawa has more victories on the tour than missed cuts, and was second at the Charles Schwab Challenge in June beforewinning last month's Workday Charity Open. He did not appear on the radar until shooting a 65 to go two off the lead on day three at Harding Park, just 20 miles from where he went to college at the University of California in Berkeley. But as Johnson tried to hold off the chasing pack, Morikawa moved into the fray with three birdies in his first 10 holes. He then chipped in for a birdie on the par-four 14th to become the first man to reach 11 under and, despite being joined by Casey, he hit the shot of the week from the 16th tee. Morikawa hit it to within seven feet on the par four and held his nerve to sink the eagle putt and put himself on the brink of becoming just the ninth player to win the US PGA on their debut, and the first since Keegan Bradley in 2011. ""It's amazing,"" said Morikawa, who grew up in Los Angeles. ""As a little kid, watching all these professionals, this is always what I've wanted to do. ""I felt very comfortable from the start, as an amateur, junior golfer, turning professional last year. But to finally close it off and come out here in San Francisco, pretty much my second home where I spent the past four years, it's pretty special."" Paul Casey missed out on becoming the oldest first-time major winner since 1967 Morikawa was four years old when Paul Casey claimed his first European Tour win in 2001, and since then the Englishman has seldom dropped out of the world's top 50. There has never been any doubt over his ability, it was whether he could produce when it really mattered - a major championship. The 43-year-old has yet to win a Players Championship or World Golf Championship event and his previous best in a major was a tie for third at the 2010 Open. Yet he remains one of the most consistent players on the tour and, after two wins last year, he travelled to San Francisco as world number 28. After a first round of 68, he said he felt more confident with caddie John McLaren back on the bag and having finished the third round two off the lead, there was genuine belief this could be his time. Three birdies in his first 10 holes on Sunday put Casey in contention to become England's first US PGA Championship winner since 1919 - and the oldest first-time major winner since 1967. But he dropped a shot at the 13th after overcooking his approach, and despite responding with two more birdies, Casey graciously said Morikawa deserved victory after that ""glorious"" tee shot. Paul Casey:""I played wonderful golf, but Collin thoroughly deserves it. I mean, what a shot he hit on 16, just awesome golf. There's nothing you can do except tip your cap to that. ""I'm very, very happy. It's been a great week, a strange week obviously missing the fans.""

Scores of police were seen entering the offices Apple Daily and Mr Lai was led through the offices in handcuffs. According to the Global Times, two of his sons as well as two senior executives of Next Digital, a media company founded by Mr Lai, were also arrested.

""The national security law is quashing the freedom of our society, spreading politics of fear,"" he said. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong The sight of nearly 200 police officers raiding the newsroom of Apple Daily, the biggest pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong, is a shocking one for many here and a sign that things are changing rapidly. One Apple Daily employee told me that his colleagues were calm and had seen this coming when the National Security Law was passed. Mr Lai has been a very vocal critic of both the Hong Kong government and of Beijing's increasingly assertive presence in the territory. For that, China's official news media have often branded him the leader of the ""Gang of Four"" which incites unrest in the city. Beijing was also infuriated when he met US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year. But while Next Media has often been criticised for its sensationalism, it remains one of the very few media outlets with an owner who has no business interest in mainland China. The newspaper, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, is already under financial strain. The paper has said it will get today's issue out on time but if its flamboyant owner is silenced it is unclear whether it will survive. The businessman is estimated to be worth more than $1bn (Â£766m). Having made his initial fortune in the clothing industry, he later ventured into media and founded the newspaper Apple Daily, which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership. In 2019 the daily was the most-read paid newspaper in the territory, both in print and online, according to the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Mr Lai has also been an activist against Beijing's increasingly tight grip on Hong Kong. In 2019 he supported the reform protests and participated in the demonstrations. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai: China's security law 'spells the death knell for Hong Kong' (Interview from June 2020) On 30 June, when the security law was passed, Mr Lai told the BBC that this ""spells the death knell for Hong Kong"". He warned that Hong Kong would become as corrupt as mainland China because ""without the rule of law, people who do business here will have no protection"". In a separate interview with the AFP news agency, Mr Lai said: ""I'm prepared for prison. If it comes, I will have the opportunity to read books I haven't read. The only thing I can do is to be positive."" Unnamed sources within Apple Daily are cited as saying the company was ""arranging lawyers"", seeing the situation as ""straight harassment"". Hong Kong police have raided the building of Next Digital and Apple Daily Steven Butler, Asia programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the arrest ""bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong's national security law would be used to suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom"". ""Jimmy Lai should be released at once and any charges dropped,"" he said. Wang Dan, dissident and exiled student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, said on social media that the arrest ""was expected"" but ""very outrageous because his two sons were also arrested, which was obviously an attempt by the authorities to destroy Lai's will through family ties"". ""I call on the international community to take immediate action."" Hong Kong has had a high degree of autonomy since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and its residents have had a far higher level of freedom of speech and media than people on the mainland. But the law's key provisions include that crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison. It makes it easier to punish protesters, and reduces Hong Kong's autonomy. In 2019, there were waves of anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong The law also gives Beijing powers to shape life in the former British colony in a way it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech. China has said the new law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest. There have been two previous waves of arrests since the law was passed by Beijing on 30 June. The first one saw several protesters arrested the next day, as they staged a demonstration. On 30 July,four students and former pro-independence activists were arrestedunder the law. Other activists, like Mr Law, fled the city before the security law came into force.

"Jimmy Lai was sentenced in April 2021 to a year in prison The billionaire media mogul Jimmy Lai, one of the most prominent supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, is now on trial. Already imprisoned on fraud charges and for his involvement in protests in the territory, the 76-year-old is now accused of colluding with foreign forces. He has denied all the charges. The trial has drawn international attention, with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron calling for the release of Mr Lai, who is a UK citizen. Critics say his case shows how Hong Kong's legal system has become a weapon to silence political opposition. Mr Lai, who has been in jail for almost three years, now faces a potential life sentence. He has been a persistent thorn in China's side. Unlike other tycoons who rose to the top in Hong Kong, Mr Lai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory. As a result, he has faced a string of charges and was eventually sentenced to a prison term in 2021 on a charge of ""unauthorised assembly"". Last December, he was handed a five-year sentence for fraud. He is still the most prominent person charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law, which can carry a life sentence. ""Iâm a born rebel,"" he told the BBC in an interview in 2020, hours before he was charged. ""I have a very rebellious character."" Jimmy Lai was born in Guangzhou, a city in southern China, to a wealthy family that lost everything when the communists took power in 1949. He was 12 years old when he fled his village in mainland China, arriving in Hong Kong as a stowaway on a fishing boat. While working odd jobs and knitting in a small clothing shop he taught himself English. He went from a menial role to eventually founding a multi-million dollar empire including the international clothing brand Giordano. Hong Kong offers HK$1m bounties on five activists Hong Kong's universities shrivel in Beijing's grip Hong Kong is a place of fear, Agnes Chow tells BBC The chain was a huge success. But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijingâs Tiananmen Square in 1989, Mr Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur. He started writing columns criticising the massacre that followed the demonstrations in Beijing and established a publishing house that went on to become one of Hong Kong's most influential. This video can not be played The Hong Kong billionaire risking it all by speaking out As China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Mr Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper. In a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Mr Lai had been a persistent critic of Chinese authorities both through his publications and writing. This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of Hong Kong. But on the mainland he is viewed as a âtraitorâ who threatens Chinese national security. In recent years, masked attackers firebombed Mr Laiâs house and company headquarters. He was also the target of an assassination plot. But none of the threats stopped him from airing his views robustly. He was a prominent part of the cityâs pro-democracy demonstrations and was arrested twice in 2021 on illegal assembly charges. Jimmy Lai was detained by Hong Kong's newly set-up national security unit When China passed Hong Kong's new national security law in June 2020, Mr Lai told the BBC it sounded the ""death knell"" for the territory. The influential entrepreneur also warned that Hong Kong would become as corrupt as China. Without the rule of law, he said, its coveted status as a global financial hub would be ""totally destroyed"". The media mogul is known for his frankness and acts of flamboyance. In 2021, he urged US President Donald Trump to help the territory, saying he was ""the only one who can save us"" from China. His newspaper, Apple Daily, published a front-page letter that finished: ""Mr President, please help us."" For Mr Lai, such acts were necessary to defend the city which had taken him in and fuelled his success. He once told news agency AFP: ""I came here with nothing, the freedom of this place has given me everything... Maybe itâs time I paid back for that freedom by fighting for it.""

"Twitter has approached TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to express an interest in buying its US operations, according to reports. Video-sharing platform TikTok has been at the centre of fierce debate in recent weeks and takeover talk. Last week US Donald Trump ordered firms to stop doing business with TikTok within 45 days over security concerns. Tech giant Microsoft is the front-runner to buy TikTok but now Twitter has emerged as a possible suitor. But it remains unclear whether Twitter can afford to buy TikTok from its Chinese owners and can complete a deal within the 45-day window, according to sources quoted in theWall Street Journal,external. The value of TikTok's US operations are unclear but estimates put it at tens of billions of dollars. Twitter's market capitalisation is about $29bn (Â£22bn), dwarfed by Microsoft's at more than $1.6tn. But experts believe a possible Twitter deal would face less regulatory scrutiny than Microsoft's. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on a possible deal while TikTok didn't respond immediately when contacted by the BBC. TikTok threatens legal action against Trump US ban Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? Trump demands US cut of Microsoft TikTok deal Last Friday, Mr Trump ordered US firms to stop doing business with the Chinese app within 45 days. The Trump administration claims that the Chinese government has access to user information gathered by TikTok, which the firm has consistently denied. In response to the US president's executive order, TikTok has threatened legal action against the US saying it was ""shocked"" by the move. The US government also unveiled a ban on Chinese-owned messaging app WeChat as tensions escalate between the two countries. Mr Trump said last week he would support Microsoft's efforts to buy TikTok's US operations if the government got a ""substantial portion"" of the proceeds. He has set a deadline of 15 September for the deal to be completed or the ban will go ahead. Microsoft said it ""will move quickly to pursue discussions"" for TikTok's operations in the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. ""Even if the deal goes through, be it Microsoft or Twitter taking a substantial stake in TikTok, what remains to be seen is how both parties are going to move forward operationally,"" said communications expert Sharon Koh. ""It will also take a tumultuous effort for both organisations to meander through the political sensitivities,"" she added.

"This video can not be played An unexpectedly lively election campaign has revived hope for change in Belarus Belarus has only ever had one president and Alexander Lukashenko, who has held the position since 1994, is running for office again on Sunday. The man once dubbed ""Europe's last dictator"" is facing perhaps the biggest-ever challenge to his rule - from Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a political novice. She says she is standing ""out of love"" for her jailed husband Sergei, but she also embodies a thirst for change in society. The campaign for this election had an unexpectedly lively start as surprise challengers to Mr Lukashenko - video blogger Sergei Tikhanovsky, banker Viktor Babaryko and ex-diplomat Valery Tsepkalo - attracted thousands to their nomination rallies. This was unusual in a country normally considered quite politically apathetic. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko under fire The mother challenging an authoritarian president Belarus opposition rally attracts thousands despite crackdown But all three were disqualified from the race, with Mr Tikhanovsky and Mr Babaryko ending up behind bars. Now, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has picked up the baton and the three campaigns have merged to back her candidacy. A teacher and housewife, Svetlana's primary goal is to end Mr Lukashenko's rule and hold a new democratic election within six months. She has been joined in her campaigning by Mr Tsepkalo's wife Veronika, and Mr Babaryko's election agent Maria Kolesnikova. The ""female trio"", as they are popularly known, advocate peaceful change, use inclusive rhetoric and steer clear of divisive political issues. Svetlana gathered the largest rally in a decade in Belarus on 30 July, with an NGO estimating attendance at over 60,000 and even the police admitting a crowd of close to 20,000. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: The last anti-Lukashenko rally comparable in size took place in 2010 Experts view Mr Lukashenko as an authoritarian populist who claims legitimacy through grassroots support, rather than international recognition. None of the previous elections he won was found free and fair by Western observers. Yet in even the most controversial poll, in 2010, where he won nearly 80% of the vote, he most likely had the support of the majority (51%), a respected independent pollster IISEPS said. The lowest percentage of the vote he has ever won was 75%. Analysts believe there are several factors behind his apparent loss of popularity this time round: fatigue from his 26-year rule, the country's economic woes and, most importantly, his dismissive handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, which angered the public. In an address to the nation Mr Lukashenko lashed out at his rivals and Russia Belarus and Russia have historically described themselves as brotherly nations. Mr Lukashenko came to power on pro-Russian slogans and was at the root of the union state established in 1999 - an agreement allowing the citizens of each country to freely travel to and live in the other, among other things. Since then, he has manoeuvred to hold on to privileged access to Russian resources and markets, using fraternal rhetoric. His fortunes changed in 2018, however, when Moscow started pushing for closer integration in earnest. In this election campaign, Mr Lukashenko presented himself as a protector of independence and cast his rivals as ""puppets"" of Russian oligarchs. Russian media initially showed little interest in the campaign and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said his country had ""no candidates"" of its own in the election. But tension escalated on 29 July when Belarusian police detained 33 Russian men and accused them of being mercenaries from the Wagner private military company, saying they had arrived to ""destabilise"" Belarus and were suspected of collaborating with Mr Tikhanovsky. Russia denied that, and alleged the group was merely travelling via Belarus to Turkey. Moscow later strongly demanded that Minsk release the men. It is not clear what their real mission might be. Belarus ruler Lukashenko says Russia lying over 'mercenaries' According to political analyst Artyom Shraybman, Mr Lukashenko's posturing as a fighter against Russian meddling has earned him no extra popularity points and the ""Wagner"" incident failed to scare voters, who turned out in numbers for Ms Tikhanovskaya's rally shortly after the detention. The results of several online polls on Mr Lukashenko's likely support have turned into a popular protest meme and earned him the mocking nickname ""Sasha 3%"" on social media. Three percent in votes is obviously an exaggeration, but there are no credible independent polls in the country and few believe the high support figures circulated by pro-government polls - the Ecoom Centre predicts 72.3% for Mr Lukashenko. There will be just one exit poll by the CIS-owned TV company Mir and very few observers to check the results of the vote count on 9 August. Few doubt that Mr Lukashenko will use all means at his disposal to stay on - from loyal election officials, flawed electoral legislation and the controversial practice of early voting, to the use of force to suppress potential protests. Early voting in the election started on 4 August He has made it clear on several occasions that he may use troops to stop ""unrest"" if needed. Given the apparent lack of a clear post-election plan on the part of Ms Tikhanovskaya's camp if Mr Lukashenko is declared the winner, pundits tend to agree that a crackdown on the likely protests in response might enable him to hang onto power in the short term. They also note, however, that this scenario will turn him into an international pariah again and seriously weaken his negotiating position in ""integration"" bargaining with Russia. It will also make him totally dependent on the uniformed state agencies, rather than popular support for the rest of his tenure.
