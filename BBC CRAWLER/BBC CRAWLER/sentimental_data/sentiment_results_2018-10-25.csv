"Universities in the UK which benefited in previous centuries from the slave trade should contribute to a Â£100m fund to support ethnic minority students, says a university leader. Geoff Thompson, chair of governors of the University of East London, says it would be ""ethical and right"" for universities to contribute. He says it would help young people who otherwise could not afford to graduate. Last month, Glasgow University revealed it had received slave-related funding. Glasgow Universitydiscovered that up to Â£198m in today's value had been donated in the 19th Century by people who had profited from the slave trade. In response it announced a ""reparative justice programme"", including creating a centre for the study of slavery and a memorial to the enslaved. But Mr Thompson says there should be a collective university fund to support today's black and ethnic minority students through university. The University of East London has been sending Freedom of Information requests to other UK universities to see if their institutions had received money from the slave trade between the 16th and 19th Century - with the findings to be gathered next month. He said in the wake of the Windrush scandal, it was ""prescient, ethical and right"" to ""seize this historic opportunity to invest in those who cannot afford or cannot see themselves graduating with a life-changing qualification"". Glasgow University honours first African American medical graduate Anti-slavery campaigner recognised in exhibition From slavery to Windrush: My family's story Mr Thompson says that even if universities are too recent to have been open during the slavery era, many might be a continuation of older institutions that could have benefited from profits from slavery. ""Every university has historians, archivists and researchers who can help institutions inform them about their past,"" said Mr Thompson. ""It is about how seriously we take the past to inform our future, and what we can do to help change lives."" In the United States there have been arguments over how to reconcile universities with historic links to slavery and slave-owning. Georgetown University has given extra support in its admissions process to thedescendants of a group of slaves sold by the universityin the 19th Century. Harvard University put up a plaque in commemoration of slaves who had lived and worked at the university.

"Chloe (r) had more than 30 foster placements before she moved in with Sarah Chapman (l) Leaving care can feel like facing a cliff edge and it is not only care leavers who say this, it is government ministers. They are launching a landmark scheme to ease the path to adulthood for some of England's most vulnerable teenagers. More than 50 organisations, including government departments and industry giants like Rolls-Royce, have signed up to the government'sCare Leaver Covenant,external, which will provide 10,000 work opportunities to care leavers over 10 years. They aim to help people like Chloe, who was in foster care from the age of 13, and now, at 18, holds down a steady job in the hospitality industry. ""When I tell people about my previous life you can see their jaws drop,"" she says. ""I thought I would end up as a drug addict and I just accepted it. It was all I thought my life would amount to."" Chloe says she had more than 30 placements in three years. She ran away frequently and ""spent a lot of time in police stations, waiting to be picked up again"". She says the right support at the right time has helped her on ""a massive journey"". ""I've grown up so much in the past year."" At 17, as the end of her time in care approached, Chloe feared she might end up in a hostel - but her social worker suggested tryingsupported lodgings through the charity Barnardo's,,externalwhere people offer a spare room to a vulnerable young person and help them on the path to independent living. The person with the spare room was Sarah Chapman, a lawyer in her early 30s, from Warwickshire. She already volunteered with Barnardo's and with the Girl Guides, so, when she heard about supported lodgings, she knew she was well placed to help. ""I enjoy working with that age group. So I thought it was a good opportunity to put my spare room to better use than just a regular lodger, and maybe help out a teenager who needed support at a quite a critical time in their life,"" says Sarah. Background checks, training and reassurances about ongoing support followed. Sarah was approved as a host and then the charity began sending potential lodgers round to meet her. ""It was a little bit nerve-wracking but, you know, part of the process, and it was a really good part, to make sure you're matching people with the right provider."" Chloe was the second girl to come round and the pair ""clicked"". ""We were very comfortable in each other's company and the conversation flowed easily. So we all agreed that she could move in."" A year on, Sarah says: ""It's been excellent."" She likes having company around the house and is impressed by how Chloe has ""straightened herself out"". Chloe says starting work was key to her transformation. She eventually hopes to move into management or run her own business. ""I like having a job. I like being busy. I don't like sitting down doing nothing."" But before she moved in with Sarah it was difficult to hold down a job because she was constantly moving home. Now she has ""somewhere I know I'm going to be able to go back to"". ""It's not like I'm going to get there and my social worker will be outside in a car with all my stuff in the back telling me I'm moving."" At Sarah's she is learning to cook and eat more healthily, to shop and budget for herself and even to save out of her wages. Sarah says there have been ""a few ups and downs... but mainly things you get living with any teenager"". ""They're not keen on washing up or cleaning or taking the bins out, but I don't think that's a symptom of coming out of the care system, I think it's a symptom of being a teenager."" Chloe admits that, initially, she had low expectations of sharing Sarah's home. ""I'd learnt the hard way not to get too excited or attached because I'd been passed around so many places. ""But this was different. Sarah let me put up posters, pictures and mirrors, and we went out shopping together to get lamps, shelves and duvets. ""For the first time I started to feel pretty good about myself."" Unlike care leavers who go straight into independent living, there's no danger of the electricity being cut off because she has run out of money and there's always enough to eat. Leaving care: The financial reality Starting university after leaving care She says she would advise any other young person offered the chance of supported lodgings to ""go for it"". Under the supported lodgings arrangements, Chloe is eligible to stay at Sarah's until she is 21 and ready to be properly independent. ""It's Sarah's home but now it feels like my home too,"" says Chloe. ""I always tell her where I'm going and what I'm doing, but it's not like she's pretending to be my mum. ""We've grown very close and we have very long talks about all sorts of things, from mundane stuff to relationships. I know that I can talk to her about anything."" Sarah agrees that substitute parents are ""often the last thing these teenagers need"". ""They're looking for an older sister, an aunt, a mentor, supportive but not mollycoddling or trying to do everything for them. ""This is the point at which they're trying to learn how to be independent.""

"Scientists say they have engineered a new antibiotic that appears promising in early clinical trials. The drug, made by Shionogi Inc, acts like the Trojan horse in Greek legend to trick bacteria into allowing it to enter. Trials on 448 people with a kidney or urinary tract infection suggested the drug was as effective as current treatments. Experts said the findings were an encouraging development. The drug takes inspiration from the story of the giant wooden horse which was used to sneak Greek warriors into the city of Troy. But instead of wood, iron is used to smuggle an antibiotic into bacteria. Dr Simon Portsmouth, who led the international research, said: ""During an acute infection, one of our innate immune responses is to create an iron-poor environment. ""In response, bacteria increase their iron intake."" The new antibiotic, cefiderocol, binds to iron and, in a deadly mistake, bacteria transport it past their defences and inside their cells. The trial results have been reported in theLancet Infectious Diseases journal.,external ""Cefiderocol was found to be both safe and tolerable,"" says Dr Portsmouth. Man has 'world's worst' super-gonorrhoea Antibiotics 'may be lost' through overuse, says chief medical officer Why is it so difficult to discover new antibiotics? The study is a rare development in the field. Bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics is making some infections incredibly difficult to treat. The Review on Antimicrobial Resistancemade stark predictions for the future, including 10 million people dying every year from drug-resistant infections by 2050. Projections of deaths from drug-resistant infections by 2050 Yet new drugs are in scarce supply. Prof Serge Mostowy, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""This important study offers hope for a new antibiotic that could potentially be an alternative to treating them, but we are not there yet."" Much larger trials are still needed to be sure of the effectiveness of the new antibiotic. Experiments in people with pneumonia and those with infections that are resistant to some of our most powerful drugs, carbapenems, are already under way. However, once cefiderocol is smuggled inside, it kills bacteria in the same way as current antibiotics. Experts say that new classes of antibiotics - that attack bacteria in completely new ways - are urgently needed.

"Ed Farmer was found unresponsive and taken to hospital, but died A university student died from the ""toxic effects"" of drinking excessive alcohol on an ""initiation-style"" bar crawl, a coroner has ruled. Newcastle University's Ed Farmer died in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest in December 2016. The 20-year-old, from Leicester, had been on a night out organised by members of the Agricultural Society. Mr Farmer's family criticised the university over its stance towards initiation events. Coroner Karen Dilks said there had been a lack of awareness of the ""inherent risks"" of binge drinking and Mr Farmer had died as a ""direct effect"" of consuming so much alcohol in a short period of time. She said first-year students should be formally trained about the potentially fatal risks of alcohol. Speaking outside court, Mr Farmer's father Jeremy said the inquest had been a ""difficult and testing process"". He said the family had been left ""utterly underwhelmed and frustrated by the apparent inactivity of Newcastle University and its student union to get to the heart of the problem of student initiations"". ""Ed's is not the first utterly needless and wasteful death to come about through this potentially fatal practice,"" he said. He added they had made the ""most difficult decision"" to agree to the release of CCTV footage showing Mr Farmer on the ground at a Metro station. ""We have made this decision trusting that these images can be used to bring home to students and universities the real dangers associated with the practice of initiations,"" he said. This video can not be played Ed Farmer's father said his family had made the ""difficult decision"" to release this CCTV footage. At one bar, the group had ordered about 100 triple vodkas and Mr Farmer was later carried to a student house, the inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard. Some first-years had their heads shaved, were sprayed with paint used to mark stock, drank vodka from a pig's head andbobbed for apples in a mixture of urine and alcohol. Witnesses told the hearing they were aware initiation-style events had been banned because they were ""dangerous and put a lot of pressure on people"" but they were viewed as a ""tradition"". The university said it would be ""reflecting carefully on all that we have learned at the inquest"". Registrar Dr John Hogan said: ""Following our disciplinary investigations, a number of students were found to be in breach of university rules and appropriate individual sanctions were imposed. ""The students' union also took action against the society involved."" The coroner said a copy of her report would be made available to the university and its students' union, as well as to Universities UK, the Department for Education and the Department of Health.

"Kelly Mayhew died in 2015 after a botched operation A woman accused of killing a patient who had silicone injections in her buttocks in New York should be deported to the United States, a judge has said. Kelly Mayhew, 34, died in 2015 after having cosmetic surgery injections in the basement of a house in Queens. Donna Francis, 38, from Essex, is wanted in the US and could face charges over criminally negligent homicide. The case will now be sent to Home Secretary Sajid Javid to make the final decision within the next two months. Ms Francis could also be charged with unauthorised practise of a profession. She moved to the UK the day after the procedure and was arrested in May 2017. The court heard that Ms Mayhew and her mother visited Ms Francis's home on 30 May at 18:00 EST and were taken to the basement, where there were two folding chairs and a treatment table. While the silicone injections were being administered, Ms Mayhew's mother held her daughter's hand. But part way through, she said she noticed that her daughter was no longer gripping her hand, was gurgling and her eyes were bloodshot and bulging. Paramedics were called but Ms Mayhew was declared dead at 19:42. The extradition hearing took place at Westminster Magistrates' Court An autopsy reported seven puncture sites in Ms Mayhew's buttocks following the injection of unencapsulated silicone. Previously the court heard that the type of silicone used by Ms Francis, who did not wear a surgical gown during the procedure, was in the wrong form and caused systemic emboli, which led Ms Mayhew's death. She has been fighting extradition to the US, saying it breached her right to a family life under article 8 and she faces inhumane conditions and torture under article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The judge ruled that although being separated from her daughter would lead to to emotional distress, the public interest in deportation, particularly for such a serious offence, outweighed this. He noted that Ms Francis, from Loughton, was not focused at the time on the young woman who died but on fleeing the scene and then the country the next day. No appeal is possible until after the decision by Mr Javid.

"More UK homes will be at flood risk in the future Englandâs coastal communities havenât faced up to the reality of rising seas through climate change, a report says. An increase of at least 1m is almost certain at some point in the future, the governmentâs advisors predict. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) warns this huge rise may happen over the next 80 years - within the lifetimes of today's children. A government spokesman said the public would be protected from the impacts of climate change. But the CCC says current shoreline management plans are unfunded and hopelessly optimistic. It estimates that by the 2080s, up to 1.2 million homes may be at increased risk from coastal floods. Young will pick up climate change bill, advisers warn Final call to save the world from 'climate catastrophe' What is climate change? Will more people have to abandon their homes in future? The CCCâs chief executive, Chris Stark, told BBC News: âPeople know sea level is going to rise â but they havenât grasped how bad this could be for them.â His colleague Professor Julia King added: âWeâve got to wake up to the fact that weâve got some very difficult challenges ahead. âWe need local councils to have some honest discussions with people to help them prepare for the difficult choices theyâll face.â The report says many coastal communities are particularly vulnerable because populations in coastal areas are often poorer and older than the UK average. It highlights the issue of land-slips on the coast. It says 100,000 cliff-top properties could be at risk from coastal landsliding, but the public donât have clear and accurate information about the issues and thereâs no insurance or compensation for people who lose their homes. Is it just homes that are under threat? No, itâs much wider than that. Transport, energy and waste infrastructure are also exposed to coastal flooding and erosion. Approximately 7,500km of road, 520km of railway line, 205,000 hectares of good farm land, and 3,400ha of potentially toxic historic landfill sites are currently at 0.1% or greater risk of coastal flooding in any given year. Power plants, ports, gas terminals and other significant assets are also at risk. The report says the government needs to focus on protecting these assets, as well as saving peopleâs homes. Whatâs more, coastal defences are likely to be at risk of failure as sea levels rise. A rise of 0.5m is projected to make a further 20% of England's coastal defences vulnerable to failure. The risk will be even higher if the current rates of deterioration of saltmarshes, shingle beaches and sand dunes continue. Some more key facts In England, 520,000 properties (including 370,000 homes) are in areas with a 0.5% or greater annual risk from coastal flooding. By the 2080s, that figure could rise to 1.5 million properties (including 1.2 million homes). In addition, approximately 1,600km of major roads, 650km of railway line, 92 railway stations and 55 historic landfill sites are at risk of coastal flooding or erosion by the end of the century. A government spokesperson said: ""The government has already committed Â£1.2bn of investment in coastal erosion and sea flooding projects over the next six years to better protect 170,000 homes. ""We welcome the committee's report which will inform our work to tackle increasing flood and coastal erosion risks, ahead of the publication of our Government Policy Statement on flooding and coastal erosion next year.""

The building is home to news network CNN, which received one of the devices by post the previous day. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said thorough examinations of all the packages were under way at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, near Washington DC. Several of the packages appear to have contained pipe bombs, according to the FBI. CNN quotes investigators as saying they were functional but unstable, meaning they could be set off merely by handling. They have timers easily bought at retail outlets. Ten packages were dispatched - most with a return address of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, her last name misspelt But experts speaking to several US media outlets have cast doubt on their effectiveness after seeing X-ray images. Anthony May, a former government bomb expert, told NPR the packages contained only one set of batteries - not enough to trigger the explosive. Earlier, Mr Sweeney confirmed that white powder found inside the package sent to CNN ""did not present a biological threat"". New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill could not confirm whether all the devices were intended to explode, but he said officials ""are treating them as suspected explosive devices"". ""This has to be taken with the utmost seriousness,"" he said. ""As far as a hoax device? We're not treating it that way."" Mr O'Neill added that authorities ""do not know at this time"" whether there were additional devices in the mail. On Thursday morning, the FBI said Mr Biden had received two suspect packages and a similar package was found at a New York restaurant owned by Mr De Niro. The series of bomb alerts began on Monday, whena suspected device was found in the post box of billionaire businessman George Soros, a major Democratic Party donor. Devices were sent to the following eight individuals, according to the FBI: Mr Soros Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former Vice-President Joe Biden Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters Mr De Niro None of the devices went off. A suspected explosive device was found at a building in Manhattan early on Thursday, local time. It is home to Mr De Niro's production company and the Tribeca Grill restaurant. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the ""really quick-witted work of a security guard"" who alerted authorities. The Academy Award-winning actor has been a vocal critic of President Trump According to the Associated Press, the security guard was off work on Thursday and had seen an image in a news report of the packages others had received. That individual then recalled spotting something similar in the building's mailroom and immediately called authorities who removed the device at about 06:30 local time (10:30 GMT), AP reports. CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after the package addressed to Mr Brennan was found in its mailroom. Every person who has has been sent a package is known to be a critic of President Donald Trump. The attempted bombings also come just under two weeks before the mid-term elections, with US politics highly polarised. Why Trump attacks the media On Wednesday, President Trump responded to the unfolding news of the suspect packages by calling for more civility in public life, and urging politicians to stop treating their opponents as ""morally defective"". This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Stop endless hostility"" His critics called his remarks hypocritical, and former CIA Director John Brennan tweeted to him on Thursday: ""Stop blaming others.

"An artwork created by an artificially intelligent program has beensold at auction for $432,000 (Â£337,000).,external The final price is far higher than the $7,000-$10,000 estimate put on it by Christie's in New York before the sale. The painting, called Portrait of Edmond Belamy, was created by a Paris-based art collective called Obvious. The artwork was produced using an algorithm and a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th Centuries. To generate the image, the algorithm compared its own work to those in the data set until it could not tell them apart. The portrait is the first piece of AI art to go under the hammer at a major auction house. The sale attracted a significant amount of media attention. ""AI is just one of several technologies that will have an impact on the art market of the future - although it is far too early to predict what those changes might be,"" said Christie's specialist Richard Lloyd, who organised the sale.

"Employers say university has to be available for adults wanting to re-train Employers and universities are calling for major changes to student funding in England, to reverse the collapse in part-time student numbers. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) says university should not only be for young people, and adults need to be able to re-train for new skills. Part-time undergraduate numbers have fallen by more than 50% since 2010. The CBI and Universities UK want more support for students to take short, flexible part-time courses. A joint statement warns of a generation of ""lost learners"" who might previously have gone back to study for part-time degrees or other qualifications. They are calling for a more flexible system, where students can take shorter courses and with greater support for people who are trying to work and study. They suggest funding could be drawn from the apprenticeship levy paid by employers. Second chance learn: 'No exams but I knew I wasn't thick' Theresa May launches review of future of tuition fees 'I want to be the first in my family to go to university' They say the decline in part-time study is a lost opportunity for people wanting to improve their job options - and a problem for employers concerned about a skills gap after Brexit. The government's review of tuition fees and student finance in England is currently considering how much students should pay, interest rates and maintenance support. Businesses and universities are calling on the review to take more account of the needs of part-time, adult learners, as well as school leavers on full-time degree courses. The rise in tuition fees in England has been a particular deterrent for part-time learners, who might have jobs and family responsibilities and were reluctant to take on such levels of debt. Across the UK, for all types of degrees, part-time learners fell by 37% between 2010-11 and 2016-17. But for undergraduate study in England, part-time numbers slumped by 51%, according to figures quoted by Universities UK. For the CBI and UUK report, there were interviews with more than 830 people who had considered going on to study part-time, but had decided against it or dropped out. They were asked what barriers needed to be removed, and 59% wanted cheaper tuition fees, 44% more flexible courses to fit around their other commitments and 37% wanted more support for living costs. The project's chair, Julie Lydon, vice chancellor of the University of South Wales, said the current system was failing to meet the ""significant demand"" for a more flexible approach to studying. Prof Lydon said the ""challenges of Brexit"", an ageing population and rapid technological change meant that the economy needed more skilled people in the workforce. ""Learning and improved life chances should not stop when you reach your twenties,"" she said. Matthew Fell, the CBI's policy director, said: ""Too often we think of universities as being just for young people, but as this work shows, adult education and lifelong learning matter just as much. ""Universities need to play a critical role in responding to the changing world of work by offering education and training for learners for whom a three-year bachelor's degree doesn't quite fit their circumstances,"" he said. The government's review of tuition fees and post-18 funding is expected to deliver its findings in the new year.

Last week, he said Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Hillary Clinton and former Attorney General Eric Holder - who were all targeted with suspicious packages - ""are losing it"", and that ""they've gone so far left that they can't even believe that they're over there"". During his campaign Mr Trump promised topay the legal bills of anyone who assaults a protester,externaland vowed to jail his opponent Hillary Clinton after the election. CNN's President Jeff Zucker on Wednesday condemned the ""total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks"". He added that Mr Trump ""should understand their words matter"". But conservatives say Democrats are to blame for the state of political discourse in the US. They say Democrats, including those who were targeted in the bomb scare, have encouraged ""angry mob"" behaviour. Republican Congressman Steve Scalise, who nearly died after he was shot in 2017 by a deranged supporter of progressive Senator Bernie Sanders during a morning softball practice, wrote in Fox News on Thursday of the ""growing list of violent or threatening actions taken against conservatives by Democrats"".

"Ed Farmer was found unresponsive and taken to hospital, but died A university student died from the ""toxic effects"" of drinking excessive alcohol on an ""initiation-style"" bar crawl, a coroner has ruled. Newcastle University's Ed Farmer died in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest in December 2016. The 20-year-old, from Leicester, had been on a night out organised by members of the Agricultural Society. Mr Farmer's family criticised the university over its stance towards initiation events. Coroner Karen Dilks said there had been a lack of awareness of the ""inherent risks"" of binge drinking and Mr Farmer had died as a ""direct effect"" of consuming so much alcohol in a short period of time. She said first-year students should be formally trained about the potentially fatal risks of alcohol. Speaking outside court, Mr Farmer's father Jeremy said the inquest had been a ""difficult and testing process"". He said the family had been left ""utterly underwhelmed and frustrated by the apparent inactivity of Newcastle University and its student union to get to the heart of the problem of student initiations"". ""Ed's is not the first utterly needless and wasteful death to come about through this potentially fatal practice,"" he said. He added they had made the ""most difficult decision"" to agree to the release of CCTV footage showing Mr Farmer on the ground at a Metro station. ""We have made this decision trusting that these images can be used to bring home to students and universities the real dangers associated with the practice of initiations,"" he said. This video can not be played Ed Farmer's father said his family had made the ""difficult decision"" to release this CCTV footage. At one bar, the group had ordered about 100 triple vodkas and Mr Farmer was later carried to a student house, the inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard. Some first-years had their heads shaved, were sprayed with paint used to mark stock, drank vodka from a pig's head andbobbed for apples in a mixture of urine and alcohol. Witnesses told the hearing they were aware initiation-style events had been banned because they were ""dangerous and put a lot of pressure on people"" but they were viewed as a ""tradition"". The university said it would be ""reflecting carefully on all that we have learned at the inquest"". Registrar Dr John Hogan said: ""Following our disciplinary investigations, a number of students were found to be in breach of university rules and appropriate individual sanctions were imposed. ""The students' union also took action against the society involved."" The coroner said a copy of her report would be made available to the university and its students' union, as well as to Universities UK, the Department for Education and the Department of Health.

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid has apologised to people who were wrongly forced to take DNA tests to prove they were entitled to settle in the UK. A Home Office review,externalfound there were at least 449 cases where letters had been sent with the demand. Mr Javid told the House of Commons that some relatives of Gurkhas and Afghan nationals employed by the UK government were among those affected. It was ""unacceptable"" and guidance was ""unclear or wrong"", he said. The Home Office launched an internal review four months ago after admitting officials wrongly forced immigrants to take DNA tests. ""I want to take this opportunity to apologise to those affected by this practice,"" Mr Javid told MPs. ""The provision of DNA evidence should always be voluntary and never mandatory."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The Home Office's internal review of the wrongful DNA demands says the rules were ""not clearly understood"" - not least because immigration officials are drowning in documents. There are 40,000 documents in seven IT systems - so it's perhaps no surprise that case workers received advice which was unclear or seemingly contradicted the law. Given Sajid Javid has only been in post since April, it raises questions for Amber Rudd, who resigned over misleading MPs over illegal immigrant targets, and her predecessor, the prime minister. Theresa May presided over the Home Office for six years and back in 2012 said she wanted to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigration. It's that broader policy objective - which critics say leads to applicants being regarded as suspects -  that is under fire yet again. When Mr Javid committed to cleaning up the injustices done to the Windrush generation, he underlined that ""hostile environment""was not a phrase he would use,external. The question is whether a massive post-Brexit reform to the immigration system will convince the Home Office's critics that it can treat all people fairly and equally before the law. Mandatory DNA testing was included as a requirement for a 2013 scheme for Afghan nationals formerly employed by the UK government. This has now been removed, Mr Javid said. In January 2015, similar guidance on DNA testing was included in a scheme for adult dependent children of Gurkhas, who are Nepalese and have been part of the Army for more than 200 years. Mr Javid said this guidance was wrong. The Home Office report said DNA evidence was requested in 398 cases as part of a 2016 operation investigating fraud, of which 83 applications were refused. Seven of those cases were refused solely for not providing DNA evidence. In a further 51 cases, DNA was requested from relatives of Gurkhas. ""I am determined to get to the bottom of how and why, in some cases, people were compelled to provide DNA in the first place,"" he told MPs. ""Across our immigration system, no-one should face a demand to supply DNA evidence and no-one should have been penalised for not providing it."" No preference for EU migrants, cabinet agrees Call to scrap high-skilled migrants cap Mr Javid said those affected would be reimbursed and he announced he had set up a task force and a review of the immigration system to be informed by Wendy Williams, who investigated the Windrush scandal. Enny Choudhury, solicitor at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said a mother and daughter she represented were ""rendered destitute"" for two and a half years as a result. ""It is clear that countless others will have been subject to the same treatment and it is astonishing that ministers still do not have a grasp on the failings of the Home Office,"" she said. Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty UK's Refugee and Migrant Rights Programme Director, said the problems with the Home Office were ""systemic, chronic and deep-rooted"" and in need of urgent reform.

Warning: This article contains language that some readers may find offensive Rugby club fined Â£5,000 over abuse Refs boycott rugby club over sexist abuse Club fined for abuse of female referee The report, which was submitted to the IRFU's Ulster Branch, outlines the ""sustained, vile, sexist abuse"" to which Ms Crabtree says she was subjected during the game by four men. In it, she describes how a small number of spectators shouted a ""tirade of profanities and sexual remarks"" at her during the 80-minute game. As the match progressed, Ms Crabtree wrote that she overheard the men yelling at her in sexually degrading language, using the words ""slag"" and ""ho"" when she made a decision to award a yellow card. Coleraine RFC has been fined Â£5,000 by IRFU's Ulster Branch over the incident ""The game continued and I could hear men laughing at how funny they found themselves,"" she said. ""I noticed that the crowd was splitting, which left four men standing on their own. ""As I approached, they jeered and told me I was a 'fucking joke'."" Her statement said the men told her to ""take off your shorts so we get a better look at your arse"". Ms Crabtree said the abuse made her feel ""anxious and unsettled"". The report states the ""jeering and sexual comments"" continued into the second half. It said the men shouted comments such as: ""Yo, you slag, you're a fucking disgrace, you slag."" Ms Crabtree said she approached the men after the game to ask their names for her official report, and asking if they felt their behaviour had been appropriate. She said one of the men dismissed her using a graphic sexual swear word. Ms Crabtree described feeling ""shock, confusion and fear"" at the comments, adding that, as she made her way into the referee changing room, she felt ""physically sick"". In the days following the initial report to Ulster Branch, a Â£2,000 suspended fine was handed down to Coleraine RFC. At the time, the Ulster Society of Rugby Football Referees (USRFR) said that Ulster rugby officials had investigated the abuse and upheld the charges. However, in her report, Ms Crabtree described that initial fine as a ""non-sanction"" adding that she felt it added ""insult to injury"". ""I endured continued sexist abuse and Coleraine have had no immediate punishment and these men were not held accountable for their actions,"" she said. She added that she felt let down by both the club and the Ulster Branch over how the situation was handled. The initial response was not welcomed by the USRFR either, which refused to officiate at any Coleraine RFC home matches in protest as Ms Crabtree had not yet received an apology, and the club had not held anyone to account. That prompted a second investigation in September, when the Ulster Branch received Ms Crabtree's report. It has since been revealed that the club has been fined Â£5,000 by Ulster rugby officials in relation to the incident. It is understood that Â£2,000 of that fine will be returned to Coleraine RFC in two years if there are no further incidents. In a statement issued earlier this week, a Coleraine RFC spokesperson said the club was ""pleased"" the issue had been resolved and had accepted the outcome of the investigation. ""We are now looking forward to giving a warm welcome to all referees and teams visiting our club for matches this week and in the future,"" said the spokesperson. A spokesperson for Ulster Branch said: ""Following a recommendation by the review panel, the IRFU Ulster Branch has imposed a fine on Coleraine RFC. ""This sanction has been accepted by the club. ""While the Coleraine RFC issue is now closed, the IRFU Ulster Branch is actively considering how to promote respect for referees."" On Tuesday the IRFU released a strategic plan outlining the organisation's goals for both the men's and women's game over the next five years. One of the key objectives is to increase the female participation in rugby to 20% - including players, coaches, referees, volunteers and committees. There are currently 12 women refereeing rugby matches in Ireland; the IRFU hope this will increase to 80 by 2023. Ulster Rugby authorities carried out two investigations into the incident Ms Crabtree is one of only three female rugby referees in Ulster. A former City of Derry and Ulster Rugby player, Ms Crabtree has been volunteering as a rugby referee since her playing career was cut short through injury. She has now completed a Level 4 course, qualifying her to referee All Ireland League matches. As a result of the incident, it is understood that officials have now launched a second review, focusing on educating referees on how to deal with abusive behaviour during matches. None of the men responsible for the abuse have been identified or disciplined. The USRFR has now ended its boycott and will referee Coleraine's first home game since the incident - on Saturday when the 1st XV will again play host to Dromore RFC. ""Our interest is the protection of our volunteer members and we are assured by the branch that they are actively reviewing measures to ensure their future well-being,"" said a USRFR spokesperson. In a statement on Thursday, Coleraine RFC said it had ""apologised to the referee for the abuse she was subjected to by spectators at the club"". ""A plan is now in place at the club to ensure that Coleraine remains a safe place for spectators, players and officials and we look forward to welcoming visiting teams, their supporters and of course our match officials,"" it continued.

"Daniel Chambers was described as a ""kind, thoughtful and loving"" son A 15-year-old boy died from hypothermia in a freezing field after missing his school bus. Daniel Chambers, from Tipton St John, Devon, went missing in extremely cold and wet conditions on 13 December. His partially-clothed body was discovered slumped at the base of a tree near a river in the village four days later. An inquest at Exeter's County Hall concluded his death was an accident. More stories from across Devon and Cornwall Daniel was a pupil at The Kings School, in Ottery St Mary, where he had recently sat his GCSE mock exams. After missing the bus, he was seen by a dog walker close to the River Otter, near his home. A police operation was launched after his mother raised the alarm at 16:30 GMT on the day he went missing. His body was discovered on 17 December in a field near Tipton St John. Whisky was found in his rucksack and tests showed his blood alcohol level was over the legal limit for driving. The assistant coroner Lydia Brown said the cause of death was hypothermia. She said severe cases could lead to ""paradoxical undressing"", where the sufferer removes his or her clothing. The coroner said it was ""inexplicable"" why he had left home but never arrived at school. She said the teenager came from a close family, and that he had never gone missing before. His best friend, George Salter, said Daniel was ""a quiet and shy person"" and that he was ""cheery and smiling and his normal self"" the day before his disappearance. In a statement, Daniel's parents Jonathan and Mary said: ""Our world will never be the same again. ""Daniel was all you could have asked for in a son. ""He was kind, thoughtful and caring and made us all smile with his loving nature.""

"Some of the rescued people are in a serious condition At least 18 people have been killed in flash floods near the Dead Sea in Jordan, most of them in a bus that was swept away. The bus was carrying 37 pupils and seven members of staff to the Zara Maeen hot springs area when it was washed away, officials said. A huge rescue operation has been launched and Israel said it had sent helicopters at Jordan's request. So far 34 people have been rescued from the area, Reuters reported. Some of them are said to be in a serious condition. The dead and injured also included members of families picnicking at the popular tourist spot. Jordan's Prime Minister Omar Razzaz (r) visited the injured in hospital The Dead Sea is the lowest point on Earth and popular with visitors. But its arid conditions and its deep canyons make it susceptible to flash floods. Police chief Brig Gen Farid al-Sharaa told state TV that the flash flood had surged for up to 5km (three miles). ""There were people who ended up in the sea water and there were people who managed to reach rocks and save themselves. Thank God we managed to save 13 people without any injuries,"" he said. Jordan's King Abdullah cancelled a visit to Bahrain scheduled for Friday because of the tragedy, local media reported. The Israeli military said that following a request from the Jordanian government, it had sent a number of helicopters with soldiers from an elite search-and-rescue unit. Troops were helping to locate those missing despite adverse weather conditions, a statement said. Many families were reunited with their children at a hospital near the Dead Sea Details of the victims have not been released although an education ministry official said the students were from a private school, the Jordan Times reported. The official, who was not named, expressed surprise that a school trip had been organised despite weather warnings. Heavy rain has been sweeping the region for several days. Some streets in the Jordanian capital, Amman, have been inundated, leading to traffic jams, while large hailstorms have been reported elsewhere.

"Women will be able to apply for any British military role for the first time, the defence secretary has said. Gavin Williamson announced that all combat roles were now open to women, including serving in special forces units such as the SAS. He said for the first time the ""armed forces will be determined by ability alone and not gender"". A ban on women serving in close combat units in the British military was lifted in 2016. The Royal Armoured Corps, which operates tanks, was the first ground close combat branch to open its doors to women in November 2016. Since then, about 35 women have either served in, or been trained to join, the Royal Armoured Corps. RAF's close combat unit opens to women Women to serve in close combat roles The opening of roles for women in close combat has been phased. As of now, women already serving in the Army are able to apply for the Royal Marines and the infantry. That will open the door for them to join special forces units such as the SAS after the necessary training. Mr Williamson told BBC News: ""We very much expect women to be joining the SAS and the Special Boat Service. ""The value that they'll bring, the impact they'll make will be phenomenal and all the services are looking forward to welcoming them."" Kat Dixon, centre, hopes she will inspire other women to join L/Cpl Kat Dixon, who serves with the Royal Wessex Yeomanry, is the first female tank gunner in her regiment having joined the Army reserves two and a half years ago. She said: ""I don't want to say I am a trailblazer but I want people to follow. I think women have a lot to offer. ""If you can meet the necessary requirements I don't think anything should be off-limits but you should have to meet the same requirements."" This video can not be played The army's new tests are based on skills required in close combat roles. She said the physical tests she had to pass were difficult, adding that ""it presents different challenges for women but they are not unsurpassable"". ""The lads in the squadron are very supportive of me,"" she said. ""You are just one of them. When you have got this kit on it doesn't really matter."" However, retired officer Col Richard Kemp said the new policy would ""cost lives"". ""My experience is if you have a team of men, even with one or two women, it could lead to divisiveness.""

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid has apologised to people who were wrongly forced to take DNA tests to prove they were entitled to settle in the UK. A Home Office review,externalfound there were at least 449 cases where letters had been sent with the demand. Mr Javid told the House of Commons that some relatives of Gurkhas and Afghan nationals employed by the UK government were among those affected. It was ""unacceptable"" and guidance was ""unclear or wrong"", he said. The Home Office launched an internal review four months ago after admitting officials wrongly forced immigrants to take DNA tests. ""I want to take this opportunity to apologise to those affected by this practice,"" Mr Javid told MPs. ""The provision of DNA evidence should always be voluntary and never mandatory."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The Home Office's internal review of the wrongful DNA demands says the rules were ""not clearly understood"" - not least because immigration officials are drowning in documents. There are 40,000 documents in seven IT systems - so it's perhaps no surprise that case workers received advice which was unclear or seemingly contradicted the law. Given Sajid Javid has only been in post since April, it raises questions for Amber Rudd, who resigned over misleading MPs over illegal immigrant targets, and her predecessor, the prime minister. Theresa May presided over the Home Office for six years and back in 2012 said she wanted to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigration. It's that broader policy objective - which critics say leads to applicants being regarded as suspects -  that is under fire yet again. When Mr Javid committed to cleaning up the injustices done to the Windrush generation, he underlined that ""hostile environment""was not a phrase he would use,external. The question is whether a massive post-Brexit reform to the immigration system will convince the Home Office's critics that it can treat all people fairly and equally before the law. Mandatory DNA testing was included as a requirement for a 2013 scheme for Afghan nationals formerly employed by the UK government. This has now been removed, Mr Javid said. In January 2015, similar guidance on DNA testing was included in a scheme for adult dependent children of Gurkhas, who are Nepalese and have been part of the Army for more than 200 years. Mr Javid said this guidance was wrong. The Home Office report said DNA evidence was requested in 398 cases as part of a 2016 operation investigating fraud, of which 83 applications were refused. Seven of those cases were refused solely for not providing DNA evidence. In a further 51 cases, DNA was requested from relatives of Gurkhas. ""I am determined to get to the bottom of how and why, in some cases, people were compelled to provide DNA in the first place,"" he told MPs. ""Across our immigration system, no-one should face a demand to supply DNA evidence and no-one should have been penalised for not providing it."" No preference for EU migrants, cabinet agrees Call to scrap high-skilled migrants cap Mr Javid said those affected would be reimbursed and he announced he had set up a task force and a review of the immigration system to be informed by Wendy Williams, who investigated the Windrush scandal. Enny Choudhury, solicitor at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said a mother and daughter she represented were ""rendered destitute"" for two and a half years as a result. ""It is clear that countless others will have been subject to the same treatment and it is astonishing that ministers still do not have a grasp on the failings of the Home Office,"" she said. Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty UK's Refugee and Migrant Rights Programme Director, said the problems with the Home Office were ""systemic, chronic and deep-rooted"" and in need of urgent reform.

A French urban climber, dubbed Spider-Man for his feats, has scaled one of London's tallest buildings without safety gear. Alain Robert, 56, completed his bare-handed ascent of the 662ft (202m) building at 110 Bishopsgate - known as the Heron Tower - in 40 minutes. Police confirmed he had been arrested for causing a public nuisance. His ascent took officers ""away from genuine emergencies"", City of London Police said. Cdr Karen Baxter said: ""The incident this afternoon has had a considerable impact on police, other emergency services and the local community. ""Road closures meant a significant disturbance to local transport and businesses and their staff located in the building were also considerably affected. ""While the incident has caused immense disruption to everyday business in the City of London it also posed a significant level of risk to the safety of people in and around Heron Tower at the time."" Mr Robert admits what he is doing is ""dangerous"" but insists he has a ""certain knowledge"" Before the climb, Mr Robert said: ""I fully feel alive when my life is at stake.""

"Nearly one in three pregnant women in England is having labour induced - an increase from one in five 10 years ago, according to figures from NHS Digital. Rising numbers of older and overweight women giving birth is behind the trend, experts say. Induced labours are usually started with pills or gels, often because babies are large or overdue. Women should be encouraged to keep to a healthy weight before and during pregnancy, doctors advise. Last year, in 2017-18,NHS data,externalshows labour started naturally for 52% of babies delivered in hospital, and this was down from 69% in 2007-08. The most common method of delivery was spontaneous vaginal delivery - except among women over 40 years old, where caesareans accounted for more. Babies most likely to be born at 4am Women 'being denied Caesarean choice' Birth trauma mother 'wanted to die' Pat O'Brien, consultant obstetrician and spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists, said women over 40 giving birth were advised to consider induction when they reached their due date, and this was pushing up inductions. In women of this age, the placenta may 'run down' and not provide the baby with as much food and oxygen as it needs. ""The average age of women giving birth is rising all the time,"" he said. ""They are also more likely to have pre-existing problems, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, which create complications. ""And with the rise in obesity, more women are likely to have bigger babies which leads to more inductions."" However, he said induction was a safe procedure which could reduce some risks and did not necessarily lead to a caesarean, as was previously thought. if a woman is overdue and does not go into labour naturally (or spontaneously) by 42 weeks, or 40 weeks for the over-40s, there is a higher risk of problems or stillbirth after this time if a woman's waters break early - more than 24 hours before labour starts - bringing an increased risk of infection to her and the baby if a woman or her baby have a health condition and do not seem to be thriving The NHS figures show planned caesareans are also increasing - from 11% in 2007-08 to 16.2% in 2017-18. Dr O'Brien said: ""The majority of elective caesarean births are performed for medical reasons, such as a baby being in a breech position, and some may be offered in response to maternal choice, which should also be supported."" He added: ""Women must be informed about the benefits and risks of the different ways to give birth, which will differ for each woman based on her individual case, pregnancy and medical history, so she can make an informed decision."" And he said it was important that women and men were encouraged to maintain a healthy weight before conception and women keep to a healthy weight during pregnancy to reduce the risk of complications. Other maternity data collected for most - but not all - deliveries in England last year, shows that most newborns weighed between 3kg and 3.49kg at birth and 74% of babies had breast milk as their first feed.

"Some of the rescued people are in a serious condition At least 18 people have been killed in flash floods near the Dead Sea in Jordan, most of them in a bus that was swept away. The bus was carrying 37 pupils and seven members of staff to the Zara Maeen hot springs area when it was washed away, officials said. A huge rescue operation has been launched and Israel said it had sent helicopters at Jordan's request. So far 34 people have been rescued from the area, Reuters reported. Some of them are said to be in a serious condition. The dead and injured also included members of families picnicking at the popular tourist spot. Jordan's Prime Minister Omar Razzaz (r) visited the injured in hospital The Dead Sea is the lowest point on Earth and popular with visitors. But its arid conditions and its deep canyons make it susceptible to flash floods. Police chief Brig Gen Farid al-Sharaa told state TV that the flash flood had surged for up to 5km (three miles). ""There were people who ended up in the sea water and there were people who managed to reach rocks and save themselves. Thank God we managed to save 13 people without any injuries,"" he said. Jordan's King Abdullah cancelled a visit to Bahrain scheduled for Friday because of the tragedy, local media reported. The Israeli military said that following a request from the Jordanian government, it had sent a number of helicopters with soldiers from an elite search-and-rescue unit. Troops were helping to locate those missing despite adverse weather conditions, a statement said. Many families were reunited with their children at a hospital near the Dead Sea Details of the victims have not been released although an education ministry official said the students were from a private school, the Jordan Times reported. The official, who was not named, expressed surprise that a school trip had been organised despite weather warnings. Heavy rain has been sweeping the region for several days. Some streets in the Jordanian capital, Amman, have been inundated, leading to traffic jams, while large hailstorms have been reported elsewhere. Thursday's incident is the second tragedy resulting from flash flooding near the Dead Sea this year. In April, nine teenage hikers were swept away and killedin Nahal Tzafit, southern Israel.

"Ron Easton was found after what is thought to be three days on the flat roof of his house A 102-year-old man spent three nights on the roof of his house after falling over and getting stuck. The man, named locally as Ron Easton, was found on Wednesday on his flat roof in Bigbury-on-Sea, Devon. The former racing driver - known as ""Ton-Up Ron"" - was airlifted to hospital where he is in a stable condition. Trish Bagley, who delivers milk and papers to Mr Easton, raised the alarm after finding two unopened bottles.

Trish Bagley found Ron Easton, 102, after what is thought to be three days on the roof of his house A local shopkeeper called a maintenance man who found Mr Easton on the roof of his house. He was brought down by Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service and flown to hospital by Devon Air Ambulance. Derriford Hospital confirmed on Thursday morning that he remains in hospital in a stable condition. This is the roof where Ron Easton was found. Ms Bagley said: ""I had no idea he was there, I just knew something was wrong. ""He always takes his milk in every day so alarm bells rang - Monday and Tuesday's milk was there so he was probably there from Sunday."" The BBC was told Mr Easton may have been adjusting his TV aerial. ""The ladder was on the wrong side of the house so no-one could see it,"" said Ms Bagley.

"Sainsbury's is opening Oasis clothes outlets in its supermarkets, the latest move to diversify the way its store space is used. The mid-market fashion chain will open before Christmas in Sainsbury's in Sydenham, south London, and in its new Selly Oak store in Birmingham. Sainsbury's said it hoped the move would make it a ""fashion destination"". Supermarkets, under pressure to wring more revenues out of their stores, have been expanding what they offer. Sainsbury's said three other Oasis outlets would open in other supermarkets in the spring. The supermarket group has already given over space to Argos, Clarks, Habitat and Specsavers. Rival Tesco hosts concessions from fashion brands Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Burton. Waitrose has partnered with private healthcare provider Bupa to provide in-store medical services and some Morrisons stores host Timpson shoe repair and key cutting outlets. While Sainsbury's already sells clothes under its Tu brand, the supermarket said Oasis would complement its current ranges and ""help to make Sainsbury's a fashion destination"". Sainsbury's, which is in the process of merging with Asda, says clothing currently accounts for Â£1bn of its sales. Hash Ladha, chief executive designate of Oasis, said the arrangement was ""an exciting development"" for the brand, adding the two brands shared a similar customer demographic, making the tie-up ""a natural strategic partnership"". High Street fashion brands have been under pressure this year as consumers tighten belts during difficult economic times. Aurora Fashions, the firm which owns Oasis, also has fashion brands Warehouse and Coast in its stable. Coast went into administration earlier this month. Asian-inspired High Street fashion brand East collapsed at the start of the year and New Look is undergoing a restructuring involving closing 60 stores.

"This video can not be played Debenhams boss Sergio Bucher says the chain wants to have fewer but better stores Debenhams has posted record annual losses and said it will close up to 50 stores, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. In the year to September the department store group lost Â£491.5m, against profits of Â£59m the year before. Debenhams, which has 165 branches, previously said it planned to close 10 stores. Boss Sergio Bucher said the company was ""taking tough decisions"" on stores where financial performance was likely to deteriorate over time. The retailer is not releasing a list of the stores at risk of closure. Debenhams attempts to 'bring joy back' Which shops are opening and closing Why we no longer love department stores Mr Bucher said in a statement,externalthat the additional 40 stores earmarked for closure were ""currently contributing positively"" to the business, but added: ""However, rolling forward current trends, we do not believe they will remain profitable in future years and therefore we intend to exit these stores over the next 3-5 years."" The BBC understands about 4,000 jobs could be affected by the changes, but Debenhams said it hoped there would be a ""minimum"" of compulsory redundancies and that some of the departures would be people who would have left the business anyway. The chain was plunged into loss by exceptional write-downs of Â£512.4m, including reductions in the value of its goodwill, stores and IT systems. Without this, it would have made a pre-tax profit of Â£33m. However, Debenhams has also been buffeted by pressures facing the whole of the UK High Street. Sales in its UK branches fell by 6.3% over the year, amid what it described as a ""volatile"" market background. However, its online business grew by 10%. The popularity of online shopping has coincided with consumers' increasing appetite for ""experiences"" such as beauty treatments, on the High Street. Add to that the rising overheads faced by bricks and mortar retailers and their mounting problems have seldom been out of the headlines this year. Earlier this month, rival department store chain House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. And other retailers, including Marks and Spencer and Mothercare, have announced branch closures. This is a massive loss for such a small business, even though the sea of red ink can be explained by one-off accounting adjustments. Debenhams is still profitable. But it only made Â£33m, despite Â£3bn worth of sales. Its biggest headache right now is property. Big department stores are expensive to run. Debenhams is tied into a lot of lengthy, inflexible leases with upward-only rents. Its business rates bill this year will be nearly three times as much as it made in underlying profits. Meanwhile, Debenhams costs are rising faster than its sales, partly because we're now shopping so much online. One in every Â£5 at Debenhams is spent via the internet. So it is finally grasping the nettle and reshaping its business, hard as it will be for the High Streets and town centres it will eventually leave behind. Twenty-five leases are up for renewal over the next five years, allowing Debenhams to hand back the keys. The question is, will landlords allow Debenhams to call time on several dozen more, as the shake-out in retail continues. Debenhams has been undergoing a revamp aimed at reviving its fortunes, redesigning stores and introducing new ""experiences"" including beauty treatments and prosecco bars. Called Debenhams Redesigned, the firm said the new format stores will deliver a ""sociable, easy and fun"" shopping experience, and it has already modernised nine of its stores. It is planning to implement a similar overhaul in a ""profitable core of up to 100 stores in flagship and vibrant markets"" where it could see a positive return on future investment. These stores account for more than 80% of the chain's profits. There are a further 20 stores which are profitable now, but which are ""not likely to deliver a return on further investment"". Debenhams said it was seeking ""alternative solutions"" for those outlets, depending on where they were. The retailer is also aiming for its online business to account for about 30% of its business, compared with 20% at the moment. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said Debenhams was operating in the part of the market under the most intense amount of pressure. ""Put simply, department stores are incredibly expensive to run,"" he said. ""The combination of too much space, inflexible leases and spiralling operating costs are set against a backdrop an accelerating behavioural shift towards online and experiences. This is eroding their profitability and changes in the business need to occur at a pace if they are to survive."" Hargreaves Lansdown's senior analyst Laith Khalaf said: ""The Debenhams share price has lost four fifths of its value in the last year, and no doubt some will be wondering if we are now near the bottom. ""Despite the dramatic drop, this is still a business in a state of transition, and while the upside could be considerable if Debenhams turns things around, there is still a risk of further losses, particularly given the fragile and dynamic consumer environment.""

"Jamal Khashoggi has not been seen since 2 October Journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder was ""premeditated"", Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has been quoted as saying by Saudi state media. The evidence for this came from a joint Saudi-Turkish task force, broadcaster al-Ekhbariya said. It also reported that prosecutors were questioning suspects as a result of the joint investigation. Saudi Arabia had initially denied all knowledge of the writer's whereabouts when he went missing on 2 October. The kingdom has since admitted he was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, blaming a ""rogue operation"". The official Saudi Press Agency reported that Thursday saw Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman chair the first meeting of a committee to reform the state's intelligence services, which was set up following Mr Khashoggi's death. Saudi Arabia also sacked two key advisers to the prince, and arrested 18 people. All you need to know about Khashoggi's death Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Who was the victim? Prince Mohammed vowed to punish those responsible on Wednesday, but media reports have quoted Turkish security sources as saying the operation was run by a top aide to the crown prince. Saudi Arabia's latest announcement follows US media reports that CIA director Gina Haspel has heard audio recordings believed to capture the journalist's murder. Gina Haspel travelled to Turkey this week Ms Haspel was allowed to listen to the audio during a visit to Turkey earlier this week, reports said. Soon after the murder on 2 October, Turkish media quoted officials as saying they had audio recordings of Khashoggi's interrogation and death, but gave no details about the contents or how the audio had been obtained. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Turkey has played its biggest card yet in the aftermath of the Jamal Khashoggi murder, reportedly passing the recordings from inside the Saudi consulate, said to reveal how the journalist was killed, to CIA director Gina Haspel. She is due to brief President Donald Trump later on Thursday. Lurid details from the recordings have been steadily leaked to the Turkish media - screams, torture, dismemberment of the body: proof, Ankara says, of the meticulously planned operation. That has now been corroborated by the Saudi prosecutor, who says he believes - based on evidence provided by Turkey - that the murder was premeditated. The question remains if it can be directly traced to the highest levels of the Saudi state. And if so, Turkey would expect the US government to harden its line towards Riyadh to hold those who gave the orders accountable. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing There is still no sign of the body. The latest focus appears to be on a well in the garden of the Saudi consulate building. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia? What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? As with much of the investigation there have been conflicting reports. The Anadolu agency initially reported the Saudis had denied permission for it to be searched, only for broadcaster NTV to say later that permission had been given. On Tuesday there were similar conflicting reports over whether Khashoggi's belongings had been found in suitcases in a Saudi diplomatic car. First, Saudi Arabia said Khashoggi had left the building alive, then that he had been killed in a ""fist-fight"" inside the consulate. It then said that Khashoggi had been murdered in a ""rogue operation"" that the leadership had not been aware of. The Saudis say Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had nothing to do with the killing An unnamed Saudi official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of, the official said. Now, the public prosecutor seems to have accepted the Turkish line - that this murder was pre-planned. What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia?

"Ms Switlyk is understood to have shot the goat about a month ago An American TV host who sparked anger after shooting a wild goat on Islay has criticised ""ignorant people"" who sent her death threats on social media. Larysa Switlyk, who presents the Larysa Unleashed programme, posted pictures of herself posing with the dead goat on a hunting trip to the Scottish island. The hunt was legal - but sparked outrage on social media. The thousands of replies sent to Ms Switlyk included some calling for her to be killed. Ms Switlyk is understood to have been in Scotland a month ago, but only posted the pictures of the dead goat on Tuesday. Anger after 'hardcore huntress' shoots goat Previous posts showed her posing next to a dead sheep on Islay, and a dead stag that was shot in Ardnamurchan. In an Instagram and Twitter post on Thursday, she remained unrepentant despite the anger over her hunt - which led the Scottish government to say it was examining whether the law needs to be changed. Ms Switlyk posted a picture of a seaplane alongside a caption saying she was heading off on her ""next hunting adventure"". She said: ""My ride has arrived - I'm headed out on a bush plane for my next hunting adventure and will be out of service for 2 weeks. ""Nothing better than disconnecting from this social media-driven world and connecting back with nature. ""Hopefully that will give enough time for all the ignorant people out there sending me death threats to get educated on hunting and conservation. FYI, I was in Scotland over a month ago...""

Several tourism companies offer the chance to stalk and shoot wild goats in Islay, Dumfries and Galloway and other parts of the UK. The animals, which have no natural predator, are classed as aninvasive, non-native species in the UK,external, and hunting them on private land is not illegal. There are thought to be more than 3,000 of the animals living in herds across the UK. Controversial culls have been carried out in some areas to reduce their numbers, while contraceptive darts have also been used tostop the animals reproducing. In the tweet which sparked the furore, the presenter - who is described on her website as a hardcore huntress - wrote: ""Beautiful wild goat here on the Island of Islay in Scotland. Such a fun hunt!! They live on the edge of the cliffs of the island and know how to hide well. ""Made a perfect 200 yard shot and dropped him (Good thing too because he could have ran off the cliff into the water).""

The Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, told BBC Scotland on Wednesday that the posts were ""horrific"", and called for the hunting of goats on Islay to be stopped immediately. Mr Russell. the MSP for the island, also insisted Ms Switlyk's goat hunting was worse than the hunting of red deer, which he said was ""very firmly regulated"" and ""you don't see people glorifying in it very often."" About30,000 deer are shot every year on public land on Scotland,external- the vast majority by wildlife rangers and contractors and about 3,500 by ""recreational stalkers"" - with many more being shot on private estates.

"Princess Angelika Latufuipeka (right) greets Harry and Meghan as they arrive in Tonga The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have received a royal welcome on arrival in the South Pacific nation of Tonga. They were greeted by a Tongan princess when they landed as well as hundreds of children - who were given the day off school to cheer the couple's arrival. A meeting with Tonga's king and queen was followed by traditional dancing and singing at an evening party. Meghan opted for the colours of the Tongan flag as she arrived wearing a red dress, before changing into white. Some observers were quick to spot that she had forgotten to remove the label of her red dress. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's first tour Forgotten war hero honoured by royals Oops - Meghan's label is still attached The couple receive a traditional Tongan welcome Schoolchildren lined the streets from the airport to the capital of Nuku'alofa, waving flags and cheering as the royal convoy made the 40-minute journey. Prince Harry and Meghan attended a private audience with King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau'u at Consular House before an evening reception and dinner. As the royal couple entered the event they were serenaded by a band playing John Lennon's Imagine. The duchess changes into her third outfit of the day for the state dinner In a speech, the duke said that going to Tonga was like visiting ""an extended family"". He said: ""My grandparents have visited a number of times and Your Majesties have been frequent visitors to see my family over the years."" He also read a message from his grandmother, the Queen, which spoke of the ""close relationship"" between the royal families. The prince signed off his speech with ""malo 'aupito"", Tongan for ""thank you very much"". Tonga is the latest stop on the whirlwind tour for the couple, who have already visited Australia, where Harry opened the Invictus Games, and Fiji. The parents-to-be will return to Australia on Friday before finishing their 16-day tour in New Zealand.

"This video can not be played A specialist ""total containment vehicle"" removes a suspect package sent to Robert De Niro A suspect package similar to those sent to senior public figures has been sent to a New York restaurant owned by the actor Robert De Niro, the FBI has said. The device was found at the Tribeca Grill in Manhattan early on Thursday local time, said the city's mayor. Former Vice-President Joe Biden has also received two suspect packages. The latest incident marks the eighth critic of President Donald Trump to receive such a package this week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

De Niro - the star of films Raging Bull and Meet the Parents - is a vocal Trump opponent. What we know about US mail bomb threats In the past he has called him ""a national disaster"", ""a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about"" and said that he wanted to ""punch him in the face"". When the Oscar-winner attacked him at the Tony Awards in June,the president responded by calling De Niro a ""very low IQ individual"".

According to the Associated Press, the security guard was off work on Thursday and had seen an image in a news report of the packages others had received. That individual then recalled spotting something similar in the building's mailroom and immediately called authorities who removed the device around 06:30 local time (11:30GMT), AP reports. Police outside the Tribeca Grill in New York City ""We have to be ready for any eventuality,"" Mr de Blasio said. ""It might be hours, it might be days, it might be weeks."" Shortly after the news about De Niro's restaurant broke, President Trump appeared to pin the blame on the media, tweeting: ""A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News.""

Other devices were sent to the following individuals, according to the FBI: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former Vice-President Joe Biden Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning, after the package addressed to Mr Brennan was found in its mailroom. Two devices were sent to separate offices for Congresswoman Waters.

""No-one should carelessly compare political opponents to historic villains, which is done often.""

Last week, he said Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Hillary Clinton and former Attorney General Eric Holder - who were all targeted with suspicious packages - ""are losing it"", and that ""they've gone so far left that they can't even believe that they're over there"". During his campaign Mr Trump promised topay the legal bills of anyone who assaults a protester,externaland vowed to jail his opponent Hillary Clinton after the election. CNN's President Jeff Zucker on Wednesday condemned the ""total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks"". He added that Mr Trump ""should understand their words matter"". But conservatives say Democrats are to blame for the state of political discourse in the US. They say Democrats, including those who were targeted in the bomb scare, have encouraged ""angry mob"" behaviour. Republican Congressman Steve Scalise, who nearly died after he was shot in 2017 by a deranged supporter of progressive Senator Bernie Sanders during a morning softball practice, wrote in Fox News on Thursday of the ""growing list of violent or threatening actions taken against conservatives by Democrats"". ""The threats and the violence have not let up and instead of seeing my Democrat colleagues calling for an end, there have been calls for their supporters to keep going, to do even more to threaten Republicans,"" he wrote. This video can not be played Pence: 'Those responsible will be brought to justice' He cited multiple examples of Republicans being ""chased out of restaurants"" and of Republican lawmakers who have received death threats against themselves and their families. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders praised Mr Trump's reaction to the bomb scares on Fox News, saying: ""The President, I think could not have been more presidential."" She added that ""certainly the media has a role to play in this process"" adding that ""90% of the coverage of this president is negative despite the historic successes"". ""That is not helpful to the American discourse,"" she added. Some of Mr Trump's supporters have said they believe the packages are part of a Democratic plot to win votes in the mid-terms, but there is no evidence for this. A Republican outside the Florida governor debates on Wednesday holds a sign accusing Democrats of ""fake bombs"" Why Trump attacks the media An FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force ""will continue to work to identify and arrest whosoever is responsible for sending these packages,"" the agency's director Christopher Wray said in a statement.

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid has apologised to people who were wrongly forced to take DNA tests to prove they were entitled to settle in the UK. A Home Office review,externalfound there were at least 449 cases where letters had been sent with the demand. Mr Javid told the House of Commons that some relatives of Gurkhas and Afghan nationals employed by the UK government were among those affected. It was ""unacceptable"" and guidance was ""unclear or wrong"", he said. The Home Office launched an internal review four months ago after admitting officials wrongly forced immigrants to take DNA tests. ""I want to take this opportunity to apologise to those affected by this practice,"" Mr Javid told MPs. ""The provision of DNA evidence should always be voluntary and never mandatory."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The Home Office's internal review of the wrongful DNA demands says the rules were ""not clearly understood"" - not least because immigration officials are drowning in documents. There are 40,000 documents in seven IT systems - so it's perhaps no surprise that case workers received advice which was unclear or seemingly contradicted the law. Given Sajid Javid has only been in post since April, it raises questions for Amber Rudd, who resigned over misleading MPs over illegal immigrant targets, and her predecessor, the prime minister. Theresa May presided over the Home Office for six years and back in 2012 said she wanted to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigration. It's that broader policy objective - which critics say leads to applicants being regarded as suspects -  that is under fire yet again. When Mr Javid committed to cleaning up the injustices done to the Windrush generation, he underlined that ""hostile environment""was not a phrase he would use,external. The question is whether a massive post-Brexit reform to the immigration system will convince the Home Office's critics that it can treat all people fairly and equally before the law. Mandatory DNA testing was included as a requirement for a 2013 scheme for Afghan nationals formerly employed by the UK government. This has now been removed, Mr Javid said. In January 2015, similar guidance on DNA testing was included in a scheme for adult dependent children of Gurkhas, who are Nepalese and have been part of the Army for more than 200 years. Mr Javid said this guidance was wrong. The Home Office report said DNA evidence was requested in 398 cases as part of a 2016 operation investigating fraud, of which 83 applications were refused. Seven of those cases were refused solely for not providing DNA evidence. In a further 51 cases, DNA was requested from relatives of Gurkhas. ""I am determined to get to the bottom of how and why, in some cases, people were compelled to provide DNA in the first place,"" he told MPs. ""Across our immigration system, no-one should face a demand to supply DNA evidence and no-one should have been penalised for not providing it."" No preference for EU migrants, cabinet agrees Call to scrap high-skilled migrants cap Mr Javid said those affected would be reimbursed and he announced he had set up a task force and a review of the immigration system to be informed by Wendy Williams, who investigated the Windrush scandal. Enny Choudhury, solicitor at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said a mother and daughter she represented were ""rendered destitute"" for two and a half years as a result. ""It is clear that countless others will have been subject to the same treatment and it is astonishing that ministers still do not have a grasp on the failings of the Home Office,"" she said. Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty UK's Refugee and Migrant Rights Programme Director, said the problems with the Home Office were ""systemic, chronic and deep-rooted"" and in need of urgent reform.

"The gender pay gap has fallen to its lowest level yet, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported. In the year to April 2018, the gap for full-time workers was 8.6% - down from 9.1% in the previous year. In other words, the average female employee now earns 8.6% less than the average man. However, campaigners said the rate of improvement was too slow and was a missed opportunity for the economy. The extent of the pay gap varies according to age, with older female workers much more likely to be underpaid in comparison. The ONS said the pay gap for those under the age of 39 was now insignificant and was narrowing ""markedly"" for those between the ages of 40 and 49. MPs: BBC 'fails' on equal pay Six things we've learnt about the gender pay gap However, pressure groups said the change was happening far too gradually. ""This is a practically static picture on pay inequality,"" said Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns on gender rights. ""This slow rate of progress means without significant action, women starting work today and in decades to come will spend their entire working lives earning less than men."" The TUC said that the current rate of progress meant that it would take another 55 years for men and women to achieve pay parity. In the 22-29 age group, women earn just 1.3% less than men. However, in the 50-59 year-old group, women earn as much as 15.5% less than men. ""Millennials appear to be leading the charge, with younger men and women edging towards pay parity,"" said Laura Suter, personal finance specialist at AJ Bell. ""We now need to see this cohort of women encouraged to progress through to senior management roles. Focus should also turn to addressing the larger pay gaps that persist for older employees."" The ONS figures also show that the average full-time employee in the UK enjoyed a 3.5% pay increase in the year to April, the biggest rise since 2008. Median gross weekly earnings reached Â£569, up from Â£550 in 2017. However, when inflation is taken into account, the rise was only 1.2% on the previous year. Those in ""continuous"" employment did better than the average, as did those in lower-paid occupations. Pay growth at fastest for ten years ""Average weekly pay for full-time employees is now increasing at its fastest since the financial crisis, in cash terms, with hourly pay rising fastest among lower-paid occupations,"" said the ONS's Roger Smith. ""However, after taking account of inflation, earnings are still only where they were in 2011 and have not yet returned to pre-downturn levels.""

"This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Sir Philip Green, once known as the 'King of the High Street' is facing his biggest challenge yet. His Arcadia retail empire is teetering on the brink of collapse, the latest saga in a colourful career that once saw him branded as the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". The retail tycoon's life story to date is rich in character and anecdote, from his failed attempts to take over M&S, to a lavish lifestyle that has attracted accusations of tax avoidance. But questions now swirl over the fate of his empire, and its 13,000 employees. Despite being born into a well-to-do family in south London, Sir Philip prided himself on having worked his way to the top. His competitive streak was apparent from an early age, noticed by school mates at Carmel College, his exclusive boarding school, nicknamed the ""Jewish Eton"". School friend Tony Rauch recalls Sir Philip making a beeline for the table-tennis table at break time and losing a tussle with another boy who had been trying to get the best bat. ""He got very angry; cried a little bit,"" Mr Rauch told BBC Radio 4'sProfileprogramme in 2012. ""He wasn't physically hurt, I think he was just very angry at having lost."" Sir Philip left school aged 15 and began working on the forecourt of the petrol station that his mother managed. He then went on to learn business basics as an apprentice in a shoe warehouse. At 23 years old, he set up his own business importing and selling jeans. Staff leaving the BHS headquarters after being told the company would go into administration Stuart Lansley, the author of an unauthorised biography of Sir Philip, described those early days for Radio 4. ""He had a very mixed track record of starting up companies, and closing them down, working with other people, falling out with people,"" said Mr Lansley. ""He travelled a lot, learning a lot about the supply chain, who the cheaper suppliers were and so on - but he certainly wasn't a household name."" It was BHS, known then as British Home Stores, that marked the moment Sir Philip Green finally ""arrived"" in 2000. He paid Â£200m for what was already a slightly faded, dowdy chain. ""He borrowed very large sums of money, invested a little bit himself, and bought up companies that were relatively cheap, because they weren't doing very well. He turned them around, paying off his debt, and then tripling - quadrupling - the money he put in, in a matter of a couple of years,"" Mr Lansley said. Two years later, he copied that model when he bought the giant retail empire Arcadia, which owns brands such as Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, and of course, Topshop and Topman. Sir Philip Green's most ambitious move came in 2004, when he put together Â£10bn, much of it from investment banks, to make an offer for Marks and Spencer. Even Sir Stuart Rose - then his rival and at the helm of Marks at the time - was impressed. ""Philip is not only a first-class retailer, he is absolutely pre-eminent in his generation in terms of his financial nous and ability,"" Sir Stuart toldProfile. ""If I wanted to be slightly uncharitable, I could say that he came to the market to raise a very, very large sum of money at a time when money was cheap and freely available - but only Philip could have put that together."" As chairman of Marks and Spencer, Sir Stuart Rose (L) faced two takeover bids from Sir Philip Green (R) Sir Stuart Rose also has first-hand experience of his reportedly very short fuse. Sir Philip reportedly grabbed the then M&S boss by the lapels during his second unsuccessful takeover bid in 2004. ""There was a fairly physical occasion one morning, yes. I think tension had got quite high during the bid and Philip got upset about something,"" said Sir Stuart. ""He wasn't above ringing me up during the height of the bid and singing 'if I were a rich man' down the telephone to me, trying to point out the error of my ways [for not selling]... that I would make more money. ""He used to say, 'The only jet you know is Easyjet.'"" Sir Philip is not shy about enjoying the trappings of his success. He commutes into London from Monaco in a private jet, has a super-yacht called Lionheart, and has been known for throwing extravagant parties for friends and family in exotic places, with entertainment from the likes of Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez. What has attracted the most controversy though is not the lavish lifestyle, but his tax affairs. In 2005, his company paid a Â£1.2bn dividend to the owner of Arcadia - Sir Philip's wife, Cristina. Since she is a resident of Monaco, she paid no tax in the UK. In 2010,activists demonstrated outside the flagship Topshop and BHS storesin central London after Sir Philip was chosen by then Prime Minister David Cameron to conduct agovernment efficiency review. They thought his tax arrangements made him the wrong choice. Despite their anger, however, Arcadia has paid significant sums in corporation tax. Activists targeted BHS, Topshop and Topman in 2010 But some of Arcadia's glamour has waned in recent years. Critics say that Sir Philip, reportedly averse to electronic gadgets, has not embraced online shopping as aggressively as competitors such as Asos or Boohoo. While sales remained steady through the group, BHS was seen as the weakest link, and was sold for Â£1. Questions were asked following the sale over just how much money Sir Philip had taken out of the company in the years before. At the time, Angela Eagle, the former shadow business secretary, said: ""In this situation, it appears this owner extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from the business and walked away to his favourite tax haven, leaving the Pension Protection Scheme to pick up the bill."" BHS went bust in April 2016, leaving a Â£571m pensions deficit. Sir Philipagreed a Â£363m cash settlementwith the Pensions Regulator in 2017 to plug the gap in the BHS pension scheme.

"The nasal spray vaccine to protect children against flu contains porcine gelatine The use of pork gelatine in three vaccines used by the NHS has been branded ""disappointing"" by the Vegetarian Society. Chief executive Lynne Elliot added that the use of animal ingredients in medicines is ""upsetting"". Porcine gelatine is derived from pigs and used in vaccines against flu, shingles, measles, mumps and rubella. Public Health England said thegelatine is used as a stabiliser,externaland developing an alternative ""may never happen"". The government agency said the gelatine is ""highly purified"" and manufactured under ""strict hygiene and safety regulations"". A spokeswoman for Public Heath England said the gelatine helps to keep the vaccine viruses stable ""to provide the best protection against flu"". Ms Elliot said there should be ""vegetarian and vegan versions of all medicines and vaccines"". Public Health England said the injectable flu vaccine does not contain gelatine but is ""less effective"" The three vaccines which contain porcine gelatine are: Fluenz Tetra - a nasal spray vaccine which protects children against flu MMR VaxPro - a jab which protects against measles, mumps and rubella Zostavax - an injection to protect adults against shingles All three are used across the UK as part of the national immunisation programme. Zostavax and Fluenz Tetra were first introduced on the NHS in 2013, while MMR VaxPro was first used in 2008. A parent who contacted the BBC said he was ""offended"" by the use of porcine gelatine in the nasal flu vaccine. He explained his wife was told about the ingredient by a doctor when she took their children to be vaccinated. She refused the vaccine because of their religion. One parent told the BBC he was ""offended"" by the use of gelatine in the nasal flu vaccine The Muslim Council of Britain said the vaccines are not permitted in Islam unless lives are at risk and there are no alternatives. Dr Shuja Shafi, the chairman of the council's research and documentation committee, said: ""There should be more work towards an alternative. ""We should be trying to find a long-term solution. The needs of the people must be met."" Dr Shafi advised anyone concerned about the use of gelatine in vaccines to consult a medical practitioner and make an ""informed decision"". Mark Frazer, from the Office of the Chief Rabbi, said vaccines containing porcine gelatine are not an issue for the Jewish community because they are not ingested. A spokeswoman from Public Health England said the nasal flu vaccination is not mandatory and the decision is ""one for parents alone"". ""We recognise that there is still some uncertainty among some groups about the acceptability of the nasal spray. ""We will continue to monitor these concerns and consider them carefully."" Public Health England said there are injectable flu vaccines that do not contain pork gelatine, but these are slightly ""less effective"" than the nasal vaccine because they may require two doses and do less to reduce the spread of flu. Therefore they should only be offered as an alternative for children and adults ""who are at high risk of the complications of flu"" and who refuse the recommended first choice vaccine. A gelatine-free vaccine is available for measles, mumps and rubella but there is no such alternative for the shingles vaccine Zostavax.

"Facebook's chief executive has repeatedly declined to answer questions from UK MPs about the scandal Facebook has been fined Â£500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdog for its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said Facebook had let a ""serious breach"" of the law take place. The fine is the maximum allowed under the old data protection rules that applied beforeGDPRtook effect in May. The ICO said Facebook had given app developers access to people's data ""without clear consent"". In July, the ICO notified the social network that it intended to issue the maximum fine. Confirming the fine, it said in a statement: ""Between 2007 and 2014, Facebook processed the personal information of users unfairly by allowing application developers access to their information without sufficiently clear and informed consent, and allowing access even if users had not downloaded the app, but were simply 'friends' with people who had."" This video can not be played JULY 2018: Ms Denham warns Facebook ""Facebook also failed to keep the personal information secure because it failed to make suitable checks on apps and developers using its platform."" Facebook said it was ""reviewing"" the ICO's decision. ""While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015,"" it said in a statement. Researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company GSR used a personality quiz to harvest the Facebook data of up to 87 million people. Some of this data was shared with Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target political advertising in the US. ""Even after the misuse of the data was discovered in December 2015, Facebook did not do enough to ensure those who continued to hold it had taken adequate and timely remedial action, including deletion,"" the ICO said. The ICO found that more than one million people in the UK had their data harvested by the personality quiz. ""A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better,"" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. The ICO is still investigating how data analytics is used for political purposes. Ms Denham is due to give evidence to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee on 6 November.

"Princess Angelika Latufuipeka (right) greets Harry and Meghan as they arrive in Tonga The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have received a royal welcome on arrival in the South Pacific nation of Tonga. They were greeted by a Tongan princess when they landed as well as hundreds of children - who were given the day off school to cheer the couple's arrival. A meeting with Tonga's king and queen was followed by traditional dancing and singing at an evening party. Meghan opted for the colours of the Tongan flag as she arrived wearing a red dress, before changing into white. Some observers were quick to spot that she had forgotten to remove the label of her red dress. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's first tour Forgotten war hero honoured by royals Oops - Meghan's label is still attached The couple receive a traditional Tongan welcome Schoolchildren lined the streets from the airport to the capital of Nuku'alofa, waving flags and cheering as the royal convoy made the 40-minute journey. Prince Harry and Meghan attended a private audience with King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau'u at Consular House before an evening reception and dinner. As the royal couple entered the event they were serenaded by a band playing John Lennon's Imagine. The duchess changes into her third outfit of the day for the state dinner In a speech, the duke said that going to Tonga was like visiting ""an extended family"". He said: ""My grandparents have visited a number of times and Your Majesties have been frequent visitors to see my family over the years."" He also read a message from his grandmother, the Queen, which spoke of the ""close relationship"" between the royal families. The prince signed off his speech with ""malo 'aupito"", Tongan for ""thank you very much"". Tonga is the latest stop on the whirlwind tour for the couple, who have already visited Australia, where Harry opened the Invictus Games, and Fiji. The parents-to-be will return to Australia on Friday before finishing their 16-day tour in New Zealand.

"Sainsbury's is opening Oasis clothes outlets in its supermarkets, the latest move to diversify the way its store space is used. The mid-market fashion chain will open before Christmas in Sainsbury's in Sydenham, south London, and in its new Selly Oak store in Birmingham. Sainsbury's said it hoped the move would make it a ""fashion destination"". Supermarkets, under pressure to wring more revenues out of their stores, have been expanding what they offer. Sainsbury's said three other Oasis outlets would open in other supermarkets in the spring. The supermarket group has already given over space to Argos, Clarks, Habitat and Specsavers. Rival Tesco hosts concessions from fashion brands Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Burton. Waitrose has partnered with private healthcare provider Bupa to provide in-store medical services and some Morrisons stores host Timpson shoe repair and key cutting outlets. While Sainsbury's already sells clothes under its Tu brand, the supermarket said Oasis would complement its current ranges and ""help to make Sainsbury's a fashion destination"". Sainsbury's, which is in the process of merging with Asda, says clothing currently accounts for Â£1bn of its sales. Hash Ladha, chief executive designate of Oasis, said the arrangement was ""an exciting development"" for the brand, adding the two brands shared a similar customer demographic, making the tie-up ""a natural strategic partnership"". High Street fashion brands have been under pressure this year as consumers tighten belts during difficult economic times. Aurora Fashions, the firm which owns Oasis, also has fashion brands Warehouse and Coast in its stable. Coast went into administration earlier this month. Asian-inspired High Street fashion brand East collapsed at the start of the year and New Look is undergoing a restructuring involving closing 60 stores.

"The gender pay gap has fallen to its lowest level yet, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported. In the year to April 2018, the gap for full-time workers was 8.6% - down from 9.1% in the previous year. In other words, the average female employee now earns 8.6% less than the average man. However, campaigners said the rate of improvement was too slow and was a missed opportunity for the economy. The extent of the pay gap varies according to age, with older female workers much more likely to be underpaid in comparison. The ONS said the pay gap for those under the age of 39 was now insignificant and was narrowing ""markedly"" for those between the ages of 40 and 49. MPs: BBC 'fails' on equal pay Six things we've learnt about the gender pay gap However, pressure groups said the change was happening far too gradually. ""This is a practically static picture on pay inequality,"" said Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns on gender rights. ""This slow rate of progress means without significant action, women starting work today and in decades to come will spend their entire working lives earning less than men."" The TUC said that the current rate of progress meant that it would take another 55 years for men and women to achieve pay parity. In the 22-29 age group, women earn just 1.3% less than men. However, in the 50-59 year-old group, women earn as much as 15.5% less than men. ""Millennials appear to be leading the charge, with younger men and women edging towards pay parity,"" said Laura Suter, personal finance specialist at AJ Bell. ""We now need to see this cohort of women encouraged to progress through to senior management roles. Focus should also turn to addressing the larger pay gaps that persist for older employees."" The ONS figures also show that the average full-time employee in the UK enjoyed a 3.5% pay increase in the year to April, the biggest rise since 2008. Median gross weekly earnings reached Â£569, up from Â£550 in 2017. However, when inflation is taken into account, the rise was only 1.2% on the previous year. Those in ""continuous"" employment did better than the average, as did those in lower-paid occupations. Pay growth at fastest for ten years ""Average weekly pay for full-time employees is now increasing at its fastest since the financial crisis, in cash terms, with hourly pay rising fastest among lower-paid occupations,"" said the ONS's Roger Smith. ""However, after taking account of inflation, earnings are still only where they were in 2011 and have not yet returned to pre-downturn levels.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Stop endless hostility"" President Donald Trump has called on the media ""to stop the endless hostility"", after suspected explosives were posted to high-profile US figures. He was speaking after parcels were sent to CNN and top Democrats, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. None of the packages exploded. The FBI has launched a hunt for their sender. The president's critics called his comments hypocritical, as he often uses vicious language against his opponents and the press. Trump Jr letter: 'You get what you deserve' Trump ends ex-CIA head's security access Explosive device found in Soros post box In scripted remarks at a Wednesday night rally in Wisconsin, the president vowed to catch the perpetrator, while calling on the media to end ""constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories"". Mr Trump also called for more civility in public life, saying: ""Those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective. ""No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historic villains, which is done often."" However, the president made no specific reference to the intended recipients of the packages. Earlier CNN worldwide president Jeff Zucker criticised President Trump and the White House press secretary for not understanding that ""words matter"". ""There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,"" he said. Suspected bombs were sent to locations in New York, the Washington DC area and Florida, authorities said on Wednesday. Explosive devices were sent to the following individuals, according to the latest FBI statement: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters Liberal philanthropist and financier George Soros (on Monday) CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after the package, addressed to Mr Brennan, was found in its mailroom. The Time Warner building in New York City was evacuated on Wednesday morning Another package, believed to have been addressed to former Vice-President Joe Biden, is being sought by US federal investigators. All the apparent targets are regularly criticised by conservatives - especially by President Trump. Why Trump attacks the media Some Democrats have accused the president of inciting violence with his past rhetoric, which includes deriding media reports as ""fake news"" and calling his media critics ""enemies of the people"".

Some of Mr Trump's supporters have said they believe the packages sent this week are part of a Democratic plot to win votes in the mid-term elections. There is no evidence for this, and the police have not released any information about any suspects. US media attack Trump's 'dirty war' The attempted attacks come just under two weeks before the mid-terms, with US politics highly polarised. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attempted attacks ""an act of terror"". He told a news conference: ""To all public officials, to all partisan affiliations - don't encourage violence, don't encourage hatred, don't encourage attacks on media. You can disagree, but you have to show respect."" Bomb squad trucks seen outside the Time Warner building in New York City On Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders condemned the ""attempted violent attacks"" against the public figures. She specified in a follow-up tweet that the White House also condemned threats made to CNN. The president's verbal assaults on the media have repeatedly raised concern, including from UN expertswho said they undermine press freedom and raise the risk of violence against journalists. Last weekhe praised a Republican congressmanwho had assaulted a reporter with a ""body slam"". This video can not be played New York Governor Andrew Cuomo: ""What is not good is overheated rhetoric and extremism that pushes people to violence."" In a joint statement, top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said the president's latest words ""ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence"". The FBI has said its ongoing investigation is ""of the highest priority"". The devices are suspected to be pipe bombs. None of them exploded. The ones addressed to Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton were intercepted by security services before they were delivered. They were all sent in manila envelopes with bubble wrap, addressed with computer-printed labels. Each listed Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the sender, although her name was misspelt. In a statement, the Florida congresswoman said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the way her name was used. Ms Wasserman Schultz's name was spelt incorrectly on the packages The package addressed to Mr Brennan was sent to CNN as he was scheduled to appear on the network on Wednesday, US media report. New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill also said law enforcement is analysing an ""envelope containing white powder"" that was found in the packaging of that device sent to CNN. Additional police were seen outside the Washington DC home of Mr Obama Speaking at a campaign event in Florida, Mrs Clinton thanked the Secret Service and said she and her family ""are fine"". ""It is a troubling time,"" she said. ""It is a time of deep divisions and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together. We also have to elect candidates who will try to do the same."" A spokeswoman for Mr Obama declined to comment on the incident, and referred reporters to the Secret Service statement.

"Councils across the UK are buying vital home help for elderly people on the cheap, the firms providing care say. Thousands of vulnerable older people rely on councils to organise support for them for daily tasks such as washing, dressing and feeding. But research by the UK Homecare Association found only one in seven was paying a fair price for care. It said this meant visits were being cut short, but councils said they had insufficient money to pay more. Doreen Foreman is 88 and lives in the north-east of England. Carers come in four times a day for 30 minutes each. She relies on her carers for virtually everything. She has limited mobility so needs them to help her go to the toilet and to fetch her meals. She says she loves to chat with her carers because it makes her happy, but adds there is not always enough time. ""They say they only have half an hour. We manage in that time, but I would like more."" Karley Craig, one of Doreen's carers, sympathises with her. She says she would like more time, but as they need to deal with Doreen's medication and food and move her with a hoist, there is little time for anything else because Karley then has to go on to her next client. Karley says caring is something she ""always wanted to do"", but says the pay is not enough for the level of responsibility she has. ""We are doing what district nurses do,"" she adds. More than 850,000 people are given support in their own home. About 80% of this is organised by councils, which normally outsource the work to care agencies. The UKHCA, the umbrella group for care firms, asked more than 200 councils and care trusts for information about how much they paid for care. The average fee was Â£16.12 an hour, although in some places it was below Â£13. The UKHCA said the minimum price was Â£18.01, once factoring in the cost of running the services and the wages for the care worker was considered. Regionally in England, councils in the north-west and north-east had the lowest rates, while nationally in the UK, Northern Ireland paid the least. UKHCA policy and campaigns director Colin Angel accused councils of buying care ""on the cheap"". He said it was forcing a number of providers to hand back contracts or refuse to take them on as the prices did not cover ""adequate wages and the costs of running safe and effective services"".

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Stop endless hostility"" President Donald Trump has called on the media ""to stop the endless hostility"", after suspected explosives were posted to high-profile US figures. He was speaking after parcels were sent to CNN and top Democrats, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. None of the packages exploded. The FBI has launched a hunt for their sender. The president's critics called his comments hypocritical, as he often uses vicious language against his opponents and the press. Trump Jr letter: 'You get what you deserve' Trump ends ex-CIA head's security access Explosive device found in Soros post box In scripted remarks at a Wednesday night rally in Wisconsin, the president vowed to catch the perpetrator, while calling on the media to end ""constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories"". Mr Trump also called for more civility in public life, saying: ""Those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective. ""No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historic villains, which is done often."" However, the president made no specific reference to the intended recipients of the packages. Earlier CNN worldwide president Jeff Zucker criticised President Trump and the White House press secretary for not understanding that ""words matter"". ""There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,"" he said. Suspected bombs were sent to locations in New York, the Washington DC area and Florida, authorities said on Wednesday. Explosive devices were sent to the following individuals, according to the latest FBI statement: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters Liberal philanthropist and financier George Soros (on Monday) CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after the package, addressed to Mr Brennan, was found in its mailroom. The Time Warner building in New York City was evacuated on Wednesday morning Another package, believed to have been addressed to former Vice-President Joe Biden, is being sought by US federal investigators. All the apparent targets are regularly criticised by conservatives - especially by President Trump. Why Trump attacks the media Some Democrats have accused the president of inciting violence with his past rhetoric, which includes deriding media reports as ""fake news"" and calling his media critics ""enemies of the people"".

There is no evidence for this, and the police have not released any information about any suspects. US media attack Trump's 'dirty war' The attempted attacks come just under two weeks before the mid-terms, with US politics highly polarised. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attempted attacks ""an act of terror"".

You can disagree, but you have to show respect."" Bomb squad trucks seen outside the Time Warner building in New York City On Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders condemned the ""attempted violent attacks"" against the public figures. She specified in a follow-up tweet that the White House also condemned threats made to CNN.

The ones addressed to Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton were intercepted by security services before they were delivered. They were all sent in manila envelopes with bubble wrap, addressed with computer-printed labels. Each listed Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the sender, although her name was misspelt. In a statement, the Florida congresswoman said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the way her name was used. Ms Wasserman Schultz's name was spelt incorrectly on the packages The package addressed to Mr Brennan was sent to CNN as he was scheduled to appear on the network on Wednesday, US media report. New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill also said law enforcement is analysing an ""envelope containing white powder"" that was found in the packaging of that device sent to CNN. Additional police were seen outside the Washington DC home of Mr Obama Speaking at a campaign event in Florida, Mrs Clinton thanked the Secret Service and said she and her family ""are fine"".

"Gina Haspel travelled to Turkey this week CIA director Gina Haspel has briefed President Donald Trump on her visit to Turkey this week over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. No details of the briefing have been released. However, it comes hours after media reports said that during the visit Ms Haspel had heard audio recordings that Turkey claims capture the murder. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor was quoted as saying Khashoggi's murder was ""premeditated"". The US-based Saudi government critic died in the consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia initially denied all knowledge of the writer's whereabouts when he went missing on 2 October, but later admitted he was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, blaming ""rogue agents"". All you need to know about Khashoggi's death Who was the victim? The official Saudi Press Agency reported that on Thursday Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman chaired the first meeting of a committee to reform the state's intelligence services, which was set up following Mr Khashoggi's death. Last week Saudi Arabia sacked two key advisers to the prince, and arrested 18 people. Meanwhile, Khashoggi's eldest son Salah arrived in the US on Thursday. A US spokesman said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had told Saudi leaders that he wanted Mr Khashoggi, a dual citizen, to be able to return to the US and was ""pleased"" that he had been allowed to do so. Mr Khashoggi, who was filmed on Tuesday shaking hands with the crown prince, had previously been unable to leave Saudi Arabia because of a travel ban imposed following his father's criticism of the kingdom's leadership. The CIA director travelled to Turkey on Monday to review intelligence about the incident. The US State Department said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended Thursday's briefing at the White House with Ms Haspel, but gave no further information. Khashoggi was last seen alive entering the Saudi consulate nearly three weeks ago On Wednesday Turkey's Sabah newspaper said she had listened to audio recordings of Khashoggi's interrogation and death, but gave no details about the contents or how the audio had been obtained. Sources quoted by the Washington Post and Reuters news agency later backed up the reports. A person ""familiar with the audio"" told the Washington Post that it was ""compelling"". Saudi Arabia has denied Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had a role in the killing On Wednesday Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is regarded as the country's de facto ruler, vowed to punish those responsible for the murder. However, media reports have quoted Turkish security sources as saying the operation was run by a top aide to Prince Mohammed. The crown prince was speaking at a business forum in Riyadh, dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"", which has been boycotted by a number of political and corporate leaders. Turkey's Anadolu news agency said on Thursday that 38 members of staff at the Istanbul consulate had been questioned as witnesses. There is still no sign of the body. The latest focus appears to be on a well in the garden of the Saudi consulate building. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia? What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? As with much of the investigation there have been conflicting reports. The Anadolu agency initially reported the Saudis had denied permission for it to be searched, only for broadcaster NTV to say later that permission had been given. On Tuesday there were similar conflicting reports over whether Khashoggi's belongings had been found in suitcases in a Saudi diplomatic car. This week Turkish President Erdogan said Turkey had strong evidence the journalist was killed in a premeditated and ""savage"" murder and has called for the suspects to be tried in Istanbul. The case has strained Saudi Arabia's relations with the US and other allies. On Tuesday the US president voiced his strongest criticism of the Saudi government to date and suggested the crown prince must have known what was going on. This video can not be played The US President criticises Saudi Arabia's handling of Jamal Khashoggi's death He told the Wall Street Journal: ""Well, the prince [Mohammed bin Salman] is running things over there more so at this stage. He's running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him."" Earlier he said: ""They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups."" The US will revoke the visas of those believed responsible for Khashoggi's killing - Saudi Arabia says 18 Saudi nationals have been detained. First, Saudi Arabia said Khashoggi had left the building alive, then that he had been killed in a ""fist-fight"" inside the consulate. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing It finally said that Khashoggi had been murdered in a ""rogue operation"" that the leadership had not been aware of. An unnamed Saudi official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of, the official said. How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia?

"Facebook's chief executive has repeatedly declined to answer questions from UK MPs about the scandal Facebook has been fined Â£500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdog for its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said Facebook had let a ""serious breach"" of the law take place. The fine is the maximum allowed under the old data protection rules that applied beforeGDPRtook effect in May. The ICO said Facebook had given app developers access to people's data ""without clear consent"". In July, the ICO notified the social network that it intended to issue the maximum fine. Confirming the fine, it said in a statement: ""Between 2007 and 2014, Facebook processed the personal information of users unfairly by allowing application developers access to their information without sufficiently clear and informed consent, and allowing access even if users had not downloaded the app, but were simply 'friends' with people who had."" This video can not be played JULY 2018: Ms Denham warns Facebook ""Facebook also failed to keep the personal information secure because it failed to make suitable checks on apps and developers using its platform."" Facebook said it was ""reviewing"" the ICO's decision. ""While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015,"" it said in a statement. Researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company GSR used a personality quiz to harvest the Facebook data of up to 87 million people. Some of this data was shared with Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target political advertising in the US. ""Even after the misuse of the data was discovered in December 2015, Facebook did not do enough to ensure those who continued to hold it had taken adequate and timely remedial action, including deletion,"" the ICO said. The ICO found that more than one million people in the UK had their data harvested by the personality quiz. ""A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better,"" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. The ICO is still investigating how data analytics is used for political purposes. Ms Denham is due to give evidence to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee on 6 November.

"This video can not be played Fox v MSNBC: How the news divides America When President Donald Trump first called the media ""enemy of the people"" last year, it elicited outrage. Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake said it was an example of an ""unprecedented"" and ""unwarranted"" White House assault on the free press. The second, third and fourth times Mr Trump used the phrase, it barely merited a shrug. Such is the unique talent of this president - an ability to take an action or opinion that once seemed outrageous and turn it into a new kind of normal. Even if the line doesn't generate headlines anymore, however, journalists still take note. And whena newsroom in Maryland was sprayed with bullets just a few weeks ago, the perils of the profession - even in an established Western democracy, and with or without the president's instigation - were put in stark relief. New York Times publisher AG Sulzberger clearly wanted to drive this point home in his previously secret meeting with Mr Trump nine days ago. NYT urges Trump to end 'enemy' rhetoric How Trump 'enemies' remark echoes tyrants Reality Check: Are journalists increasingly under attack? The message, however, may not have been received. In his Sunday morning tweet, the president appears to assert that it's the media's fault that he has decided to label them ""enemies of the American people"". For Mr Trump, then, this kind of language - if it is a problem - is a problem for the media, not him, to fix. This video can not be played 'Enemy of the people' - Trump compared to Stalin for attacks on media The irony, of course, is that Mr Trump cites New York Times reports about details of Robert Mueller's Russia investigation that are based on anonymous sources. On Friday, he referred to the special counsel looking at his tweets - a bit of information drawn directly from a Times article. Allow Twitter content?

Whenever the Times runs a story about his administration with similar sourcing, however, it's ""fake news"". And this gets to the heart of the matter. The president wants positive news coverage for himself and critical coverage of his adversaries. ""Fake news"", ""enemy of the people"" and all the other media-bashing is simply a means to achieving that goal. In sport, the strategy is called ""working the referee"". It's the same idea in politics - but the stakes are much higher. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump doesn't just want the referee's ""calls"" to go his way. His goal is to question the reliability the referee entirely. And it's working - at least among the president's most loyal supporters. In a recent CBS News poll,91% of ""strong supporters"" of the president's said they trust Mr Trump to provide them with accurate information,external. Only 11% said the same thing about the ""mainstream media"", while 63% said they trusted their own ""friends and family"". Mr Sulzberger warned that Mr Trump's rhetoric could lead to violence The president's war of words with the media has contributed to a base of support that is, effectively, invulnerable to negative news. The question now is whether that base is enough to prevail in the upcoming mid-term congressional elections and, eventually, carry him to re-election victory in 2020. It is, at the very least, a good place to start - and a reason why the president may stick to his current course, in spite of Mr Sulzberger's words of caution.

"Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba was part of the elite Special Air Service (SAS) The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have unveiled a statue of a largely unknown British-Fijian war hero who died in battle after holding off hundreds of enemy soldiers for hours. Harry and Meghan paid tribute to Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba, who saved the lives of his fellow soldiers at the Battle of Mirbat in Oman in 1972. Only eight Fijians have joined the elite Special Air Service (SAS). The royal couple unveiled the statue at Nadi Airport on Thursday morning. They are on a 16-day tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's first tour Meghan's message of female empowerment in Fiji How to catch the eye of a royal Sgt Labalaba, who was born in 1942 in Fiji, was recruited into the British army in 1961 and quickly made his way into the SAS. Known to his colleagues as a ""gentle giant"", he was part of a team of nine SAS soldiers based outside Mirbat. They were part of a secret military operation code-named Operation Jaguar and their duty was to protect the Sultan of Oman from a group of Marxist guerrillas known as the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf. On 19 July, 1972, a day before they were due to go home, they were attacked. Knowing the unit was hopelessly outnumbered, Sgt Labalaba ran hundreds of yards to reach a 25-pounder artillery gun  which is usually operated by four to six men. He held out for two and a half hours against at least 250 fighters, repelling wave after wave of attacks. He was shot in the jaw and eventually died when a bullet passed through his neck. ""Laba was exceptional,"" one of his fellow soldiers told the BBC, ""even among the very high standard of the other Fijians in the regiment."" His comrades say that without him, they could not have survived.

"The BBC has ""failed"" in its duty to give staff equal pay and opportunities, and needs ""a more transparent"" pay structure, a group of MPs has said. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee suggested women at the corporation were earning ""far less"" for doing comparable jobs. The inquiry was sparked by presenter Carrie Gracie, who had accused the corporation of pay discrimination. The BBC said much of the report was out of date but there is ""more to do"". It said reforms to its pay structure now ""ensure fairness and give an unprecedented level of transparency"". Gender pay gap at lowest level yet, says ONS Director general Tony Hall said: ""This report is looking backwards and has not caught up to where we are. In the last year, our gender pay gap is one of the lowest in the media in the UK, if not the lowest. ""It's come down in the last year by 20%, and we're the only organisation in the UK who's committed to getting our gender pay gap down to equal by the end of 2020."" The committee's findings come on the same day as the publication of Ofcom's annual report on the BBC, which assesses how the corporation is performing. The broadcasting regulator identified four areas where the BBC should go further to deliver for audiences: More transparencyon why major decisions have been made or how projects have been developed. For example, changes to the iPlayer or the plans for a new BBC Scotland channel. Being more innovative andtaking more risks with original programming, both in commissioning and creating content. Attracting more young people. Ofcom said younger people are more likely to listen to commercial, rather than BBC, radio stations, and that few young people choose to watch BBC Three content online. Representing UK society better,for example by featuring more older women on TV, portraying national identity without stereotypes, and representing disabled people in a way that doesn't just focus on their struggles from having a disability. In July 2017,the publication of the BBC's highest-earning presentersrevealed an imbalance between the numbers of men and women at the top of the list, leading to an outcry and the corporation commissioning three separate reviews into pay. But theDCMS committee's report,externalsaid a new BBC pay framework was ""of no use in helping women compare their salaries to those of their male colleagues"". The committee's chairman Damian Collins MP said the BBC ""must take urgent action now"". ""The BBC acts as a beacon in public life. As an employer it has an even higher level of duty than others to advance equality of opportunity - but this it has failed to do,"" he added. The BBC's Carrie Gracie resigned from her role as China Editor over equal pay The MPs also criticised the BBC's investigations into pay, saying the corporation had ""failed adequately to consult staff"". In June, the BBC apologisedfor underpaying Ms Gracie, BBC News's former China editor, compared with the male international editors, and gave her back pay. Gracie left her role in January, accusing the BBC of operating a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"" and said it was facing a ""crisis of trust"". The MPs said the episode pointed to a ""culture of invidious, opaque decision-making"". BBC star salaries 2017-18: Who earned what? BBC apologises to Carrie Gracie over pay How the BBC gender pay story has unfolded The BBC said: ""Recent disclosures by other media organisations show that the BBC's gender pay gap is amongst the smallest and well below the national average. But we do hold ourselves to a higher standard. ""That is why our action on pay has seen the BBC make real progress in addressing equal pay cases"". The corporation highlighted its audit of equal pay and future planned reviews of pay transparency, as well as the introduction of independent oversight to resolve disputes and steps to rebalance ""top talent pay"". Claudia Winkleman was the highest paid woman in the BBC's annual report 2017/18 The BBC added that its reform to pay structure would ""ensure fairness and give an unprecedented level of transparency and information about pay ranges for all staff"". But BBC Women, a group representing female journalists and producers, said the MPs' report revealed there was ""intractable processes, lack of transparency, evasive tactics, and no genuinely independent oversight"" at the corporation. ""BBC management should lead by example, implement the recommendations made by the select committee immediately, meet its legal obligations on pay,"" it said.

"Tesla has reported a quarterly profit for just the third time in its 15-year history. The electric car-maker made a record $311.5m (Â£241m) in the three months to 30 September, as the pace of car deliveries accelerated. The result is a victory for chief executive Elon Musk, who had promised a profit to investors earlier this year. Tesla's last profitable quarter came in 2016 and it had faced mounting questions about its finances. In a letter to investors, Mr Musk called the quarter ""historic"" and said it was a credit to the firm's ""ingenuity and incredible hard work"". He also said Tesla was on track to be profitable again in the fourth quarter. Shares jumped more than 10% in after-hours trading in New York. The results are a sign that the firm has turned a corner, said Nicholas Hyett at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Normally we'd tell investors to avoid reading too deeply into a single quarter's numbers, but this quarter really counted at Tesla,"" he said. Tesla, which has never reported an annual profit, had been under particular strain after it ramped up spending for its launch of the Model 3, its newest car aimed at a wider market. Following a surge of orders last year, it struggled to meet manufacturing targets and deliver cars to customers. That prompted worries about Tesla's finances and fanned concerns that customers would get impatient and cancel their bookings. However, less than a fifth of the roughly 455,000 reservations the firm reported in 2017 have been cancelled, it said. Musk mocks US regulator Tesla production hits record high Production has also picked up, driving sales. Tesla made more than 80,000 vehicles in the period, of which more than 60% were Model 3s. The increase lifted revenue to $6.8bn in the quarter, more than double a year ago. Job cuts and other reductions in spending also helped the bottom line. Akshay Anand, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book, called it a ""very strong"" quarterly performance. ""Kudos to Elon Musk and team for surprising nearly everyone,"" he said. ""Now, the question remains - can Tesla make this a habit, or [is] this a blip on the radar?"" On a call with financial analysts, Mr Musk said Tesla aimed to be profitable every quarter going forward. He is counting on strong demand in Europe and China, where Tesla plans to start selling Model 3s next year. The aim is to shift up to a million cars a year outside the US. Tesla hopes to start production of its next model in 2020 and is also making plans for a Tesla ride-hailing service, Mr Musk added. The quarterly profit milestone was a boost to the Tesla chief, who has been criticised for not delivering on previous promises and other recent behaviour, such asTwitter attacks on a British diver. Last month the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission,accused him of defrauding investorswhen he claimed he had secured funding to take Tesla private. The two sides later announced a settlement, in which Mr Musk would step aside as chairman and pay a fine, among other penalties, but could remain Tesla chief executive. Tesla declined to take questions on the search for a new board chair.

"The nasal spray vaccine to protect children against flu contains porcine gelatine The use of pork gelatine in three vaccines used by the NHS has been branded ""disappointing"" by the Vegetarian Society. Chief executive Lynne Elliot added that the use of animal ingredients in medicines is ""upsetting"". Porcine gelatine is derived from pigs and used in vaccines against flu, shingles, measles, mumps and rubella. Public Health England said thegelatine is used as a stabiliser,externaland developing an alternative ""may never happen"". The government agency said the gelatine is ""highly purified"" and manufactured under ""strict hygiene and safety regulations"". A spokeswoman for Public Heath England said the gelatine helps to keep the vaccine viruses stable ""to provide the best protection against flu"". Ms Elliot said there should be ""vegetarian and vegan versions of all medicines and vaccines"". Public Health England said the injectable flu vaccine does not contain gelatine but is ""less effective"" The three vaccines which contain porcine gelatine are: Fluenz Tetra - a nasal spray vaccine which protects children against flu MMR VaxPro - a jab which protects against measles, mumps and rubella Zostavax - an injection to protect adults against shingles All three are used across the UK as part of the national immunisation programme. Zostavax and Fluenz Tetra were first introduced on the NHS in 2013, while MMR VaxPro was first used in 2008. A parent who contacted the BBC said he was ""offended"" by the use of porcine gelatine in the nasal flu vaccine. He explained his wife was told about the ingredient by a doctor when she took their children to be vaccinated. She refused the vaccine because of their religion. One parent told the BBC he was ""offended"" by the use of gelatine in the nasal flu vaccine The Muslim Council of Britain said the vaccines are not permitted in Islam unless lives are at risk and there are no alternatives. Dr Shuja Shafi, the chairman of the council's research and documentation committee, said: ""There should be more work towards an alternative. ""We should be trying to find a long-term solution. The needs of the people must be met."" Dr Shafi advised anyone concerned about the use of gelatine in vaccines to consult a medical practitioner and make an ""informed decision"". Mark Frazer, from the Office of the Chief Rabbi, said vaccines containing porcine gelatine are not an issue for the Jewish community because they are not ingested. A spokeswoman from Public Health England said the nasal flu vaccination is not mandatory and the decision is ""one for parents alone"". ""We recognise that there is still some uncertainty among some groups about the acceptability of the nasal spray. ""We will continue to monitor these concerns and consider them carefully."" Public Health England said there are injectable flu vaccines that do not contain pork gelatine, but these are slightly ""less effective"" than the nasal vaccine because they may require two doses and do less to reduce the spread of flu. Therefore they should only be offered as an alternative for children and adults ""who are at high risk of the complications of flu"" and who refuse the recommended first choice vaccine. A gelatine-free vaccine is available for measles, mumps and rubella but there is no such alternative for the shingles vaccine Zostavax.

"European share markets have steadied after big falls in Asian stocks that followed a bruising trading session on Wall Street. Tokyo stocks slumped more than 3%, while losses pushed the US Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year. European markets followed suit at first, but had risen by lunchtime, with London's FTSE 100 up 0.17%. Concerns over corporate profits and slowing growth have rattled investors. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.4% to 24,583.4 points, while the S&P 500 plunged 3.1% to 2,656.1 points on Wednesday. The technology-focused Nasdaq dropped more than 4.4% to 7,108.4 points - its worst day since 2011 - amid concerns about weak corporate profits and global trade tensions. It was the worst day since 2011 for the index, which is now 10% lower than its September peak and in ""correction"" territory. Even technology firms, which have driven much of the market gains this year, did not escape the sell-off, with Amazon falling 5.9%, Facebook down 5.4%, Google owner Alphabet off 4.8% and Netflix sinking 9.4%. Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific head of trading at Oanda, said in a research note the tech sector had previously been seen as ""impervious to weaker global growth sentiment, but escalating US-China trade tension remains that sectors undoing"". Wednesday's losses marked a sixth straight day of declines on the S&P and followedturbulence earlier in October. The Dow is now on track for its worst month since May 2010. Investors were also spooked by figures on Wednesday showing new home sales fell last month to their slowest pace in nearly two years. They underlined other reports suggesting the US housing market is weakening - a worry given the sector is seen as a bellwether of economic health by many. Investors have also grown nervous as growth in China slows and companies report increased costs due to labour shortages and tariffs. Those forecasts hit companies such as Caterpillar, down 5.6%, and 3M, off 4.2%. The falls compounded declines on Tuesday in the wake of disappointing results. Nate Thooft at Manulife Mutual Funds said: ""Costs are increasing and it's often tariff-related. We also reached a potential peak for earnings - companies that show marginal weakness take a beating."" Adding to the sense of unease were a series of crude mail bombs and suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, less than a fortnight before the midterm elections. Jack Ablin at Cresset Wealth Advisors said the selling appeared to be ""emotionally"" driven, adding: ""Perhaps it's just a ratcheting up of chaos."" The losses on major European indexes were less severe.

"Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba was part of the elite Special Air Service (SAS) The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have unveiled a statue of a largely unknown British-Fijian war hero who died in battle after holding off hundreds of enemy soldiers for hours. Harry and Meghan paid tribute to Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba, who saved the lives of his fellow soldiers at the Battle of Mirbat in Oman in 1972. Only eight Fijians have joined the elite Special Air Service (SAS). The royal couple unveiled the statue at Nadi Airport on Thursday morning. They are on a 16-day tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's first tour Meghan's message of female empowerment in Fiji How to catch the eye of a royal Sgt Labalaba, who was born in 1942 in Fiji, was recruited into the British army in 1961 and quickly made his way into the SAS. Known to his colleagues as a ""gentle giant"", he was part of a team of nine SAS soldiers based outside Mirbat. They were part of a secret military operation code-named Operation Jaguar and their duty was to protect the Sultan of Oman from a group of Marxist guerrillas known as the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf. On 19 July, 1972, a day before they were due to go home, they were attacked. Knowing the unit was hopelessly outnumbered, Sgt Labalaba ran hundreds of yards to reach a 25-pounder artillery gun  which is usually operated by four to six men. He held out for two and a half hours against at least 250 fighters, repelling wave after wave of attacks. He was shot in the jaw and eventually died when a bullet passed through his neck. ""Laba was exceptional,"" one of his fellow soldiers told the BBC, ""even among the very high standard of the other Fijians in the regiment."" His comrades say that without him, they could not have survived.

"Sina Entertainment said that Chinese users were ""more creative"" than the Russians with the challenge - showing their daily life toils One of the hottest online trends of the summer - the #fallingstarschallenge - has now made an appearance in China and it is inevitably being reinvented by Chinese millennials who never pass up an opportunity for parody. The trend began in Russia and became wildly popular in August, particularly among the country's rich kids of Instagram. It saw wealthy young Russians use the hashtag #fallingstarschallenge2018 while staging falls out of luxury cars and private jets surrounded by items like luxury handbags and champagne glasses casually splayed around the floor. The trend quickly went global, but has particularly proven popular in China. Certainly some wealthy young Chinese have been showing off their bling in the challenge. Allow Instagram content?

The #fallingstarschallenge has taken off in China - but people aren't just using it to flaunt their wealth Chinese media has wasted no time in highlighting the difference between the way Russian and Chinese users are posting, saying that while overseas Chinese have jumped on the bandwagon, domestic users are not using the challenge to flaunt their wealth.

The Sina news portal describes the Chinese trend as ""more creative"" than the Russian. It showed pictures on its Weibo microblog of super-wealthy Russian women falling out of expensive vehicles, surrounded by luxury goods  juxtaposed with pictures of Chinese people staging falls in front of cheap, household products or items associated with their work and study. It was a message that clearly found favour and was being spread by the Chinese authorities.  But the BBC  also asked a few users what their thinking was behind their posts. One user took the challenge before running in a marathon One user, 'MrBailuJ' says she took her picture at a marathon she was competing in, in the northern city of Xi'an. She says: ""I received my pack before the race, and I thought about this recent photo trend. It's so different from previous ones, and I thought it was an interesting way to take a picture and share with my circle of friends."" One user says he works at an education institute, and shares a picture of him collapsing in front of multiple mobile phones, tablets, and packets of biscuits. Another user, May, says she chose to do the trend to show the daily struggles of keeping fit. ""I don't own a sports car, or anything Hermes, I only have barbells and protein powder,"" she says. May said she didn't have 'a sports car or anything Hermes' but used what she had One user told the BBC that flaunting one's wealth could actually lead to criticism from other users. He said: ""Most of the Chinese people doing this online aren't doing it because they're wealthy. They are showing their experiences of the past and present, or their personal achievements. ""Showing off their wealth on the internet would lead to ridicule,"" he says. ""The less money you have, the less afraid you will be of letting others see your wealth."" He says that this explains why ""the super-rich have not come out to show off"". In China, people are pretty open about how much money they earn. But those who flaunt their wealth are increasingly viewed with suspicion and some hostility. Wang Sicong, the son of one of China's richest men, Wang Jianlin, came under fire from users in May 2015, after he spent 250,000 yuan ($36,000; Â£27,000) on a couple of Apple watches for his pet dog. Since Xi Jinping came to power in late 2012, China has seen a large-scale anti-corruption campaign targeting ""tigers and flies"" - high and low-level officials who have been accused of bribery or abuse of power. Questions about the legitimate earnings of China's elite extended to China's entertainment industry in early October when the government fined top actress Fan Bingbing for tax evasion and other offences. On social media there have been calls for a wider investigation into China's super-rich, to establish whether their earnings are legitimate,  so it's perhaps not surprising that the Chinese internet is sending up as much as flaunting wealth when it comes to falling stars.

It also accused the Home Office of a ""complete failure of leadership"". The Home Office said it was engaging with police to ensure they get the resources they need.

"Tesla has reported a quarterly profit for just the third time in its 15-year history. The electric car-maker made a record $311.5m (Â£241m) in the three months to 30 September, as the pace of car deliveries accelerated. The result is a victory for chief executive Elon Musk, who had promised a profit to investors earlier this year. Tesla's last profitable quarter came in 2016 and it had faced mounting questions about its finances. In a letter to investors, Mr Musk called the quarter ""historic"" and said it was a credit to the firm's ""ingenuity and incredible hard work"". He also said Tesla was on track to be profitable again in the fourth quarter. Shares jumped more than 10% in after-hours trading in New York. The results are a sign that the firm has turned a corner, said Nicholas Hyett at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Normally we'd tell investors to avoid reading too deeply into a single quarter's numbers, but this quarter really counted at Tesla,"" he said. Tesla, which has never reported an annual profit, had been under particular strain after it ramped up spending for its launch of the Model 3, its newest car aimed at a wider market. Following a surge of orders last year, it struggled to meet manufacturing targets and deliver cars to customers. That prompted worries about Tesla's finances and fanned concerns that customers would get impatient and cancel their bookings. However, less than a fifth of the roughly 455,000 reservations the firm reported in 2017 have been cancelled, it said. Musk mocks US regulator Tesla production hits record high Production has also picked up, driving sales. Tesla made more than 80,000 vehicles in the period, of which more than 60% were Model 3s. The increase lifted revenue to $6.8bn in the quarter, more than double a year ago. Job cuts and other reductions in spending also helped the bottom line. Akshay Anand, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book, called it a ""very strong"" quarterly performance. ""Kudos to Elon Musk and team for surprising nearly everyone,"" he said. ""Now, the question remains - can Tesla make this a habit, or [is] this a blip on the radar?"" On a call with financial analysts, Mr Musk said Tesla aimed to be profitable every quarter going forward. He is counting on strong demand in Europe and China, where Tesla plans to start selling Model 3s next year. The aim is to shift up to a million cars a year outside the US. Tesla hopes to start production of its next model in 2020 and is also making plans for a Tesla ride-hailing service, Mr Musk added. The quarterly profit milestone was a boost to the Tesla chief, who has been criticised for not delivering on previous promises and other recent behaviour, such asTwitter attacks on a British diver. Last month the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission,accused him of defrauding investorswhen he claimed he had secured funding to take Tesla private. The two sides later announced a settlement, in which Mr Musk would step aside as chairman and pay a fine, among other penalties, but could remain Tesla chief executive. Tesla declined to take questions on the search for a new board chair.

"Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 The co-founder of Superdry is talking to shareholders about returning to the fashion retailer in the hope of reviving its fortunes. Julian Dunkerton, who stepped down as chief executive in 2014 andleft its board in March, remains its biggest shareholder with an 18.5% stake. He has gone public with criticism of Superdry's strategy afterits latest profit warninglast week. The firm's shares have fallen from almost Â£20 in January to Â£7.29p apiece. Mr Dunkerton told the BBC he was offering to return to Superdry ""in any capacity"" to correct what he described as a failing strategy. He argued that the policy of putting new products in its stores more frequently was misguided. It should focus on its core jackets and hoodies and offer a far wider range of variations online, he said: ""Superdry is a series of core products - stick with them and tweak them."" The decision to start discounting jackets two days before Christmas meant there was not enough stock for the rest of the winter, Mr Dunkerton added. ""This is just about the strategy - it's not about ego,"" he said. ""The ship needs to turn and it needs to turn quickly."" Mr Dunkerton founded Superdry in Cheltenham 15 years ago with designer James Holder, who left two years ago and still owns a 9.7% stake in the company. He said his co-founder backed his plan to return to the company as both believed they could no longer stand back and watch as the shares continue to sink. Mr Dunkerton said any retail shareholders he spoke to also wanted him to go back. He has hired the broker Cenkos to help persuade institutional investors to support his campaign. However, Aberdeen Standard Investments, which is the second-largest shareholder in Superdry with a 10.6% stake, has criticised Mr Dunkerton for failing to make contact before going public with his campaign. Frederik Nassauer, a fund manager at Aberdeen Standard, has gone on record to support the company's management and strategy. ""Euan Sutherland was appointed chief executive in 2014, as Julian decided to step aside as chief executive after several profit warnings,""he told The Times,external. The other major shareholders, Old Mutual, Artemis and Blackrock, which have stakes of 7%, 5% and 4.7% respectively, are yet to reveal their stance on Mr Dunkerton's campaign. Peter Bamford, chairman of Superdry, said the former chief executive had raised several issues about strategy since he left the business. ""We have reviewed and discussed these issues and, while we have sympathy with some of his points, we have a different view on the best strategy or approach to addressing them,"" he said. ""The board believes that Julian's view of strategy has not evolved with the needs of the business. We remain fully committed to our successful global digital brand strategy and the board is confident that Superdry has in place the right leadership."" The company makes up to three quarters of its profits in the second half of the year and has embarked on an 18-month plan to broaden its range in order to be less dependent on sales of winter jackets, jumpers and hoodies. Superdry last week blamedpoor sales over the summer on unseasonably hot weatherin the UK, continental Europe and on the US east coast. That situation continued into October. The profit warning sent shares down by a fifth and the company is now worth just under Â£600m. In July Mr Dunkerton raised Â£71m by selling 5.5 million shares to institutional investors at Â£12.85 a share, reducing his stake from 25.2% to 18.5%.

"Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba was part of the elite Special Air Service (SAS) The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have unveiled a statue of a largely unknown British-Fijian war hero who died in battle after holding off hundreds of enemy soldiers for hours. Harry and Meghan paid tribute to Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba, who saved the lives of his fellow soldiers at the Battle of Mirbat in Oman in 1972. Only eight Fijians have joined the elite Special Air Service (SAS). The royal couple unveiled the statue at Nadi Airport on Thursday morning. They are on a 16-day tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's first tour Meghan's message of female empowerment in Fiji How to catch the eye of a royal Sgt Labalaba, who was born in 1942 in Fiji, was recruited into the British army in 1961 and quickly made his way into the SAS. Known to his colleagues as a ""gentle giant"", he was part of a team of nine SAS soldiers based outside Mirbat. They were part of a secret military operation code-named Operation Jaguar and their duty was to protect the Sultan of Oman from a group of Marxist guerrillas known as the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf. On 19 July, 1972, a day before they were due to go home, they were attacked. Knowing the unit was hopelessly outnumbered, Sgt Labalaba ran hundreds of yards to reach a 25-pounder artillery gun  which is usually operated by four to six men. He held out for two and a half hours against at least 250 fighters, repelling wave after wave of attacks. He was shot in the jaw and eventually died when a bullet passed through his neck. ""Laba was exceptional,"" one of his fellow soldiers told the BBC, ""even among the very high standard of the other Fijians in the regiment."" His comrades say that without him, they could not have survived.

"European share markets have steadied after big falls in Asian stocks that followed a bruising trading session on Wall Street. Tokyo stocks slumped more than 3%, while losses pushed the US Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year. European markets followed suit at first, but had risen by lunchtime, with London's FTSE 100 up 0.17%. Concerns over corporate profits and slowing growth have rattled investors. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.4% to 24,583.4 points, while the S&P 500 plunged 3.1% to 2,656.1 points on Wednesday. The technology-focused Nasdaq dropped more than 4.4% to 7,108.4 points - its worst day since 2011 - amid concerns about weak corporate profits and global trade tensions. It was the worst day since 2011 for the index, which is now 10% lower than its September peak and in ""correction"" territory. Even technology firms, which have driven much of the market gains this year, did not escape the sell-off, with Amazon falling 5.9%, Facebook down 5.4%, Google owner Alphabet off 4.8% and Netflix sinking 9.4%. Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific head of trading at Oanda, said in a research note the tech sector had previously been seen as ""impervious to weaker global growth sentiment, but escalating US-China trade tension remains that sectors undoing"". Wednesday's losses marked a sixth straight day of declines on the S&P and followedturbulence earlier in October. The Dow is now on track for its worst month since May 2010. Investors were also spooked by figures on Wednesday showing new home sales fell last month to their slowest pace in nearly two years. They underlined other reports suggesting the US housing market is weakening - a worry given the sector is seen as a bellwether of economic health by many. Investors have also grown nervous as growth in China slows and companies report increased costs due to labour shortages and tariffs. Those forecasts hit companies such as Caterpillar, down 5.6%, and 3M, off 4.2%. The falls compounded declines on Tuesday in the wake of disappointing results. Nate Thooft at Manulife Mutual Funds said: ""Costs are increasing and it's often tariff-related. We also reached a potential peak for earnings - companies that show marginal weakness take a beating."" Adding to the sense of unease were a series of crude mail bombs and suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, less than a fortnight before the midterm elections. Jack Ablin at Cresset Wealth Advisors said the selling appeared to be ""emotionally"" driven, adding: ""Perhaps it's just a ratcheting up of chaos."" The losses on major European indexes were less severe.

"This video can not be played Debenhams boss Sergio Bucher says the chain wants to have fewer but better stores Debenhams has posted record annual losses and said it will close up to 50 stores, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. In the year to September the department store group lost Â£491.5m, against profits of Â£59m the year before. Debenhams, which has 165 branches, previously said it planned to close 10 stores. Boss Sergio Bucher said the company was ""taking tough decisions"" on stores where financial performance was likely to deteriorate over time. The retailer is not releasing a list of the stores at risk of closure. Debenhams attempts to 'bring joy back' Which shops are opening and closing Why we no longer love department stores Mr Bucher said in a statement,externalthat the additional 40 stores earmarked for closure were ""currently contributing positively"" to the business, but added: ""However, rolling forward current trends, we do not believe they will remain profitable in future years and therefore we intend to exit these stores over the next 3-5 years."" The BBC understands about 4,000 jobs could be affected by the changes, but Debenhams said it hoped there would be a ""minimum"" of compulsory redundancies and that some of the departures would be people who would have left the business anyway. The chain was plunged into loss by exceptional write-downs of Â£512.4m, including reductions in the value of its goodwill, stores and IT systems. Without this, it would have made a pre-tax profit of Â£33m. However, Debenhams has also been buffeted by pressures facing the whole of the UK High Street. Sales in its UK branches fell by 6.3% over the year, amid what it described as a ""volatile"" market background. However, its online business grew by 10%. The popularity of online shopping has coincided with consumers' increasing appetite for ""experiences"" such as beauty treatments, on the High Street. Add to that the rising overheads faced by bricks and mortar retailers and their mounting problems have seldom been out of the headlines this year. Earlier this month, rival department store chain House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. And other retailers, including Marks and Spencer and Mothercare, have announced branch closures. This is a massive loss for such a small business, even though the sea of red ink can be explained by one-off accounting adjustments. Debenhams is still profitable. But it only made Â£33m, despite Â£3bn worth of sales. Its biggest headache right now is property. Big department stores are expensive to run. Debenhams is tied into a lot of lengthy, inflexible leases with upward-only rents. Its business rates bill this year will be nearly three times as much as it made in underlying profits. Meanwhile, Debenhams costs are rising faster than its sales, partly because we're now shopping so much online. One in every Â£5 at Debenhams is spent via the internet. So it is finally grasping the nettle and reshaping its business, hard as it will be for the High Streets and town centres it will eventually leave behind. Twenty-five leases are up for renewal over the next five years, allowing Debenhams to hand back the keys. The question is, will landlords allow Debenhams to call time on several dozen more, as the shake-out in retail continues. Debenhams has been undergoing a revamp aimed at reviving its fortunes, redesigning stores and introducing new ""experiences"" including beauty treatments and prosecco bars. Called Debenhams Redesigned, the firm said the new format stores will deliver a ""sociable, easy and fun"" shopping experience, and it has already modernised nine of its stores. It is planning to implement a similar overhaul in a ""profitable core of up to 100 stores in flagship and vibrant markets"" where it could see a positive return on future investment. These stores account for more than 80% of the chain's profits. There are a further 20 stores which are profitable now, but which are ""not likely to deliver a return on further investment"". Debenhams said it was seeking ""alternative solutions"" for those outlets, depending on where they were. The retailer is also aiming for its online business to account for about 30% of its business, compared with 20% at the moment. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said Debenhams was operating in the part of the market under the most intense amount of pressure. ""Put simply, department stores are incredibly expensive to run,"" he said. ""The combination of too much space, inflexible leases and spiralling operating costs are set against a backdrop an accelerating behavioural shift towards online and experiences. This is eroding their profitability and changes in the business need to occur at a pace if they are to survive."" Hargreaves Lansdown's senior analyst Laith Khalaf said: ""The Debenhams share price has lost four fifths of its value in the last year, and no doubt some will be wondering if we are now near the bottom. ""Despite the dramatic drop, this is still a business in a state of transition, and while the upside could be considerable if Debenhams turns things around, there is still a risk of further losses, particularly given the fragile and dynamic consumer environment.""

"Adding a recording of a mother's voice to smoke alarms could save lives, according to US scientists. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found the modified alarms were more effective at waking children than conventional alarms. And they had the potential to buy vital seconds to escape a burning building. Fire chiefs welcomed the research, but said families should not worry about the alarms currently in their homes. The research team at the Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio said children were ""remarkably resistant"" to being woken up by sounds because they have longer and deeper sleep than adults. The study compared a traditional high-pitch smoke alarm with voice-based ones. Conventional smoke alarms give out a blaring noise There were 176 children who took part, and alarms were personalised with a recording of the mother's voice instructing their child to wake up. Only half woke up to the blaring noise of a conventional smoke alarm. But nine in 10 woke up to the voice alarms. The experiments were performed in a sleep laboratory, and the alarms were played once the children were in the deepest phase of sleep. Smoke alarms 'fail to wake children' Smoke alarm response times 'wildly vary' Smoke alarm 'would have saved fire-death boys' Dr Mark Splaingard, one of the researchers, said: ""The fact that we were able to find a smoke alarm sound that reduces the amount of time it takes for many children five to 12 years of age to wake up and leave the bedroom, could save lives."" The researchers now want to test whether any voice will do, or if it has to be the mother. And they want to assess what impact such alarms might have on waking up adults. Rick Hylton, from the UK's National Fire Chiefs Council, said he was looking forward to seeing how the research panned out. He said: ""People shouldn't be concerned about the effectiveness of their current smoke alarms. ""We know smoke alarms save lives so we ask that people ensure they have installed smoke alarms. ""They will alert occupants early if working, fitted and installed in the correct location. This gives adults, parents or guardians the opportunity to wake children, and leave the house.""

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are finishing their first overseas tour with engagements in New Zealand - the last country they're visiting. The royal couple's 16-day trip started in Australia, before moving on to Fiji and Tonga. They returned to Australia before flying to Wellington. On the final day of their tour Meghan and Harry donned traditional Maori cloaks and exchanged ""hongi"" greetings with well-wishers - pressing their nose and forehead together - at a welcome ceremony in Rotorua. Prince Harry gave a speech partially in Maori, praising the ""creative, gifted and caring Te Arawa Rangatahi [young people]"" who use their talents to promote the language and support mental wellbeing. The couple then spent more than their allotted 30 minutes meeting the crowds who had gathered outside for their last walkabout. On Monday the focus was on mental health, with a visit to a Wellington cafe. Speaking at the beachside Maranui Cafe, where they met mental health workers, the duchess said people's sense of self-worth could become ""really skewed"" by social media. Speaking to staff who work on a programme for millennials, she said: ""You see photos on social media and you don't know whether she's born with it or maybe it's a filter. ""Your judgment of your sense of self-worth becomes really skewed when it's all based on likes."" They met schoolchildren outside the cafe - with Meghan later running back inside to ask that the leftover cakes be taken out for the children. One of them, five-year-old Joe Young, found events a bit overwhelming and was comforted by the duke and duchess, with Harry tickling his stomach. Next up was a meeting with musicians and artists - including a man dressed as an orc soldier. They were at Courtenay Creative, which runs programmes for young people looking to get into film, and posed for pictures with actors dressed as monsters. Earlier in the day, they had been to New Zealand's smallest national park, where they went on a trail walk and spent time on the beach - despite the rainy weather, with Harry sheltering his wife with an umbrella. In a speech, he said ""myself and my wife and our little bump"" were grateful for the way conservationists ""look after this beautiful place"". Meghan and Harry had landed in New Zealand on Sunday, flying in from Sydney with members of the New Zealand Invictus Games squad. They were given a traditional Maori welcome - including a performance of the haka. Their first engagement was at the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park, where they laid a wreath. Meghan later gave a speech to mark the 125th anniversary of women being given the vote in New Zealand. She said: ""In the words of your suffragette Kate Sheppard, 'all that separates, whether race, class, creed, or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome'."" Harry and Meghan travelled to Australia for the second time for the end of the Invictus Games. On Friday, they were among the crowds watching the wheelchair basketball finals on the last day of the competition. At the closing ceremony on Saturday, the Duke of Sussex said the competitors' performances had been humbling. ""They are men and women who have confronted a challenge and overcome it,"" he said. ""They are ordinary people doing extraordinary things."" His wife thanked the Invictus organisation for welcoming her into the family, saying she had witnessed ""amazing support networks"" between the 500 competitors. On Friday, Harry and Meghan visited Tupou College for the unveiling of The Queen's Commonwealth Canopy, an initiative that aims to conserve indigenous forests for future generations. They first arrived in Tonga on Thursday. School children were given the day off to welcome the couple and lined the route to Nuku'alofa, where the royals had a private audience with King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau'u. The couple's last engagement in Fiji took place at Nadi airport before their flight to Tonga. Harry unveiled a memorial to British-Fijian SAS soldier Sgt Talaiasi Labalaba, who died after single-handedly holding off 250 insurgents during an operation in Oman in 1972. The Duchess of Sussex had to cut short a visit to a market in the capital, Suva, on Wednesday morning because of security concerns caused by large crowds. Meghan left about six minutes into a scheduled 15 minute visit to the site. Meghan also addressed students at the University of the South Pacific - her first speech of the royal tour. She said that for women and girls in developing countries education was ""key"" to economic and social development and could help them ""create incredible futures"". On Tuesday, Harry and Meghan attended a ceremony where the prince tried kava, a traditional non-alcoholic drink. Crowds cheered as he sipped the drink, which is used to treat anxiety and stress in some countries. The couple were then met by huge crowds of people at the Grand Pacific Hotel in Suva, where they waved from a balcony. The duke and duchess met President Jioji Konrote and First Lady Sarote Faga Konrote, who presented Meghan with a pearl necklace. The royal couple's trip began on 16 October in Sydney, as news of Meghan's pregnancy made headlines across the globe. Needless to say, everyone was looking out for a first glimpse of the royal baby bump. Australia's Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove and his wife Lynne presented Harry and Meghan with a toy kangaroo and a little pair of Ugg boots for their baby, which is due in the spring. The couple went barefoot on Bondi Beach, as they met surfing community group OneWave, which encourages the discussion of mental health issues. The duke and duchess also went out on the water in Sydney, where Harry took up the challenge of scaling the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Together with three Invictus Games athletes and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the duke's team took 13 minutes to complete their ascent of the bridge. The couple also attended the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games. However, after it overran by nearly two hours, it was decided that Meghan would take some time out of her schedule and spend the following morning resting. Throughout the tour the prince's beard appeared to draw attention from fans of all ages, from 98-year-old Daphne Dunne at the Sydney Opera House... ...to five-year-old Luke at Dubbo Airport. Why Harry is a hero for 'rangas' However, at Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Ruby the koala seemed somewhat less impressed. Photographs subject to copyright.

"Matthew Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport in May The Foreign Office has failed to offer adequate support to a British student charged with spying in the United Arab Emirates, his wife has told the BBC. Durham University PhD student Matthew Hedges hasreportedly been held in solitary confinement for five months. Daniela Tejada said requests to meet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had not received a response. Mr Hunt said he had raised ""a number of concerns"" about the case with his UAE counterpart. Mr Hedgesappeared in court on Wednesday, and his lawyer requested that the evidence be re-examined. The court agreed and the hearing was adjourned until November 21. Ms Tejada told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme there was ""absolutely no guarantee of a fair trial"" as her husband had been ""heavily interrogated without legal counsel from the beginning"". Ms Tejada, who lives in Exeter, said that after Mr Hedges was arrested in Dubai on May 5 she ""didn't receive any [meaningful] advice"" from the Foreign Office, and was directed to a charity. She said this led her to contact the media - an approach the Foreign Office has since told her could result in ""bogus charges"" being brought against her husband in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Ms Tejada added that the Foreign Office had failed to focus on ensuring her partner's freedom - choosing instead to prioritise his welfare. She called on the government to do more to help her husband, saying accusations that he worked for the British intelligence services meant it was a ""state matter"". Mr Hunt has previously said he was ""very worried about this and I have mentioned it face-to-face with the Emirati foreign minister twice now."" The Foreign Office said it was supporting a British man following his detention in the UAE. Free 'spy' student, academics demand Free my husband from UAE jail, wife pleads Mr Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport as he was leaving the country following a research trip on the impact of the Arab Spring on the UAE's foreign policy and security strategy. Ms Tejada said her husband has only been able to meet his court-appointed lawyer once, while the state ""has had five months"" to prepare the case against him. She said that Mr Hedges ""had been forbidden from discussing his case"" with her. She said she had been told that if found guilty, her husband's sentence could range from ""a couple of months to 15 years"". Mr Hedges has continued to be held in solitary confinement, Ms Tejada said, but his conditions had ""somewhat improved"". He had been taken to hospital ""to get an idea why he was persistently vomiting"", she said, with anxiety thought to be a cause. ""He comes across as a strong person because he is very big, played rugby, but he is very vulnerable,"" she continued. The UAE government said in a statement that ""since his arrest Mr Hedges has been provided with constant medical and psychological care. ""Mr Hedges has the ongoing facility to contact family, embassy and consular staff and his legal counsel by phone,"" it added. ""The UAE constitution also provides that an accused person shall be presumed innocent until proven otherwise in a legal and fair trial.""

"The Harry Potter series is extremely popular in India A top Indian law university in the eastern state of West Bengal has introduced a course based on the fictional world of Harry Potter. The course uses the role of law in the series to draw parallels between the stories and real-life situations. Professor Shouvik Kumar Guha, who designed it, says it is an ""experiment"" to ""encourage creative thinking."" Several universities in the US and at least one in the UK also offer courses inspired by the famous series. The course in India, which is entitled ""An interface between Fantasy Fiction Literature and Law: Special focus on Rowling's Potterverse"", is expected to include a total of 45 hours of discussion-based teaching. Some of the topics mentioned in the course module point out how social and class rights in India can be equated with the ""enslavement of house-elves and the marginalisation of werewolves"" in the fantasy series. What you might not know about Harry Potter Harry Potter-inspired bar: Where mixology meets magic Mr Guha said the course, which begins in December, has already reached its capacity of 40 students and many other students have since approached him with requests to increase the class size. Harry Potter's unmatched popularity in India is the reason Mr Guha decided to pick the series as opposed to Game of Thrones or Star Trek, he said. The course will be offered as an elective to senior students at Kolkata's National University of Juridical Sciences. The course aims to draw parallels between the series and real-life situations ""In our current system, we simply tell students the black letter of law,"" Mr Guha told the BBC. ""Will they be able to apply pre-existing laws to situations that have never come up before?"" He added that he wanted to use fictional examples to let students look at situations that can arise especially when ""our country is going through massive changes"". Mr Guha said that the course was an experiment in pushing law students to ""come out of their comfort zones"" and to learn from a fantasy series that most of them grew up reading. ""You can also see so many examples of how media is subverted by political institutions in the Potter books and see parallels in the real world,"" he said. ""[Harry Potter author JK] Rowling's universe talks a lot about how legal institutions are failing in some scenarios."" New spider species resembles Harry Potter 'Sorting Hat' The course module opens with two lines from one of the books in the series: ""Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?"" asked Scrimgeour. ""No, I'm not,"" retorted Hermione. ""I'm hoping to do some good in the world!"" More than 450 million copies of the seven original Harry Potter books have been sold worldwide This is the second Indian law school to offer such a course. More than 500 million copies of the seven original Harry Potter books have been sold worldwide in 79 languages. TheUK's Durham university is believed to have been the first to offer a Harry Potter-themed course- it used the series to examine prejudice, citizenship and bullying. Many universities in the US, including top institutions such as Yale and Georgetown, did the same, but none of them offered courses in law. Their offerings ranged from courses in theology to the ""scientific means"" of magic. The curriculum for the ""Potterverse"" law course includes some of the following topics: Legal traditions and institutions, including liberty and the rule of law in a magical society, and bureaucracy in the ministry of magic Unforgivable curses, Wizengamot trials, the innocence of Sirius Black and the persecution of Tom Riddle Social values, identity and class rights as seen in the enslavement of house elves or the marginalisation of werewolves, giants and centaurs Contracts and agency - for instance, unbreakable vows and Snape and the order of Phoenix Quidditch and sports law at Hogwarts Inside London's Harry Potter-style cocktail bar.

"""Google you informer!"" reads graffiti in Kreuzberg Google has dropped plans to open a large campus in a trendy district of Berlin that were strongly opposed by local campaigners. The US tech giant planned to set up an incubator for start-ups in Kreuzberg, but on Wednesday said the site would go to two local charities. A spokesman did not say if local opposition had played a role in the decision. Anti-gentrification activists said the move showed that ""protest works"". The Berlin campus would have been the firm's seventh after London, Tel Aviv, Seoul, Madrid, SÃ£o Paulo and Warsaw. Berlin tech flexes its muscles 'My daring granddad grabbed a bit of East Berlin' Fighting the far-right with techno In September activists occupied the building it was to be located in for several hours. They also put up stickers in the area with slogans such as ""Goodbye Google"" and ""Google is not a good neighbour"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some were against what they said were Google's ""evil"" practices, such as tax evasion and the unethical use of personal data. Others were fighting gentrification in the area, which they say is pricing local people out. The Knight Fox property consultancy said home prices in Berlin rose 20% between 2016 and 2017. In Kreuzberg prices rose 71% in the same period. The district has long been known for radical and underground culture.
