"The US released new images on Monday it says provide more evidence Iran was behind recent Gulf of Oman attacks The US military will send an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East as tensions build with Iran. Acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the deployment was in response to ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces. The US Navy also shared new images it says link Iran to attacks last week on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Washington has accused Iran of blowing holes in the vessels with mines. Iran has denied the allegations. Tensions were further fuelled on Monday whenIran said its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed levels set under the 2015 nuclear agreement. This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: US pressure on Iran has been ""very effective"" It recently stepped up production in response to the US tightening sanctions. The 2015 deal, from which the US has withdrawn, curbed Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said his country did not seek to wage war with any nation and had remained ""loyal"" to its international obligations. What we know about the tanker attacks Why would Iran attack tankers? Iran, the US and the Gulf: What now? Overnight three rockets hit a military base housing US troops north of Baghdad, the Iraqi military said.The US said it was ""indirect fire"",externaland did not cause injuries. No group said it had carried out the attack, though it followed US warnings of an increased threat to US interests in Iraq by Iranian-backed militias. Announcing the deployment, Mr Shanahan said the US did ""not seek conflict with Iran"" but the action had been taken to ""ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region to protect our national interests"". He said the military would continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments to troop levels accordingly. This video can not be played Security correspondent Frank Gardner looks at the evidence which the US says proves Iran's involvement in Thursday's attacks The 1,000 additional troops being despatched to the Middle East is presented as a prudent defensive measure by the Pentagon; the recent attacks on the two oil tankers being taken as a clear sign of Iran's hostile intent. They join some 1,500 additional troops sent last month. Taken together, these deployments inevitably raise tensions but they are clearly not in any sense an assault force. If direct conflict does break out between Washington and Tehran, it will most likely be a sporadic air and maritime battle, not a land campaign. But what worries Washington is attacks by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or Iran's proxies against US troops or facilities in the wider region - hence this latest deployment. The US defence secretary is again insisting that Washington does not want conflict with Tehran, but tensions remain high and any miscalculation could lead to a serious escalation. Shortly before the announcement, the Pentagon released new images including some purporting to show the remnants of an unexploded mine on the Japanese-owned oil tanker damaged in the attacks. The photos appear to show it being removed by members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Pentagon has already released grainy video said to show the same episode. Also seen in the latest images is apparent damage - a hole - above the waterline on the hull of the Kokuka Courageous. Your questions answered on tanker attacks US-Iran tensions explained Another image is said to show the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessel shortly after it was involved in removing the limpet mine. The other tanker damaged in the attacks was the Norwegian-owned Front Altair. The US has implicated Iran in the latest attacks and four others outside the Strait of Hormuz in May, allegations denied by Iran. China urged the US to lower the pressure and for Iran to stick to the nuclear deal, warning of a ""Pandora's box"" in the region. Russia - another party to the nuclear accord - also called for restraint, calling US actions ""truly provocative"". Saudi Arabia also blames Iran for the attacks on the two oil tankers, while the UK said it was ""almost certain"" Iran was behind the blasts. But EU foreign ministers meeting on Monday warned against jumping to conclusions and backed UN calls for an independent investigation. In 2015, Iran agreed to a landmark deal with world powers to curb its nuclear development. It agreed to limit the enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, and other measures in return for relief from sanctions. Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear accord last year and started to re-impose sanctions.

This video can not be played Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi says the enriched uranium limit will be breached on 27 June. Speaking on Iranian TV, President Rouhani said the international community could see that it was the US, not Iran, that was acting badly. ""Iran has been loyal to its signature,"" he said. ""Iran has been loyal to international agreements, and the one standing against us today [the US] is the one that has trampled all pacts, agreements and international accords."" Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation said earlier it was on course to exceed agreed limits on its low-enriched uranium stockpiles by 27 June. But Iran said there was ""still time"" for European countries to act by protecting Iran from reinstated US sanctions. Why would Iran attack tankers in the Gulf of Oman?

"Iran said last month that it would quadruple its production of low-enriched uranium Iran has announced it will breach on 27 June the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium that was set under a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Its atomic energy agency said it had quadrupled production of the material, which is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons. But it added there was ""still time"" for European countries to act by protecting Iran from reinstated US sanctions. The US, which pulled out of the deal, accused Iran of ""nuclear extortion"". ""This is a pattern of 40 years of behaviour, it's consistent with how the Iranian regime behaves,"" US state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. ""We would say to the international community that we should not yield to nuclear extortion by the Iranian regime."" This video can not be played Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi says the enriched uranium limit will be breached on 27 June. The UK, France and Germany have warned Iran not to violate the 2015 deal. They have previously said they will have no choice but to reimpose their own sanctions, which were lifted in return for limits on the Iranian nuclear programme. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know In a separate development, Iran said it had broken up a cyber spying network run by the CIA. It said several US spies had been arrested in different countries. The US did not immediately comment on the allegation. The latest developments come at a time of high tension in the Middle East, with the US accusing Iran of being behind suspected attacks that left two oil tankers ablaze in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday. Iran has denied any involvement. Context in international affairs is everything. In early May, Iran signalled its intention to break out from some of the constraints imposed by the nuclear deal. On Monday, it repeated that threat, adding that the rate of enrichment was being stepped up and that it expected to break the limit on the amount of low-enriched uranium it can hold before the end of this month. But since its first announcement, the context has changed dramatically with two sets of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf - both attributed by the US to Iran. Many fear that Washington and Tehran are on the verge of a military clash and that miscalculation could tip them over the edge. Iran's further threat today to increase its level of enrichment to a stage that would bring it much closer to ""weapons-grade"" material adds another element of risk into an already combustible mix. Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most fissile isotope, U-235. Under the nuclear deal, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium, which has a 3-4% concentration of U-235 and can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. ""Weapons-grade"" uranium is 90% enriched or more. Iran has complained that European powers have failed to abide by their commitments to mitigate the effects on its economy of the sanctions that US President Donald Trump reinstated after abandoning the nuclear deal last year. Mr Trump wants to force Iran to renegotiate the accord and agree to curb its ballistic missile programme and end its ""malign"" activities in the Middle East. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? In early May, the US stepped up pressure on Iran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. The move was intended to deny the Iranian government its principal source of revenue. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani subsequently announced that his country was scaling back its commitments under the nuclear deal. How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians This included no longer complying with caps on its stockpiles of low-enriched uranium and heavy water - set at 300kg (660lb) and 130 tonnes respectively - and halting sales of surplus supplies overseas. Mr Rouhani also gave the European powers 60 days to protect Iranian oil sales. If they failed, he said, Iran would suspend its restrictions on uranium enrichment and halt the redesign of its heavy-water reactor at Arak, whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb. On Monday, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran told a televised news conference at Arak that the ""countdown to pass the 300kg reserve of enriched uranium has started"". ""In 10 days' time... we will pass this limit,"" Behrouz Kamalvandi said. ""There is still time for the Europeans... But the Europeans have expressed indirectly their inability to act. They should not think that after 60 days, they will have another 60-day opportunity."" Iran has a heavy water reactor and heavy water plant at Arak The Europeans have set up a ""special purpose vehicle"" that would essentially allow goods to be bartered between Iranian and foreign companies without direct financial transactions. But the mechanism - known as Instex - is not yet operational. Mr Kamalvandi also said Iran might start enriching uranium up to 5% concentration so that it could provide fuel for its Bushehr power plant, or even up to the 20% concentration required for the Tehran research reactor. Experts say the technical leap required to get to 90% concentration from 20% is relatively straightforward, because it becomes easier at higher levels. Going from the natural state of 0.7% concentration to 20% takes 90% of the total energy required. Iran maintains that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. A spokesman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said her government had been ""clear about our concern at Iranian plans to reduce compliance"" with the deal. ""Should Iran cease meeting its nuclear commitments, we would then look at all options available to us,"" the spokesman added. The German foreign ministry urged Iran to abide by the deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was a staunch opponent of the nuclear deal, called for international sanctions to be reimposed immediately ""should Iran deliver on its current threats"". ""In any event, Israel will not allow Iran to get nuclear weaponry,"" he warned.

"The architects' visualisation of Heathrow's plan shows the M25 running under the new runway Heathrow Airport will construct a third runway by 2026 and complete its expansion by 2050, according to its ""masterplan"" published on Tuesday. The plan includes diverting rivers, moving roads and rerouting the M25 through a tunnel under the new runway. Heathrow's expansion has faced fierce opposition, but the airport says it has engaged with local communities and other stakeholders. The proposals are now open to public consultation until 13 September. The masterplan is illustrated in a visualisation from the architects, showing the M25 running in a tunnel underneath the new runway. It proposes a staggered approach with the new runway to be built in the first phase by 2026, with the rest of the airport infrastructure - including new terminals and access - to be complete by around 2050. 1990:The Runway Capacity study says expanding Heathrow would ""afford the greatest benefits"" 2003:Government paper on future of air transport recommends third runway at Heathrow 2007:Heathrow expansion plans published - include third runway and sixth terminal 2010:Conservative-Lib Dem coalition rules out new runways at London airports 2015:Airports Commission recommends third runway at Heathrow 2018:House of Commons votes in favour of runway plans 2019:Public consultation begins Local and environmental groups have argued that expanding Heathrow and building a third runway would mean unacceptable levels of noise and pollution, as well as adding to the UK's carbon emissions from the increased number of flights. In response to those criticisms, the plan also outlines a new low-emission zone for the airport, meaning additional charges for those who drive a more polluting vehicle to the airport. Activists cancel Heathrow drone disruption Campaigners lose Heathrow runway challenge Could aviation ever be less polluting? Heathrow says it is pursuing better public transport links and is proposing a longer respite at night, providing local communities with six-and-a-half undisturbed hours without a flight. ""We have been working with partners at the airport, in local communities and in government to ensure our plans show how we can grow sustainably and responsibly - with environmental considerations at the heart of expansion,"" said Emma Gilthorpe, Heathrow's executive director for expansion. The plan also gives details of the proposed compensation scheme for people whose houses will have to be demolished to make way for the expansion. In all, 761 homes are expected to go, including the entire village of Longford. Heathrow says it will pay the full market value plus 25% for properties in its compulsory purchase zone, as well as for some houses in the surrounding areas. Homeowners can find out whether they are eligible by checking their address onthe consultation website,external. Campaign groups opposed to the development reacted angrily. ""Heathrow's plans are laughable,"" said Robert Barnstone, campaign co-ordinator of Stop Heathrow Expansion. ""Not only does it want to disrupt people's lives for up to 30 years whilst building this new runway, but now proposes jumbo-size car parks whilst pledging to reduce the number of people using cars at the airport."" Another group, Hacan, echoed those sentiments. ""What hits you is the scale of these proposals,"" said John Stewart, who chairs the group. ""The impact on local people could be severe for many years to come.  Disruption from construction; the demolition of homes; the reality of more than 700 extra planes a day."" By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent In the past year, Heathrow's third runway has won the backing of Parliament and survived multiple challenges in the High Court. This blueprint for expansion is the fruit of that success and represents an important step towards the day when the bulldozers will start their work. And importantly, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister has indicated he won't lie down in front of them. Boris Johnson said exactly that just four years ago. He seems to have changed his mind. A three-month public consultation on these plans is the final step before the airport submits a planning application. Assuming all goes to plan, work will begin on the runway in early 2022. But Heathrow's blueprint on expansion stretches to 2050, well beyond the runway's planned opening in 2026. The airport also plans extensive work to terminals 2 and 5, as well as consolidating all existing car parks into one single site to the south of the airport and then building a new one to the north at a later date. Total private investment in the airport over the next two decades is forecast to be in the region of Â£30bn. This video can not be played Inside Heathrow's high-tech baggage hall The government agreed last year to back the scheme for expanding Heathrow. Last month, campaigners, backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, lost a High Court challenge against that decision. This week, environmental protest group, Extinction Rebellion, called off plans to disrupt operations at Heathrow to coincide with the announcement of its expansion plans. The public will be able to have their say on the plans via a website and at 43 ""consultation events"" during the 12-week period. The privately-funded expansion - to deliver the new runway - is expected to cost Â£14bn. Ms Gilthorpe said she hoped to ""have spades in the ground"" by early 2022.

"A report by MPs has urged the UK government to end the era of throwaway clothes and poor working conditions in the fashion supply chain. The MPs' proposals are designed to force the fashion industry to clean up its act. They made 18 recommendations covering environmental and labour practices and want the government to act. Not only is the fashion industry a source of emissions, but old clothes pile up in landfill. Fibres also flow into the sea when clothes are washed, polluting the marine environment. A government spokesperson said it was dealing with the impacts of fast fashion - and many measures were already in place. Among the proposals from the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) were: A 1p charge per garment on producers to fund better recycling of clothes; Ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold stock that can be reused or recycled instead; Mandatory environmental targets for fashion retailers with a turnover above Â£36 million; Tax changes to reward reuse, repair and recycling - to support responsible fashion companies. The EAC's chair, Labour MP Mary Creagh, said: ""Fashion producers should be forced to clear up the mountains of waste they create. Small changes you can make for a greener life Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say Call for '1p a garment' fast fashion charge Can we make fashion greener? Forever 21 'steals' anti-fast-fashion art ""The government is content to tolerate practices that trash the environment and exploit workers despite having just committed to net zero emission targets. ""It is out of step with the public who are shocked by the fact that we are sending 300,000 tonnes of clothes a year to incineration or landfill."" But ministers cite the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP), a voluntary agreement co-ordinated by the waste watchdog WRAP. This sets targets for the industry to reduce carbon emissions, water and waste. The government also maintains it's better to find outlets for waste textiles rather than simply imposing a landfill ban. A government spokesperson said: ""It simply isn't true to say we are not accepting the committee's recommendations. ""In our landmark Resources and Waste Strategy we will take forward measures including developing proposals and consulting on extended producer responsibility (EPR) and higher product standards for textiles. ""This would make producers responsible for the full cost of managing and disposing of their products after they're no longer useful."" Tolmeia Gregory blogs about ethical fashion under the name TollyDollyPosh. Tolmeia Gregory Go vintage:""Do things like shopping second-hand and vintage, going to your local charity shop. You can also buy on sites like eBay and Depop."" Buy less:""If you can, just not shopping at all is a really great way to do it. Embracing what you already own and what's already in your wardrobe. There's a great phrase you hear a lot: 'Loved clothes last'"". Look for eco-friendly materials:""Look out for more natural fibres - go for cotton over polyester. Not only do they feel a lot nicer when you wear them, but don't contain things like microfibres that go into our water and into marine life when we wash our clothes."" Learn to DIY:""It doesn't take much to learn how to hand-sew and stitch up a hole. Or if you have a pair of ripped jeans that are becoming a bit too ripped, you could always cut them and keep them as shorts."" Ministers say they're focusing on a tax on single-use plastic in packaging, rather than a tax on cheap fashion items. They point to Sweden's VAT reduction for repair services, which they say has made little impact. They say they will consider a levy on clothes alongside their plans for making firms in different sectors more responsible for their waste - but no decisions will be made on this until 2025.

"Lives are being lost and destroyed by the failure of the NHS in England to provide care for people with eating disorders, MPs and campaigners say. They say more than a million people have an eating disorder, but specialist help is often difficult to access. It leaves patients relying on GPs who lack the skills and training to help. The warnings have been made in two separate reports - by charity Beat and the cross-party Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. They acknowledged improvements had been made to children's services, but said adult care remained more problematic. Research by Beat showed some specialist services had waiting times of more than five months. Chief executive Andrew Radford said: ""This research should set alarm bells ringing. ""Eating disorders have among the highest mortality rates of any mental illness, yet people's chances of recovery are being subjected to a lottery, and lives are at risk."" Fears over Instagram eating disorder posts Why my bones are crumbling at 27 Hannah says there was no plan for her treatment when she was seriously ill Hannah, 30, from south London, developed bulimia in her early 20s. It got so bad that she had several suicide attempts. But her only treatment was one hour of group therapy a week - and she had to wait months before it started. ""It just wasn't enough,"" she said. ""I was so unwell I couldn't carry on. I couldn't see a way forward."" After being diagnosed with depression and bulimia, the treatment was still inadequate, Hannah said. ""It wasn't done in a meaningful way - there was no care plan."" She finally got the help she needed from a charity, but over the following three to four years she developed anorexia. This time, she went for private treatment because it was available more quickly. ""If I had accessed the right care back in my 20s, I might have been OK. ""The model is flawed. You are asking people to wait months for treatment when they are already sick walking through the door of their GP."" Estimates suggest more than one million people have an eating disorder, although campaigners believe the true figure could be even higher. Around three-quarters of them are female. There is a range of different conditions. Anorexia and bulimia - where bouts of over-eating are compensated by steps such as enforced vomiting or taking laxatives - account for around half of all cases. Many cases start during adolescence, but treatment can take years, so most patients need support during adulthood. Fewer than half of patients with anorexia and bulimia fully recover. Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. People with the condition have a five-fold increased risk of death which is linked to complications such as a weakened immune system and heart problems. GPs are often the first point of call for patients. But the committee warned they lack training, with some research suggesting doctors get little more than ""a couple of hours in medical school"". The committee was told that it resulted in doctors simply relying on body mass index (BMI) as an indicator of problems. It echoes the research carried out by Beat, with patients complaining they find it difficult to get help. GPs can refer on to specialist support provided by community mental health teams. This normally involves some form of talking therapy. But information provided under the Freedom of Information Act found a seven-fold variation in the numbers getting help across different services. Waiting times varied between two weeks and five-and-a-half months. And even when they are referred for help, significant numbers have to rely on the support of general community health teams because of a lack of specialist staff. While both reports looked at services in England, Beat said the rest of the UK had similar - if not worse - problems. The committee's report was a follow-up to a 2017 review by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman in 2017. It highlighted serious failings which contributed to the death of 19-year-old Averil Hart - who died after moving away from home to go to university - and two other young women. Averil Hart went to the University of East Anglia to study creative writing The committee said the findings of their review two years on showed there had been a lack of progress. But NHS England insisted it has been taking steps. The health service has been investing in services specifically for under-19s, with a new waiting time target due to come into force next year. It demands that 95% of those referred for help for an eating disorder should receive help within one week for urgent cases, and four weeks for non-urgent cases. Funding for mental health services generally is also being increased at a faster rate than the overall budget. Some Â£2.3bn of the extra Â£20bn available for the NHS in England by 2020, will go towards mental health. Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said more resources were needed to help doctors support patients with eating disorders.

"The inquest had heard no paramedics were sent to help Sebastien Belanger where he lay dying Emergency services bosses took ""too long"" to decide to send specialist teams to help victims of the London Bridge attack, an inquest has heard. Paramedics were kept away from the scene of the attack on 3 June 2017 after it was made a ""hot zone"" - unsafe for staff - the Old Bailey heard. It was not until three hours after the three attackers had been shot dead that medics entered a courtyard where five of the victims died. Eight people were killed in the attack. At the inquests into their deaths. Paul Woodrow, director of operations at London Ambulance Service (LAS), admitted the ""chaotic"" aftermath of the attack contributed to communication ""issues"". Police told medics to stay away from the courtyard area around the Boro Bistro restaurant due to reports of shots being fired nearby, the Old Bailey heard. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people in and around Borough Market. Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the coroner, said two groups of people had known there were victims in need of urgent treatment in the courtyard outside Boro Bistro. But neither group told people in the courtyard that ambulance staff had been instructed not to go there. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Mr Woodrow said the ""confusion"" after the attack ""hindered our ability, jointly, to get full situational awareness"". He said LAS was ""overflowing with information"" and had received 134 related 999 calls on top of 4,400 already received from other incidents on a ""busy Saturday"". Paramedics were being given information about various locations within a wide area, which some staff ""would not have an intimate knowledge of"", he said. ""In the very early stages of these incidents, they really are chaotic, and it's just a fact that we do not have an army of people there to filter the information,"" he added. He said co-ordinating conflicting information in a large incident was ""not a problem that is easily resolved... it's just not realistic to expect that we can get 100 to 150 people into an area in the first 10 minutes of an incident"". The court heard it was about three hours before medics entered the Boro Bistro courtyard, despite the knifemen being killed within 10 minutes of launching their attack. Gareth Patterson QC, representing the families of some of the victims, said the delay was inconsistent with the need to provide urgent medical care in the ""golden hour"" following injury. The inquest had previously heard medics were not told that SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, James McMullan and Alexandre Pigeardlay mortally wounded in the courtyard, while a police officer on the scene who had called for help was not told about ambulance resources awaiting casualties on Borough High Street. Mr Woodrow said: ""There was clearly a breakdown in communications at that stage."" Mr BÃ©langer, 36, Mr McMullan, 32, and Mr Pigeard, 26, were eventually brought to ambulances at a safe meeting point away from the market, but they were already dead. The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden The others killed in the attack were Xavier Thomas, 45, Chrissy Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, and Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39. Mr Woodrow said LAS could not send specialist ambulance intervention teams - made up of medics, firefighers and armed officers - into a ""hot zone"" without input from police and fire services. But he accepted it ""took too long to make a decision to commit"" to that strategy. Mr Patterson said there was no evidence of whether or not the courtyard was specifically designated as a ""hot zone"". Some volunteer medics were allowed to break the rules to enter the high-risk zone to treat patients, the inquest heard. ""I'm proud of my staff who put themselves in harm's way,"" Mr Woodrow said.

"Heads say inadequate funding for schools is adding to the pressure on teachers A one-off increase of Â£3.8bn would be needed to reverse 8% cuts in per pupil school spending, new analysis shows. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says a further Â£1.1bn would be needed each year up until 2023 to maintain spending in real terms, once rising costs were taken into account. Candidates for the Conservative leadership have been making competing promises on education spending. The government says funding for schools has been at its highest level ever. School budgets have moved up the political agenda, partly as a result of campaigning by parents and head teachers across England. IFS analysis says since 2009, spending has fallen by 8% per pupil once rising costs such as pay and pension contributions are taken into account. Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap Head teachers warn of action over cash crisis Schools facing 'financial cliff edge' ""It's the largest reduction in education spending for at least 30 or 40 years or longer, so it's not surprising it has generated political pressure,"" says their economist Luke Sibieta. In a new analysis published on Tuesday, the IFS says to reverse that real terms fall for 5 to 16-year-olds would take a one-off increase of Â£3.8bn. That includes all spending in schools, including that by local authorities, and is more than any candidate has promised so far. Jules White, the Sussex head teacher who has led the WorthLess campaign said: ""There is immense frustration that this bidding war has begun, when the government has been in absolute denial about the financial constraints."" To keep up with rising pupil numbers, the IFS says Â£1.1bn a year would be needed to avoid future real terms cuts. A similar 8% increase for 16 to 19-year-olds would cost around Â£480m as a one-off uplift. Sixth form and further education colleges have faced the sharpest squeeze in budgets in recent years. Head teachers have staged protest marches in Westminster But with some Conservative leadership contenders also suggesting tax cuts, it's not clear where the money would be found. Mr Sibieta says making education a priority would deepen the squeeze elsewhere, unless the government increased borrowing. ""The NHS has received a very generous settlement in advance of the spending review, but over four years other government departments are being asked to reduce spending by Â£2.5bn in total"". There is also a subtle rebuke for Boris Johnson from the IFS, after he described variation in funding per pupil in different parts of England as a ""postcode lottery"". A new funding formula for schools is being gradually introduced, based a combination of measures of need in different local authorities. The IFS said: ""With the introduction of this formula, the government - which Mr Johnson was part of - effectively ended a long-standing postcode lottery in school funding in England."" However, many in the lowest funded areas, which include many conservative heartlands in the counties and shires, remain disappointed that the formula will not lead to substantial increases for all. The government has argued that school spending in England is at its highest level ever in cash terms. A statement from the Department for Education added: ""We know schools face budgeting challenges, which is why we have introduced a wide range of support to help schools reduce costs and get the best value from their resources."" ""The Secretary of State has made clear that as we approach the next spending review, he will back head teachers to have the resources they need to deliver a world class education in the years ahead.""

"Samsung issued the safety advice to owners of its QLED-branded TVs Samsung has advised owners of its latest TVs to run regular virus scans. A how-to video on the Samsung Support USA Twitter account demonstrates the more than a dozen remote-control button presses required to access the sub-menu needed to activate the check. It suggested users should carry out the process ""every few weeks"" to ""prevent malicious software attacks"". The suggestion surprised cyber-security specialists, who said the public would be unlikely to go to the trouble. BBC News asked Samsung whether any specific threat had prompted the warning. The company responded that it had been ""posted for customers' education"". However, it also deleted the post at about the same time. The 19-second video guide had been watched more than 200,000 times. In a separate statement given to the BBC on 18 June, Samsung added: ""Samsung takes security very seriously and our products and services are designed with security in mind. ""Yesterday we shared information about one of the preventative security features on our Smart TVs, in order to show consumers proactive steps they can take on their device. ""We understand that this may have caused some confusion and we want to clarify that this was simply a way to inform and educate consumers about one of the features included in our products."" Samsung's recent smart TVs run off a version of its proprietary operating system, Tizen, and often come pre-loaded with McAfee's Security for TV anti-virus software. One security adviser had described the tweet as being ""pointless advice"" that would be a ""waste of time"" to follow. ""There is a tiny number of known malware that might attack a TV,"" said Ken Munro, of Pen Test Partners. ""I've seen one case of a ransomware infection but the prospect of it happening to most users is very small. ""A better solution would be for Samsung to automatically update its operating system for you."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another expert predicted that very few people if any were likely to follow the advice. ""Trying to place the burden on users like this won't work,"" said Scott Helme, of Security Headers. ""At the very least, Samsung should provide an on-screen prompt if this were really necessary."" The tweet had prompted some users to suggest the alert was a good reason to avoid connecting a television to the internet in the first place. Allow Twitter content?

"The inquest had heard no paramedics were sent to help Sebastien Belanger where he lay dying Emergency services bosses took ""too long"" to decide to send specialist teams to help victims of the London Bridge attack, an inquest has heard. Paramedics were kept away from the scene of the attack on 3 June 2017 after it was made a ""hot zone"" - unsafe for staff - the Old Bailey heard. It was not until three hours after the three attackers had been shot dead that medics entered a courtyard where five of the victims died. Eight people were killed in the attack. At the inquests into their deaths. Paul Woodrow, director of operations at London Ambulance Service (LAS), admitted the ""chaotic"" aftermath of the attack contributed to communication ""issues"". Police told medics to stay away from the courtyard area around the Boro Bistro restaurant due to reports of shots being fired nearby, the Old Bailey heard. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people in and around Borough Market. Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the coroner, said two groups of people had known there were victims in need of urgent treatment in the courtyard outside Boro Bistro. But neither group told people in the courtyard that ambulance staff had been instructed not to go there. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Mr Woodrow said the ""confusion"" after the attack ""hindered our ability, jointly, to get full situational awareness"". He said LAS was ""overflowing with information"" and had received 134 related 999 calls on top of 4,400 already received from other incidents on a ""busy Saturday"". Paramedics were being given information about various locations within a wide area, which some staff ""would not have an intimate knowledge of"", he said. ""In the very early stages of these incidents, they really are chaotic, and it's just a fact that we do not have an army of people there to filter the information,"" he added. He said co-ordinating conflicting information in a large incident was ""not a problem that is easily resolved... it's just not realistic to expect that we can get 100 to 150 people into an area in the first 10 minutes of an incident"".

"Patisserie Valerie was in such dire straits that managers had ordered puff pastry be made from margarine rather than butter as a cost-cutting measure, its new owners have revealed. Causeway Capital bought the chain after it fell into administration following the discovery of a multi million-pound hole in its accounts. They plan to invest in the remaining 96 shops and boost online sales. Causeway also plans to revamp the menu and provide new uniforms for staff. ""We will take every single recipe apart and put it back together,"" said Matt Scaife from Causeway. When his firm took over, there was ""underinvestment in the business,"" he said. ""A lot of things had been pulled out, investment in training and people, and most importantly the recipes."" Ex-Patisserie Valerie boss 'felt like emigrating' Patisserie Valerie says finance chief arrested Patisserie Valerie black hole grows to Â£94m But he was heartened by the approach of the staff. When his team took over he found ""quite a lot of optimism"". ""There's a huge amount of passion in the business."" The firm has a tool to customise cakes for special occasions which he hopes will help increase sales. Under its previous owners the business struggled to cope with competition in an industry which typically has thin profit margins. From 3 July, the firm will start to roll out new menus, a new logo and a new, blue uniform for staff. Mr Scaife hopes high-end confectionery will appeal to customers planning for special occasions. ""If you are meeting your mum you might take her somewhere more special and you might go to Patisserie Valerie,"" he said. His firm wants to avoid the mistakes of previous owners by investing to keep the chain exciting. That will mean continuously reinvesting so it can fulfil its potential, he suggests. ""Imagine you brought a patisserie business to Soho in 1926. It's the flapper jazz scene. Imagine how exciting that was,"" he says. ""Now imagine reinvesting 5% a year since 1926 rather than pulling money out of it.""

"The value of Iran's currency hit record lows as a result of the US sanctions The United States reinstated economic sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear deal in May 2018. Mr Trump says he wants to apply ""maximum pressure"" on the government in Tehran to compel it to renegotiate the accord. But Iran's leaders have remained defiant. The substantial impact the sanctions have had on the country is clear, and the economic hardship Iranians are facing helped trigger widespread protests in November 2019 that were brutally quashed by the authorities. Iran's economy was badly affected for several years by sanctions imposed by the international community over the country's nuclear programme. In 2015, President Hassan Rouhani agreed a deal with the US and five other world powers to limit Iranian nuclear activities in return for the lifting of those sanctions. The following year, after the deal was implemented, Iran's economy bounced back and GDP grew 12.3%, according to the Central Bank of Iran. But much of that growth was attributed to the oil and gas industry, and the recoveries of other sectors were not as significant as many Iranians had hoped. Growth fell back to 3.7% in 2017, helping to fuel the economic discontent that led to the biggest anti-government protests in Iran for almost a decade that December. The reinstatement of US sanctions in 2018 - particularly those imposed on the energy, shipping and financial sectors that November - caused foreign investment to dry up and hit oil exports. The sanctions bar US companies from trading with Iran, but also with foreign firms or countries that are dealing with Iran. This video can not be played Tehran's poorest hit by US sanctions In May 2019, Mr Trump ended exemptions from US secondary sanctions - such as exclusion from US markets - for major importers of Iranian oil and tightened restrictions on the Iranian banking sector. He said the decision was ""intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue"". As a result of the sanctions,Iran's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted an estimated 4.8% in the 2018 and is forecast to shrink another 9.5% in 2019,external, according to the International Monetary Fund. The unemployment rate meanwhile rose from 14.5% in 2018 to 16.8% in 2019. The IMF is forecasting zero growth in 2020, which would support Mr Rouhani's assertion in October that Iran has ridden out ""the storm"" caused by the sanctions. Has Iran's economy benefited from the nuclear deal? At the start of 2018, Iran's crude oil production reached 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), according to data gathered from secondary sources by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). The country was exporting about 2.3 million bpd. Most of the oil was bought by eight countries or territories that were granted six-month exemptions by the US when sanctions on the Iranian energy sector took effect - China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Greece and Italy. By March, Iran's oil exports had fallen to 1.1 million barrels per day on average A condition of the waivers was that the importers reduce their purchases of Iranian oil, and by April 2019 Iran's oil exports had fallen to 1 million bpd on average, according to Bloomberg. That reduced the government's revenue by billions of dollars. Two months later, President Trump decided to allow the exemptions to expire and declared that he ""intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero"". By October 2019, Iran's crude oil production had fallen to 2.1 million bpd on average, according to Opec's data. Bloomberg reported that only 260,000 bpd on average was being exported. However, analysts have said the figure may not reflect actual deliveries due to reported activities by Iran and its customers to conceal purchases or avoid tracking of tankers. Iranian tankers have been accused of flouting international rules by turning off their Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders. Iran is also said to frequently conduct ship-to-ship transfers to move oil and oil products. The plummeting oil sales have also led to a significant fall in Iran's foreign exchange earnings. The IMF estimates that Iran's reserves of foreign currency have been reduced to $86bn - 20% below their level in 2013. A senior US official, Brian Hook, said in December 2019 that he believedIran had access to only 10% of those reserves,externalbecause of restrictions on its financial sector, and that as a result it would struggle to prop up its currency and prevent inflation. Iran's government itself forecasts thatoil export revenues will be reduced by 70% in the next Iranian fiscal year,external. Is it about to get more expensive to fill my car? Currency traders were offering 143,000 rials to the US dollar at the end of April President Rouhani kept the Iranian currency stable for almost four years. But it has lost 50% of its value against the US dollar on the unofficial market since the US abandoned the nuclear deal, according to foreign exchange websites. The fixed official rate of 42,000 rials to the dollar is used for a limited range of transactions, so most Iranians rely on currency traders. Bonbast.com reported that traders were offering 13,650 rials to the dollar in early December 2019. The rial's slide has been attributed to Iran's economic problems and a high demand for foreign currency among ordinary Iranians who have seen the value of their savings eroded and their purchasing power cut sharply. The rial has regained some of its value since September 2018, when the Central Bank of Iran released more dollars into the market and authorities cracked down on currency dealers as prices reached a record low of 176,000 to the dollar. Iran's currency woes have also led to shortages of imported goods and products that are made with raw materials from abroad, most notably babies' nappies. What babies' nappies tell us about Iran's economic woes President Rouhani managed to get inflation down to 9% in 2017. But the IMF estimated that it soared to 30.5% in 2018 and projected that it would reach 35.7% in 2019. The World Bank has said that inflation in Iran has been especially high for food items,external, with meat products 116% more expensive year-on-year in April 2019, and that the rural population has been disproportionally affected. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained The Statistical Centre of Iran reported thatthe Consumer Price Index (CPI) 12-month rate of inflation for households stood at 42% in late October 2019,external. Food and beverage prices were up by 61% year-on-year and the price of tobacco was up by 80%. The price rises led to long queues at government-subsidised grocery shops, particularly for rationed meat. In an attempt to lower prices, the government banned livestock exports, flew in hundreds of thousands of cows and sheep from abroad. In November 2019, the government unexpectedly announced it was cutting petrol subsidies. It said the price of petrol would rise by 50% to 15,000 rials a litre ($0.12; Â£0.09 at the unofficial market exchange rate), and that drivers of private cars would be allowed to purchase only 60 litres each month before the price rose to 30,000 rials. Mr Rouhani said the $2.5bn in savings would allow the government to provide additional help to 18 million families. But the price rises caused widespread anger, and hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Iran. A crackdown by security forces left at least 208 people dead and thousands injured, according to Amnesty International. The government dismissed such figures as ""utter lies"".

"New signs featuring a picture of a hedgehog are to appear on UK roads to warn motorists of potential hazards caused by the spiny creatures and other small wildlife. They will be placed in areas with large numbers of animals such as hedgehogs, otters, squirrels and badgers. Current signs focus on smaller species such as toads, or deer and livestock. The Department for Transport says it hopes to help prevent accidents and reverse a decline in wildlife numbers. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling called on local authorities and animal welfare groups to identify accident and wildlife hotspots where the new signs should be located. Hedgehog numbers 'down by half' Recent estimates put the hedgehog population in England, Wales and Scotland at about one million, compared with 30 million in the 1950s. The DfT says its new sign is ""filling a gap"" between the existing signs carrying warnings about smaller animals such as migratory toads and wildfowl, and those highlighting larger animals. Jill Nelson, from the People's Trust for Endangered Species (PTES), says the signs were created after the charity and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS) discussed their concerns with Mr Grayling. ""We welcome this focus on road safety and protection for all small mammals,"" she said. Research by PTES and the BHPS in 2018,externalsuggested hedgehogs are disappearing more rapidly in the countryside, as hedgerows and field margins are lost to intensive farming, and the DfT says the sign is designed to reverse their decline ""in particular"". The DfT says that between 2005 and 2017,100 people were killed, and a further 14,173 injured in accidents in Britain where an animal, excluding horses, were in the road.

"This video can not be played Watson: I'll never leave the Labour Party Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has described another Brexit referendum as ""the least worst option"" and urged his party to throw its weight behind one. Speaking to the BBC, he said Labour should then fight for Remain, even though ""we might lose some votes"". Jeremy Corbyn has resisted calls to fully endorse another public vote, only calling for it in some circumstances. But Mr Watson said Labour would pay ""a very high electoral price"" if it did not have ""a clear position"" on Brexit. The nuanced position was blamed for Labour's performance at the European elections - it came third behind The Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats, with its share of the vote falling to 14%. Afterwards,several senior figures criticised a lack of clarity on Brexit, and last week, MPs expressed their frustration at a heated meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. The PLP is still split, though, with some MPs in Leave-supporting areas warning against backing a further public vote. The shadow cabinet was due to meet on Monday to discuss Brexit, but the meeting has been postponed. Labour still split over further referendum Corbyn in 'heated' meeting with MPs Scottish Labour backs Brexit referendum policy Mr Watson - who has repeatedly put pressure on Mr Corbyn to back a further referendum - told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg he believed it was now the only choice available. Theresa May's Brexit deal with the EU has been rejected by Parliament three times and the UK currently has until 31 October to come up with another way to leave. ""Sometimes in politics your choices are the least worst option,"" Mr Watson said. ""It is my honestly held view that Parliament will not be able to get a deal on Brexit and therefore the only choice, reluctantly, is to ask the people to take another look at it."" When asked if he would leave the Labour Party if things did not change, he replied, ""I'm never going to leave the Labour Party,"" but added ""sometimes I wonder whether the Labour Party is leaving me."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn spells out his party's ""very clear policy"" Earlier, in a speech to the Centre for European Reform, the deputy leader said Labour must be honest about the EU's strengths. ""Pro-European is who we are and who we have always been. Our members are Remain. Our values are Remain. Our hearts are Remain."" He told the BBC Labour ""might lost some votes if we change position"", but added: ""I think it's incumbent on us to give an honest account of ourselves and make the case for why we've changed our position."" Mr Watson is calling for a one-off meeting or ballot of members to be held to vote on a shift in policy - warning Labour could not afford to wait until its party conference in late September. But as he gave his speech, Labour chairman Ian Lavery - who is against another referendum - tweeted that ""ignoring Leave voters"" was not a sensible move. Allow Twitter content?

He said if Labour ""turned its back"" on voters in the North who voted Leave, ""then Tom Watson won't be deputy, Jeremy Corbyn won't be prime minister."" Labour MP Kerry McCarthy said she would commend Mr Watson for ""speaking out"", but shadow ministers needed to ""meet urgently for a proper discussion on Brexit"".

So many Labour members will be cheering him on!"" Laura Kuenssberg says plenty of Labour MPs are worried because they represent constituencies with Leave voters, but there is no question the balance in the party is on the other side. ""There are plenty of senior people - including those absolutely loyal to Jeremy Corbyn - who think it is time for the leadership to make a clearer statement arguing for another referendum and for Britain to stay in EU,"" she says. ""Some of those think it is vital to do before the summer and they predict we may end up with an election in the autumn with the Tories arguing for Leave and Labour arguing for Remain."" However, Mr Watson said all strands of opinion within the party are entitled to be heard. He also argued that the ""core"" EU values of internationalism, solidarity and freedom are also the values of Labour. ""Some people have begun to equate support for Europe with class identity - I don't think that's right or helpful,"" he said.

"Troubled construction and services firm Kier has said it will cut 1,200 jobs as it seeks to make cost savings of Â£55m a year by 2021. The cuts came as the firm's boss announced a plan to simplify Kier's business and reduce its debt. The company will sell its homebuilding business, Kier Living, and will shut or sell other interests, including its recycling and rubbish processing units. Kier will now focus on activities such as construction and road maintenance. Shares in the company have fallen by more than 85% in the past year, and they fell a further 11% on Monday to about 116p. ""These actions are focused on resetting the operational structure of Kier, simplifying the portfolio, and emphasising cash generation in order to structurally reduce debt,"" said chief executive Andrew Davies, who took over the role in April this year. ""By making these changes, we will reinforce the foundations from which our core activities can flourish in the future, to the benefit of all of our stakeholders."" The company's woes are having ramifications beyond the construction world. The share price fall has affected its largest investor, Woodford Investment Management, which had to suspend its flagship fund after some of its investments lost value and investors withdrew their cash. It has been a tough few years for outsourcing companies competing for government contracts. Early last year Carillion, which cooked school meals and maintained prisons, collapsed into administration. Many firms were found to be making low bids in order to gain contracts and booking revenues when the contracts were won, not when the money was actually paid. This meant that when firms missed targets as part of these contracts, and were paid less as a consequence, the companies reported heavy losses. Of the 1,200 jobs being lost at Kier, 650 of the posts are scheduled to be cut by the end of this month, while the remaining 550 jobs are expected to go next year. The company added that several potential suitors had already expressed an interest in its Kier Living business. Two weeks ago, shares in Kier tumbled more than 22% after the company issued a profit warning. At the time it said underlying profit would be about Â£25m below previous expectations. It blamed higher costs and problems at units in its road, utilities and housing maintenance businesses.

"Avril Forsythe signed up to the deal as she thought it sounded like a good idea A company thatAustralian media has described as operating an ""alleged scam"",externalhas close links to a business in Northern Ireland, the BBC has learned. Viewble Media Pty Ltd has been accused of leaving Australian businesses almost $31m AUS (Â£16.9m) in debt. A BBC investigation has discovered it has close links to a company in County Down. Viewble Media UK Ltd was operating across the UK from Groomsport. BBC News NI has been contacted by businesses from across Northern Ireland, Yorkshire and London that claim to have lost money through an advertising deal. As part of the deal, a shop owner buys a screen from Viewble at a cost of Â£299 a month for three years, paying a total sum of almost Â£11,000. A second associated company, the Shoppers Network UK Ltd, then rents the screen for advertising, paying the shop owner Â£299 a month for three years. As part of the deal, the shop would get its own advert shown on the screen, and get its ad shown in neighbouring businesses. It is referred to as a cost neutral deal. The shop owners, though, found that the payments from the second company stopped coming. And they did not realise that if anything went wrong, they would be stuck in the contract and would have to make repayments. The business owners had signed finance deals, which meant they would owe the Â£11,000, and the repayments from the advertising were not guaranteed. Avril Forsythe, who runs the Goldmine Jewellers in Omagh, thought it sounded like a good deal at first. ""It was like there is no risk in this,"" she said. ""Now we've found out that when there is a default in the payments, that we are still liable and that we can't get out of the contract."" Andrew Bustard, of Castlederg-based Top Gear Motors, had a screen installed in his car show room and is now also out of pocket. ""I think everyone knows when your heart sinks and you realise that you've signed up to something that is not what it's supposed to be or what you were promised,"" he said. Adam and Andrew Bustard from Top Gear Motors in Castlederg also had a screen installed Both business owners stopped getting repayments in December, but are contractually committed to paying what they owe for the next three years. BBC News NI found that Viewble Media UK Ltd has close links to the Australian business,which, according to The Sydney Morning Herald, has been involved in this ""alleged scam"".,external The Shoppers Network UK Ltd has some of the same company directors as Viewble and was supposed to make the repayments. But it went under, meaning the payments to rent the screens stopped. Australia's business ombudsman has launched an investigation after receiving more than 1,000 complaints about Viewble Media Pty Ltd and The Shoppers Network. It said it is thebiggest investigation it has ever dealt with.,external Australian authorities say both businesses are now in liquidation and this has had a direct impact on the UK business. Viewble Media Pty Ltd has been making headlines across Australia Once problems started in Australia, businesses in the UK also stopped getting their payments. David Reid, whom Australian media describes as a director of the business in Australia,,externalis also listed as a director of Viewble Media UK and The Shoppers Network in the UK. Ricci Aiken from Northern Ireland is also listed as one of the directors of the UK business. The BBC understands that Viewble Media UK is jointly owned by Mr Aiken, who has 25% of the shares, and an Australian firm, which owns the remaining 75% of shares. The BBC has also seen an advert for a job as the general manager of Viewble Media UK. Viewble Media offered businesses the opportunity to place a screen in their shop which would show adverts from other businesses The role was based in Bangor, with a salary of Â£50,000. The job advertisement indicated that the staff member would be expected to report directly to Viewble Media's chief executive in Australia. The company also employed freelance sales agents across the UK. According to Companies House, both firms are still active in the UK, but clients stopped receiving payments from The Shoppers Network at the end of last year. Mr Aiken told the BBC that the UK company has ceased trading, and that a new firm is taking on the clients. He said any issue with payments should be taken up with it. The Small Business Commissioner Paul Uppal has been speaking to authorities in Australia about Viewble Media Mr Aiken did not address concerns that the operation could be a scam or claims that the deals were mis-sold to businesses. David Reid said that a new media partner had been appointed in the UK and it has not had any complaints. He also added that the Australian business is in liquidation, and said any questions should be directed to the liquidator. Paul Uppal, the Small Business Commissioner, said his office has been working with authorities in Australia and has also been dealing directly with businesses. ""They've told us just how draconian the contracts are and that they've ended up being signed into and how they now feel that they are trapped because of the situation,"" he said. ""So we're seeing first-hand the real stress that this can cause for a small business. It's just not the financial impact but it's also the mental impact that can cause on a family business.""

"The Police Service of Northern Ireland is facing a Â£40m bill after losing a court challenge over holiday pay. Class action was brought by a group representing more than 3,700 police officers and civilian staff. The Court of Appeal in Belfast upheld a 2018 tribunal finding that they are owed money for a shortfall in holiday pay dating back 20 years. Miscalculations arose after holiday pay was based on basic pay and did not include overtime. The original tribunal made its decision in November 2018. At that stage, the bill was up to Â£30m. PSNI and Police Authority could face Â£30m holiday pay bill However, the figure could now be Â£40m after appeal court judges held that holiday pay should be calculated on the basis of actual annual working days. It is understood payments could be in the region of Â£10,000 on average per individual. BBC News NI's Home Affairs Correspondent Julian O'Neill said the PSNI had previously accepted ""3,700 personnel had been short changed"" after holiday pay was miscalculated in breach of European law. He said the appeal, brought by the PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton and the Police Authority, (now the Policing Board) had challenged the period of time settlements should cover. Our correspondent said the dismissal of the appeal meant ""what is owed must now be recalculated from as far back as 1998"". Chief Constable George Hamilton's appeal against a tribunal decision on holiday pay has been dismissed The appeal court judge said that the ""lead cases should now continue before the tribunal to a final determination"". PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George Clarke said the PSNI was now seeking further legal advice on the matter. ""This will include considering implications of the judgement and how the costs will be met,"" he said. The chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, Mark Lindsay, hailed the judgement as a ""major victory"". ""This more than justifies our decision to go to the Employment Tribunal as we believed there was something inherently unfair in the way officers were being denied what was rightfully their entitlement,"" he said. He added that the federation was now seeking ""a timely and final resolution"" but warned that it could take a long time due to the number of claims involved. Solicitor John McShane, who represents the officers and civilian workers, described the result as ""significant"". He said the claim was not for compensation but was ""a claim to actually get paid what they are properly entitled to be paid"". He said they would now begin negotiations with the chief constable to ""bring a financial conclusion to the matter"".

"Channel 4 set up an empty podium for Boris Johnson, who declined to take part in the debate Contenders to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader have clashed over delivering Brexit during a TV debate. The MPs argued over whether a new deal could be renegotiated with the EU, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson came under fire for not taking part in the Channel 4 debate but defended his stance, suggesting it would ""be slightly cacophonous"". His leadership bid has been backed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who dropped out of the race on Friday. Some of the sharpest exchanges came over whether Parliament should be shut down - prorogued - in order to push through a no-deal Brexit by 31 October - something four of the five candidates argued against. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but EU leaders agreed to delay the date to October after MPs repeatedly rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Brexit: What happens next? What is Theresa May's withdrawal agreement? How to answer: 'What's your biggest weakness?' International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said proroguing Parliament was a ""deeply disturbing"" option and Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned ""you don't deliver democracy by trashing our democracy"". However ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab refused to rule it out, saying ""every time one of these candidates take an option awayâ¦ we weaken our chances of getting the best deal."" Channel 4's debate attracted an audience of 1.3 million and 7.8% of the audience share. The programme was up against Soccer Aid on ITV, Countryfile on BBC One and Top Gear on BBC Two. Analysisby BBC political correspondent Ben Wright No stand-out winner and a debate that won't trouble the absent front-runner Boris Johnson. His team thought there was nothing to be gained from pitching up for this blue-on-blue skirmish which was mostly good natured but repeatedly raised questions the candidates struggled to answer. How can the next prime minister renegotiate a deal with the EU? How can it be done by October? How could the UK leave without a deal if MPs refuse? At one end of the debate, Dominic Raab was rounded on for saying he would be prepared to try and suspend parliament if it was the only way to get the UK out without a deal at the end of October. In the opposite corner, Rory Stewart was the only one who said a renegotiation with the EU in the next four months was a fantasy promise. At some point this week one of the five will break out and become the challenger to Boris Johnson for the ballot of Tory members. The candidates at the debate before a studio audience in east London also argued over whether a no-deal Brexit should be considered. Mr Javid said no deal was the ""last thing"" he wanted, but added: ""You do plan for no deal precisely because you want a deal."" Mr Raab said Britain would be able to ""manage those risks"" associated with leaving the EU without a deal. However, Mr Stewart said ""I think a no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense,"" adding ""it would be deeply damaging for our economy."" The candidates were united in condemnation of the Labour leader with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt accusing Jeremy Corbyn of being ""against aspiration"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove argued that he was the candidate Mr Corbyn would be most scared of facing at Prime Minister's Questions.

The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister Mr Johnson, the front-runner in the leadership race, was represented at the debate by an empty lectern. And Mr Hunt attacked his failure to appear. ""Where's Boris?"" he asked, adding ""if his team won't allow him out with five fairly friendly colleagues, how is he going to deal with 27 European countries?"" Mr Stewart also made a pointed dig at his absent colleague, saying he hoped ""one of us"" - referring to the MPs who had attended the debate - becomes prime minister. Do Boris Johnson's claims about his time as London mayor add up? Speaking to Radio 4's World at One on Friday, Mr Johnson said he was ""pretty bewildered"" by claims he was dodging scrutiny and said the public had had ""quite a lot of blue-on-blue action, frankly, over the last three years"". He said the best time to take part was on Tuesday after the second ballot and would be at the BBC debate on Tuesday, hosted by Emily Maitlis. This video can not be played Michael Gove tells Today says he'll be a ""unifying figure"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who withdrew from the leadership race after the first ballot - has backed Mr Johnson ""as the best candidate to unite the Conservative Party"" as has Esther McVey,who was eliminated in the first round. Writing inthe Times,external, Mr Hancock said Mr Johnson had a ""unique personality"", adding: ""I have confidence Boris will be a One Nation prime minister because that's how he ran London - consistently - for eight years."" Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today he was ""naturally disappointed"" that Mr Hancock had chosen to endorse his rival rather than himself. While Mr Johnson remained the frontrunner, Mr Gove said ""we need to make sure he is tested"" and he believed he could make it to the final two as a ""strong alternative"" who was equipped to ""be prime minister from day one"". The TV debate also saw politicians being asked about their priorities apart from Brexit. Mr Javid chose funding education and further education colleges, saying: ""We have cut back too much in that space."" Mr Raab said he wanted to improve state schools and offer more choices for young apprenticeships, while Mr Gove said children would be his top priority and emphasised the importance of protecting the environment for the future. Mr Hunt told the audience ""every Conservative has two desires: cut taxes and spend more on public services."" He also said he would focus on literacy and the social care system. Mr Stewart said his central priority would be fixing adult social care, describing the issue as ""the great unfinished revolution"". Asked about their weaknesses, Mr Gove said he was impatient, while Mr Raab said he was ""a restless soul"" who ""always wanted to make things better"". Mr Javid admitted to being stubborn while Mr Stewart said there were ""many things he didn't know about the world"". However, he added that ""we need leaders who listen"" and criticised ""macho posturing"". Mr Hunt joked that his biggest weakness was""getting my wife's nationality wrong""- but on a more serious note, said inhis battle with junior doctorsas health secretary, he could have been ""better at communicating"" what he was trying to do. The candidates will now go on to take part in further ballots until only two remain. The final pair will be put to a vote of the 160,000 members of the Conservative Party from 22 June. The winner is expected to be announced about four weeks later. Can Johnson deliver Brexit in 99 days?

"This video can not be played Businesses in Buenos Aires were affected by a nationwide power cut in 2019 Argentina is investigating what caused a massive power cut that hit nearly 50 million people. President Mauricio Macri called the outage ""unprecedented"", promising a thorough inquiry. Almost all of Argentina, neighbouring Uruguay and some areas of Paraguay woke up to darkness on Sunday. The disruption hit public transport while hospitals were forced to run on generators. Power had largely been restored by the end of the day. Argentine officials said it began with a failure in the country's ""interconnection system"" but that the exact cause was unknown. Energy Minister Gustavo Lopetegui said it was unlikely that a cyber-attack was responsible, and that it would take 10-15 days for the results of the investigation to be published. Despite the massive outage he said the country's electrical network was ""very robust"". The power cut hit almost all of Argentina's 44 million population, with just one province not connected to the main system spared. Uruguay's 3.4 million inhabitants were also affected. The two countries share a power grid. Local elections still took place as scheduled in Argentina, with local media showing voters using their mobile phones for torches. The blackout came during provincial elections in Argentina Transport was halted People, like this woman in Montevideo, Uruguay, were forced to use candles Restaurants that expected to be full for Father's Day instead remained closed. Residents posted pictures of dark towns and cities and long lines of cars queuing at petrol stations. ""Everything came to a halt. Elevators, water pumps, everything. We were left adrift,"" Juan Borges, who lives in Buenos Aires, told the BBC. ""There are some elderly people on the eighth floor but nothing happened, because the power cut was short. If it had gone on for longer it would have been a whole different story."" he said. A similar blackout hit Brazil in 2009, with a massive blackout leaving about 60 million without power.

"This video can not be played Watson: I'll never leave the Labour Party Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has described another Brexit referendum as ""the least worst option"" and urged his party to throw its weight behind one. Speaking to the BBC, he said Labour should then fight for Remain, even though ""we might lose some votes"". Jeremy Corbyn has resisted calls to fully endorse another public vote, only calling for it in some circumstances. But Mr Watson said Labour would pay ""a very high electoral price"" if it did not have ""a clear position"" on Brexit. The nuanced position was blamed for Labour's performance at the European elections - it came third behind The Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats, with its share of the vote falling to 14%. Afterwards,several senior figures criticised a lack of clarity on Brexit, and last week, MPs expressed their frustration at a heated meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. The PLP is still split, though, with some MPs in Leave-supporting areas warning against backing a further public vote. The shadow cabinet was due to meet on Monday to discuss Brexit, but the meeting has been postponed.

""Sometimes in politics your choices are the least worst option,"" Mr Watson said. ""It is my honestly held view that Parliament will not be able to get a deal on Brexit and therefore the only choice, reluctantly, is to ask the people to take another look at it.""

Mr Watson is calling for a one-off meeting or ballot of members to be held to vote on a shift in policy - warning Labour could not afford to wait until its party conference in late September.

"This video can not be played ""Carrie Lam must step down"" - Joshua Wong Hong Kong's most prominent student activist, Joshua Wong, has called for the resignation of leader Carrie Lam, after walking free from prison. Wong, 22, became the face of the 2014 pro-democracy protests which called for the city to pick its own leaders. People in Hong Kong are again out on the streets, this time against a controversial bill which would allow extradition to mainland China. China has said it will continue to support Ms Lam. Organisers say more than two million people rallied against the extradition bill on Sunday, despite it being suspended. Police put the figure at 338,000. This video can not be played Protests returned to Hong Kong streets following the suspension of the extradition bill Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Much of the public anger has been directed at Ms Lam, who is pro-Beijing, and on Sunday she apologised for the controversy over the bill. Demonstrators are pushing for the bill to be scrapped completely, for those jailed during the protests to be freed and for the resignation of Ms Lam. Hundreds gathered on Monday near the government's offices. How radical youth forced the government's hand Chinaâs history of extraordinary rendition 'Shield Girl': The face of Hong Kong's protests Wong left prison after being jailed in May on contempt charges related to his involvement in the pro-democracy protests known as the Umbrella Movement. Speaking to the BBC, he said he was ready to ""join the fight"" against the extradition bill, and called for Ms Lam to step aside. ""It's time for her to end her political career,"" he said, saying she had ""allowed police to hold a gun to the citizens of Hong Kong"". ""It's hard for us to accept that Carrie Lam, the leader of Hong Kong, copy the model of the Tiananmen Square massacre to such a modern global financial centre,"" he added, referring toChina's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts Young and unhappy in Hong Kong Wong and other student activists led the protests which saw thousands of people camp in the central business district for 79 days, bringing the city to a standstill. The Umbrella Movement paralysed parts of the city in 2014 The student activists were later convicted of unlawful assembly and jailed over an incident that helped trigger the mass protests. Four other pro-democracy activists, including university professors and a Baptist minister, also received sentences for their part in the protests. Protesters fear the extradition bill could bring Hong Kong more decisively under China's control. If the protest organisers are right about the turnout on Sunday, it would be the largest protest in Hong Kong's history. All you need to know about the protests The scale of the march in pictures Will the bill damage Hong Kong's star status? The demonstration was mainly peaceful, with police officers reportedly holding back to allow the throngs of people to slowly pass through the city. This is in contrast with scenes at the last major demonstration on Wednesday, which saw clashes between protesters and police that injured dozens. Police have been accused of using excessive force against protesters Defending the bill, Hong Kong officials said local courts would have the final say as to whether to grant extradition requests. Ms Lam's government also said suspects accused of political, religious and certain types of commercial crimes would not be extradited. Hong Kong has been part of China since 1997 under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which allows it freedoms not seen on mainland China. By Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring For the first time on Monday, one English-language newspaper in mainland China has acknowledged that the week-long Hong Kong protests have been taking place. However, the China Daily newspaper insists that the protests were small-scale,external, and were specifically against the US ""interfering in Hong Kong affairs"". The Beijing government is extremely sensitive about any protests, whether they are by two people or two million people, as it sees activism over laws that the Communist Party supports as examples of dissent. Consequently, state media in Chinese language have avoided mentioning them altogether, and have only reported on the suspension of the bill, and the Communist Party's dissatisfaction with it. Since last Sunday, government censors have ramped up online censorship of terms related to the protests, and continue to ban any pictures of protesters on the street outright. Posts on the popular Sina Weibo microblog mentioning ""Hong Kong"" or ""the Hong Kong government"" have been consistently censored. And users of the popular WhatsApp-like WeChat have reported that pictures they shared of the protests have been actively taken down.

""We need to be clear where Labour stands, and if [the] shadow cabinet can't agree, put it to the members,"" Ms McCarthyposted on Twitter,external.

Another MP, Siobhain McDonagh,tweeted:,external""I have had my differences with Tom Watson over the years but this video is brilliant and his argument is bang on! So many Labour members will be cheering him on!"" Laura Kuenssberg says plenty of Labour MPs are worried because they represent constituencies with Leave voters, but there is no question the balance in the party is on the other side. ""There are plenty of senior people - including those absolutely loyal to Jeremy Corbyn - who think it is time for the leadership to make a clearer statement arguing for another referendum and for Britain to stay in EU,"" she says. ""Some of those think it is vital to do before the summer and they predict we may end up with an election in the autumn with the Tories arguing for Leave and Labour arguing for Remain."" However, Mr Watson said all strands of opinion within the party are entitled to be heard. He also argued that the ""core"" EU values of internationalism, solidarity and freedom are also the values of Labour. ""Some people have begun to equate support for Europe with class identity - I don't think that's right or helpful,"" he said.

"The RMT will resume strike action after suspending it in February Rail commuters on some of the country's busiest routes are facing disruption due to a planned five-day strike over the future of train guards. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) plan to walk out on Tuesday over South Western Railway's ""failure"" to rule out it would move to a driver-controlled operation. London commuters and racegoers at Royal Ascot have been advised to check details of trains online. SWR called the strikes ""unnecessary"". It said while services may be disrupted by the strike, there will still be trains running, and advised commuters to plan in advance and check departure times on its website. Planned industrial action wassuspended in Februaryas a resolution seemed in sight, with the RMT claiming SWR had pledged ""each passenger train shall operate with a guard with safety critical competencies"". But RMT said SWR had now ""rowed back"" on its public pledges as it refused to rule out future driver controlled operations - which would see the role of the guard ""carved up completely"". RMT general secretary Mick Cash said members were ""angry and frustrated"" as they had suspended action in ""good faith"" only for SWR to ""fail to bolt down an agreement that matches up to our expectations on the guard guarantee"". He also criticised SWR's ""insistence"" that future schemes would be ""governed"" by the protection of company profits rather than that of ""the travelling public"". A SWR spokesman said it was ""very disappointing"" the union had decided to call the strike despite dates being set for more talks. ""Clearly, they have decided to target popular events such as Royal Ascot with this cynical action which is driven by internal RMT politics,"" the spokesman said. The company said it met with union representatives last week to fix new dates for talks but the unions were ""insistent on going ahead with their unnecessary strike"". It said it had matched RMT's request to keep a guard on each train and wanted to move on to discuss how to make the most of new technology on board. The spokesman said the company ""remains committed to finding a solution"". Passengers heading to Twickenham, Hampton Court and Royal Ascot, have been advised to allow extra time for their travel. The Royal Ascot event runs for five days from Tuesday. How will you be impacted by the strikes? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Violent offenders are being handed informal punishments by the police, despite guidance restricting their use to low-level offences. Offences including burglary, sexual assault, violence and arson have led police to issue community resolutions, which do not involve going to court. Critics said the orders were being used ""contrary to their original purpose"". The National Police Chiefs' Council said community resolutions should not be used in the most serious cases. About 112,000 offenders have been dealt with through community resolution orders each year since 2014, the BBC's Shared Data Unit found. The orders represent about 3% of all crime outcomes, but there has been a slight decline in their use over that period. From 2014 to 2018, they were issued for: Some 2,500 sex offences including 27 rapes (Police forces said these disposals could relate to sexual activity between children including sexting) Some 5,000 for possession of weapons, including knives and guns Some 156,000 for violent offences against the person including 1,720 for cruelty to children Some 151,000 for theft offences including 3,555 for burglaries and 309 for aggravated vehicle taking Ben Matthews, 18, was the victim of an attack County Durham studentBen Matthews, 18, was attacked by a prison guard. When the offence was committed, the attacker could have received a community resolution if he completed Durham Constabulary's Checkpoint scheme. Since a legal change in April, the case will now be classed as a deferred prosecution, which also does not involve the attacker going to court. Ben's mother, Jo Law, said: ""We're petrified he'll walk away without a record. Legal aid advice network 'decimated' by funding cuts Neighbourhood police: One in seven officers axed were beat bobbies ""I would have liked him to go to court, for Ben's sake, and to show that they're taking it seriously. ""People who commit violent offences shouldn't be put on to such schemes, police don't realise the impact it's having on victims. ""I could have been going to Ben's funeral - I can't stop that going through my mind."" Commonly issued for minor offences, a community resolution can involve restorative justice techniques, such as the offender apologising to the victim, paying compensation or repairing any damage caused. Unlike a caution, a community resolution does not lead to a criminal record. Under guidance, offenders should admit to the crime, while victims should agree before a community resolution is issued, though officers can use the disposal without consent with supervisor authorisation. Chris Henley QC, who chairs the Criminal Bar Association, said: ""What is clear from the figures is that contrary to their original purpose and the very clear guidance given to the police, community resolutions are being used to deal with more and more serious offences. This shouldn't be happening. ""These cases should be resolved formally in a courtroom. ""It is unsurprising that offenders arrested for serious crime leap at the offer of an informal community resolution order."" Magistrates' Association chair John Bache JP said serious offences should be resolved in court. ""While we are aware there may be specific reasons why a community resolution was appropriate in some of the cases identified, the public must have confidence that serious offences are taken seriously - especially where there is an identifiable victim."" A spokesman for Victim Support said the orders were effective in dealing with low-level offences, but ""wholly inappropriate"" for more serious crimes. Chief Constable Jo Farrell said her force puts victims first Among the forces who provided context, Derbyshire Constabulary said seven incidents of child sexual exploitation concerned sexting between children. Essex Police linked high use for weapons possession to a Stansted Airport operation targeting people entering the UK carrying banned items that may be legal elsewhere. West Midlands Police, which issued six for rape of victims under-16, said disposals for sex offences could relate to activity between children, adding that they were only used with consent from victims or their parents. Durham Constabulary Chief Constable Jo Farrell said quality assurance methods were used to ""ensure that at all times, we have done the right thing for the victim"". National Police Chiefs' Council deputy chief constable Sara Glen said ""community resolutions helped police handle low-level offending proportionately...[and] should not be used in the most serious cases"". She said ""victims' wishes were central"" to decision-making which would also be examined further by force scrutiny panels. ""We anticipate that the number of community resolutions used for indictable offences will further decrease...community resolutions for these few cases must be authorised by an officer of a rank not lower than Inspector and we conduct thematic reviews to ensure compliance,"" she said. Michael Fisher with former Durham Constabulary Chief Constable Mike Barton In 2015, a government report saidout-of-court disposals,externalhad been inappropriately issued in up to 30% of cases. But the report said the measures were effective if they allowed police to make ""simple, swift and proportionate responses"" to less serious crimes. Teesside Cannabis Club founder Michael Fisher said community resolutions made sense for possession of cannabis for personal use. He said: ""They're good for under-25s who could otherwise carry around decisions made while young for the rest of their lives."" In Scotland, police have used similar disposals for more than 41,000 offences since 2015. Recorded Police Warnings were primarily issued for minor incidents such as urinating or drinking alcohol in public but 13,330 were disposals categorised as ""other"". Supt Barry Blair, from Police Scotland, said they allowed officers to use discretion when dealing with minor offending and aimed to minimise police bureaucracy while maximising an officer's time on the street. Police in Northern Ireland underwent training after community resolutions were issued against guidance for weapons possession. Between 2015 and 2018, use of the disposal for the offence dropped from 6.4% to 0.7% after officers received ""robust governance"" and education. Growing in use, the disposals make up 5% of all crime outcomes recorded since 2015-16 in Northern Ireland.
