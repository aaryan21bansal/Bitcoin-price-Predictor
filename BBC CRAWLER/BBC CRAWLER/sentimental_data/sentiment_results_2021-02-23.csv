"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland's economy will begin to reopen from the end of April The reopening of Scotland's economy - including shops, bars, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers - is expected to start from 26 April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. She said it was hoped that the country's stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April. Four people from two households will be allowed to meet outdoors from 15 March. All primary pupils and S4 to S6 secondary students could return to school from that date. However, pupils in the first three years of secondary school are unlikely to return until after the Easter holidays. Ms Sturgeon saidthe Scottish government's strategic framework,externalwas ""deliberately cautious"" at this stage. What Covid rules are changing, and when? Live coverage of the first minister's statement Douglas Fraser: A route map to the starting point ""But in the coming weeks, if the data allows and positive trends continue, we will seek to accelerate the easing of restrictions,"" she said. However, opposition parties said the statement ""fell short"" of expectations and lacked clarity on its ""ultimate goal"", while business leaders called for more detail. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced thatshops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality in England could reopenon 12 April. Under a four-step plan to ease lockdown south of the border, all legal limits on social contact could be lifted by 21 June if strict conditions are met. Ms Sturgeon said the aim in Scotland was to move fully back to a levels system of restrictions from the last week in April. ""At that stage, we hope that all parts of the country currently in level four will be able to move out of level four and back initially to level three - possibly with some revision to the content of the levels."" The first minister said that from 26 April, the government would expect to see a ""phased but significant re-opening of the economy, including non essential retail, hospitality and services like gyms and hairdressers"". More detail will be set out in mid-March, including the order in which parts of the economy will reopen. The aim is for a ""progressive easing"" of the level four restrictions at three-week intervals. Scotland's youngest children and some senior pupils returned to the classroom on Monday, and Ms Sturgeon said schools were the ""immediate priority"". It is hoped that the next phase will see the remaining primary school pupils return from 15 March, with more senior pupils back in the classroom ""for at least part of their learning"". Deputy First Minister John Swinney told Radio Scotland's Drivetime show that this would not just be senior pupils studying for qualifications, and that he wanted to see all S4 to S6 pupils ""back into the school system"" on this date if the data allows. The rules on outdoor mixing would also be relaxed on that date, with up to four people from two households allowed to meet, and non-contact sports for under-18s resuming. The youngest pupils returned to school this week The final phase of the return to school would take place from 5 April, a date when school pupils will be at the start or middle of their Easter holiday break. It is also hoped to lift the stay at home restrictions from that date. At least six people from two households should be able to meet together outdoors, and communal worship will be allowed to resume. The timing of major religious festivals - such as Easter - will be taken into account when deciding the exact date. The levels system of restrictions would then be reintroduced from 26 April, along with a ""more substantial"" reopening of society and the economy. ""It is important to stress, of course, that all of this depends on us continuing to suppress the virus now - and continuing to accept some trade-offs for a period, for example on international travel,"" said Ms Sturgeon. ""However, if we do so, I am optimistic that we can make good progress in returning more normality to our lives and the economy."" Analysis by Lucy Whyte, BBC Scotland education correspondent Scotland may have been among the first of the four nations to get any pupils in class, but it looks like it could be one of the last to have all pupils back to in-person learning. This plan could see more children, especially primary pupils, allowed back in the classroom by 15 March, a week after England. But the full return of Scotland's schools might not happen until a month later. The decision to stick with a phased approach will be welcomed by teaching unions, who will also be glad to see the inclusion of blended learning initially for senior pupils. The 5 April date for the potential full return to class is at the start of the Easter holidays for most, so really we are talking about the middle of that month before everyone is back. Will the first minister go faster? She has made clear that she will if she can, and there is a precedent when she accelerated the full return to school in August last year. On that occasion she could demonstrate that numbers were on her side. The Scottish Conservatives' Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, said the statement ""fell short of public expectations"". ""We didn't get information about when measures like social distancing will end and when we will be able to do something as basic as give a loved one a hug,"" she said. ""Everyone understands that we might not be able to give people absolute certainty - but they were at least expecting the first minister to give them some kind of hope. ""Nothing has been published about what happens after 26 April. This isn't a route map out of Covid, it is holding document."" Ms Sturgeon said dates became ""more arbitrary"" the further you looked into the future. ""It is like putting your finger in the wind and coming up with a date that is not firmly based in the evidence,"" she said. Scottish Labour's interim leader, Jackie Baillie, said the statement lacked clarity on its ""ultimate goal"". She also called for a revised testing strategy which includes mass community testing where appropriate. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie voiced concern that vaccine passports were ""slowly gaining traction"" and said: ""We don't want a two tier society which would exacerbate inequalities."" Scottish Green Party co-leader Patrick Harvie also raised fears that vaccine passports could make social inequality worse. Tracy Black, director of CBI Scotland, said many Scottish businesses would be ""left feeling deflated"" as there was still ""considerable uncertainty"" about how and when they could reopen their doors. She said businesses recognised it was right to take a cautious approach, but ""will have been looking for more detail than the partial timetable that has been provided"". Liz Cameron, the chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said: ""It is important that Scotland remains as closely in step with the four nations as is possible. ""A competitive disadvantage to business communities elsewhere in the UK will only add insult to the injury already caused by the pandemic.""

"Oatly, the plant-based milk company started in Sweden, is planning a stock exchange listing in the United States. The move comes as the firm has been pushing to expand, amid the booming popularity of alternative milks. Last year, it raised $200m (Â£160m), drawing investment from celebrities including Jay-Z, Oprah Winfrey and Natalie Portman. The firm, which is sold in more than 20 countries, did not say how much money it hoped to raise in the listing. But over the last 12 months, investors have shown strong appetite for shares of companies making their publicly-traded debuts. Market valuations for firms such as Airbnb, dating app Bumble and food delivery platform Doordash have soared. Oatly, an early oat milk pioneer, is said to be seeking a value of as much as $10bn, compared to the $2bn value suggested by July's investment round. Founded in the 1990s, previous investors include the state-owned China Resources and Verlinvest, a Belgium-based investment firm.

Oatly, which reported more than $200m in sales in 2019, has cast itself as a champion of plant-based milks, which it says are better for the planet.

"Tech giants Google and Facebook have too great a share of the UK online advertising market, the boss of the UK's competition watchdog has said. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would like regulatory changes to deal with that market dominance, its boss Andrea Coscelli told the BBC. Google and Facebook have faced criticism from competition and other regulators in the past. Facebook said it faces ""significant competition"" online from rival firms. Google has also been approached for comment by the BBC. When questioned by the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan, Mr Coscelli said that the two tech giants have a ""duopoly"" in the UK when it comes to digital advertising, which can often be bad for competition. Google and Facebook have about an 80% share of the UK's Â£14bn digital advertising market, which is ""not an ideal situation"", Mr Coscelli said. ""We think it would be good if we got to a situation where others had a bigger share of the market,"" he said. He also described the fact that Google holds about 90% of the UK's Â£7.3bn search advertising market as a ""problem"". Facebook currently has a more than 50% share of the Â£5.5bn display advertising market in the UK, which is too much, Mr Coscelli said. This video can not be played The Competition and Markets Authority would like regulatory changes to deal with the 'imbalance of power' ""When companies have too much economic power, that creates a number of distortions, first for competitors, secondly for consumers, and at some level potentially in terms of the political process as well, in some cases,"" he said. ""We, in general terms, like to see markets more competitive, with more players, with more diversity of players, because we think that delivers better outcomes."" A Facebook spokesman said its platform ""gives millions of people and businesses in the UK the opportunity to connect and share."" He added: ""Advertisers can and do freely move their [advertising] spending between TV, radio, print, outdoor and online. ""And in online advertising itself, we face significant competition from the likes of Google, Apple, Snap, Twitter and Amazon, as well as new entrants like TikTok, which keeps us on our toes."" Mr Coscelli stopped short of saying that Facebook and Google should be broken up. ""Our current proposal is not to break them up, it's to have pro-competitive regulation to deal with some of the issues, but it would allow the companies to maintain all the current activities that they have,"" he said. The CMA said in December it plans to issue Facebook, Google and the other tech giants a set of rules customised to each firm to rein in ""anti-competitive behaviour"" and give consumers ""more control over how their data used"". It is set to create a Digital Markets Unit within itself to draw up the rules and govern compliance, although legislation is required which may not be introduced until 2022. Competition and Markets Authority plans tailored rules for tech giants Facebook v Australia: Who blinked first? Google fires AI ethics founder Silicon Valley firms have recently faced increasing scrutiny from other regulatory bodies around the world. Before the UK's exit from the European Union, competition regulation for global or pan-European companies was done through Brussels. Google has been hit with a number of competition fines by the European Commission over the years, including a â¬1.49bn (Â£1.28bn)fine in 2019 for blocking rival online search advertisers. Facebook is also facing competition action in the United States from federal regulators and more than 45 state prosecutors who are accusing the social media company oftaking illegal action to buy up rivals and stifle competition.

"Mr Depardieu denies the accusations, his lawyer has said French actor GÃ©rard Depardieu has been formally placed under investigation over accusations that he raped an actress at his home three years ago. The woman accuses him of raping and assaulting her in Paris in August 2018. His lawyer told French news agency AFP that Mr Depardieu ""totally dispute[d]"" the allegation, and the investigation should not have been made public. The arts world in France has been shaken by a series of accusations of sexual abuse against leading figures. Mr Depardieu, 73, is one of the country's most famous actors, known for films including Jean de Florette, Green Card and Cyrano. An initial investigation into the rape allegations was dropped in 2019, with prosecutors citing insufficient evidence, but was reopened last summer. Prosecutors formally placed Mr Depardieu under investigation in December 2020. He is free but under judicial supervision. The woman's lawyer, Elodie Tuaillon-Hibon, told AFP she hoped her client's ""private sphere"" would be respected as the case unfolded. Able to combine bearish physicality with emotional delicacy on screen, he has appeared in some 170 films, getting his big break in 1973 with Les Valseuses (Going Places). He won the best actor award for Cyrano at Cannes in 1990, and was nominated for an Oscar for the same role. Green Card, an English-language comedy made the same year, brought him further acclaim outside the French-speaking world. Off-screen, he made headlines in recent years for attacking French tax laws, moving to Belgium in protest. In 2013, he took Russian citizenship, with his decree of naturalisation signed personally by President Vladimir Putin.

"The cost of a music streaming subscription has remained largely static for the last 10 years Raising the price of music streaming services could lead to a rise in piracy, MPs have been told. The music industry has been keen to increase prices for some time, saying it could help artists earn more money. But Spotify told MPs it was wary of tweaking its monthly Â£9.99 subscription fee, which hasn't changed in a decade. If music becomes ""unaffordable to consumers"", warned chief legal officer Horacio Gutierrez, it could end up ""pushing them back into online piracy"". Gutierrez was giving evidence to a digital, culture, media and sport select committee inquiry into the economics of streaming. Streaming 'is threatening the future of music' 'Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers' Classic bands accused of crowding out new music It was set up last year to investigate whether musicians are being paid fairly by services like Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music. All three appeared before MPs on Tuesday, but much of the talk was about one of their rivals - YouTube. Apple Music's Elena Segal said it was difficult for streaming services to compete with the music available on Google's video-streaming site. ""Competing with free is very difficult,"" she said. ""It's challenging to compete on an un-level playing field. ""They don't necessarily have licenses for all the music that they use, and they don't need to,"" she said, referring to the ""safe harbour"" laws that protect YouTube from legal claims when users upload copyrighted material. ""Even when they do have licenses, the amount they pay... is less."" The inquiry heard from (clockwise from top left): Apple Music's Elena Segal, Amazon's Paul Firth and Spotify's Horacio Gutierrez Segal added that the mere fact of YouTube's existence prevented other streaming services from raising their prices. Another factor, she explained, was that the same songs are available on almost every music streaming service, unlike Netflix and Disney Plus, which can lure customers in with original films and TV shows. ""Those things do make it challenging to just put prices up in a vacuum...  because people can just opt to go to free or to another service that will have the same music,"" she said. However, both Amazon and Spotify conceded they would not end their free, ad-supported services if YouTube was to disappear. It is not the first time that the DCMS inquiry has heard accusations against YouTube. The company was accused of ""making an absolute fortune from other people's work"" by committee chair Julian Knight MP, after being told that YouTube paid UK record labels Â£35m in 2020, about half what they earned from selling vinyl records. By contrast, Spotify said they generated Â£474m for the UK music industry last year. However, Katherine Oyama, director of government affairs and public policy at YouTube said the company's payments were ""absolutely on a par"" with Spotify and other streaming platforms. Earlier this month, she told MPs YouTube had paid $3 billion (Â£2.1billion) to the global music industry in 2019. Pressed on the BPI's claims, Oyama said record labels were pointing fingers at YouTube ""to alleviate hard questions about their own industry"". She also called for more ""transparency"" on how the money paid to the industry was divided up before going to artists and songwriters. Disco legend Nile Rodgers gave evidence to an earlier session in the inquiry Earlier sessions of the inquiry saw testimony from Chic's Nile Rodgers and members of Radiohead and Elbow, as well as executives from all three major labels. Elbow frontman Guy Garvey said the way artists are paid for audio streams was ""threatening the future of music"". ""That sounds very dramatic,"" he told MPs, ""but if musicians can't afford to pay the rent... we haven't got tomorrow's music in place."" By contrast, Universal Music UK's chairman and chief executive, David Joseph, told the inquiry that artists were ""very happy with the investment, very happy with advances"" they currently received. He was interrupted by SNP MP John Nicolson, who said: ""I think you're living in cloud cuckoo land here if you really believe that."" Much of the discussion has centred around whether artists receive a fair share of the Â£1bn generated in the UK when their music is played online. At Tuesday's session, all three streaming companies said they were willing to investigate new ways of distributing money. One such suggestion is the user-centric payment system where, if you only listen to Dua Lipa, your entire subscription fee would go directly to her. Under the current system, all the money earned by streaming services is pooled before being distributed according to market share - so if Dua accounts for 1% of all streams on Spotify, she and her label receive 1% of the money. ""We would definitely be open to looking for alternative models and considering them,"" said Spotify's Horacio Gutierrez. Paul Firth of Amazon Music agreed, saying, ""we should take a look at a number of these approaches"" to see whether they really benefit the artist. Segal, however, cautioned that a new approach would need to be agreed by everyone who supplies music to the streaming services before it could be implemented. At present, Spotify is believed to pay between Â£0.002 and Â£0.0038 per stream, while Apple Music pays about Â£0.0059. YouTube pays the least - about Â£0.00052 (or 0.05 pence) per stream. All of that money goes to rights-holders, a blanket term that covers everything from massive record companies to artists who release their own music. The cash is then divided up between everyone involved in making the record. Often, the recording artist will only receive about 13% of the revenue, with labels and publishers keeping the rest. Songwriters and studio musicians receive even less. Independent labels tend to make more equitable deals, with some offering a 50/50 split of the profits. Artists who self-release their music stand to receive more - but may find it hard to compete with the promotion and marketing a major label can supply. Tuesday's hearing was the last session before MPs write their report on the streaming economy. It featured a brief cameo for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who recently signed a lucrative deal to produce and host podcasts for Spotify. ""Can Harry and Megan save the music business?"" asked conservative MP Steve Brine. ""That seems a little bit premature,"" laughed Gutierrez, who conceded that the duke and duchess had been signed because they were good ""box office"". ""At the end of the day, it goes back to attention economics,"" he said. ""The product is valued on the bas[is] of how many users it can attract, how many streams it will attract, which in turn determines how many advertisers are willing to advertise on the podcast. ""There is a market that is emerging for talent in that regard"". However, the couple's podcast won't generate any additional revenues for musicians on Spotify, unless they play licensed music within the show itself.

"A surge in Tesla shares first made Elon Musk the world's richest man in January Tesla boss Elon Musk has lost his title as the world's richest person after a recent slide in the electric carmaker's shares, the main driver of his wealth. Tesla shares have tumbled more than 20% since hitting a high of more than $880 in early January. They suffered especially steep falls this week, tied to the firm's recent risky $1.5bn (Â£1bn) investment in Bitcoin. The drop returned Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to the top spot on the rich list. The risk of being associated with the notoriously volatile Bitcoin - which has fallen sharply in recent days - may have prompted some Tesla investors to sell their shares, even if the firm has not been hurt by the declines, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. ""By Musk and Tesla aggressively embracing Bitcoin... investors are starting to tie Bitcoin and Tesla at the hip,"" he said. ""The recent 48-hour sell-off in Bitcoin and added volatility has driven some investors to the exits on this name in the near-term."" Bitcoin's value jumped nearly 50% in the weeks after Tesla revealed it had purchased $1.5bn of the currency and planned to accept it as payment. But since climbing above $57,000 on Sunday, the cryptocurrency has dropped nearly 20%. It was trading at less than $48,000 on Tuesday - still higher than when Tesla disclosed its bet. Why is the richest man in the world talking about Bitcoin? Bitcoin keeps hitting new highs after Tesla backing Just as Mr Musk was credited with helping to fuel Bitcoin's rise, he may also have himself to blame for some of the recent Bitcoin declines. In an exchange on Twitter,externalover the weekend Mr Musk wrote that the price of Bitcoin did ""seem high lol"". This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 Also driving the cryptocurrency lower were comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who sounded a warning on Bitcoin on Monday. She called it an ""extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions"". The comments follow a recent surge of interest in Bitcoin, after major US firms such as Mastercard and Bank of NY Mellon followed Tesla's lead in announcing plans to incorporate the digital currency into their operations. Mr Musk's attention to Bitcoin comes as Tesla faces other challenges. The firm recently halted most sales of the lowest-priced version of its Model Y SUV, with Mr Musk citing a desire to improve the car's range. Earlier this month, Chinese regulators summoned the firm over safety and quality issues, after reports of battery fires and abnormal acceleration. China is Tesla's biggest source of sales after the United States Rival carmakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen have also stepped up their focus on electric vehicles in recent months. The struggles follow an astonishing rise in Tesla shares in 2020, when prices leapt from less than $90 to more than $700. The increase propelled Mr Musk past Amazon boss Jeff Bezos in the world's richest rankings for the first time in January, while also raising questions about whether that value made sense for a firm that produces a fraction of the cars of its rivals. The two billionaires have been vying for the top spot in the weeks since. The more than 8% decline in Tesla's share price on Monday was the biggest since September and wiped more than $15bn off Mr Musk's net worth, according to Bloomberg. Shares fell a further 2% on Tuesday. Mr Musk's tweets have also famously triggered sharp moves in Tesla shares, including last year when the firm lost $14bn in market value after he wrote that its share price was too high.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would like regulatory changes to deal with that market dominance, its boss Andrea Coscelli told the BBC. Google and Facebook have faced criticism from competition and other regulators in the past. Facebook said it faces ""significant competition"" online from rival firms. Google has also been approached for comment by the BBC. When questioned by the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan, Mr Coscelli said that the two tech giants have a ""duopoly"" in the UK when it comes to digital advertising, which can often be bad for competition. Google and Facebook have about an 80% share of the UK's Â£14bn digital advertising market, which is ""not an ideal situation"", Mr Coscelli said. ""We think it would be good if we got to a situation where others had a bigger share of the market,"" he said. He also described the fact that Google holds about 90% of the UK's Â£7.3bn search advertising market as a ""problem"". Facebook currently has a more than 50% share of the Â£5.5bn display advertising market in the UK, which is too much, Mr Coscelli said. This video can not be played The Competition and Markets Authority would like regulatory changes to deal with the 'imbalance of power' ""When companies have too much economic power, that creates a number of distortions, first for competitors, secondly for consumers, and at some level potentially in terms of the political process as well, in some cases,"" he said. ""We, in general terms, like to see markets more competitive, with more players, with more diversity of players, because we think that delivers better outcomes."" A Facebook spokesman said its platform ""gives millions of people and businesses in the UK the opportunity to connect and share."" He added: ""Advertisers can and do freely move their [advertising] spending between TV, radio, print, outdoor and online. ""And in online advertising itself, we face significant competition from the likes of Google, Apple, Snap, Twitter and Amazon, as well as new entrants like TikTok, which keeps us on our toes."" Mr Coscelli stopped short of saying that Facebook and Google should be broken up. ""Our current proposal is not to break them up, it's to have pro-competitive regulation to deal with some of the issues, but it would allow the companies to maintain all the current activities that they have,"" he said. The CMA said in December it plans to issue Facebook, Google and the other tech giants a set of rules customised to each firm to rein in ""anti-competitive behaviour"" and give consumers ""more control over how their data used"". It is set to create a Digital Markets Unit within itself to draw up the rules and govern compliance, although legislation is required which may not be introduced until 2022. Competition and Markets Authority plans tailored rules for tech giants Facebook v Australia: Who blinked first? Google fires AI ethics founder Silicon Valley firms have recently faced increasing scrutiny from other regulatory bodies around the world. Before the UK's exit from the European Union, competition regulation for global or pan-European companies was done through Brussels. Google has been hit with a number of competition fines by the European Commission over the years, including a â¬1.49bn (Â£1.28bn)fine in 2019 for blocking rival online search advertisers. Facebook is also facing competition action in the United States from federal regulators and more than 45 state prosecutors who are accusing the social media company oftaking illegal action to buy up rivals and stifle competition.

"An FFP3 mask, not the brand being withdrawn by the Department of Health A million high-grade masks used in the NHS may not meet the right safety standards and have been withdrawn. The Department of Health told the BBC there are 1.12 million of these masks either in use or in hospital stores and has told staff to stop using them. Distribution of some gloves has also been suspended because they may not meet technical requirements. The Department of Health said safety of frontline staff was an absolute priority. Its warning concerns a specific brand of FFP3 mask, which are more sophisticated than surgical masks and are worn in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. The British Medical Associationappealed last monthfor staff on general wards to be given this type of mask to guard against coronavirus infection. Call for better virus masks for all medical staff Coronavirus: Has the NHS got enough PPE? Covid PPE: Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used The Department of Health and Social Care's (DHSC)alert last week,externalwarned that a certain type of FFP3 -  branded ""Fang Tian"" and marked as FT-045 - may not meet the required technical specifications. It advised health and care providers to check to see if their stock included the product and to stop using them until further investigation. The alert said the masks were provided by Polyco Healthline, but the manufacturer Suzhou Fangtian Industries told the BBC it had never supplied the firm. The BBC has approached Polyco Healthline for comment but has not heard back. The DHSC told BBC News the affected 1.12 million masks was a very small proportion of its overall stocks. These masks make up approximately 4% of its overall stock, the department said, and about 1.7% of the masks used every day. A spokesman said there was a ""resilient supply"" of FFP3 masks to ensure staff had access to the PPE they needed. The Department of Health and Social Care has withdrawn the masks over safety concerns The DHSC also issued an alert about ""nitri-hand"" non-sterile nitrile examination gloves - 27 million of these have been supplied by Full Support Group since June last year. The packaging for the gloves is understood to say they had not been tested for resistance to virus. But the supplier, Full Support Group, told BBC News they had in fact passed the test and the packaging should have been amended. ""We are confident that the gloves in question, having been checked and confirmed that they meet the requirements, will be released from quarantine as soon as the administrative process has been completed,"" a spokesman from the supplier said. He added that Full Support had successfully supplied the NHS since 2002. The DHSC said the batch of gloves represented a very small proportion of overall supply. But Rob Harwood, BMA consultants committee chairman, said it was ""unacceptable if staff's safety is still being jeopardised by inadequate PPE"" a year into the pandemic. ""Healthcare staff working on the frontline do so facing the grave risk of contracting Covid, and deserve the best protection from this deadly virus,"" he said. ""Many will be incredibly concerned to learn that some masks designed to offer enhanced protection, as well as gloves, may not meet standards, potentially placing them at greater risk."" He said it was ""good"" to see immediate action but ""urgent clarification"" was needed to explain ""how they entered the supply chain"". The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Our priority is providing frontline staff with quality PPE that meets robust quality requirements, and we have delivered nearly eight billion items so far. ""We carry out extensive due diligence on all PPE items before release, and where an issue is identified we act quickly to isolate the relevant product and conduct the appropriate investigations."" BBC News has been investigating the purchase of PPE for NHS staff since the beginning of the pandemic. It has previously revealedhow millions of face masks bought by the UK government could not be usedin the NHS as intended. Last week the High Court ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancockhad acted unlawfullywhen his department did not reveal details of contracts it had agreed during the pandemic within 30 days of them being signed. Update: The DHSC originally told the BBC 12 million face masks had been affected. It has since said this figure is incorrect, and the number is 1.12 million.

Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The Republic of Ireland is to continue at its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions until at least 5 April. The widely expected decision to maintain Level Five has been taken at a cabinet meeting today. But primary schools will reopen on Monday for the four youngest age groups, with final year secondary students also returning then. Other pupils and students will resume their schooling in a phased manner over the coming weeks, along with pre-school childcare. The Irish government has decided to take a cautious approach to easing its lockdown, arguing its aim is the long-term suppression of the virus. Ireland's vaccination programme has been hampered by supply issues and the relatively late authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the European Medicines Agency. But the Republic is near the top of the EU league in vaccinating people, once the injections arrive in the state. Read more here. A police officer has been dismissed after she attended a four-person gathering during lockdown and then crashed her car into a shop while drunk. PC Tasia Stephens, 24, from South Wales Police, lost her job and was barred from working in the profession again. She admitted gross misconduct at a tribunal, after attending the party last April during the first lockdown. She has since been sentenced after admitting drink-driving. PC Stephens' representative had argued she had been ""distressed"" after recently dealing with her first sudden death while on duty. Read the full story here. One of today's main areas of focus has been the Scottish Parliament where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was setting out how lockdown restrictions will ease. Here's how she made the announcement this afternoon. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Scotland's economy to begin to reopen at the end of April' A Covid-19 antibodies survey in Nigeria suggests four million people in Lagos state alone have had the virus - more than has been officially recorded for the whole of Africa. The official figure for Nigeria is 153,000 cases with 1,862 deaths. The study was done on 10,000 people from four Nigerian states to estimate the extent of coronavirus in Africa's most populous nation. It was conducted in September and October - before a second wave began in early December. Nigeria recorded its highest daily infection rate in January, when it logged 1,600 new cases, suggesting many more people were infected in the second wave. Find out more about the survey here. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures showing a further 8,489 coronavirus cases have been recorded and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. It shows the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital continue to fall. In the past 24 hours we've also heard a lot fromboth Boris JohnsonandNicola Sturgeonas they set out their plans to ease lockdown in England and Scotland. But both of them were clear - decisions around lockdown would be based on the data, and dependent on the current positive trends continuing. In England, there are four tests to taking each step of lockdown easing and they consider things like the infection rate and number of people in hospital.

exclusive research by BBC Monitoring exposed a huge increase in followers of

says it removes harmful misinformation and actively promotes good information
about Covid, including vaccines. Only eight African countries have a compulsory system to register deaths, a BBC investigation has found. All of the countries surveyed by the BBC have some sort of death registration but it is often on paper and not available in a shareable digitised form. The information may be used in a local area but cannot calculate mortality trends on a national level. Only Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Cape Verde, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, Seychelles and Mauritius have functioning, compulsory and universal civil registration systems that record deaths. That's compared to all but two countries in Europe - Albania and Monaco - and just over half in Asia, analysis of UN data shows. It has been widely reported that Africa's Covid-19 death toll is far lower than in other parts of the world - but there is a concern its true extent in some countries is not fully understood.

Many businesses have been asking when they will be allowed to reopen. Now they have some rough indication, pencilled in to the calendar, but far from all of them, and with distancing still required. In contrast with Boris Johnson's approach for England,Nicola Sturgeon's statement at Holyroodwas not a route map to a late summer of socialising, concerts, sports and travel. The plan is far more cautious. Nicola Sturgeon's idea of release, maybe by late April, is to get through the doors of a restaurant or bar. Both leaders had said they were putting data ahead of dates, but it was the prime minister's dates the public notice, remember and plan on. Travel bookings soared on Monday and Tuesday. Scotland's first minister is warning dates are not much better than ""a finger in the wind"", and depend on a lot of data variables to reach each point. Scotland's travel and tourism industry isn't being given much to plan on. Read more from Douglas here. Front-line health workers, the elderly, and people with chronic diseases are being prioritised in Lebanon The World Bank has threatened to suspend financing for
Lebanonâs Covid-19 vaccination programme amid allegations that people are
receiving shots without registering or waiting their turn. Lebanon launched the programme
on 14 February with 28,000 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines purchased withsome of the $34m (Â£24m) in aid it has been allocated,external. To ensure fair and transparent distribution, the government
asked everyone to register with an online platform, whose algorithms prioritise
recipients based on agreed criteria. Health workers, the elderly, and people
with chronic diseases are meant to be vaccinated first. However, it was not long before complaints about âviolationsâ
emerged in a country where corruption and mismanagement have been blamed for an
unprecedented economic crisis and the devastating explosion at Beirutâs port last
August. After several members of parliament were vaccinated on
Tuesday, World Bank regional director Saroj Kumar Jha warned
of consequences if people were found to be queue jumping. He added that the World Bank had asked monitors to verify that vaccination centres were adhering to the rules, adding the hashtag â#NoWastaâ. âWastaâ is an Arabic term for nepotism or influence. Parliamentâs Secretary-General, Adnan Daher, told the National News Agency thatthe lawmakers had been registered and that âtheir turn had comeâ,external.

But she added: ""Covid has brought with it further complications. We're now dealing with worrying diabetes and high blood pressure issues and my parents are exhausted beyond belief."" Under a video clip of Frances giving a thumbs up and clapping, Jo said her sister ""would like to say a huge thank you to everybody who has helped her, especially the amazing doctors and nurses of the NHS, and her many many well-wishers"". She earlierquestioned why she was offered the vaccine before her sister, who has the rare genetic syndrome Cri du Chat, but said it was possibly because she was deemed a carer for her sister.

"Boris Johnson says the government will look at the use of vaccine passports, but there are complex issues to consider The UK PM is ""optimistic"" Covid restrictions in England can be lifted on 21 June - the end of a four-step lockdown easing First Minister Nicola Sturgeon set out her plan for easing the lockdown in Scotland The Scottish government hopes to lift the stay at home restriction from 5 April, she says From the end of April, she expects a phased reopening of the economy including: non-essential retail, hospitality, gyms and hairdressers If all goes to plan, Scotland will return to varying levels of restrictions from the last week in April UK unemployment rate rises to 5.1% in the three months to December, official figures show 1.1 million high-grade masks used in the NHS may not meet the right safety standards and have been withdrawn A further 548 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test; there have been 8,489 more cases Edited by Claire Heald and James Clarke We're wrapping up for the evening. We'll be back on Wednesday with more updates from the UK around the world. Today's live page was edited by Claire Heald and James Clarke, and written by Ella Wills, Francesca Gillett, Alex Kleiderman and Kelly-Leigh Cooper.  Nicola Sturgeon announcing the plans to reopen Scotland's economy We're about to bring our live coverage of the latest events in the pandemic to an end. Thank you for joining us. Before we go, here's a round-up of the main headlines from today:  A woman who deliberately coughed at police investigating a breach of coronavirus restrictions has been jailed for four months. Lisa Dawn Fisher was verbally abusive when the officers called at a flat in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, on 30 January. The 31-year-old, who admitted two counts of assault against an emergency worker, was sentenced at Scarborough Magistrates' Court on 17 February. She was also ordered to pay Â£75 compensation. North Yorkshire Police say there has been an increase in assaults against emergency service workers. Read more here. We've heard before about outbreaks of coronavirus at prisons across the UK - withdata showing a surge last autumn. Now, a privately-run jail in Cambridgeshire says a number of staff and prisoners have tested positive in half of its 12 male wings. Last year one of HMP Peterborough's inmatesdied after contracting Covid-19. Sodexo says the ""current situation is well controlled and under constant review"", adding the virus has not been detected in the separate women's jail. There's more here.

Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The Republic of Ireland is to continue at its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions until at least 5 April. The widely expected decision to maintain Level Five has been taken at a cabinet meeting today. But primary schools will reopen on Monday for the four youngest age groups, with final year secondary students also returning then. Other pupils and students will resume their schooling in a phased manner over the coming weeks, along with pre-school childcare. The Irish government has decided to take a cautious approach to easing its lockdown, arguing its aim is the long-term suppression of the virus. Ireland's vaccination programme has been hampered by supply issues and the relatively late authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the European Medicines Agency. But the Republic is near the top of the EU league in vaccinating people, once the injections arrive in the state. Read more here. A police officer has been dismissed after she attended a four-person gathering during lockdown and then crashed her car into a shop while drunk. PC Tasia Stephens, 24, from South Wales Police, lost her job and was barred from working in the profession again. She admitted gross misconduct at a tribunal, after attending the party last April during the first lockdown. She has since been sentenced after admitting drink-driving. PC Stephens' representative had argued she had been ""distressed"" after recently dealing with her first sudden death while on duty. Read the full story here. One of today's main areas of focus has been the Scottish Parliament where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was setting out how lockdown restrictions will ease. Here's how she made the announcement this afternoon. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Scotland's economy to begin to reopen at the end of April' A Covid-19 antibodies survey in Nigeria suggests four million people in Lagos state alone have had the virus - more than has been officially recorded for the whole of Africa. The official figure for Nigeria is 153,000 cases with 1,862 deaths. The study was done on 10,000 people from four Nigerian states to estimate the extent of coronavirus in Africa's most populous nation. It was conducted in September and October - before a second wave began in early December. Nigeria recorded its highest daily infection rate in January, when it logged 1,600 new cases, suggesting many more people were infected in the second wave. Find out more about the survey here. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures showing a further 8,489 coronavirus cases have been recorded and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. It shows the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital continue to fall. In the past 24 hours we've also heard a lot fromboth Boris JohnsonandNicola Sturgeonas they set out their plans to ease lockdown in England and Scotland. But both of them were clear - decisions around lockdown would be based on the data, and dependent on the current positive trends continuing. In England, there are four tests to taking each step of lockdown easing and they consider things like the infection rate and number of people in hospital. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter More than 30
posts in violation of Facebook's policy on harmful misinformation and
harassment have been removed following BBC Panorama's investigation into the
impact of anti-vaccine disinformation online. AfterVaccines: the disinformation waraired, a number of fake newspaper front pages attributed to the Times, the Sun
and the Daily Mail promoting falsehoods about the coronavirus vaccine were
shared on Facebook in a bid to attack the programme. I was also
targeted with threats and abuse by anti-vaccine activists on Instagram and
Facebook, some of which have also now been removed. A
Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We have removed the violating content
brought to our attention and continue to investigate and monitor the accounts
responsible."" Panorama's investigation revealed how videos promoting claims about the vaccine
that are contrary to scientific evidence have caused real-world harm, affecting
communities across the UK. Thesecontinue to circulatein Facebook groups
and on Whatsapp, which Facebook owns. Meanwhile,
exclusive research by BBC Monitoring exposed a huge increase in followers of
accounts promoting anti-vaccine claims on Instagram in particular. Facebook
says it removes harmful misinformation and actively promotes good information
about Covid, including vaccines. Only eight African countries have a compulsory system to register deaths, a BBC investigation has found. All of the countries surveyed by the BBC have some sort of death registration but it is often on paper and not available in a shareable digitised form. The information may be used in a local area but cannot calculate mortality trends on a national level. Only Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Cape Verde, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, Seychelles and Mauritius have functioning, compulsory and universal civil registration systems that record deaths. That's compared to all but two countries in Europe - Albania and Monaco - and just over half in Asia, analysis of UN data shows. It has been widely reported that Africa's Covid-19 death toll is far lower than in other parts of the world - but there is a concern its true extent in some countries is not fully understood. Africa's data gap could have enormous policy implications. Having an accurate picture of who is dying, from what and where, is crucial when it comes to allocating resources and funding.

"This video can not be played Hancock: 'This is on everyone to act together' Everybody has to ""play their part"" to meet the dates for England's lockdown to be eased, Matt Hancock has said. But it is currently ""too early"" to say how long social distancing will be in place, the health secretary said. The aim is for measures like masks to become a ""matter of personal responsibility"", rather than law, in the future. Boris Johnson has outlined a strategy that could see restrictions lifted by 21 June - if strict conditions are met. Nicola Sturgeon is to revealplans to ease restrictionsin Scotland later. She has said Scotland will return to a tiered system, meaning different parts of the country could be under different rules. Kuenssberg: PM steers country towards the exit Why can't we unlock more quickly? What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? Holiday bookings surge on lockdown exit plans The health secretary told the BBC it is ""vital"" that ""everybody plays their part"" to make sure ""that we hit these dates and get out of this as soon as we possibly can, safely"". People should be able to hug friends and family from 17 May, when the most vulnerable groups have had two coronavirus vaccine jabs, he said. Mr Hancock said eradicating Covid-19 completely is ""not going to be possible"" and that everyone would have to ""learn to live with it"", as we do with flu. He said he wanted measures to become a ""matter of personal responsibility and social norms"" that could see people choosing to wear masks on public transport, for example. There is already evidence that the vaccines were working, with the number of deaths ""coming down really sharply"", he added. He urged people to take up their vaccine offer, amid warnings the virus could persist in inner city communities where uptake is low. Dr Mike Tildesley, reader in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the University of Warwick and member of government advisory group SPI-M, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this was a ""real concern"". ""It's really important that we get the vaccines out to those deprived communities to prevent a potential wave of infections occurring as we do unlock,"" he added. Mr Hancock said it is ""absolutely on all of us"" to get the vaccine when invited. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show coronavirus deaths continue to decline. In the week of 12 February, there were 17,136 deaths registered in the UK, down by 1,710 on the previous week. Deaths are still running above usual levels for this time of year, however. They were 26% higher than the average for the same week over the past five years. In the first step of the prime minister's roadmap, all pupils in England's schools are expected to return to class from8 March, with mass testing and wider use of face masks in secondary schools. There will be a further easing on29 March,with groups of up to six people or two households allowed to gather in parks and gardens. Shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality, as well as self-contained holiday accommodation, could reopen on12 April.A review of international leisure travel restrictions will be completed by this date. From17 May,two households or a group of six may be able to meet indoors in a pub or other hospitality venue such as restaurants. Cinemas, museums, hotels, performances and sporting events will also reopen, with up to 30 people able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes. The final step from21 Junewill potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs. Progressing along the schedule will depend on four tests: the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence of vaccine efficacy, an assessment of new variants, and keeping infection rates below a level that could put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. There will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. This video can not be played Watch the full statement by Boris Johnson on England's roadmap out of the Covid-19 lockdown On Monday, Mr Johnson told a Downing Street news conference he could not guarantee his plan would be irreversible ""but the intention is that it should be"". He added that the coming spring and summer would be ""seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all"". As part of its plans, the government wants to determine whether offering ""Covid status"" certificates, which could be used by people to demonstrate they had received a vaccine or a negative coronavirus test, could help venues open again. Mr Johnson acknowledged there were ""clearly some quite complex issues, some ethical issues"" but later told a meeting of his own MPs that ""a debate had to be had"". MPs will vote on the roadmap in late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers. Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that without clarity on business support - like the VAT reduction and the business rates holiday - ""many businesses are simply throwing in the towel now and we cannot afford that in the UK when we've already had record redundancies"". Conservative MP Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory lockdown-sceptics, said the ""pace of change will be a hammer blow"" to industries such as aviation, hospitality and the arts. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterwants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schoolsfollowing Mr Johnson's announcement in England. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Emma Coronel Aispuro stayed loyal to her husband, attending nearly every day of his trial in 2019 The wife of jailed Mexican drug lord JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n has been arrested in the US on suspicion of drug trafficking, US authorities say. Emma Coronel Aispuro, 31, was detained at Dulles International Airport outside Washington DC. She is charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana. GuzmÃ¡n is currently serving a life sentence in Colorado for drug trafficking and money laundering. The 63-year-old is a former head of the Sinaloa cartel, which officials say was the biggest supplier of drugs to the US. Histrial in 2019 heard shocking revelations about his life, from drugging and raping girls as young as 13 to carrying out the cold-blooded murders of former cartel members and rivals. How El Chapo fell victim to his own legend The downfall of one of the world's most notorious criminals Ms Coronel Aispuro appeared via video link before a federal judge at a court in Washington DC on Tuesday and was ordered to remain in detention for the time being. Emma Coronel Aispuro appeared during a virtual hearing at a federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday Prosecutor Anthony Nardozzi said Ms Coronel Aispuro had ""worked closely"" with members of the Sinaloa cartel and had possessed the ""financial means to generate a serious risk of flight"". As well as facing drug trafficking charges, she is also accused of conspiring with others to help her husband escape from prison in Mexico in 2015. He was sprung from Mexico's maximum-security Altiplano prison after his sons bought a property near the prison and a GPS watch smuggled into the prison gave diggers his exact location. He escaped by riding a specially adapted small motorcycle through the tunnel. This video can not be played El Chapo trial: Five facts about Mexican drug lord JoaquÃ­n GuzmÃ¡n Court documents said Ms Coronel Aispuro was allegedly involved in planning another prison escape for her husband before he was extradited to the US in January 2017. She has not commented on the charges. Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said the arrest was ""a matter that the United States will decide"" but added that he hoped the US would share more of the details. Ms Coronel Aispuro is a dual US-Mexico citizen, a former beauty pageant winner and journalism student, and the mother of twins with GuzmÃ¡n. According to previous interviews gave to US media, she first met GuzmÃ¡n at a dance when she was 17 and he was 49. She attended nearly every day of her husband's three-month trial in New York, during which she heard not only grim accounts of murder and rape, but also claims he had spied on her and other mistresses. She came under the media spotlight during that trial. In one instance, she appeared to laugh during the tearful testimony of one of GuzmÃ¡n's mistresses. On another day she and GuzmÃ¡n wore similar velvet jackets, which many people interpreted as a show of solidarity. El Chapo's beauty queen wife stays loyal She remained supportive of GuzmÃ¡n throughout, saying at the end of the trial: ""I don't know my husband as the person they are trying to show him as, but rather I admire him as the human being that I met, and the one that I married."" GuzmÃ¡n came from a poor family in Sinaloa state, north-west Mexico.

"For Antonio Caraballo and his son Sami, home is a hotel room for 10 days A father wants the Scottish government to reconsider its Covid quarantine rules after his son was told he had to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. Antonio Caraballo's 10-year-old son Sami, who lives with his mother in Finland, flew to Edinburgh on Saturday to see his father. Mr Caraballo expected Sami to self-isolate at the family home and filled out pre-flight paperwork accordingly. But on arrival, border officials insisted he had to isolate in a hotel. Because he is a child, Mr Caraballo has had to quarantine with him, at a total cost of more than Â£2,400. The Scottish government said children under 11 were exempt from having to be tested for Covid-19 on arrival to Scotland, but not from having to stay in a quarantine hotel. Quarantine hotel plan to cover all overseas flights Family reunited after hotel quarantine 'error' Girl's hotel quarantine means hug with mum is put on hold The rule means that Sami will spend 10 days of his 14-day visit in a hotel room, and Mr Caraballo, who is a key worker at an oil and gas firm, has to do his work from there. Mr Caraballo told BBC Scotland: ""Sami lives in Finland with his mother and usually we see a lot of each other, but because of the pandemic, he has not been here since last summer. We didn't see him at Christmas. ""We had to balance the risks of my son travelling from a country with a low number of cases to a country with a high number of cases. ""But we brought him for his own wellbeing. Now I am so frustrated for him."" Sami is spending the majority of his visit in hotel quarantine Sami's parents had organised an extra week off school to add to his week-long half term break known as the ""ski holiday"" in Finland. The school were happy to let him spend time with his family. Mr Caraballo arrived at the airport to collect his son on Saturday but instead of taking him home to isolate there, ended the day in a quarantine hotel. ""I got a call from the border agent,"" he said. ""He said he didn't need a Covid test but he had to go to the hotel. They said because my child is underage an adult would have to go with him. We had to try to book the quarantine hotel online and then my wife and Sami's sister Amelia, who is three, only saw him for five seconds as the two of us were escorted away."" Mr Caraballo was given a scrap of paper with a number on it to appeal his case by hotel staff, but the number did not exist Mr Caraballo has tried to appeal against the decision and was given a helpline to call by the hotel staff. Unfortunately this turned out to be an invalid number. He is finding it difficult to speak to anyone who can help. ""The most frustrating thing is that there doesn't seem to be anyone who is accountable,"" he said. ""There is no-one to call, no-one to speak to at the hotel."" Coronavirus restrictions on travel and visiting other households in Scotland carry an exemption for shared parenting. People are allowed ""to travel to participate in or facilitate shared parenting or between two parts of an extended household"". Mr Caraballo feels that when a child is visiting a parent, there should be an exemption, or the ability to self-isolate at home. He said: ""We thought we were doing the right thing flying him into Edinburgh. If we had him arrive in another part of the UK there would have been a loophole."" Different rules set by the UK and Scottish governments mean that arrivals to airports in England who travel on to Scotland, do not have to quarantine in a hotel unless they arrive from a country on the red list. The Doubletree Edinburgh Airport is where Mr Caraballo and his son have to quarantine for 10 days For the moment all plans are on hold and Sami will have just three days with his family after the hotel stay. A family ""late Christmas dinner"" has been postponed. Mr Caraballo said Sami was bored and frustrated but is resilient. He added: ""It's just a shame. The whole point of bringing him here was to cheer him up."" A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""We understand how difficult this is for families with children, but to manage the risk of importing new variants and to give vaccine deployment the best chance of bringing us closer to normality these limits on international travel are necessary. ""The clinical advice is clear that a comprehensive system of managed quarantine is essential to minimise the impact of new Covid-19 variants. This means children must enter managed isolation regardless of whether they are accompanied or unaccompanied. We must restrict how many exemptions are in place otherwise the policy will not be effective."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"An FFP3 mask, not the brand being withdrawn by the Department of Health A million high-grade masks used in the NHS may not meet the right safety standards and have been withdrawn. The Department of Health told the BBC there are 1.12 million of these masks either in use or in hospital stores and has told staff to stop using them. Distribution of some gloves has also been suspended because they may not meet technical requirements. The Department of Health said safety of frontline staff was an absolute priority. Its warning concerns a specific brand of FFP3 mask, which are more sophisticated than surgical masks and are worn in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. The British Medical Associationappealed last monthfor staff on general wards to be given this type of mask to guard against coronavirus infection. Call for better virus masks for all medical staff Coronavirus: Has the NHS got enough PPE? Covid PPE: Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used The Department of Health and Social Care's (DHSC)alert last week,externalwarned that a certain type of FFP3 -  branded ""Fang Tian"" and marked as FT-045 - may not meet the required technical specifications. It advised health and care providers to check to see if their stock included the product and to stop using them until further investigation. The alert said the masks were provided by Polyco Healthline, but the manufacturer Suzhou Fangtian Industries told the BBC it had never supplied the firm. The BBC has approached Polyco Healthline for comment but has not heard back. The DHSC told BBC News the affected 1.12 million masks was a very small proportion of its overall stocks. These masks make up approximately 4% of its overall stock, the department said, and about 1.7% of the masks used every day. A spokesman said there was a ""resilient supply"" of FFP3 masks to ensure staff had access to the PPE they needed. The Department of Health and Social Care has withdrawn the masks over safety concerns The DHSC also issued an alert about ""nitri-hand"" non-sterile nitrile examination gloves - 27 million of these have been supplied by Full Support Group since June last year. The packaging for the gloves is understood to say they had not been tested for resistance to virus. But the supplier, Full Support Group, told BBC News they had in fact passed the test and the packaging should have been amended. ""We are confident that the gloves in question, having been checked and confirmed that they meet the requirements, will be released from quarantine as soon as the administrative process has been completed,"" a spokesman from the supplier said. He added that Full Support had successfully supplied the NHS since 2002. The DHSC said the batch of gloves represented a very small proportion of overall supply. But Rob Harwood, BMA consultants committee chairman, said it was ""unacceptable if staff's safety is still being jeopardised by inadequate PPE"" a year into the pandemic. ""Healthcare staff working on the frontline do so facing the grave risk of contracting Covid, and deserve the best protection from this deadly virus,"" he said. ""Many will be incredibly concerned to learn that some masks designed to offer enhanced protection, as well as gloves, may not meet standards, potentially placing them at greater risk."" He said it was ""good"" to see immediate action but ""urgent clarification"" was needed to explain ""how they entered the supply chain"". The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Our priority is providing frontline staff with quality PPE that meets robust quality requirements, and we have delivered nearly eight billion items so far. ""We carry out extensive due diligence on all PPE items before release, and where an issue is identified we act quickly to isolate the relevant product and conduct the appropriate investigations."" BBC News has been investigating the purchase of PPE for NHS staff since the beginning of the pandemic. It has previously revealedhow millions of face masks bought by the UK government could not be usedin the NHS as intended. Last week the High Court ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancockhad acted unlawfullywhen his department did not reveal details of contracts it had agreed during the pandemic within 30 days of them being signed. Update: The DHSC originally told the BBC 12 million face masks had been affected. It has since said this figure is incorrect, and the number is 1.12 million.

"This video can not be played Watch the full statement by Boris Johnson on England's roadmap out of the Covid-19 lockdown A new four-step plan to ease England's lockdown could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met. Shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality could reopen on 12 April in England under plans set out by the PM. From 17 May, two households might be allowed to mix in homes, while the rule of six could apply in places like pubs. It requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be ""cautious but irreversible"" and at every stage decisions would be led by ""data not dates"". There was ""no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world"", he said. Kuenssberg: PM steers country towards the exit Why can't we unlock more quickly? Holiday bookings surge on lockdown exit plans Mr Johnson later told a Downing Street news conference the coming spring and summer would be ""seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all"". He described the plan as a ""one-way road to freedom"" but said he could not guarantee it would be irreversible ""but the intention is that it should be"". It comes as the first data on the UK's coronavirus vaccine rolloutsuggested it was having a ""spectacular"" impact on stopping serious illness. As part of the first step of the plan for easing lockdown in England: From 8 March -All schools will open with outdoor after-school sports and activities allowed. Recreation in an outdoor public spaces - such as a park - will be allowed between two people, meaning they would be allowed to sit down for a coffee, drink or picnic From 29 March -Outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households will be allowed. It is understood this will include gatherings in private gardens. Outdoor sports facilities such as tennis or basketball courts will reopen andorganised adult and children's sport, such as grassroots football, will also return Secondary school pupilscan access tests and will be required to wear face coveringsin classrooms and shared spaces like corridors. There will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. The second stepfrom 12 Aprilwould see major parts of the economy permitted to reopen: Non-essential retail opens, hairdressers and some public buildings like libraries Outdoor settings like alcohol takeaways, beer gardens, zoos and theme parks Indoor leisure like swimming pools and gyms Self-contained holiday accommodation, such as self-catering lets and camp sites But wider social contact rules will continue to apply in all settings - meaning no indoor mixing between different households will be allowed. Mr Johnson confirmed the end of hospitality curfews - and requirements to eat a substantial meal alongside alcohol. He said a review of international leisure travel restrictions would be announced by 12 April at the earliest. Funerals continue with up to 30 people, and weddings with up to 15 guests. The third step will comefrom 17 May- if the data allows - and will see the ""rule of six"" abolished for outdoor gatherings, replaced with a limit of 30 people: Two households can mix indoors - with the rule of six applied in hospitality settings like pubs Cinemas, museums, hotels, performances and sporting events reopen - though social distancing remains Up to 10,000 spectatorscan attend the very largest outdoor seated venueslike football stadiums Up to 30 people will be able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes. Mr Johnson said this step would also ""consider the potential role of Covid status certification"" - which could refer to so-called ""vaccine passports"" - in helping indoor venues to reopen safely. This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty explains the length of gaps between each stage of reopening Before the fourth step, ministers will carry out a review into social distancing and other ""long-term measures"" designed to reduce transmission, including the ""one metre plus"" rule and the wearing of face coverings. They will also consider whether to lift the ""work from home"" guidance, which the government says people should continue to follow until the review has been completed. England care home residents to get one visitor each Live music 'at the back of queue to reopen' 'We're delighted to have dates to work towards' The fourth stepfrom 21 Junewill potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs. The government hopes that - from this date - restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished. Music and events leaders called for more financial support for the sector,with the boss of one live music trade body saying his industry is ""at the back of the queue to re-open"" once restrictions are lifted. MPs will vote on the roadmap in late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers. This video can not be played Sir Patrick Vallance says home-working and mask-wearing measures may continue until next winter Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said he thought the roadmap struck the ""right balance"" - but warned reopening schools risks increasing the number of cases reported each day. Speaking later at the Downing Street briefing, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was ""very important"" to leave a gap of five weeks between the changes in the roadmap to avoid ""flying blind"". Sir Patrick also said ""baseline"" measures - such as face coverings in certain situations, hand washing, and self-isolation - may be necessary next winter. The vaccines are working well and infection levels have fallen to a fifth of what they were since the start of the year. So why, many may ask, is there such caution? The answer lies in the mountain of data published by the government as it unveiled its roadmap. Among the documents was modelling done by Imperial College London. It showed a rapid easing of restrictions could lead to surge in deaths over the summer and a total of 80,000 deaths by the middle of 2022. There is much uncertainty about scenarios like this - for one thing it did not take into account any seasonal impact that the warmer weather could bring by reducing spread of the virus. The gradual lifting could, by comparison, reduce that to around 30,000. That would bring it in line with the sort of deaths we could see during a bad flu winter. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says that should be the context in which we judge Covid now. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions but have largely moved in the same direction, though at different speeds, during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidScotlandwould return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased. It means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday.

InWales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterwants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schoolsfollowing Mr Johnson's announcement in England. The prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight. He faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions. One participant suggested he was talking ""gibberish"" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey. Another said the PM had been ""rattled"". What annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted ""before"" certain dates. He was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was ""no backtracking"" on the five-week wait between steps. The prime minister also said that ""a debate had to be had"" on domestic vaccine passport certificates. It came as a further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according tolatest government figures,external.

"Nicola Sturgeon says that her plan is to lift restrictions gradually ""with a view to more substantial re-opening"" from late April onward The moves out of lockdown will take place in three-week blocks, but if data allowed an acceleration of the easing of restrictions would take place Non-essential shops, gyms and hairdressers are set to open on 12 April in England, but in Scotland they are likely to remain closed until 26 April Yesterday, PM Boris Johnson told the Commons that if strict conditions are met all legal limits will be lifted by 21 June. That is not a date mentioned in Ms Sturgeon's address Conservative MSP Ruth Davidson told the FM that she needed to give a clearer indication to Scots about when their lives can get back to normal Scotland's hospital admissions are falling steadily and there were 655 new positive lab tests.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Dr Christine Tait Bukard, expert in infection and immunity at the University of Edinburgh, describes the Scottish government's approach as ""very sensible"". She also says ministers must remain cautious and ensure that the downward trend of infections continues. Asked about vaccine passports, Dr Tait Bukard told BBC Radio  Scotland'sDrivetimethey are not ""absolutely essential"". She says: ""What we've seen so far is that the vaccine actually stops spread of disease which means we probably don't need a 100% vaccination of the community to actually get some level of herd immunity. ""As we know vaccine passports actually support inequality."" UK Hospitality Scotland says even an ""ambiguous"" reopening date is a ""small step in the right direction"" and also calls for travel restrictions to be lifted. Executive director Willie Macleod said: âWe need much more detail, though, to really get to grips
with the challenge of reopening. ""We will need details of the type of
restrictions businesses will be under and the timeframe for easing them."" Mr Macleod adds that ""unrealistic level 3 restrictions"" will be ""immensely damaging"" for the sector. He says many will struggle to survive further constraints. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland So, the last week of April is when we would expect to see phased but significant re-opening of the economy, including non essential retail, hospitality and services like gyms and hairdressers. Ricardo Corvi is a hairdresser & director of Rainbow Room International Ayr and he tells Drivetime he welcomes a possible return by that date. ""Ultimately we've been begging for a date. ""We've felt like caged animals just desperate to get back into our business, back into our salons to look after our clients."" He says hairdressers know what to expect this time and he hopes clients will be patient. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stephen Montgomery is from the Scottish Hospitality Group and runs two hotels in Scotland. He describes the route map as ""foggy and full of potholes"" Mr Montomery says that for every week his hotels are closed, it costs his group Â£196,000 in national insurance, pension contributions and holiday accrual, even before they pay any utilities. He only receives Â£66,300 a week  back in support and says the sector needs support for another year. He said: ""We are hanging on by our fingertips, By the end of April, we are going to see bounce back loans having to be paid, VAT bills starting to get paid. We have no clear route map out of this at all."" He says level three is not viable and hotels need to be open from 10am until 10pm. The British
Independent Retailers Association calls on the Scottish government
to pave the way to allow non-essential retail to reopen earlier than
scheduled. But it also expresses its frustration at the inability of the four home nations
to release a consistent message. Bira CEO Andrew Goodacre says he cannot understand why there is such a wide variation of interpreting the same data. He adds: ""This inability for
the four home nations to agree on a strategy adds to confusion in the eyes of
the general public. âLast summer Scotland opened up later than elsewhere in the UK but still
ended up in the same position of having to lockdown. âWe urge the Scottish government to learn from this and re-consider the
decision to delay re-opening until the end of April.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chris McLaughlinBBC Scotland Sports News Correspondent Like many other sectors, sport is looking on and wondering
when it can realistically plan for the return of fans. In England, up to 10,000
fans can attend sporting events from May 17th â that was always
unlikely to be replicated in Scotland. After speaking to a number of governing
bodies over the past few days, there was more hope than expectation leading up
to todayâs speech by the first minister. Itâs very much a case of ""as you were"" and letâs see where we are by mid-March. With the clock ticking though, there
are some big calls to be made. Scotlandâs national stadium will host Euro2020
matches in June and fans who have bought tickets want to know if thereâs chance
of them going along. If current virus trends continue, my understanding is that
some will be. Just how many, is the question. Nicola Sturgeon sets out how lockdown restrictions will ease and the economy begin to reopen in Scotland. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce says it had expected details from the first minister that will now not be announced until mid-March. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron says the reopening of some trading from 5 April will provide ""some solace"" but calls for higher compensation for those have to wait longer to reopen. She adds: ""Come the end of
April, we would urge the Scottish Government to relax restrictions on domestic
travel as this will be essential for the survival of tourism and hospitality
businesses currently reliant on domestic visitors. âBut
time is of the essence. For many thousands of businesses, our debt is
increasing, and our cash running out."" Dr Cameron adds Nicola Sturgeon should have ""applied the same amount of rigour"" as Boris Johnson. She also calls for both the Scottish and UK governments to extend and expand support to affected businesses. The Moderator of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland has welcomed the possibility of church buildings being allowed to open for Easter, which is this year on 4 April. The Rt Rev Dr Martin
Fair says: âChristians are Easter people and we live with hope in all
circumstances - hope that has sustained us through this last year. âThe announcement in the Scottish Parliament today is a good
beginning to a return to normality and we look forward to further progress in
the easing of restrictions. âHowever, individual congregations will proceed cautiously
according to their own circumstances and will only re-open buildings when itâs
safe for them to do so.â Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stephen Leckie is chairman of the Scottish Tourism Alliance and owner of the Crieff Hydro Hotel. He says today's announcement offered ""a little bit of hope""  but he feels ""hard done by"" He tells John Beattie the the FM's statement ran to a total of 3,459 words, but featured the word ""hospitality"" once, ""hotels"" nil, ""accommodation and self catering"" nil and ""tourism"" nil. He said: ""We are feeling left out and forgotten. We are gagging to open. We know the demand is there. ""But we have 62 days of closure ahead of us and then we move from level four to level three and we don't know about travel restrictions."" He says there is ""no point in opening if customers cannot travel"".  The Scottish government has set out four phases in its strategy to lift coronavirus restrictions.  The first minister has talked about ""data not dates"", however she did give some indication about what we could expect and when: First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said there will be a ""progressive easing"" of Scotland's rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday announced a ""roadmap"" to lift England's lockdown restrictions in stages - starting with the reopening of schools. Over the course of the past year, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has advised the authorities on the pandemic, assessing the risks of transmission of coronavirus in many areas of daily life. This advice looks at how closing or opening certain sectors could affect its spread - although with varying degrees of confidence, as the precise impact of each measure is difficult to assess. Scientists are still trying to understand the full impact of the vaccines and the new variants of coronavirus. These have not been factored in yet in the assessments from Sage, which have been publicly released. The BBC has looked at what they say about the risks in a number of areas.Check out more here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland There is still no certainty in terms of holidays Shona Thorne of Thorne Travel in Ayrshire thought there would have been a lot more detail to the proposed unlocking. Ms Thorne says bookings for 2022 are ""buoyant"" but that people are still uncertain about 2021. She tells John Beattie that the announcement does not make anything clearer. I think the road map only takes us a short distance. I would have hoped to have a full road map, like the one England has. We have had people who have transferred over from last year, people who have weddings booked. They are unsure if this is going to happen or not. It would be good to have an understanding of what to advise them and at this moment in time the moment we are only looking at a few weeks in advance. Shona Thorne, Travel agent The Scottish Licensed Trade Association warns a late spring reopening will be too late for many of its members. Spokesman Paul Waterson says: âWhile it is encouraging that our sector can hopefully reopen from the end of
April, we are concerned that a return to the previous tiered system will lead
many operators to decide that such restrictive reopening conditions are simply
not worth the time, effort and money involved."" He adds hospitality is not a ""one size fits all"" sector as it includes pubs, restaurants, hotels and nightclubs. Mr Waterson adds licensed hospitality has been among the hardest hit by trading restrictions despite investing an estimated
Â£80m on becoming Covid compliant. David Lonsdale of the Scottish Retail Consortium gives the first minister's announcement a ""cautious thumbs up"". But he tells BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime: ""For retail we have a provisional date for reopening in two months' time at the end of April."" But he adds: ""There is quite a chunky 100-page document behind this which we are still trying to plough through. ""There is still quite a lot of detail that appears, at first glance, to be missing from this."" CBI Scotland says while the strategic framework represents a small step in the right direction ""many Scottish businesses will be
left feeling deflated"". Director Tracy Black says: ""Considerable uncertainty still remains over how and when
they can reopen their doors."" She stresses the business community recognises that ""data
not dates"" must be the key driver of lockdown easing measures and that a
cautious approach remains the right one. But she adds: ""However, firms will have been looking
for more detail than the partial timetable that has been provided. ""For sectors like hospitality, retail and
tourism, that have been hit so hard by the pandemic, the road back to a tier
system at the end of April will feel like a long and uncertain one. ""Others,
like tourism and aviation, face another prolonged period of hibernation."" Derek Provan, the chief executive of AGS Airports, the company which owns Aberdeen
International, Glasgow and Southampton airports, takes a swipe at Nicola Sturgeon's route map. He compares her announcement to the one made on Monday by Boris Johnson for England and says while the PM provided a ""clear framework for the safe restart of international aviation"", the first minister had provided ""a clear message the aviation industry is not a priority for
the Scottish government"". He said that his industry was handed no plan or framework against which they can
start plotting any form of recovery.  This sends a very worrying signal to our airports, our airlines and the thousands of staff our sector supports. We find ourselves in a position where airports and airlines in England can start planning to safely reopen in time for the summer, yet in Scotland we are left with more questions than answers. It is now two weeks since the Scottish government committed to setting up an aviation working group and it has still to meet. This lack of meaningful engagement cannot continue.

Before we go, here's a round-up of the main headlines from today:  A woman who deliberately coughed at police investigating a breach of coronavirus restrictions has been jailed for four months. Lisa Dawn Fisher was verbally abusive when the officers called at a flat in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, on 30 January. The 31-year-old, who admitted two counts of assault against an emergency worker, was sentenced at Scarborough Magistrates' Court on 17 February. She was also ordered to pay Â£75 compensation. North Yorkshire Police say there has been an increase in assaults against emergency service workers. Read more here.

Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The Republic of Ireland is to continue at its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions until at least 5 April. The widely expected decision to maintain Level Five has been taken at a cabinet meeting today. But primary schools will reopen on Monday for the four youngest age groups, with final year secondary students also returning then. Other pupils and students will resume their schooling in a phased manner over the coming weeks, along with pre-school childcare. The Irish government has decided to take a cautious approach to easing its lockdown, arguing its aim is the long-term suppression of the virus. Ireland's vaccination programme has been hampered by supply issues and the relatively late authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the European Medicines Agency. But the Republic is near the top of the EU league in vaccinating people, once the injections arrive in the state. Read more here. A police officer has been dismissed after she attended a four-person gathering during lockdown and then crashed her car into a shop while drunk. PC Tasia Stephens, 24, from South Wales Police, lost her job and was barred from working in the profession again. She admitted gross misconduct at a tribunal, after attending the party last April during the first lockdown. She has since been sentenced after admitting drink-driving. PC Stephens' representative had argued she had been ""distressed"" after recently dealing with her first sudden death while on duty. Read the full story here. One of today's main areas of focus has been the Scottish Parliament where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was setting out how lockdown restrictions will ease. Here's how she made the announcement this afternoon. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Scotland's economy to begin to reopen at the end of April' A Covid-19 antibodies survey in Nigeria suggests four million people in Lagos state alone have had the virus - more than has been officially recorded for the whole of Africa. The official figure for Nigeria is 153,000 cases with 1,862 deaths. The study was done on 10,000 people from four Nigerian states to estimate the extent of coronavirus in Africa's most populous nation. It was conducted in September and October - before a second wave began in early December. Nigeria recorded its highest daily infection rate in January, when it logged 1,600 new cases, suggesting many more people were infected in the second wave. Find out more about the survey here. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures showing a further 8,489 coronavirus cases have been recorded and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. It shows the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital continue to fall. In the past 24 hours we've also heard a lot fromboth Boris JohnsonandNicola Sturgeonas they set out their plans to ease lockdown in England and Scotland. But both of them were clear - decisions around lockdown would be based on the data, and dependent on the current positive trends continuing. In England, there are four tests to taking each step of lockdown easing and they consider things like the infection rate and number of people in hospital. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter More than 30
posts in violation of Facebook's policy on harmful misinformation and
harassment have been removed following BBC Panorama's investigation into the
impact of anti-vaccine disinformation online. AfterVaccines: the disinformation waraired, a number of fake newspaper front pages attributed to the Times, the Sun
and the Daily Mail promoting falsehoods about the coronavirus vaccine were
shared on Facebook in a bid to attack the programme. I was also
targeted with threats and abuse by anti-vaccine activists on Instagram and
Facebook, some of which have also now been removed. A
Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We have removed the violating content
brought to our attention and continue to investigate and monitor the accounts
responsible."" Panorama's investigation revealed how videos promoting claims about the vaccine
that are contrary to scientific evidence have caused real-world harm, affecting
communities across the UK. Thesecontinue to circulatein Facebook groups
and on Whatsapp, which Facebook owns. Meanwhile,
exclusive research by BBC Monitoring exposed a huge increase in followers of
accounts promoting anti-vaccine claims on Instagram in particular. Facebook
says it removes harmful misinformation and actively promotes good information
about Covid, including vaccines. Only eight African countries have a compulsory system to register deaths, a BBC investigation has found. All of the countries surveyed by the BBC have some sort of death registration but it is often on paper and not available in a shareable digitised form. The information may be used in a local area but cannot calculate mortality trends on a national level. Only Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Cape Verde, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, Seychelles and Mauritius have functioning, compulsory and universal civil registration systems that record deaths. That's compared to all but two countries in Europe - Albania and Monaco - and just over half in Asia, analysis of UN data shows. It has been widely reported that Africa's Covid-19 death toll is far lower than in other parts of the world - but there is a concern its true extent in some countries is not fully understood. Africa's data gap could have enormous policy implications. Having an accurate picture of who is dying, from what and where, is crucial when it comes to allocating resources and funding. ""In order to help the living, we need to count the dead,"" UN Population Fund demographer Romesh Silva tells the BBC. Read more about thedata gap and why it matters here.

Many businesses have been asking when they will be allowed to reopen. Now they have some rough indication, pencilled in to the calendar, but far from all of them, and with distancing still required. In contrast with Boris Johnson's approach for England,Nicola Sturgeon's statement at Holyroodwas not a route map to a late summer of socialising, concerts, sports and travel. The plan is far more cautious. Nicola Sturgeon's idea of release, maybe by late April, is to get through the doors of a restaurant or bar. Both leaders had said they were putting data ahead of dates, but it was the prime minister's dates the public notice, remember and plan on. Travel bookings soared on Monday and Tuesday. Scotland's first minister is warning dates are not much better than ""a finger in the wind"", and depend on a lot of data variables to reach each point. Scotland's travel and tourism industry isn't being given much to plan on. Read more from Douglas here.

But with outdoor sport to resume for children in England from the end of March there are hopes young people in NI will be able to get playing again soon. The Department of Health in NI said it recognised the importance of sport but has concerns over its role in transmission of coronavirus. Watch as parents share their hopes.

The Department of Health told the BBC there are 1.12 million of these masks either in use or in hospital stores and has told staff to stop using them. Distribution of some gloves has also been suspended because they may not meet technical requirements. The Department of Health said safety of frontline staff was an absolute priority. Its warning concerns a specific brand of FFP3 mask, which are more sophisticated than surgical masks and are worn in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols. Update: The DHSC originally told the BBC 12 million face masks had
been affected. It has since said this figure is incorrect, and the number is
1.12 million. BBC Radio 5 Live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Keighlie Holt has not been able to work as a hairdresser and is retraining as a social media analyst The unemployment rate has risen to its highest level in almost five years, with younger workers bearing the brunt of the job losses, official figures show. The UK's jobless rate rose to 5.1% in the three months to December,external, with the number of people on company payrolls down 726,000 on pre-pandemic levels. Almost three-fifths of these were younger than 25 years. There were, however, some early signs of stabilisation in the jobs market. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a small increase in the numbers of employees paid through payroll over the past couple of months, with 83,000 more people on the books in January compared with the previous month. Average pay rose, too, by 4.7% including bonuses, although this was said to be a statistical quirk rather than a sign of lasting wage growth, Statisticians said this was partly because of the disproportionate fall in the number of young, typically lower-paid workers. Adjusting for this, the ONS said underlying wage growth was ""likely to be under 3%"". The ONS said 1.74 million people were unemployed in the October to December period, up 454,000 from the same quarter in 2019. How high could the unemployment rate go? ""Our survey shows that the unemployment rate has had the biggest annual rise since the financial crisis,"" said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics. ""However, the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for work has stabilised after rising sharply at the start of the pandemic, with many people who lost their jobs early on having now started looking for work."" More than half of UK firms plan to hire new staff Fewest firms planning job cuts since Covid began Despite this, Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that the true underlying picture was not yet clear due to the high number of people still on furlough. He said figures from early February suggested that about six million people were currently furloughed, adding: ""There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what will happen to them when that scheme ends."" The Bank of England is forecasting that the unemployment rate will rise sharply, peaking at an estimated 7.8% later in the year. Keighlie Holt is a 20 year-old hairdresser from Blackpool, which has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. The impact of covid on her industry means she has has only worked for a fraction of the year. She is now retraining as a social media analyst: ""Last year I did what felt like, literally, three months of work. ""December wasn't anywhere near what it's like on any other December, that's normally our busiest time. And then it just wasn't going to go back to normal. No one wanted to get their hair done. No, I wasn't going anywhere."" Today's labour market figures show that pay was up by an average of nearly 5% compared with a year ago - a much bigger pay rise than has been typical for most of the past decade. If you're an employee you may not recognise that figure as anywhere near your own pay rise; a big part of it is because it is an average figure. If you remove nearly 730,000 workers from employers' payrolls, many of whom have been in low-paid occupations such as accommodation and food services - where pay rises have been modest or non-existent - then it flatters the average. However, even allowing for those ""compositional"" effects, the Office for National Statistics estimates that there was still pay growth of 3% overall - far more than inflation at 0.7%. And in some sectors it was better than that: according to the ONS, pay in health and social work rose by an average of 6.2% - some modest compensation, perhaps, for the risks those workers have been taking. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing for next week's Budget, which is expected to set out further plans to help the labour market. ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy,"" Mr Sunak said. ""At the Budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery."" Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, claimed some businesses were ""throwing in the towel"" because the government was taking too long to confirm what business support would be available to them over the next six months. Ms Dodds criticised the government for announcing its roadmap to ending lockdown ""without the clarity of business support"".  She told the BBC ministers ""may relish the theatre of budget"" but it was ""wrong to put decisions off until the Budget"", as some businesses had decided to ""give up"".

"An FFP3 mask, not the brand being withdrawn by the Department of Health A million high-grade masks used in the NHS may not meet the right safety standards and have been withdrawn. The Department of Health told the BBC there are 1.12 million of these masks either in use or in hospital stores and has told staff to stop using them. Distribution of some gloves has also been suspended because they may not meet technical requirements. The Department of Health said safety of frontline staff was an absolute priority. Its warning concerns a specific brand of FFP3 mask, which are more sophisticated than surgical masks and are worn in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. The British Medical Associationappealed last monthfor staff on general wards to be given this type of mask to guard against coronavirus infection. Call for better virus masks for all medical staff Coronavirus: Has the NHS got enough PPE? Covid PPE: Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used The Department of Health and Social Care's (DHSC)alert last week,externalwarned that a certain type of FFP3 -  branded ""Fang Tian"" and marked as FT-045 - may not meet the required technical specifications. It advised health and care providers to check to see if their stock included the product and to stop using them until further investigation. The alert said the masks were provided by Polyco Healthline, but the manufacturer Suzhou Fangtian Industries told the BBC it had never supplied the firm. The BBC has approached Polyco Healthline for comment but has not heard back. The DHSC told BBC News the affected 1.12 million masks was a very small proportion of its overall stocks. These masks make up approximately 4% of its overall stock, the department said, and about 1.7% of the masks used every day. A spokesman said there was a ""resilient supply"" of FFP3 masks to ensure staff had access to the PPE they needed. The Department of Health and Social Care has withdrawn the masks over safety concerns The DHSC also issued an alert about ""nitri-hand"" non-sterile nitrile examination gloves - 27 million of these have been supplied by Full Support Group since June last year. The packaging for the gloves is understood to say they had not been tested for resistance to virus. But the supplier, Full Support Group, told BBC News they had in fact passed the test and the packaging should have been amended. ""We are confident that the gloves in question, having been checked and confirmed that they meet the requirements, will be released from quarantine as soon as the administrative process has been completed,"" a spokesman from the supplier said. He added that Full Support had successfully supplied the NHS since 2002. The DHSC said the batch of gloves represented a very small proportion of overall supply. But Rob Harwood, BMA consultants committee chairman, said it was ""unacceptable if staff's safety is still being jeopardised by inadequate PPE"" a year into the pandemic. ""Healthcare staff working on the frontline do so facing the grave risk of contracting Covid, and deserve the best protection from this deadly virus,"" he said. ""Many will be incredibly concerned to learn that some masks designed to offer enhanced protection, as well as gloves, may not meet standards, potentially placing them at greater risk."" He said it was ""good"" to see immediate action but ""urgent clarification"" was needed to explain ""how they entered the supply chain"". The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Our priority is providing frontline staff with quality PPE that meets robust quality requirements, and we have delivered nearly eight billion items so far. ""We carry out extensive due diligence on all PPE items before release, and where an issue is identified we act quickly to isolate the relevant product and conduct the appropriate investigations."" BBC News has been investigating the purchase of PPE for NHS staff since the beginning of the pandemic. It has previously revealedhow millions of face masks bought by the UK government could not be usedin the NHS as intended. Last week the High Court ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancockhad acted unlawfullywhen his department did not reveal details of contracts it had agreed during the pandemic within 30 days of them being signed.

"Boris Johnson says the government will look at the use of vaccine passports, but there are complex issues to consider The UK PM is ""optimistic"" Covid restrictions in England can be lifted on 21 June - the end of a four-step lockdown easing First Minister Nicola Sturgeon set out her plan for easing the lockdown in Scotland The Scottish government hopes to lift the stay at home restriction from 5 April, she says From the end of April, she expects a phased reopening of the economy including: non-essential retail, hospitality, gyms and hairdressers If all goes to plan, Scotland will return to varying levels of restrictions from the last week in April UK unemployment rate rises to 5.1% in the three months to December, official figures show 1.1 million high-grade masks used in the NHS may not meet the right safety standards and have been withdrawn A further 548 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test; there have been 8,489 more cases Edited by Claire Heald and James Clarke We're wrapping up for the evening.

Nicola Sturgeon announcing the plans to reopen Scotland's economy We're about to bring our live coverage of the latest events in the pandemic to an end. Thank you for joining us. Before we go, here's a round-up of the main headlines from today:  A woman who deliberately coughed at police investigating a breach of coronavirus restrictions has been jailed for four months. Lisa Dawn Fisher was verbally abusive when the officers called at a flat in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, on 30 January. The 31-year-old, who admitted two counts of assault against an emergency worker, was sentenced at Scarborough Magistrates' Court on 17 February. She was also ordered to pay Â£75 compensation. North Yorkshire Police say there has been an increase in assaults against emergency service workers. Read more here. We've heard before about outbreaks of coronavirus at prisons across the UK - withdata showing a surge last autumn. Now, a privately-run jail in Cambridgeshire says a number of staff and prisoners have tested positive in half of its 12 male wings. Last year one of HMP Peterborough's inmatesdied after contracting Covid-19. Sodexo says the ""current situation is well controlled and under constant review"", adding the virus has not been detected in the separate women's jail. There's more here.

Dawn Lapthorn, from Plymouth in Devon, posts videos of herself dressed in an inflatable dinosaur costume to the group, which amassed more than 1,000 members in just over a day. People have also started sharing their own videos in the group. Ms Lapthorn says she is looking forward to a ""mass gathering of all these dinosaurs"" when it is allowed. Watch the dinosaurs doing their thing above. Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The Republic of Ireland is to continue at its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions until at least 5 April. The widely expected decision to maintain Level Five has been taken at a cabinet meeting today. But primary schools will reopen on Monday for the four youngest age groups, with final year secondary students also returning then. Other pupils and students will resume their schooling in a phased manner over the coming weeks, along with pre-school childcare. The Irish government has decided to take a cautious approach to easing its lockdown, arguing its aim is the long-term suppression of the virus. Ireland's vaccination programme has been hampered by supply issues and the relatively late authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the European Medicines Agency. But the Republic is near the top of the EU league in vaccinating people, once the injections arrive in the state. Read more here. A police officer has been dismissed after she attended a four-person gathering during lockdown and then crashed her car into a shop while drunk. PC Tasia Stephens, 24, from South Wales Police, lost her job and was barred from working in the profession again. She admitted gross misconduct at a tribunal, after attending the party last April during the first lockdown. She has since been sentenced after admitting drink-driving. PC Stephens' representative had argued she had been ""distressed"" after recently dealing with her first sudden death while on duty. Read the full story here. One of today's main areas of focus has been the Scottish Parliament where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was setting out how lockdown restrictions will ease. Here's how she made the announcement this afternoon. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Scotland's economy to begin to reopen at the end of April' A Covid-19 antibodies survey in Nigeria suggests four million people in Lagos state alone have had the virus - more than has been officially recorded for the whole of Africa. The official figure for Nigeria is 153,000 cases with 1,862 deaths. The study was done on 10,000 people from four Nigerian states to estimate the extent of coronavirus in Africa's most populous nation. It was conducted in September and October - before a second wave began in early December. Nigeria recorded its highest daily infection rate in January, when it logged 1,600 new cases, suggesting many more people were infected in the second wave. Find out more about the survey here. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures showing a further 8,489 coronavirus cases have been recorded and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. It shows the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital continue to fall. In the past 24 hours we've also heard a lot fromboth Boris JohnsonandNicola Sturgeonas they set out their plans to ease lockdown in England and Scotland. But both of them were clear - decisions around lockdown would be based on the data, and dependent on the current positive trends continuing. In England, there are four tests to taking each step of lockdown easing and they consider things like the infection rate and number of people in hospital. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter More than 30
posts in violation of Facebook's policy on harmful misinformation and
harassment have been removed following BBC Panorama's investigation into the
impact of anti-vaccine disinformation online. AfterVaccines: the disinformation waraired, a number of fake newspaper front pages attributed to the Times, the Sun
and the Daily Mail promoting falsehoods about the coronavirus vaccine were
shared on Facebook in a bid to attack the programme. I was also
targeted with threats and abuse by anti-vaccine activists on Instagram and
Facebook, some of which have also now been removed. A
Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We have removed the violating content
brought to our attention and continue to investigate and monitor the accounts
responsible."" Panorama's investigation revealed how videos promoting claims about the vaccine
that are contrary to scientific evidence have caused real-world harm, affecting
communities across the UK. Thesecontinue to circulatein Facebook groups
and on Whatsapp, which Facebook owns. Meanwhile,
exclusive research by BBC Monitoring exposed a huge increase in followers of
accounts promoting anti-vaccine claims on Instagram in particular. Facebook
says it removes harmful misinformation and actively promotes good information
about Covid, including vaccines. Only eight African countries have a compulsory system to register deaths, a BBC investigation has found. All of the countries surveyed by the BBC have some sort of death registration but it is often on paper and not available in a shareable digitised form. The information may be used in a local area but cannot calculate mortality trends on a national level. Only Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Cape Verde, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, Seychelles and Mauritius have functioning, compulsory and universal civil registration systems that record deaths. That's compared to all but two countries in Europe - Albania and Monaco - and just over half in Asia, analysis of UN data shows. It has been widely reported that Africa's Covid-19 death toll is far lower than in other parts of the world - but there is a concern its true extent in some countries is not fully understood. Africa's data gap could have enormous policy implications. Having an accurate picture of who is dying, from what and where, is crucial when it comes to allocating resources and funding. ""In order to help the living, we need to count the dead,"" UN Population Fund demographer Romesh Silva tells the BBC. Read more about thedata gap and why it matters here. BBC Radio 5 Live Professor Melinda Mills from the University of Oxford was the lead author of a report published last week into vaccination passports.

""I have family in Canada that I would desperately love to visit and in the Netherlands so I think itâs coming for international travel,"" she said. ""As long as itâs really clear and thereâs agreed-upon standards, and theyâre clear about the data privacy, yes, of course I would like that.

Many businesses have been asking when they will be allowed to reopen. Now they have some rough indication, pencilled in to the calendar, but far from all of them, and with distancing still required. In contrast with Boris Johnson's approach for England,Nicola Sturgeon's statement at Holyroodwas not a route map to a late summer of socialising, concerts, sports and travel. The plan is far more cautious. Nicola Sturgeon's idea of release, maybe by late April, is to get through the doors of a restaurant or bar. Both leaders had said they were putting data ahead of dates, but it was the prime minister's dates the public notice, remember and plan on. Travel bookings soared on Monday and Tuesday. Scotland's first minister is warning dates are not much better than ""a finger in the wind"", and depend on a lot of data variables to reach each point. Scotland's travel and tourism industry isn't being given much to plan on. Read more from Douglas here. Front-line health workers, the elderly, and people with chronic diseases are being prioritised in Lebanon The World Bank has threatened to suspend financing for
Lebanonâs Covid-19 vaccination programme amid allegations that people are
receiving shots without registering or waiting their turn. Lebanon launched the programme
on 14 February with 28,000 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines purchased withsome of the $34m (Â£24m) in aid it has been allocated,external. To ensure fair and transparent distribution, the government
asked everyone to register with an online platform, whose algorithms prioritise
recipients based on agreed criteria. Health workers, the elderly, and people
with chronic diseases are meant to be vaccinated first. However, it was not long before complaints about âviolationsâ
emerged in a country where corruption and mismanagement have been blamed for an
unprecedented economic crisis and the devastating explosion at Beirutâs port last
August. After several members of parliament were vaccinated on
Tuesday, World Bank regional director Saroj Kumar Jha warned
of consequences if people were found to be queue jumping. He added that the World Bank had asked monitors to verify that vaccination centres were adhering to the rules, adding the hashtag â#NoWastaâ. âWastaâ is an Arabic term for nepotism or influence. Parliamentâs Secretary-General, Adnan Daher, told the National News Agency thatthe lawmakers had been registered and that âtheir turn had comeâ,external. The sister of broadcaster Jo Whiley has thanked NHS staff and well-wishers who helped her after she contracted coronavirus. Whiley revealed last week that Frances, who has learning difficulties and diabetes, was admitted to hospital with Covid. In a tweet,external, Jo said: ""Itâs hard to believe weâve gone from discussing palliative care on Friday night to sitting on her favourite bench drinking cups of tea."" But she added: ""Covid has brought with it further complications. We're now dealing with worrying diabetes and high blood pressure issues and my parents are exhausted beyond belief."" Under a video clip of Frances giving a thumbs up and clapping, Jo said her sister ""would like to say a huge thank you to everybody who has helped her, especially the amazing doctors and nurses of the NHS, and her many many well-wishers"". She earlierquestioned why she was offered the vaccine before her sister, who has the rare genetic syndrome Cri du Chat, but said it was possibly because she was deemed a carer for her sister.

But with outdoor sport to resume for children in England from the end of March there are hopes young people in NI will be able to get playing again soon. The Department of Health in NI said it recognised the importance of sport but has concerns over its role in transmission of coronavirus. Watch as parents share their hopes. We've heard today about Scotland's plans to leave lockdown, and yesterday Boris Johnson set out his plan for England. Northern Ireland has renewed its restrictions to 1 April, but what about Wales?

The Department of Health told the BBC there are 1.12 million of these masks either in use or in hospital stores and has told staff to stop using them. Distribution of some gloves has also been suspended because they may not meet technical requirements. The Department of Health said safety of frontline staff was an absolute priority. Its warning concerns a specific brand of FFP3 mask, which are more sophisticated than surgical masks and are worn in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols. Update: The DHSC originally told the BBC 12 million face masks had
been affected. It has since said this figure is incorrect, and the number is
1.12 million. BBC Radio 5 Live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Vanessa Bryant said Meek Mill's lyrics lacked ""respect and tact"" Vanessa Bryant has criticised rapper Meek Mill over a song that references her late husband, the basketball star Kobe Bryant. Don't Worry (RIP Kobe) contains the lyric: ""If I ever lack, I'm goin' out with my chopper, it be another Kobe.""

Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The Republic of Ireland is to continue at its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions until at least 5 April. The widely expected decision to maintain Level Five has been taken at a cabinet meeting today. But primary schools will reopen on Monday for the four youngest age groups, with final year secondary students also returning then. Other pupils and students will resume their schooling in a phased manner over the coming weeks, along with pre-school childcare. The Irish government has decided to take a cautious approach to easing its lockdown, arguing its aim is the long-term suppression of the virus. Ireland's vaccination programme has been hampered by supply issues and the relatively late authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the European Medicines Agency. But the Republic is near the top of the EU league in vaccinating people, once the injections arrive in the state. Read more here. A police officer has been dismissed after she attended a four-person gathering during lockdown and then crashed her car into a shop while drunk. PC Tasia Stephens, 24, from South Wales Police, lost her job and was barred from working in the profession again. She admitted gross misconduct at a tribunal, after attending the party last April during the first lockdown. She has since been sentenced after admitting drink-driving. PC Stephens' representative had argued she had been ""distressed"" after recently dealing with her first sudden death while on duty. Read the full story here. One of today's main areas of focus has been the Scottish Parliament where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was setting out how lockdown restrictions will ease. Here's how she made the announcement this afternoon. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Scotland's economy to begin to reopen at the end of April' A Covid-19 antibodies survey in Nigeria suggests four million people in Lagos state alone have had the virus - more than has been officially recorded for the whole of Africa. The official figure for Nigeria is 153,000 cases with 1,862 deaths. The study was done on 10,000 people from four Nigerian states to estimate the extent of coronavirus in Africa's most populous nation. It was conducted in September and October - before a second wave began in early December. Nigeria recorded its highest daily infection rate in January, when it logged 1,600 new cases, suggesting many more people were infected in the second wave. Find out more about the survey here. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures showing a further 8,489 coronavirus cases have been recorded and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. It shows the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital continue to fall. In the past 24 hours we've also heard a lot fromboth Boris JohnsonandNicola Sturgeonas they set out their plans to ease lockdown in England and Scotland. But both of them were clear - decisions around lockdown would be based on the data, and dependent on the current positive trends continuing. In England, there are four tests to taking each step of lockdown easing and they consider things like the infection rate and number of people in hospital.

Facebook, some of which have also now been removed. A
Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We have removed the violating content

that are contrary to scientific evidence have caused real-world harm, affecting
communities across the UK. Thesecontinue to circulatein Facebook groups

exclusive research by BBC Monitoring exposed a huge increase in followers of
accounts promoting anti-vaccine claims on Instagram in particular. Facebook
says it removes harmful misinformation and actively promotes good information
about Covid, including vaccines. Only eight African countries have a compulsory system to register deaths, a BBC investigation has found. All of the countries surveyed by the BBC have some sort of death registration but it is often on paper and not available in a shareable digitised form. The information may be used in a local area but cannot calculate mortality trends on a national level. Only Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Cape Verde, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, Seychelles and Mauritius have functioning, compulsory and universal civil registration systems that record deaths. That's compared to all but two countries in Europe - Albania and Monaco - and just over half in Asia, analysis of UN data shows. It has been widely reported that Africa's Covid-19 death toll is far lower than in other parts of the world - but there is a concern its true extent in some countries is not fully understood. Africa's data gap could have enormous policy implications. Having an accurate picture of who is dying, from what and where, is crucial when it comes to allocating resources and funding.

Many businesses have been asking when they will be allowed to reopen. Now they have some rough indication, pencilled in to the calendar, but far from all of them, and with distancing still required. In contrast with Boris Johnson's approach for England,Nicola Sturgeon's statement at Holyroodwas not a route map to a late summer of socialising, concerts, sports and travel. The plan is far more cautious. Nicola Sturgeon's idea of release, maybe by late April, is to get through the doors of a restaurant or bar.

"Holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since the plan for easing lockdown was unveiled. Despite questions over the return of international travel, the UK's biggest holiday firm, Tui, said bookings for foreign trips jumped 500% overnight. The owner of UK-based holiday firms Hoseasons and Cottages.com said it sold a record 10,000 breaks. The government said a decision on easing international travel would not happen until mid-May at the earliest. But Tui said its bookings for July-onwards had soared with Greece, Spain and Turkey the most popular destinations. Amid uncertainty over when foreign travel will be allowed, some holidaymakers have their sights set on a UK break. Simon Altham, group chief commercial officer at Awaze, the company behind Hoseasons, said: ""Last year following similar announcements we saw bookings peak at one every 11 seconds, but this time demand has exceeded our expectations and comfortably broken that record."" Nat Sommers has booked a break in Yorkshire Nat Sommers told the BBC she had booked a family trip to Yorkshire after Boris had announced his plans to ease lockdown. ""We'd been keeping our eye on a few places over the last few weeks in anticipation of lockdown being eased,"" she said. ""We just decided to go for it an book it in the hope that things would be back to relative normality come August."" Boris Johnson has said a global travel taskforce would put forward a report by 12 April on how to return to international travel. The government would then make a decision on removing restrictions on international travel, but not before 17 May at the earliest. What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? When can I go on holiday in the UK or travel abroad? Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' As the government has said dates could move for the start of international travel, Tui has said that anyone due to travel between 17 May and the end of June can change their booking to a later date without a fee. Andrew Flintham, managing director for Tui UK and Ireland, described the government's steps as ""positive"". Thomas Cook said traffic to its website was up over 100% on Monday from 15:00 GMT onwards, with bookings ""flooding in"" for countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. ""The government's announcement today is good news for those of us desperate to get away on holiday,"" said Thomas Cook's chief executive Alan French. ""While we await more details, it's clear that the government's ambition is to open up international travel in the coming months and hopefully in time for the summer holidays."" There was a big leap in family bookings for the summer holidays, especially for August, as well as people booking for the October half term and Christmas, a Thomas Cook spokesman said. Crete has seen a surge in bookings, according to EasyJet EasyJet reported a 337% surge in flight bookings and a 630% jump in holiday bookings for locations such as Alicante, Malaga, Palmo, Faro and Crete. The airline's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said Boris Johnson's announcement had ""provided a much-needed boost in confidence"" for its UK customers. 'We're delighted to have dates to work towards' Plans to reopen England's shops and gyms in April ""We have consistently seen that there is pent up demand for travel and this surge in bookings shows that this signal from the government that it plans to reopen travel has been what UK consumers have been waiting for,"" he said. Tour operator and airline Jet2 also reported a 1,000% increase in bookings in the 24 hours following the prime minister's announcement. Popular destinations include Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, with a notable spike in demand from July onwards. Its chief executive, Steve Heapy, said: ""The government's announcement is the news [holidaymakers] have been longing for, and the continued surge in bookings shows how ready our customers are to get away to the sunshine on a real package holiday."" While bookings are high, there are still plenty of questions about how international travel will resume - and no guarantees that it will start again in mid-May. The industry has seen restrictions put on top of restrictions over the last few months, with visitors from entire continents banned, the introduction of quarantine hotels and multiple tests required. Removing them will take some careful unpicking. The government has said that any removal will depend on the location of concerning variants, progress of vaccine rollouts here and abroad as well as death rates and hospital admissions. It's also not just about us. Other countries will need to agree to allow British tourists in. But after fears they could be left off the roadmap, the travel industry is keen to make this plan and these dates work. Amanda Matthews, managing director and owner of Ramsbottom-based luxury travel agency network Designer Travel, said her firm had seen double the number of enquiries and new bookings for the summer. ""But we've also had hundreds of calls from people who've got bookings for travel in March, April, May and June - still very uncertain about whether they will be travelling or not,"" she told the BBC. ""Because there's no concrete date yet for the reopening of international travel, as a travel agent, we can't answer our existing clients' questions about holidays they've already booked for spring and summer. We've got no idea."" Designer Travel owner Amanda Matthews says her firm saw double the usual number of enquiries on Monday While the roadmap has provided hope for summer holidays, retail expert Kate Hardcastle said there was also ""huge disappointment"" for the travel industry - particularly among domestic overnight accommodation providers such as mobile home holiday parks and holiday cottage providers. ""Easter is obviously a critical part of the travel calendar for travel agencies and the industry, so it's a lost opportunity, one less holiday to be able to sell within,"" she told the BBC. ""I also know a lot of families are dependent on Easter holidays as it tends to be cheaper and more cost effective than the summer holidays. It would be awful to think that some people are completely priced out of a holiday this year."" But data from hotel technology company Avvio suggests a heyday for upmarket UK hotels, with August revenue for 4- and 5-star hotels more than tripling as would-be holiday makers bank on domestic breaks being more likely. On Tuesday, global hotels group InterContinental Hotels, which owns the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn brands, said the sector was unlikely to see a recovery until later this year, dependent on vaccine rollouts. ""2021 has begun with many of these challenges still in place,"" chief executive Keith Barr said, as the company unveiled a $260m (Â£185m) loss.

"The latest lockdown started in Wales just before Christmas It is ""impossible"" to give a date for the end of lockdown restrictions, one of Wales' top doctors says. Dr Chris Jones, deputy chief medical officer, said there was a ""real risk"" of a third wave of Covid-19 cases if restrictions eased too quickly. He was speaking afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a plan to end lockdown in England, by 21 June. The Conservativeshave called for the Welsh Government to produce a roadmapfor the end of the Covid lockdown. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Jones said there were ""probably greater risks"" now than at previous points in the pandemic because of the more transmissible variants. He told Claire Summers that opening schools ""has a definite effect on the R-rate"", and how the new variants will affect infections is ""uncertain"". What's England's roadmap for lifting lockdown? PM unveils plan to end England lockdown by 21 June Tories demand Welsh Covid roadmap after PM's plan Four more Covid deaths reported in Wales ""It is absolutely impossible in my view to say that on any one date in several months, that this will be the situation,"" he said in response to a question about Mr Johnson's announcement. ""I think we have to take things step by step."" He said all the UK's chief medical officers ""share the same view about the risks associated with relaxing restrictions,"" but added politicians had ""very difficult decisions"" to make. But he said ""messaging to the public"" was ""very important"". ""To send the message that everything is going to be back to normal in a few months time, I think, is almost too open,"" he said. ""We are not out of the woods yet. There is a real risk of a third wave if restrictions are eased too quickly. ""We hope, from our cautious approach and step-by-step approach, will minimise the risk of that."" In England, the prime minister has set out a four-stage plan beginning on 8 March, with ""at least"" five weeks between each of the stages to allow time to assess the impact of relaxing some restrictions to be felt, and prepare for the next stage if possible. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon haspublished a ""cautious"" framework to ending restrictionsthere, with the reopening of shops, bars, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers expected to start from 26 April. She said it was hoped that Scotland's stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April. However, Northern Irelandhas renewed lockdown measuresuntil 1 April. Children in England are due to return to the classroom on 8 March. In Wales, Foundation phase children, aged three to seven, are returning to school this week. Ysgol Gymraeg Sant Baruc in Barry had pupils back in class on Monday If conditions regarding the virus continue to improve, all primary years will be back in school on 15 March, along with pupils in exam years 11 and 13, and some pupils in years 10 and 12 who are due to sit exams. However, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said not all of those secondary-age pupils would be back in full time, which she hopes will happen from 12 April. In Scotland all primary pupils and S4 to S6 secondary students could return to school from 15 March, but pupils in the first three years of secondary school are unlikely to return until after Easter. This video can not be played ""We can't see mum unless she has hours to live"" From 8 March in England, one nominated person will be able to visit a care home resident, but there is no date for this in Wales, where care home visits remain banned. Care Forum Wales is working with the Welsh Government to ""formulate a safe policy for visiting"". Someone who is very keen to see visits start is Jen Sutton. Jen Sutton has only had one outdoor visit with her mother since last March Her mother Liz Jones is 82 and lives in a care home in Aberystwyth. Ms Sutton, who lives in Cardiff, is an only child and used to visit her mother regularly until the pandemic struck. Liz Jones has not seen her daughter face to face since the summer ""I haven't seen her indoors since March and the only other visit I've had is 20 minutes in a garden pod end of July, beginning of August. Then they closed down again for various reasons. I've seen her on Skype but it's not the same,"" she said. ""I'd just like to see her through a window. If it meant me isolating for 10 days beforehand I would do that. I don't particularly want to go in. I'm quite happy to wave through a window. ""It's a human right isn't it, to see your family. It's not too much to ask."" This is one of the areas where Wales could be moving more quickly than England. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said some non-essential shops and hairdressers could reopen on 15 March. But this has raised questions over prioritising this when large numbers of secondary pupils will remain unable to return to the classroom. England is due to reopen all shops on 12 April, while in Scotland the provisional date is 26 April. The rule change could see grandparents get to hold their new born grandchildren for the first time For most of us the rules for who we can meet indoors remain limited to the people we live with. Until 27 February, only those who lived alone - or are single and live in a house share - and single parents had been able to form a so-called ""support bubble"". However, nowfamilies with babies are now allowed to meet up with one other householdto form a bubble. It means anyone with a child under the age of one can form an exclusive support bubble with another household, allowing them to meet indoors, and stay overnight in each others homes. The rule change also allows teenagers - aged 16 to 17 - who do not live with an adult to form a support bubble with another household. Since Saturday 20 February , people in Wales have been able to exercise in groups of four, but only from a maximum of two households, and it must be exercise rather than ""socialising"", Mr Drakeford said. In England, from 8 March people can exercise with one other person not from their household, but they will also be allowed to meet outdoors on a park bench for a chat, for example, expressly for the purpose of socialising. In Scotland a provisional date of 15 March has been given for four people from two households to be allowed to meet outdoors. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Then from 29 March, people in England will be able to meet in groups of up to six people from different households, or two groups from two households. They will be able to do this in private gardens as well as public spaces. Could holiday accommodation such as at Bluestone near Narberth open for Easter? Discussions have been ongoing in Wales with the tourism sector about a potential reopening at Easter. The country is again likely to be ahead of England on this, although no firm date has been mentioned yet, and Mr Drakeford said it would not be opened ""in one go"". Mr Johnson's roadmap has holidays in self-contained accommodation used by one household being allowed from 12 April at the earliest, which misses the school holidays completely. Mr Drakeford has talked of easing the stay at home requirement at the lockdown review on 12 March, if cases continue to decreased. However he has said there could be a ""stay local"" requirement in place, as there was in the arrangements during the autumn for people to remain in their local authority area. Mr Johnson has said the stay at home rule in England will end on 29 March but people should stay as local as possible, while in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April. No dates for community sport have been given for Wales At present, only certain elite athletes in Wales are allowed to train together. No dates have been mooted so far to allow people to get together for sport, including more individual distanced pursuits like golf or singles' tennis. There are also no plans to reopen gyms. In England, outdoor sports venues and formally organised outdoor sports can resume from 29 March. Gyms will be able to open from 12 April at the earliest. While in Scotland the possible date for reopening gyms and swimming pools has been mooted as 26 April. Currently in Wales, only register offices and places of worship are open to perform marriages and guests are limited to the number who can be accommodated in the venue under the 2m social distancing regulations for different households. From 1 March, licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen for ceremonies. In England, six people can currently attend but ceremonies are limited to those in exceptional circumstances, such as those who are terminally ill. From 8 March, all weddings with six people will be allowed. This will expand to 15 people on 12 April and 30 people on 17 May. Drinkers will not be going inside a Welsh pub any time soon Not any time soon in Wales, in a nutshell. There has been no date mooted, and Mr Drakeford said closures were unlikely to be revoked in the next six weeks. In England, it is hoped people will be able to visit outdoor seating in restaurants and pubs from 12 April, and move indoors from 17 May. Meanwhile in Scotland pubs could reopen on 26 April.

"A montage of photographs of the 17,300-year-old kangaroo rock painting (left) and an illustration of the artwork (right) Australian scientists have discovered the country's oldest known rock art - a 17,300-year-old painting of a kangaroo. The artwork measuring 2m (6.5ft) was painted in red ochre on the ceiling of a rock shelter. It was found in Western Australia's Kimberley region, known for its Aboriginal rock paintings. Its age was determined by radiocarbon-dating ancient mud wasp nests.The findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour,external. Mud wasp nests were used to date the artwork Researcher Damien Finch, who pioneered the mud wasp dating technique, said it was rare to find mud wasp nests both on top and underneath a single artwork. But the team was able to sample both types to establish the artwork's minimum and maximum ages. ""We radiocarbon dated three wasp nests underlying the painting and three nests built over it to determine, confidently, that the painting is between 17,500 and 17,100 years old; most likely 17,300 years old,"" said Dr Finch, a geochronologist from the University of Melbourne. Scientists saythis estimation makes the artwork the oldest known intact painting in Australia.,external Mud wasps used to date aboriginal rock art The painting was found within this rock shelter in Kimberley The study's co-author Dr Sven Ouzman, from the University of Western Australia, added there could be a link between the kangaroo painting and the ancient art from other regions. ""This iconic kangaroo image is visually similar to rock paintings from islands in South East Asia dated to more than 40,000 years ago, suggesting a cultural link - and hinting at still older rock art in Australia,"" he said. Earlier this year,researchers found the world's oldest animal cave painting, a 45,000-year-old life-sized depiction of a pig, on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. In South Africa, ahashtag-like doodle created 73,000 years agois believed to be the oldest known drawing. Cissy Gore-Birch, chair of the Balanggarra Aboriginal Corporation, noted the significance of the kangaroo rock art discovery for Aboriginal people and Australians. ""It's important that Indigenous knowledge and stories are not lost and continue to be shared for generations to come,"" she said. This video can not be played Cave paintings as old as those found in Europe have been found in Indonesia, raising new questions about early mankind and the development of art in prehistoric times.

"Keighlie Holt has not been able to work as a hairdresser and is retraining as a social media analyst The unemployment rate has risen to its highest level in almost five years, with younger workers bearing the brunt of the job losses, official figures show. The UK's jobless rate rose to 5.1% in the three months to December,external, with the number of people on company payrolls down 726,000 on pre-pandemic levels. Almost three-fifths of these were younger than 25 years. There were, however, some early signs of stabilisation in the jobs market. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a small increase in the numbers of employees paid through payroll over the past couple of months, with 83,000 more people on the books in January compared with the previous month. Average pay rose, too, by 4.7% including bonuses, although this was said to be a statistical quirk rather than a sign of lasting wage growth, Statisticians said this was partly because of the disproportionate fall in the number of young, typically lower-paid workers. Adjusting for this, the ONS said underlying wage growth was ""likely to be under 3%"". The ONS said 1.74 million people were unemployed in the October to December period, up 454,000 from the same quarter in 2019. How high could the unemployment rate go? ""Our survey shows that the unemployment rate has had the biggest annual rise since the financial crisis,"" said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics. ""However, the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for work has stabilised after rising sharply at the start of the pandemic, with many people who lost their jobs early on having now started looking for work."" More than half of UK firms plan to hire new staff Fewest firms planning job cuts since Covid began Despite this, Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that the true underlying picture was not yet clear due to the high number of people still on furlough. He said figures from early February suggested that about six million people were currently furloughed, adding: ""There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what will happen to them when that scheme ends."" The Bank of England is forecasting that the unemployment rate will rise sharply, peaking at an estimated 7.8% later in the year. Keighlie Holt is a 20 year-old hairdresser from Blackpool, which has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. The impact of covid on her industry means she has has only worked for a fraction of the year. She is now retraining as a social media analyst: ""Last year I did what felt like, literally, three months of work. ""December wasn't anywhere near what it's like on any other December, that's normally our busiest time. And then it just wasn't going to go back to normal. No one wanted to get their hair done. No, I wasn't going anywhere."" Today's labour market figures show that pay was up by an average of nearly 5% compared with a year ago - a much bigger pay rise than has been typical for most of the past decade. If you're an employee you may not recognise that figure as anywhere near your own pay rise; a big part of it is because it is an average figure. If you remove nearly 730,000 workers from employers' payrolls, many of whom have been in low-paid occupations such as accommodation and food services - where pay rises have been modest or non-existent - then it flatters the average. However, even allowing for those ""compositional"" effects, the Office for National Statistics estimates that there was still pay growth of 3% overall - far more than inflation at 0.7%. And in some sectors it was better than that: according to the ONS, pay in health and social work rose by an average of 6.2% - some modest compensation, perhaps, for the risks those workers have been taking. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing for next week's Budget, which is expected to set out further plans to help the labour market. ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy,"" Mr Sunak said. ""At the Budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery."" Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, claimed some businesses were ""throwing in the towel"" because the government was taking too long to confirm what business support would be available to them over the next six months. Ms Dodds criticised the government for announcing its roadmap to ending lockdown ""without the clarity of business support"".  She told the BBC ministers ""may relish the theatre of budget"" but it was ""wrong to put decisions off until the Budget"", as some businesses had decided to ""give up"".

"This video can not be played Biden: ""This nation will smile again"" President Joe Biden has addressed the nation as the US passed the figure of 500,000 Covid-related deaths, the highest number of any country. ""As a nation, we can't accept such a cruel fate. We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow,"" he said on Monday. The president and vice-president, and their spouses, then observed a moment of silence outside the White House during a candle-lighting ceremony. Confirmed US infections now stand at 28.1 million, also a global record. What 500,000 US deaths look like ""Today I ask all Americans to remember. Remember those we lost and remember those we left behind,"" President Biden said, calling for Americans to fight Covid together. This video can not be played The 'colourful' lives lost to Covid - how obituaries are helping us all mourn The president ordered all flags on federal property to be lowered to half mast for the next five days. At the White House, he opened his speech by noting that the number of American deaths from Covid was higher than the death toll from World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War combined. ""Today we mark a truly grim, heartbreaking milestone - 500,071 dead,"" he said. ""We often hear people described as ordinary Americans,"" he went on to say. ""There's no such thing, there's nothing ordinary about them. The people we lost were extraordinary. They span generations. Born in America, emigrated to America."" ""So many of them took their final breath alone in America."" Family mourn Gregory Blanks, 50, who died with Covid in January in Texas He drew on his own experience with grief - his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 and one of his sons died from brain cancer in 2015. ""I know what it's like to not be there when it happens. I know what it's like when you are there holding their hands; there's a look in their eye and they slip away,"" he said. ""For me, the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose."" Mr Biden's approach to the pandemic is different to his predecessor, Donald Trump, who cast doubt on the impact of the deadly virus and was viewed as having politicised the wearing of masks and other measures needed to prevent the spread of the virus. President Biden, Vice-President Harris, the First Lady and the Second Gentleman during a moment of silence On 19 January, one day before Mr Biden took office, he held an event to mark 400,000 Americans dying of the disease. Monday's event, marking the latest death toll, comes about one month later.

"Nicola Sturgeon is preparing to unveil details of Scotland's path out of lockdown. The return of face-to-face education, sports activities for young people and ""limited"" social interaction for adults will be among the priorities. It will begin with easing current level four restrictions before moving back into a geographically variable system. The first minister has said all decisions will be ""driven by data rather than dates"". She wants the country's gradual emergence from lockdown to be ""phased and sustainable"", with at least three weeks between each phase. Is vaccination slowing Scotland's Covid death rate? Covid deaths falling as vaccine 'having an effect' It comes a day after Scotland's youngest children returned to the classroom for the first time this year, though most pupils continue with home schooling. And it follows Boris Johnson's announcement thatshops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality in England would reopenon 12 April if strict conditions were met as part of a four-step plan to ease lockdown. The first phase of reopening Scotland's schools is underway with P1 to P3 back to face-to-face education The Scottish government has said its priority is still the suppression of the virus to the ""lowest possible level"". The speed at which the changes happen will be largely dictated by Covid rates across the country and the impact that is having on the NHS. How quickly the country is vaccinated will also be a big factor in the changes to lockdown restrictions. The latest statistics show that more than 1.4m have now had their first jab, and the it is now being offered to people withunderlying health conditions, and unpaid carers. Research published on Monday has already revealed the vaccination programme is having a""spectacular"" impact on preventing serious illness. And last week data appeared to show the Covid death rate is falling in older people's care homes - where all residents have now received their first dose. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the percentage of positive test results is a key measure and argues that a rate under 5% shows a country has got Covid under control Ms Sturgeon said: ""We know we cannot continue in lockdown indefinitely and we must plan a gradual phased return to as much normality as possible. ""We hope that more children will be able to return to school later in March. And we have published new guidance to enable aneasing of restrictions on care home visitingfrom early March. ""Beyond that, giving people the ability to meet loved ones, initially outdoors, is a priority for easing restrictions within the current level four."" Ms Sturgeon said the aim was to move Scotland back to a levels system, which would also see the economy gradually reopen. At Monday's government coronavirus briefing, she said she expected Scotland's route of lockdown would have ""broad similarities"" with England but it would not be identical. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that the UK would have to learn to live with coronavirus for some time rather than pursue an elimination strategy to rid the country of it completely. He said such a policy was ""not possible"" for an ""open trading nation"" such as the UK, as the strategy did not work without entirely closing off borders. Instead, he said, the UK's plan was to replace lockdown measures with protection from the vaccine. ""It's because of this incredibly successful vaccine rollout across Scotland and right across the country that we are allâ¦ able to take appropriate steps out of lockdown and keep this virus under control."" The country's business sector is hoping the first minister's announcement will give them a sign of when they can possibly return to normal. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents a number of big bar and restaurant operators, has called for a similar announcement to the UK government's indicative dates for hospitality reopening. The prime minister hopes to see indoor hospitality and hotels reopen on 17 May and all legal limits on social contact lifted on 21 June at the earliest. A SHG spokesman said: ""We desperately want to see Nicola Sturgeon confirm similar plans for Scotland in her statement, and allow us to be a part of that. ""Anything less would be an incredible betrayal of those people whose livelihoods have been under threat for so long."" Meanwhile Tracy Black, the director of the CBI in Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat businesses wanted certainty. ""We think the first minister will be more cautious [than in England],"" she said. ""It's so important to be be able to plan and work with staff so they know when they will come back to work. We need to see support continues if restrictions are in place - we don't want any cliff edges this year."" Ahead of the first minister's announcement, Scottish Labour called for a beefed-up testing system to be put in place. The party's interim leader Jackie Baillie said: ""Infection rates are now being driven down by a combination of lockdown measures and the roll out of the vaccine - but keeping infection rates low will depend on rapidly identifying and containing any outbreaks. ""That is why we are calling for a renewed emphasis on testing - including asymptomatic community testing on a mass scale."" Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Willie Rennie said the country needs to see a ""clear plan for both allowing activities, perhaps outdoor first, to resume and for our NHS to be equipped to deal with the recovery"". He added: ""We also need to see testing ramped up to squash future outbreaks as soon as they occur, as well as certainty for the many businesses who will dread being plunged back into the opaque tiers system.""

Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The Republic of Ireland is to continue at its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions until at least 5 April. The widely expected decision to maintain Level Five has been taken at a cabinet meeting today. But primary schools will reopen on Monday for the four youngest age groups, with final year secondary students also returning then. Other pupils and students will resume their schooling in a phased manner over the coming weeks, along with pre-school childcare. The Irish government has decided to take a cautious approach to easing its lockdown, arguing its aim is the long-term suppression of the virus. Ireland's vaccination programme has been hampered by supply issues and the relatively late authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the European Medicines Agency. But the Republic is near the top of the EU league in vaccinating people, once the injections arrive in the state. Read more here. A police officer has been dismissed after she attended a four-person gathering during lockdown and then crashed her car into a shop while drunk. PC Tasia Stephens, 24, from South Wales Police, lost her job and was barred from working in the profession again. She admitted gross misconduct at a tribunal, after attending the party last April during the first lockdown. She has since been sentenced after admitting drink-driving. PC Stephens' representative had argued she had been ""distressed"" after recently dealing with her first sudden death while on duty. Read the full story here. One of today's main areas of focus has been the Scottish Parliament where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was setting out how lockdown restrictions will ease. Here's how she made the announcement this afternoon. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Scotland's economy to begin to reopen at the end of April' A Covid-19 antibodies survey in Nigeria suggests four million people in Lagos state alone have had the virus - more than has been officially recorded for the whole of Africa. The official figure for Nigeria is 153,000 cases with 1,862 deaths. The study was done on 10,000 people from four Nigerian states to estimate the extent of coronavirus in Africa's most populous nation. It was conducted in September and October - before a second wave began in early December. Nigeria recorded its highest daily infection rate in January, when it logged 1,600 new cases, suggesting many more people were infected in the second wave. Find out more about the survey here. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures showing a further 8,489 coronavirus cases have been recorded and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. It shows the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital continue to fall. In the past 24 hours we've also heard a lot fromboth Boris JohnsonandNicola Sturgeonas they set out their plans to ease lockdown in England and Scotland. But both of them were clear - decisions around lockdown would be based on the data, and dependent on the current positive trends continuing. In England, there are four tests to taking each step of lockdown easing and they consider things like the infection rate and number of people in hospital. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter More than 30
posts in violation of Facebook's policy on harmful misinformation and
harassment have been removed following BBC Panorama's investigation into the
impact of anti-vaccine disinformation online. AfterVaccines: the disinformation waraired, a number of fake newspaper front pages attributed to the Times, the Sun
and the Daily Mail promoting falsehoods about the coronavirus vaccine were
shared on Facebook in a bid to attack the programme. I was also
targeted with threats and abuse by anti-vaccine activists on Instagram and
Facebook, some of which have also now been removed. A
Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We have removed the violating content
brought to our attention and continue to investigate and monitor the accounts
responsible."" Panorama's investigation revealed how videos promoting claims about the vaccine
that are contrary to scientific evidence have caused real-world harm, affecting
communities across the UK. Thesecontinue to circulatein Facebook groups
and on Whatsapp, which Facebook owns. Meanwhile,
exclusive research by BBC Monitoring exposed a huge increase in followers of
accounts promoting anti-vaccine claims on Instagram in particular. Facebook
says it removes harmful misinformation and actively promotes good information
about Covid, including vaccines. Only eight African countries have a compulsory system to register deaths, a BBC investigation has found. All of the countries surveyed by the BBC have some sort of death registration but it is often on paper and not available in a shareable digitised form. The information may be used in a local area but cannot calculate mortality trends on a national level. Only Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Cape Verde, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, Seychelles and Mauritius have functioning, compulsory and universal civil registration systems that record deaths. That's compared to all but two countries in Europe - Albania and Monaco - and just over half in Asia, analysis of UN data shows. It has been widely reported that Africa's Covid-19 death toll is far lower than in other parts of the world - but there is a concern its true extent in some countries is not fully understood. Africa's data gap could have enormous policy implications. Having an accurate picture of who is dying, from what and where, is crucial when it comes to allocating resources and funding. ""In order to help the living, we need to count the dead,"" UN Population Fund demographer Romesh Silva tells the BBC. Read more about thedata gap and why it matters here.

Many businesses have been asking when they will be allowed to reopen. Now they have some rough indication, pencilled in to the calendar, but far from all of them, and with distancing still required. In contrast with Boris Johnson's approach for England,Nicola Sturgeon's statement at Holyroodwas not a route map to a late summer of socialising, concerts, sports and travel. The plan is far more cautious. Nicola Sturgeon's idea of release, maybe by late April, is to get through the doors of a restaurant or bar. Both leaders had said they were putting data ahead of dates, but it was the prime minister's dates the public notice, remember and plan on. Travel bookings soared on Monday and Tuesday. Scotland's first minister is warning dates are not much better than ""a finger in the wind"", and depend on a lot of data variables to reach each point. Scotland's travel and tourism industry isn't being given much to plan on. Read more from Douglas here. Front-line health workers, the elderly, and people with chronic diseases are being prioritised in Lebanon The World Bank has threatened to suspend financing for
Lebanonâs Covid-19 vaccination programme amid allegations that people are
receiving shots without registering or waiting their turn. Lebanon launched the programme
on 14 February with 28,000 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines purchased withsome of the $34m (Â£24m) in aid it has been allocated,external. To ensure fair and transparent distribution, the government
asked everyone to register with an online platform, whose algorithms prioritise
recipients based on agreed criteria. Health workers, the elderly, and people
with chronic diseases are meant to be vaccinated first. However, it was not long before complaints about âviolationsâ

unprecedented economic crisis and the devastating explosion at Beirutâs port last
August. After several members of parliament were vaccinated on

Whiley revealed last week that Frances, who has learning difficulties and diabetes, was admitted to hospital with Covid. In a tweet,external, Jo said: ""Itâs hard to believe weâve gone from discussing palliative care on Friday night to sitting on her favourite bench drinking cups of tea."" But she added: ""Covid has brought with it further complications. We're now dealing with worrying diabetes and high blood pressure issues and my parents are exhausted beyond belief."" Under a video clip of Frances giving a thumbs up and clapping, Jo said her sister ""would like to say a huge thank you to everybody who has helped her, especially the amazing doctors and nurses of the NHS, and her many many well-wishers"". She earlierquestioned why she was offered the vaccine before her sister, who has the rare genetic syndrome Cri du Chat, but said it was possibly because she was deemed a carer for her sister.

But with outdoor sport to resume for children in England from the end of March there are hopes young people in NI will be able to get playing again soon. The Department of Health in NI said it recognised the importance of sport but has concerns over its role in transmission of coronavirus. Watch as parents share their hopes. We've heard today about Scotland's plans to leave lockdown, and yesterday Boris Johnson set out his plan for England. Northern Ireland has renewed its restrictions to 1 April, but what about Wales? Find out here. More than a millionhigh-grade masks used in the NHS may not meet the right safety standards and have been withdrawn. The Department of Health told the BBC there are 1.12 million of these masks either in use or in hospital stores and has told staff to stop using them. Distribution of some gloves has also been suspended because they may not meet technical requirements. The Department of Health said safety of frontline staff was an absolute priority. Its warning concerns a specific brand of FFP3 mask, which are more sophisticated than surgical masks and are worn in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols. Update: The DHSC originally told the BBC 12 million face masks had
been affected. It has since said this figure is incorrect, and the number is
1.12 million. BBC Radio 5 Live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Dr Christine Tait Bukard, expert in infection and immunity at the University of Edinburgh, describes the Scottish government's approach as ""very sensible"". She also says ministers must remain cautious and ensure that the downward trend of infections continues. Asked about vaccine passports, Dr Tait Bukard told BBC Radio  Scotland'sDrivetimethey are not ""absolutely essential"". She says: ""What we've seen so far is that the vaccine actually stops spread of disease which means we probably don't need a 100% vaccination of the community to actually get some level of herd immunity. ""As we know vaccine passports actually support inequality."" UK Hospitality Scotland says even an ""ambiguous"" reopening date is a ""small step in the right direction"" and also calls for travel restrictions to be lifted. Executive director Willie Macleod said: âWe need much more detail, though, to really get to grips
with the challenge of reopening. ""We will need details of the type of
restrictions businesses will be under and the timeframe for easing them."" Mr Macleod adds that ""unrealistic level 3 restrictions"" will be ""immensely damaging"" for the sector. He says many will struggle to survive further constraints. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland So, the last week of April is when we would expect to see phased but significant re-opening of the economy, including non essential retail, hospitality and services like gyms and hairdressers. Ricardo Corvi is a hairdresser & director of Rainbow Room International Ayr and he tells Drivetime he welcomes a possible return by that date. ""Ultimately we've been begging for a date. ""We've felt like caged animals just desperate to get back into our business, back into our salons to look after our clients."" He says hairdressers know what to expect this time and he hopes clients will be patient. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stephen Montgomery is from the Scottish Hospitality Group and runs two hotels in Scotland. He describes the route map as ""foggy and full of potholes"" Mr Montomery says that for every week his hotels are closed, it costs his group Â£196,000 in national insurance, pension contributions and holiday accrual, even before they pay any utilities. He only receives Â£66,300 a week  back in support and says the sector needs support for another year. He said: ""We are hanging on by our fingertips, By the end of April, we are going to see bounce back loans having to be paid, VAT bills starting to get paid. We have no clear route map out of this at all."" He says level three is not viable and hotels need to be open from 10am until 10pm. The British
Independent Retailers Association calls on the Scottish government
to pave the way to allow non-essential retail to reopen earlier than
scheduled. But it also expresses its frustration at the inability of the four home nations
to release a consistent message. Bira CEO Andrew Goodacre says he cannot understand why there is such a wide variation of interpreting the same data. He adds: ""This inability for
the four home nations to agree on a strategy adds to confusion in the eyes of
the general public. âLast summer Scotland opened up later than elsewhere in the UK but still
ended up in the same position of having to lockdown. âWe urge the Scottish government to learn from this and re-consider the
decision to delay re-opening until the end of April.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chris McLaughlinBBC Scotland Sports News Correspondent Like many other sectors, sport is looking on and wondering
when it can realistically plan for the return of fans. In England, up to 10,000
fans can attend sporting events from May 17th â that was always
unlikely to be replicated in Scotland. After speaking to a number of governing
bodies over the past few days, there was more hope than expectation leading up
to todayâs speech by the first minister. Itâs very much a case of ""as you were"" and letâs see where we are by mid-March. With the clock ticking though, there
are some big calls to be made. Scotlandâs national stadium will host Euro2020
matches in June and fans who have bought tickets want to know if thereâs chance
of them going along. If current virus trends continue, my understanding is that
some will be. Just how many, is the question. Nicola Sturgeon sets out how lockdown restrictions will ease and the economy begin to reopen in Scotland. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce says it had expected details from the first minister that will now not be announced until mid-March. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron says the reopening of some trading from 5 April will provide ""some solace"" but calls for higher compensation for those have to wait longer to reopen. She adds: ""Come the end of
April, we would urge the Scottish Government to relax restrictions on domestic
travel as this will be essential for the survival of tourism and hospitality
businesses currently reliant on domestic visitors. âBut
time is of the essence. For many thousands of businesses, our debt is
increasing, and our cash running out."" Dr Cameron adds Nicola Sturgeon should have ""applied the same amount of rigour"" as Boris Johnson. She also calls for both the Scottish and UK governments to extend and expand support to affected businesses. The Moderator of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland has welcomed the possibility of church buildings being allowed to open for Easter, which is this year on 4 April. The Rt Rev Dr Martin
Fair says: âChristians are Easter people and we live with hope in all
circumstances - hope that has sustained us through this last year. âThe announcement in the Scottish Parliament today is a good
beginning to a return to normality and we look forward to further progress in
the easing of restrictions. âHowever, individual congregations will proceed cautiously
according to their own circumstances and will only re-open buildings when itâs
safe for them to do so.â Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stephen Leckie is chairman of the Scottish Tourism Alliance and owner of the Crieff Hydro Hotel. He says today's announcement offered ""a little bit of hope""  but he feels ""hard done by"" He tells John Beattie the the FM's statement ran to a total of 3,459 words, but featured the word ""hospitality"" once, ""hotels"" nil, ""accommodation and self catering"" nil and ""tourism"" nil. He said: ""We are feeling left out and forgotten. We are gagging to open. We know the demand is there. ""But we have 62 days of closure ahead of us and then we move from level four to level three and we don't know about travel restrictions."" He says there is ""no point in opening if customers cannot travel"".  The Scottish government has set out four phases in its strategy to lift coronavirus restrictions.  The first minister has talked about ""data not dates"", however she did give some indication about what we could expect and when: First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said there will be a ""progressive easing"" of Scotland's rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday announced a ""roadmap"" to lift England's lockdown restrictions in stages - starting with the reopening of schools. Over the course of the past year, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has advised the authorities on the pandemic, assessing the risks of transmission of coronavirus in many areas of daily life. This advice looks at how closing or opening certain sectors could affect its spread - although with varying degrees of confidence, as the precise impact of each measure is difficult to assess. Scientists are still trying to understand the full impact of the vaccines and the new variants of coronavirus. These have not been factored in yet in the assessments from Sage, which have been publicly released. The BBC has looked at what they say about the risks in a number of areas.Check out more here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland There is still no certainty in terms of holidays Shona Thorne of Thorne Travel in Ayrshire thought there would have been a lot more detail to the proposed unlocking. Ms Thorne says bookings for 2022 are ""buoyant"" but that people are still uncertain about 2021. She tells John Beattie that the announcement does not make anything clearer. I think the road map only takes us a short distance. I would have hoped to have a full road map, like the one England has. We have had people who have transferred over from last year, people who have weddings booked. They are unsure if this is going to happen or not. It would be good to have an understanding of what to advise them and at this moment in time the moment we are only looking at a few weeks in advance. Shona Thorne, Travel agent The Scottish Licensed Trade Association warns a late spring reopening will be too late for many of its members. Spokesman Paul Waterson says: âWhile it is encouraging that our sector can hopefully reopen from the end of
April, we are concerned that a return to the previous tiered system will lead
many operators to decide that such restrictive reopening conditions are simply
not worth the time, effort and money involved."" He adds hospitality is not a ""one size fits all"" sector as it includes pubs, restaurants, hotels and nightclubs. Mr Waterson adds licensed hospitality has been among the hardest hit by trading restrictions despite investing an estimated
Â£80m on becoming Covid compliant. David Lonsdale of the Scottish Retail Consortium gives the first minister's announcement a ""cautious thumbs up"". But he tells BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime: ""For retail we have a provisional date for reopening in two months' time at the end of April."" But he adds: ""There is quite a chunky 100-page document behind this which we are still trying to plough through. ""There is still quite a lot of detail that appears, at first glance, to be missing from this."" CBI Scotland says while the strategic framework represents a small step in the right direction ""many Scottish businesses will be
left feeling deflated"". Director Tracy Black says: ""Considerable uncertainty still remains over how and when
they can reopen their doors."" She stresses the business community recognises that ""data
not dates"" must be the key driver of lockdown easing measures and that a
cautious approach remains the right one. But she adds: ""However, firms will have been looking
for more detail than the partial timetable that has been provided. ""For sectors like hospitality, retail and
tourism, that have been hit so hard by the pandemic, the road back to a tier
system at the end of April will feel like a long and uncertain one. ""Others,
like tourism and aviation, face another prolonged period of hibernation."" Derek Provan, the chief executive of AGS Airports, the company which owns Aberdeen
International, Glasgow and Southampton airports, takes a swipe at Nicola Sturgeon's route map. He compares her announcement to the one made on Monday by Boris Johnson for England and says while the PM provided a ""clear framework for the safe restart of international aviation"", the first minister had provided ""a clear message the aviation industry is not a priority for
the Scottish government"". He said that his industry was handed no plan or framework against which they can
start plotting any form of recovery.  This sends a very worrying signal to our airports, our airlines and the thousands of staff our sector supports. We find ourselves in a position where airports and airlines in England can start planning to safely reopen in time for the summer, yet in Scotland we are left with more questions than answers. It is now two weeks since the Scottish government committed to setting up an aviation working group and it has still to meet. This lack of meaningful engagement cannot continue.

"Holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since the plan for easing lockdown was unveiled. Despite questions over the return of international travel, the UK's biggest holiday firm, Tui, said bookings for foreign trips jumped 500% overnight. The owner of UK-based holiday firms Hoseasons and Cottages.com said it sold a record 10,000 breaks. The government said a decision on easing international travel would not happen until mid-May at the earliest. But Tui said its bookings for July-onwards had soared with Greece, Spain and Turkey the most popular destinations. Amid uncertainty over when foreign travel will be allowed, some holidaymakers have their sights set on a UK break. Simon Altham, group chief commercial officer at Awaze, the company behind Hoseasons, said: ""Last year following similar announcements we saw bookings peak at one every 11 seconds, but this time demand has exceeded our expectations and comfortably broken that record."" Nat Sommers has booked a break in Yorkshire Nat Sommers told the BBC she had booked a family trip to Yorkshire after Boris had announced his plans to ease lockdown. ""We'd been keeping our eye on a few places over the last few weeks in anticipation of lockdown being eased,"" she said. ""We just decided to go for it an book it in the hope that things would be back to relative normality come August."" Boris Johnson has said a global travel taskforce would put forward a report by 12 April on how to return to international travel. The government would then make a decision on removing restrictions on international travel, but not before 17 May at the earliest. What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? When can I go on holiday in the UK or travel abroad? Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' As the government has said dates could move for the start of international travel, Tui has said that anyone due to travel between 17 May and the end of June can change their booking to a later date without a fee. Andrew Flintham, managing director for Tui UK and Ireland, described the government's steps as ""positive"". Thomas Cook said traffic to its website was up over 100% on Monday from 15:00 GMT onwards, with bookings ""flooding in"" for countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. ""The government's announcement today is good news for those of us desperate to get away on holiday,"" said Thomas Cook's chief executive Alan French. ""While we await more details, it's clear that the government's ambition is to open up international travel in the coming months and hopefully in time for the summer holidays."" There was a big leap in family bookings for the summer holidays, especially for August, as well as people booking for the October half term and Christmas, a Thomas Cook spokesman said. Crete has seen a surge in bookings, according to EasyJet EasyJet reported a 337% surge in flight bookings and a 630% jump in holiday bookings for locations such as Alicante, Malaga, Palmo, Faro and Crete. The airline's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said Boris Johnson's announcement had ""provided a much-needed boost in confidence"" for its UK customers. 'We're delighted to have dates to work towards' Plans to reopen England's shops and gyms in April ""We have consistently seen that there is pent up demand for travel and this surge in bookings shows that this signal from the government that it plans to reopen travel has been what UK consumers have been waiting for,"" he said. Tour operator and airline Jet2 also reported a 1,000% increase in bookings in the 24 hours following the prime minister's announcement. Popular destinations include Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, with a notable spike in demand from July onwards. Its chief executive, Steve Heapy, said: ""The government's announcement is the news [holidaymakers] have been longing for, and the continued surge in bookings shows how ready our customers are to get away to the sunshine on a real package holiday."" While bookings are high, there are still plenty of questions about how international travel will resume - and no guarantees that it will start again in mid-May. The industry has seen restrictions put on top of restrictions over the last few months, with visitors from entire continents banned, the introduction of quarantine hotels and multiple tests required. Removing them will take some careful unpicking. The government has said that any removal will depend on the location of concerning variants, progress of vaccine rollouts here and abroad as well as death rates and hospital admissions. It's also not just about us. Other countries will need to agree to allow British tourists in. But after fears they could be left off the roadmap, the travel industry is keen to make this plan and these dates work. Amanda Matthews, managing director and owner of Ramsbottom-based luxury travel agency network Designer Travel, said her firm had seen double the number of enquiries and new bookings for the summer. ""But we've also had hundreds of calls from people who've got bookings for travel in March, April, May and June - still very uncertain about whether they will be travelling or not,"" she told the BBC. ""Because there's no concrete date yet for the reopening of international travel, as a travel agent, we can't answer our existing clients' questions about holidays they've already booked for spring and summer. We've got no idea."" Designer Travel owner Amanda Matthews says her firm saw double the usual number of enquiries on Monday While the roadmap has provided hope for summer holidays, retail expert Kate Hardcastle said there was also ""huge disappointment"" for the travel industry - particularly among domestic overnight accommodation providers such as mobile home holiday parks and holiday cottage providers. ""Easter is obviously a critical part of the travel calendar for travel agencies and the industry, so it's a lost opportunity, one less holiday to be able to sell within,"" she told the BBC. ""I also know a lot of families are dependent on Easter holidays as it tends to be cheaper and more cost effective than the summer holidays. It would be awful to think that some people are completely priced out of a holiday this year."" But data from hotel technology company Avvio suggests a heyday for upmarket UK hotels, with August revenue for 4- and 5-star hotels more than tripling as would-be holiday makers bank on domestic breaks being more likely. On Tuesday, global hotels group InterContinental Hotels, which owns the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn brands, said the sector was unlikely to see a recovery until later this year, dependent on vaccine rollouts. ""2021 has begun with many of these challenges still in place,"" chief executive Keith Barr said, as the company unveiled a $260m (Â£185m) loss.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Dr Christine Tait Bukard, expert in infection and immunity at the University of Edinburgh, describes the Scottish government's approach as ""very sensible"". She also says ministers must remain cautious and ensure that the downward trend of infections continues. Asked about vaccine passports, Dr Tait Bukard told BBC Radio  Scotland'sDrivetimethey are not ""absolutely essential"". She says: ""What we've seen so far is that the vaccine actually stops spread of disease which means we probably don't need a 100% vaccination of the community to actually get some level of herd immunity. ""As we know vaccine passports actually support inequality."" UK Hospitality Scotland says even an ""ambiguous"" reopening date is a ""small step in the right direction"" and also calls for travel restrictions to be lifted. Executive director Willie Macleod said: âWe need much more detail, though, to really get to grips
with the challenge of reopening. ""We will need details of the type of
restrictions businesses will be under and the timeframe for easing them."" Mr Macleod adds that ""unrealistic level 3 restrictions"" will be ""immensely damaging"" for the sector. He says many will struggle to survive further constraints. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland So, the last week of April is when we would expect to see phased but significant re-opening of the economy, including non essential retail, hospitality and services like gyms and hairdressers. Ricardo Corvi is a hairdresser & director of Rainbow Room International Ayr and he tells Drivetime he welcomes a possible return by that date. ""Ultimately we've been begging for a date. ""We've felt like caged animals just desperate to get back into our business, back into our salons to look after our clients."" He says hairdressers know what to expect this time and he hopes clients will be patient. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stephen Montgomery is from the Scottish Hospitality Group and runs two hotels in Scotland. He describes the route map as ""foggy and full of potholes"" Mr Montomery says that for every week his hotels are closed, it costs his group Â£196,000 in national insurance, pension contributions and holiday accrual, even before they pay any utilities. He only receives Â£66,300 a week  back in support and says the sector needs support for another year. He said: ""We are hanging on by our fingertips, By the end of April, we are going to see bounce back loans having to be paid, VAT bills starting to get paid. We have no clear route map out of this at all."" He says level three is not viable and hotels need to be open from 10am until 10pm. The British
Independent Retailers Association calls on the Scottish government
to pave the way to allow non-essential retail to reopen earlier than
scheduled. But it also expresses its frustration at the inability of the four home nations
to release a consistent message. Bira CEO Andrew Goodacre says he cannot understand why there is such a wide variation of interpreting the same data. He adds: ""This inability for
the four home nations to agree on a strategy adds to confusion in the eyes of
the general public. âLast summer Scotland opened up later than elsewhere in the UK but still
ended up in the same position of having to lockdown. âWe urge the Scottish government to learn from this and re-consider the
decision to delay re-opening until the end of April.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chris McLaughlinBBC Scotland Sports News Correspondent Like many other sectors, sport is looking on and wondering
when it can realistically plan for the return of fans. In England, up to 10,000
fans can attend sporting events from May 17th â that was always
unlikely to be replicated in Scotland. After speaking to a number of governing
bodies over the past few days, there was more hope than expectation leading up
to todayâs speech by the first minister. Itâs very much a case of ""as you were"" and letâs see where we are by mid-March. With the clock ticking though, there
are some big calls to be made. Scotlandâs national stadium will host Euro2020
matches in June and fans who have bought tickets want to know if thereâs chance
of them going along. If current virus trends continue, my understanding is that
some will be. Just how many, is the question. Nicola Sturgeon sets out how lockdown restrictions will ease and the economy begin to reopen in Scotland. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce says it had expected details from the first minister that will now not be announced until mid-March. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron says the reopening of some trading from 5 April will provide ""some solace"" but calls for higher compensation for those have to wait longer to reopen. She adds: ""Come the end of
April, we would urge the Scottish Government to relax restrictions on domestic
travel as this will be essential for the survival of tourism and hospitality
businesses currently reliant on domestic visitors. âBut
time is of the essence. For many thousands of businesses, our debt is
increasing, and our cash running out."" Dr Cameron adds Nicola Sturgeon should have ""applied the same amount of rigour"" as Boris Johnson. She also calls for both the Scottish and UK governments to extend and expand support to affected businesses. The Moderator of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland has welcomed the possibility of church buildings being allowed to open for Easter, which is this year on 4 April. The Rt Rev Dr Martin
Fair says: âChristians are Easter people and we live with hope in all
circumstances - hope that has sustained us through this last year. âThe announcement in the Scottish Parliament today is a good
beginning to a return to normality and we look forward to further progress in
the easing of restrictions. âHowever, individual congregations will proceed cautiously
according to their own circumstances and will only re-open buildings when itâs
safe for them to do so.â Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stephen Leckie is chairman of the Scottish Tourism Alliance and owner of the Crieff Hydro Hotel. He says today's announcement offered ""a little bit of hope""  but he feels ""hard done by"" He tells John Beattie the the FM's statement ran to a total of 3,459 words, but featured the word ""hospitality"" once, ""hotels"" nil, ""accommodation and self catering"" nil and ""tourism"" nil. He said: ""We are feeling left out and forgotten. We are gagging to open. We know the demand is there. ""But we have 62 days of closure ahead of us and then we move from level four to level three and we don't know about travel restrictions."" He says there is ""no point in opening if customers cannot travel"".  The Scottish government has set out four phases in its strategy to lift coronavirus restrictions.  The first minister has talked about ""data not dates"", however she did give some indication about what we could expect and when: First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said there will be a ""progressive easing"" of Scotland's rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday announced a ""roadmap"" to lift England's lockdown restrictions in stages - starting with the reopening of schools. Over the course of the past year, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has advised the authorities on the pandemic, assessing the risks of transmission of coronavirus in many areas of daily life. This advice looks at how closing or opening certain sectors could affect its spread - although with varying degrees of confidence, as the precise impact of each measure is difficult to assess. Scientists are still trying to understand the full impact of the vaccines and the new variants of coronavirus. These have not been factored in yet in the assessments from Sage, which have been publicly released. The BBC has looked at what they say about the risks in a number of areas.Check out more here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland There is still no certainty in terms of holidays Shona Thorne of Thorne Travel in Ayrshire thought there would have been a lot more detail to the proposed unlocking. Ms Thorne says bookings for 2022 are ""buoyant"" but that people are still uncertain about 2021. She tells John Beattie that the announcement does not make anything clearer. I think the road map only takes us a short distance. I would have hoped to have a full road map, like the one England has. We have had people who have transferred over from last year, people who have weddings booked. They are unsure if this is going to happen or not. It would be good to have an understanding of what to advise them and at this moment in time the moment we are only looking at a few weeks in advance. Shona Thorne, Travel agent The Scottish Licensed Trade Association warns a late spring reopening will be too late for many of its members. Spokesman Paul Waterson says: âWhile it is encouraging that our sector can hopefully reopen from the end of
April, we are concerned that a return to the previous tiered system will lead
many operators to decide that such restrictive reopening conditions are simply
not worth the time, effort and money involved."" He adds hospitality is not a ""one size fits all"" sector as it includes pubs, restaurants, hotels and nightclubs. Mr Waterson adds licensed hospitality has been among the hardest hit by trading restrictions despite investing an estimated
Â£80m on becoming Covid compliant. David Lonsdale of the Scottish Retail Consortium gives the first minister's announcement a ""cautious thumbs up"". But he tells BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime: ""For retail we have a provisional date for reopening in two months' time at the end of April."" But he adds: ""There is quite a chunky 100-page document behind this which we are still trying to plough through. ""There is still quite a lot of detail that appears, at first glance, to be missing from this."" CBI Scotland says while the strategic framework represents a small step in the right direction ""many Scottish businesses will be
left feeling deflated"". Director Tracy Black says: ""Considerable uncertainty still remains over how and when
they can reopen their doors."" She stresses the business community recognises that ""data
not dates"" must be the key driver of lockdown easing measures and that a
cautious approach remains the right one. But she adds: ""However, firms will have been looking
for more detail than the partial timetable that has been provided. ""For sectors like hospitality, retail and
tourism, that have been hit so hard by the pandemic, the road back to a tier
system at the end of April will feel like a long and uncertain one. ""Others,
like tourism and aviation, face another prolonged period of hibernation."" Derek Provan, the chief executive of AGS Airports, the company which owns Aberdeen
International, Glasgow and Southampton airports, takes a swipe at Nicola Sturgeon's route map. He compares her announcement to the one made on Monday by Boris Johnson for England and says while the PM provided a ""clear framework for the safe restart of international aviation"", the first minister had provided ""a clear message the aviation industry is not a priority for
the Scottish government"". He said that his industry was handed no plan or framework against which they can
start plotting any form of recovery.  This sends a very worrying signal to our airports, our airlines and the thousands of staff our sector supports. We find ourselves in a position where airports and airlines in England can start planning to safely reopen in time for the summer, yet in Scotland we are left with more questions than answers. It is now two weeks since the Scottish government committed to setting up an aviation working group and it has still to meet. This lack of meaningful engagement cannot continue.

"Holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since the plan for easing lockdown was unveiled. Despite questions over the return of international travel, the UK's biggest holiday firm, Tui, said bookings for foreign trips jumped 500% overnight. The owner of UK-based holiday firms Hoseasons and Cottages.com said it sold a record 10,000 breaks. The government said a decision on easing international travel would not happen until mid-May at the earliest. But Tui said its bookings for July-onwards had soared with Greece, Spain and Turkey the most popular destinations. Amid uncertainty over when foreign travel will be allowed, some holidaymakers have their sights set on a UK break. Simon Altham, group chief commercial officer at Awaze, the company behind Hoseasons, said: ""Last year following similar announcements we saw bookings peak at one every 11 seconds, but this time demand has exceeded our expectations and comfortably broken that record."" Nat Sommers has booked a break in Yorkshire Nat Sommers told the BBC she had booked a family trip to Yorkshire after Boris had announced his plans to ease lockdown. ""We'd been keeping our eye on a few places over the last few weeks in anticipation of lockdown being eased,"" she said. ""We just decided to go for it an book it in the hope that things would be back to relative normality come August."" Boris Johnson has said a global travel taskforce would put forward a report by 12 April on how to return to international travel. The government would then make a decision on removing restrictions on international travel, but not before 17 May at the earliest. What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? When can I go on holiday in the UK or travel abroad? Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' As the government has said dates could move for the start of international travel, Tui has said that anyone due to travel between 17 May and the end of June can change their booking to a later date without a fee. Andrew Flintham, managing director for Tui UK and Ireland, described the government's steps as ""positive"". Thomas Cook said traffic to its website was up over 100% on Monday from 15:00 GMT onwards, with bookings ""flooding in"" for countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. ""The government's announcement today is good news for those of us desperate to get away on holiday,"" said Thomas Cook's chief executive Alan French. ""While we await more details, it's clear that the government's ambition is to open up international travel in the coming months and hopefully in time for the summer holidays."" There was a big leap in family bookings for the summer holidays, especially for August, as well as people booking for the October half term and Christmas, a Thomas Cook spokesman said. Crete has seen a surge in bookings, according to EasyJet EasyJet reported a 337% surge in flight bookings and a 630% jump in holiday bookings for locations such as Alicante, Malaga, Palmo, Faro and Crete. The airline's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said Boris Johnson's announcement had ""provided a much-needed boost in confidence"" for its UK customers. 'We're delighted to have dates to work towards' Plans to reopen England's shops and gyms in April ""We have consistently seen that there is pent up demand for travel and this surge in bookings shows that this signal from the government that it plans to reopen travel has been what UK consumers have been waiting for,"" he said. Tour operator and airline Jet2 also reported a 1,000% increase in bookings in the 24 hours following the prime minister's announcement. Popular destinations include Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, with a notable spike in demand from July onwards. Its chief executive, Steve Heapy, said: ""The government's announcement is the news [holidaymakers] have been longing for, and the continued surge in bookings shows how ready our customers are to get away to the sunshine on a real package holiday."" While bookings are high, there are still plenty of questions about how international travel will resume - and no guarantees that it will start again in mid-May. The industry has seen restrictions put on top of restrictions over the last few months, with visitors from entire continents banned, the introduction of quarantine hotels and multiple tests required. Removing them will take some careful unpicking. The government has said that any removal will depend on the location of concerning variants, progress of vaccine rollouts here and abroad as well as death rates and hospital admissions. It's also not just about us. Other countries will need to agree to allow British tourists in. But after fears they could be left off the roadmap, the travel industry is keen to make this plan and these dates work. Amanda Matthews, managing director and owner of Ramsbottom-based luxury travel agency network Designer Travel, said her firm had seen double the number of enquiries and new bookings for the summer. ""But we've also had hundreds of calls from people who've got bookings for travel in March, April, May and June - still very uncertain about whether they will be travelling or not,"" she told the BBC. ""Because there's no concrete date yet for the reopening of international travel, as a travel agent, we can't answer our existing clients' questions about holidays they've already booked for spring and summer. We've got no idea."" Designer Travel owner Amanda Matthews says her firm saw double the usual number of enquiries on Monday While the roadmap has provided hope for summer holidays, retail expert Kate Hardcastle said there was also ""huge disappointment"" for the travel industry - particularly among domestic overnight accommodation providers such as mobile home holiday parks and holiday cottage providers. ""Easter is obviously a critical part of the travel calendar for travel agencies and the industry, so it's a lost opportunity, one less holiday to be able to sell within,"" she told the BBC. ""I also know a lot of families are dependent on Easter holidays as it tends to be cheaper and more cost effective than the summer holidays. It would be awful to think that some people are completely priced out of a holiday this year."" But data from hotel technology company Avvio suggests a heyday for upmarket UK hotels, with August revenue for 4- and 5-star hotels more than tripling as would-be holiday makers bank on domestic breaks being more likely. On Tuesday, global hotels group InterContinental Hotels, which owns the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn brands, said the sector was unlikely to see a recovery until later this year, dependent on vaccine rollouts. ""2021 has begun with many of these challenges still in place,"" chief executive Keith Barr said, as the company unveiled a $260m (Â£185m) loss.

"Keighlie Holt has not been able to work as a hairdresser and is retraining as a social media analyst The unemployment rate has risen to its highest level in almost five years, with younger workers bearing the brunt of the job losses, official figures show. The UK's jobless rate rose to 5.1% in the three months to December,external, with the number of people on company payrolls down 726,000 on pre-pandemic levels. Almost three-fifths of these were younger than 25 years. There were, however, some early signs of stabilisation in the jobs market. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a small increase in the numbers of employees paid through payroll over the past couple of months, with 83,000 more people on the books in January compared with the previous month.

"A montage of photographs of the 17,300-year-old kangaroo rock painting (left) and an illustration of the artwork (right) Australian scientists have discovered the country's oldest known rock art - a 17,300-year-old painting of a kangaroo. The artwork measuring 2m (6.5ft) was painted in red ochre on the ceiling of a rock shelter. It was found in Western Australia's Kimberley region, known for its Aboriginal rock paintings. Its age was determined by radiocarbon-dating ancient mud wasp nests.The findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour,external. Mud wasp nests were used to date the artwork Researcher Damien Finch, who pioneered the mud wasp dating technique, said it was rare to find mud wasp nests both on top and underneath a single artwork. But the team was able to sample both types to establish the artwork's minimum and maximum ages. ""We radiocarbon dated three wasp nests underlying the painting and three nests built over it to determine, confidently, that the painting is between 17,500 and 17,100 years old; most likely 17,300 years old,"" said Dr Finch, a geochronologist from the University of Melbourne. Scientists saythis estimation makes the artwork the oldest known intact painting in Australia.,external Mud wasps used to date aboriginal rock art The painting was found within this rock shelter in Kimberley The study's co-author Dr Sven Ouzman, from the University of Western Australia, added there could be a link between the kangaroo painting and the ancient art from other regions. ""This iconic kangaroo image is visually similar to rock paintings from islands in South East Asia dated to more than 40,000 years ago, suggesting a cultural link - and hinting at still older rock art in Australia,"" he said. Earlier this year,researchers found the world's oldest animal cave painting, a 45,000-year-old life-sized depiction of a pig, on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. In South Africa, ahashtag-like doodle created 73,000 years agois believed to be the oldest known drawing. Cissy Gore-Birch, chair of the Balanggarra Aboriginal Corporation, noted the significance of the kangaroo rock art discovery for Aboriginal people and Australians. ""It's important that Indigenous knowledge and stories are not lost and continue to be shared for generations to come,"" she said. This video can not be played Cave paintings as old as those found in Europe have been found in Indonesia, raising new questions about early mankind and the development of art in prehistoric times.

"The Welsh Government spells out how it will strengthen day to day businesses post-Covid Town centres are to be the focus of the Welsh Government's ""mission"" for post-Covid economic recovery. An extra Â£270m is to be made available to offer long-term financial help to businesses. However firms that are given government support will be expected to reduce carbon use and be fair employers. Deputy Minister Lee Waters said Wales must set out a ""green, prosperous and a fairer"" economic recovery from the pandemic. In its Economic Resilience and Reconstruction Mission, the Welsh Government has spelt out how it aims to strengthen businesses and help those firms that innovate, to offer skilled jobs. Employers will be encouraged to show how their organisations are reducing their impact on the environment and promise permanent work. Firms accuse ministers of 'silence' over reopening Welsh economy in decline before Covid hit ""If businesses want support from the government they have to sign up to give something back as well - an economic and social contract which respects fair work, respects the environment and can harness and support workers mental health, I think that's a fair deal,"" said Mr Waters. More public sector money will be encouraged to be spent within Wales With high streets in Wales already changing, the mission said Covid has increased the speed of that change - as seen with the closure ofDebenhamsandTopshopstores, among others. The Welsh Government said different departments are working to help towns have a new future, by repurposing buildings and encouraging hubs where people can work closer to home rather than commuting. The public sector in Wales spends around Â£6bn a year and the plan is for more to be spent within Wales, to help jobs and prosperity. NHS Wales, for example, spends Â£22m a year on food - 48% of which is being spent with businesses outside Wales. Last decade's progress to reduce unemployment has been partly reversed by efforts to combat Covid However, the Welsh Government claimed efforts to combat Covid and effects of Brexit have reversed the last decade's progress in reducing unemployment and economic inactivity. Young people, women, disabled people and ethnic communities are being hit hardest with job losses and working fewer hours because of Covid, ministers say. The mission also wants business success to be measured by the percentage of people in permanent employment, narrowing the gender pay gap, household incomes, air pollution levels, greenhouse gas emissions and the percentage of companies carrying out research and development. Welsh Conservative economy spokesman, Russell George MS, welcomed the additional support but said it is ""disappointing Labour ministers continue to drag their heels"" on extending the business rates holiday. ""We now face a huge challenge to rebuild Wales after the pandemic, and Welsh Labour's dismal track record has stifled economic growth to the extent where ministers have admitted they don't know what they've been doing on the economy,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's economy spokeswoman, Helen Mary Jones, said the Welsh Government's plan was ""a pale imitation"" of her party's Â£6bn Welsh Green Deal, which claims to see 60,000 jobs created. ""Twenty years of a Labour government in Wales has been characterised by a failure of delivery,"" she said.

"Pub landlord Paul Slater says he is frustrated at the lack of information from the Welsh Government ""The English seem to have some vision and we don't seem to have a road map out of it."" Pub landlord Paul Slater said he is frustrated at the lack of information from the Welsh Government about when businesses might be able to reopen. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) wants more details about the conditions for lifting lockdown. The Welsh Government said new variants of coronavirus mean it cannot provide as much certainty as they would like. Ministers also argued the package of business support is the most generous in the UK. Tories demand Welsh Covid roadmap after PM's plan Town centres focus of green post-Covid recovery The head of the FSB in Wales, Ben Cottam, said there is a danger tourism firms will lose a significant amount of Easter trade. Ben Cottam, head of Wales for FSB, calls for security on funding for businesses On Monday, the UK governmentset out its roadmap for the reopening of businesses in England. Mr Cottam said it was ""welcome"" that the Welsh Government gave some indication to retail and close contact businesses as to their path out of lockdown on Friday. But he said there should be ""a clearer conversation now"" about what businesses will need to do ahead of reopening. Mr Cottam argued this did not happen as the country came out of similar lockdown measures last year. ""It's been really frustrating for businesses that the day they're able to reopen, they get the guidance."" Paul Slater says his staff want ""to know what's going on"" Paul Slater is the landlord of The Trotting Mare pub which sits the Welsh side of the border with England, between Whitchurch and Oswestry, in Shropshire. Mr Slater toldBBC Radio Waleshe had been closed for eight of the past 12 months, and called for more information from the Welsh Government. ""It's the uncertainty - I have got staff wanting to know what's going on,"" said Mr Slater. ""Even if it was a long term date, we would have something to work towards. ""Wales and England have both got the same data and evidence but Wales are taking a different route, which after three lockdowns is becoming a bit frustrating, whereas the English see to have some vision and we don't seem to have a road map out of it."" Sue Muddeman has owned the Bay Bistro in Rhossili for 16 years Sue Muddeman, who has owned the Bay Bistro in Rhossili for 16 years, said they closed just before Christmas and decided not to reopen to provide a takeaway service. Ms Muddeman doesn't expect a reopening date but called for as much notice as possible in order to prepare. ""There's lots of things that they could be telling us now so that we could be prepared, so when they do have a date for opening we can literally open those doors and we're ready to go,"" she said. ""We probably can't solve the problem of people coming from England that have different rules. That was an issue. But it needs to be laid out very clearly."" Swansea shop Hiatus director Matt Bryer said he will ""persist to make this work"" Meanwhile in Swansea, Hiatus, a sustainability conscious surf, outdoors and lifestyle store, had to delay it's opening due to the pandemic. The company's director, Matt Bryer, explained they finally managed to open the shop in September 2020, but said the past few months have been ""challenging."" ""You've never had to be as dynamic as you have now,"" he said. Mr Bryer said it feels like ""neglect"" when he sees other sectors ""getting access to more funding"". ""It seems like we might be misunderstood on how we operate, how our cashflow operates and how our commitments operates,"" he said. The past few months have been ""challenging"", Hiatus shop director Matt Bryer says Mr Cottam also called on the Welsh Government to offer security on funding for businesses with relief for certain sectors to be extended by a year. ""We would like to see Welsh Government commit to 100% rates relief holiday,"" he said. ""That will just give businesses a little bit of breathing space they need to get back up and running and to help restart the economy."" The FSB wants the Welsh and UK governments to provide consistent messages and trading conditions. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it will move to the alert level three in ""gradual steps, assessing the impact as we go along"". It said a first step, in the next three weeks, would be to consider the rules around non-essential retail and close contact services, and the possibility of re-opening self-contained accommodation for Easter. ""We recognise everyone wants certainty and to be able to plan for the future, and that businesses want to be open and trading - we want that to happen as soon as it is safe to do so,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are actively reviewing our options for providing further support for firms aligned to the review process and have active planning in place to extend if required."" It added that the Welsh Government has provided Â£650m to help businesses through the December to March period in addition to a Â£180m support fund for the tourism, hospitality and leisure sectors.

"The new law requires tech firms to pay for displaying links to news stories Facebook has announced it will restore news content to its users in Australia. The tech giant has blocked news to Australians on its platform since last Thursday amid a dispute over a proposed law which would force it and Google to pay news publishers for content. Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg had told him the ban would end ""in the coming days"", after the pair had talks. Mr Frydenberg said amendments would be made to the law. ""Facebook has re-friended Australia,"" he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. The government has been debating the law - seen as a possible test case for regulation globally - in the Senate, after it was passed in the lower house last week. Last Thursday, Australians woke up to find they could not access or share any news stories on their accounts. Facebook argued it had been forced to block Australian news in response to the proposed legislation. The government's news code aims to set up a ""fairer"" negotiation process between the tech giants and news companies over the value of news content. What happened after Facebook blocked news in Australia? Facebook blocks news content in Australia But it has been strongly opposed by Facebook and Google - both argue the code misunderstands how the internet works. Facebook has also said it gets little commercial gain from news content. This video can not be played Australians react to Facebook's news ban (18 February) But the Australian government says the code is needed to ""level the playing field"" for news publishers, which have seen profits slump in the internet age. By Tuesday evening it was reported that multiple companies, including the Guardian Australia and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, had resumed talks with the social media giant. Seven West Media, a large media company, then announced in a statement they had signed a letter of intent to provide its news content to the platform after reaching an agreement. Facebook said on Tuesday that it had been reassured by recent discussions with the government. ""Going forward, the government has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won't automatically be subject to forced negotiation,"" said Campbell Brown, vice president of global news partnerships at Facebook. ""We have come to an agreement that will allow us to support the publishers we choose to, including small and local publishers."" Facebook already has its own ""showcase"" product - Facebook News Tab - through which it pays media organisations a fee to display their stories on its platform. This feature however, is only available in the UK and US. Google had also threatened to withdraw its primary search engine from Australia, but the company has recently agreed deals with local media companies. Facebook's move to ban Australian news was a big risk last week. It made global headlines - not least because it also initially restricted some government health-department and emergency services pages. Some have been perplexed by the move. Why would Facebook openly court such negative headlines? Critics called the move undemocratic - authoritarian even. There are claims that fake news on the platform increased since the ban - though that's difficult to prove. But Facebook isn't the only voice to say these new laws are badly drafted. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web, said he was concerned that forcing companies to pay for certain content could make the internet ""unworkable"". The proposed law was also seen by some as heavily influenced by the lobbying operations of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp - which owns many of Australia's major newspapers. The law's intention was to protect struggling journalism, not to line the pockets of a media dynasty. There does now appear to be movement on both sides. Crucially, Facebook objected to the idea of a ""forced negotiation' with news outlets, which it now believes is off the table. However although both sides have moved, and both will claim victory, this whole episode has damaged Facebook. Politicians from across the world offered support to the Australian government - there were even accusations of bullying by the social network. And considering Facebook desperately doesn't want these laws replicated in other countries, antagonising Australia's allies may not have been the smartest of moves. The government and Facebook have reached a compromise of sorts. Australian authorities will introduce four further amendments, including one that means the government may not apply the code to Facebook if it can demonstrate a ""significant contribution"" to local journalism. They include a two-month mediation period before government-enforced arbitration kicks in - giving parties more time to reach a private deal. Australia's largest locally-owned company Nine Entertainment said it was ""pleased"" the government had found a compromise and was looking forward to resuming talks about a commercial arrangement.

No, I wasn't going anywhere."" Today's labour market figures show that pay was up by an average of nearly 5% compared with a year ago - a much bigger pay rise than has been typical for most of the past decade. If you're an employee you may not recognise that figure as anywhere near your own pay rise; a big part of it is because it is an average figure. If you remove nearly 730,000 workers from employers' payrolls, many of whom have been in low-paid occupations such as accommodation and food services - where pay rises have been modest or non-existent - then it flatters the average. However, even allowing for those ""compositional"" effects, the Office for National Statistics estimates that there was still pay growth of 3% overall - far more than inflation at 0.7%. And in some sectors it was better than that: according to the ONS, pay in health and social work rose by an average of 6.2% - some modest compensation, perhaps, for the risks those workers have been taking.

"The employment rate in Scotland also fell in the three months to December Scotland's unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5% over the last quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). TheUK rate rose in the three months to December and is now at 5.1%, its highest level for nearly five years. The employment rate among those aged 16 to 64 in Scotland fell slightly over the same period to 73.7%. The Scottish government said the figures did not reflect the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Separate HMRC early estimates for January 2021, also published on Tuesday, show there were 2,331,000 payrolled employees in Scotland - an increase of 8,000 from December 2020. However, the figure is 68,000 lower than a year ago. It's hard to get an accurate count for unemployment when more than four million people across the UK are thought to be on furlough. Many more are also not seeking work, but they're under-employed - not working the hours they normally would. But this latest data from the Office for National Statistics give some sense of the jobs market last year: Scottish unemployment up 26,000 and those in work down 43,000. By year's end, the jobless rate was 4.5%: the UK, 5.1%. The number claiming benefit because of no or low pay is 83% - up on January last year, and a higher rate than the UK. Unemployment is set to rise when furlough is withdrawn, although with business restrictions continuing well into summer, it is expected the Westminster budget next week will see furlough extended. Reacting to the figures, Scotland's Business Minister Jamie Hepburn said they did not reflect the full impact of coronavirus or the outlook for employment. He said: ""The Job Retention Scheme continues to play an important role in supporting employers and employees and, combined with the huge economic uncertainty caused by Brexit, this remains an extremely uncertain time for the economy and jobs. ""We have repeatedly called on the UK government to extend the Job Retention Scheme for as long as required - which will be beyond the current end date of April. ""The Scottish government continues to support employers, allocating over Â£3bn to help businesses since the start of this pandemic."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy. ""That's why throughout the crisis, my focus has been on doing everything we can to protect jobs and livelihoods. ""At the Budget next week, I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the figures reflected continuing challenges as a result of the Covid pandemic. He added: ""The UK government has taken quick and decisive action to support jobs and businesses across all parts of the UK. Our Â£280 billion support package which includes furlough, business loans and self employed schemes have so far protected nearly one million jobs and 100,000 businesses in Scotland."" Stuart McIntyre, head of research at the Fraser of Allander economic institute, said: ""With the prime minister announcing that the UK will be eased gradually out of lockdown, it seems inevitable that Rishi Sunak will need to keep his economic support measures - including furlough - in place for longer still. ""Lifting these support measures too early runs the risk of precipitating a sharp rise in unemployment. ""Given that we have come so far with this public health crisis, an extra few months of support makes clear economic sense.""

"Healthy rivers are essential for fish to thrive A report has warned of a ""catastrophic"" decline in freshwater fish, with nearly a third threatened by extinction. Conservation groups said 80 species were known to have gone extinct, 16 in the last year alone. Millions of people rely on freshwater fish for food and as a source of income through angling and the pet trade. But numbers have plummeted due to pressures including pollution, unsustainable fishing, and the damming and draining of rivers and wetlands. The report said populations of migratory fish have fallen by three-quarters in the last 50 years. Over the same time period, populations of larger species, known as ""megafish"", have crashed by 94%. ,external' Hedge trimmer' fish facing global extinction 'Hedge trimmer' fish facing global extinction 'You can't be afraid when fishing for sharks' The report, The World's Forgotten Fishes, is by 16 conservation groups, including WWF, the London Zoological Society (ZSL), Global Wildlife Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. Dead fish in the water near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In UK waters, the sturgeon and the burbot have vanished, salmon are disappearing and the European eel remains critically endangered. According to the WWF, much of the decline is driven by the poor state of rivers, mostly as a result of pollution, dams and sewage. It has called on the government to restore freshwater habitats to good health through proper enforcement of existing laws, strengthening protections in the Environment Bill and championing a strong set of global targets for the recovery of nature. Dave Tickner, from WWF, said freshwater habitats are some of the most vibrant on earth, but - as this report shows - they are in catastrophic decline around the world. ""Nature is in freefall and the UK is no exception: wildlife struggles to survive, let alone thrive, in our polluted waters,"" said the organisation's chief adviser on freshwater. ""If we are to take this government's environmental promises seriously, it must get its act together, clean up our rivers and restore our freshwater habitats to good health. "" Large fish such as sturgeon are dying out faster Carmen Revenga of The Nature Conservancy said freshwater fish are a diverse and unique group of species that are not only essential for the healthy functioning of our rivers, lakes and wetlands, but millions of people, particularly the poor, also depend on them for their food and income. ""It's now more urgent than ever that we find the collective political will and effective collaboration with private sector, governments, NGOs and communities, to implement nature-based solutions that protect freshwater species, while also ensuring human needs are met,"" she said. Commenting, Dr Jeremy Biggs, of the Freshwater Habitats Trust, said to protect freshwater biodiversity, we need to consider both large and small waters, and to protect all our freshwaters: ponds, lakes, streams and rivers.

Lisa Dawn Fisher was verbally abusive when the officers called at a flat in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, on 30 January. The 31-year-old, who admitted two counts of assault against an emergency worker, was sentenced at Scarborough Magistrates' Court on 17 February. She was also ordered to pay Â£75 compensation. North Yorkshire Police say there has been an increase in assaults against emergency service workers. Read more here.

Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The Republic of Ireland is to continue at its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions until at least 5 April. The widely expected decision to maintain Level Five has been taken at a cabinet meeting today. But primary schools will reopen on Monday for the four youngest age groups, with final year secondary students also returning then. Other pupils and students will resume their schooling in a phased manner over the coming weeks, along with pre-school childcare. The Irish government has decided to take a cautious approach to easing its lockdown, arguing its aim is the long-term suppression of the virus. Ireland's vaccination programme has been hampered by supply issues and the relatively late authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the European Medicines Agency. But the Republic is near the top of the EU league in vaccinating people, once the injections arrive in the state. Read more here. A police officer has been dismissed after she attended a four-person gathering during lockdown and then crashed her car into a shop while drunk. PC Tasia Stephens, 24, from South Wales Police, lost her job and was barred from working in the profession again. She admitted gross misconduct at a tribunal, after attending the party last April during the first lockdown. She has since been sentenced after admitting drink-driving. PC Stephens' representative had argued she had been ""distressed"" after recently dealing with her first sudden death while on duty. Read the full story here. One of today's main areas of focus has been the Scottish Parliament where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was setting out how lockdown restrictions will ease. Here's how she made the announcement this afternoon. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Scotland's economy to begin to reopen at the end of April' A Covid-19 antibodies survey in Nigeria suggests four million people in Lagos state alone have had the virus - more than has been officially recorded for the whole of Africa. The official figure for Nigeria is 153,000 cases with 1,862 deaths. The study was done on 10,000 people from four Nigerian states to estimate the extent of coronavirus in Africa's most populous nation. It was conducted in September and October - before a second wave began in early December. Nigeria recorded its highest daily infection rate in January, when it logged 1,600 new cases, suggesting many more people were infected in the second wave. Find out more about the survey here. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures showing a further 8,489 coronavirus cases have been recorded and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. It shows the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital continue to fall. In the past 24 hours we've also heard a lot fromboth Boris JohnsonandNicola Sturgeonas they set out their plans to ease lockdown in England and Scotland. But both of them were clear - decisions around lockdown would be based on the data, and dependent on the current positive trends continuing. In England, there are four tests to taking each step of lockdown easing and they consider things like the infection rate and number of people in hospital.

"The new law requires tech firms to pay for displaying links to news stories Facebook has announced it will restore news content to its users in Australia. The tech giant has blocked news to Australians on its platform since last Thursday amid a dispute over a proposed law which would force it and Google to pay news publishers for content. Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg had told him the ban would end ""in the coming days"", after the pair had talks. Mr Frydenberg said amendments would be made to the law. ""Facebook has re-friended Australia,"" he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. The government has been debating the law - seen as a possible test case for regulation globally - in the Senate, after it was passed in the lower house last week. Last Thursday, Australians woke up to find they could not access or share any news stories on their accounts. Facebook argued it had been forced to block Australian news in response to the proposed legislation. The government's news code aims to set up a ""fairer"" negotiation process between the tech giants and news companies over the value of news content. What happened after Facebook blocked news in Australia? Facebook blocks news content in Australia But it has been strongly opposed by Facebook and Google - both argue the code misunderstands how the internet works. Facebook has also said it gets little commercial gain from news content. This video can not be played Australians react to Facebook's news ban (18 February) But the Australian government says the code is needed to ""level the playing field"" for news publishers, which have seen profits slump in the internet age. By Tuesday evening it was reported that multiple companies, including the Guardian Australia and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, had resumed talks with the social media giant. Seven West Media, a large media company, then announced in a statement they had signed a letter of intent to provide its news content to the platform after reaching an agreement. Facebook said on Tuesday that it had been reassured by recent discussions with the government. ""Going forward, the government has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won't automatically be subject to forced negotiation,"" said Campbell Brown, vice president of global news partnerships at Facebook. ""We have come to an agreement that will allow us to support the publishers we choose to, including small and local publishers."" Facebook already has its own ""showcase"" product - Facebook News Tab - through which it pays media organisations a fee to display their stories on its platform. This feature however, is only available in the UK and US. Google had also threatened to withdraw its primary search engine from Australia, but the company has recently agreed deals with local media companies. Facebook's move to ban Australian news was a big risk last week. It made global headlines - not least because it also initially restricted some government health-department and emergency services pages. Some have been perplexed by the move. Why would Facebook openly court such negative headlines? Critics called the move undemocratic - authoritarian even. There are claims that fake news on the platform increased since the ban - though that's difficult to prove. But Facebook isn't the only voice to say these new laws are badly drafted. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web, said he was concerned that forcing companies to pay for certain content could make the internet ""unworkable"". The proposed law was also seen by some as heavily influenced by the lobbying operations of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp - which owns many of Australia's major newspapers. The law's intention was to protect struggling journalism, not to line the pockets of a media dynasty. There does now appear to be movement on both sides. Crucially, Facebook objected to the idea of a ""forced negotiation' with news outlets, which it now believes is off the table. However although both sides have moved, and both will claim victory, this whole episode has damaged Facebook. Politicians from across the world offered support to the Australian government - there were even accusations of bullying by the social network. And considering Facebook desperately doesn't want these laws replicated in other countries, antagonising Australia's allies may not have been the smartest of moves. The government and Facebook have reached a compromise of sorts. Australian authorities will introduce four further amendments, including one that means the government may not apply the code to Facebook if it can demonstrate a ""significant contribution"" to local journalism. They include a two-month mediation period before government-enforced arbitration kicks in - giving parties more time to reach a private deal. Australia's largest locally-owned company Nine Entertainment said it was ""pleased"" the government had found a compromise and was looking forward to resuming talks about a commercial arrangement.

"The government should buy more British food for schools and hospitals, Sir Keir Starmer has said in a speech to the National Farmers Union (NFU). The Labour leader also denied that his party was anti-countryside, calling the idea ""more perception than reality"". International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said leaving the EU provided the chance to end ""50 years of an anti-innovation"" approach imposed by the bloc. The NFU's conference was its first since the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal. The virtual get-together happened on the same day that Brussels asked for the full ratification of the agreement to be delayed until the end of April - to which the UK government agreed. Jam firm's sticky year amid Covid-19 spread Starmer targets savers in 'national recovery plan' Next steps in England's rural revolution unveiled Some businesses have complained of more friction at borders and an increase in bureaucracy in recent weeks since the deal came into force, with the Britain leaving the European single market and customs union. There are also concerns about trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But Ms Truss was keen to talk up the future of UK agriculture, telling NFU members it would continue to ""lead the world in food and drink"" and had quality and safety standards which were ""second to none"". In a press conference afterwards, she admitted that there ""continue to be issues to work through"", but ministers would work to ""make sure that trade continues to flow"". And Environment Secretary George Eustice said that following Brexit, farmers would be rewarded for ""farming more sustainably, creating space for nature on their land, enhancing animal welfare and reducing carbon emissions"". During his speech, Sir Keir said more of the government's catering budget should go on British produce. He also argued that moneyfrom his proposed Covid Recovery Bond schemecould go towards helping rural communities, for example by investing in long-term flood protection. A 2014 government report said the public sector spent about Â£2.4bn on food for schools, hospitals and the armed forces. Sir Keir's appearance at the NFU conference was the first by a Labour leader since Tony Blair in 2008 and he used the opportunity to tackle perceptions of a ""distance that has grown"" between his party and rural communities. He argued that Labour had strong connections to the countryside, citing its support for protecting British food standards. Sir Keir said: ""No party can claim to represent the country if we don't represent the countryside.""

Lisa Dawn Fisher was verbally abusive when the officers called at a flat in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, on 30 January. The 31-year-old, who admitted two counts of assault against an emergency worker, was sentenced at Scarborough Magistrates' Court on 17 February. She was also ordered to pay Â£75 compensation. North Yorkshire Police say there has been an increase in assaults against emergency service workers. Read more here.

Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The Republic of Ireland is to continue at its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions until at least 5 April. The widely expected decision to maintain Level Five has been taken at a cabinet meeting today. But primary schools will reopen on Monday for the four youngest age groups, with final year secondary students also returning then. Other pupils and students will resume their schooling in a phased manner over the coming weeks, along with pre-school childcare. The Irish government has decided to take a cautious approach to easing its lockdown, arguing its aim is the long-term suppression of the virus. Ireland's vaccination programme has been hampered by supply issues and the relatively late authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the European Medicines Agency. But the Republic is near the top of the EU league in vaccinating people, once the injections arrive in the state. Read more here. A police officer has been dismissed after she attended a four-person gathering during lockdown and then crashed her car into a shop while drunk. PC Tasia Stephens, 24, from South Wales Police, lost her job and was barred from working in the profession again. She admitted gross misconduct at a tribunal, after attending the party last April during the first lockdown. She has since been sentenced after admitting drink-driving. PC Stephens' representative had argued she had been ""distressed"" after recently dealing with her first sudden death while on duty. Read the full story here. One of today's main areas of focus has been the Scottish Parliament where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was setting out how lockdown restrictions will ease. Here's how she made the announcement this afternoon. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Scotland's economy to begin to reopen at the end of April' A Covid-19 antibodies survey in Nigeria suggests four million people in Lagos state alone have had the virus - more than has been officially recorded for the whole of Africa. The official figure for Nigeria is 153,000 cases with 1,862 deaths. The study was done on 10,000 people from four Nigerian states to estimate the extent of coronavirus in Africa's most populous nation. It was conducted in September and October - before a second wave began in early December. Nigeria recorded its highest daily infection rate in January, when it logged 1,600 new cases, suggesting many more people were infected in the second wave. Find out more about the survey here. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures showing a further 8,489 coronavirus cases have been recorded and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. It shows the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital continue to fall. In the past 24 hours we've also heard a lot fromboth Boris JohnsonandNicola Sturgeonas they set out their plans to ease lockdown in England and Scotland. But both of them were clear - decisions around lockdown would be based on the data, and dependent on the current positive trends continuing. In England, there are four tests to taking each step of lockdown easing and they consider things like the infection rate and number of people in hospital.

"Keighlie Holt has not been able to work as a hairdresser and is retraining as a social media analyst The unemployment rate has risen to its highest level in almost five years, with younger workers bearing the brunt of the job losses, official figures show. The UK's jobless rate rose to 5.1% in the three months to December,external, with the number of people on company payrolls down 726,000 on pre-pandemic levels. Almost three-fifths of these were younger than 25 years. There were, however, some early signs of stabilisation in the jobs market. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a small increase in the numbers of employees paid through payroll over the past couple of months, with 83,000 more people on the books in January compared with the previous month. Average pay rose, too, by 4.7% including bonuses, although this was said to be a statistical quirk rather than a sign of lasting wage growth, Statisticians said this was partly because of the disproportionate fall in the number of young, typically lower-paid workers. Adjusting for this, the ONS said underlying wage growth was ""likely to be under 3%"". The ONS said 1.74 million people were unemployed in the October to December period, up 454,000 from the same quarter in 2019. How high could the unemployment rate go? ""Our survey shows that the unemployment rate has had the biggest annual rise since the financial crisis,"" said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics. ""However, the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for work has stabilised after rising sharply at the start of the pandemic, with many people who lost their jobs early on having now started looking for work."" More than half of UK firms plan to hire new staff Fewest firms planning job cuts since Covid began Despite this, Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that the true underlying picture was not yet clear due to the high number of people still on furlough. He said figures from early February suggested that about six million people were currently furloughed, adding: ""There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what will happen to them when that scheme ends."" The Bank of England is forecasting that the unemployment rate will rise sharply, peaking at an estimated 7.8% later in the year. Keighlie Holt is a 20 year-old hairdresser from Blackpool, which has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. The impact of covid on her industry means she has has only worked for a fraction of the year. She is now retraining as a social media analyst: ""Last year I did what felt like, literally, three months of work. ""December wasn't anywhere near what it's like on any other December, that's normally our busiest time. And then it just wasn't going to go back to normal. No one wanted to get their hair done. No, I wasn't going anywhere."" Today's labour market figures show that pay was up by an average of nearly 5% compared with a year ago - a much bigger pay rise than has been typical for most of the past decade. If you're an employee you may not recognise that figure as anywhere near your own pay rise; a big part of it is because it is an average figure. If you remove nearly 730,000 workers from employers' payrolls, many of whom have been in low-paid occupations such as accommodation and food services - where pay rises have been modest or non-existent - then it flatters the average. However, even allowing for those ""compositional"" effects, the Office for National Statistics estimates that there was still pay growth of 3% overall - far more than inflation at 0.7%. And in some sectors it was better than that: according to the ONS, pay in health and social work rose by an average of 6.2% - some modest compensation, perhaps, for the risks those workers have been taking. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing for next week's Budget, which is expected to set out further plans to help the labour market. ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy,"" Mr Sunak said. ""At the Budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery."" Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, claimed some businesses were ""throwing in the towel"" because the government was taking too long to confirm what business support would be available to them over the next six months. Ms Dodds criticised the government for announcing its roadmap to ending lockdown ""without the clarity of business support"".  She told the BBC ministers ""may relish the theatre of budget"" but it was ""wrong to put decisions off until the Budget"", as some businesses had decided to ""give up"".

"Emma Coronel Aispuro stayed loyal to her husband, attending nearly every day of his trial in 2019 The wife of jailed Mexican drug lord JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n has been arrested in the US on suspicion of drug trafficking, US authorities say. Emma Coronel Aispuro, 31, was detained at Dulles International Airport outside Washington DC. She is charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana. GuzmÃ¡n is currently serving a life sentence in Colorado for drug trafficking and money laundering. The 63-year-old is a former head of the Sinaloa cartel, which officials say was the biggest supplier of drugs to the US. Histrial in 2019 heard shocking revelations about his life, from drugging and raping girls as young as 13 to carrying out the cold-blooded murders of former cartel members and rivals. How El Chapo fell victim to his own legend The downfall of one of the world's most notorious criminals Ms Coronel Aispuro appeared via video link before a federal judge at a court in Washington DC on Tuesday and was ordered to remain in detention for the time being. Emma Coronel Aispuro appeared during a virtual hearing at a federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday Prosecutor Anthony Nardozzi said Ms Coronel Aispuro had ""worked closely"" with members of the Sinaloa cartel and had possessed the ""financial means to generate a serious risk of flight"". As well as facing drug trafficking charges, she is also accused of conspiring with others to help her husband escape from prison in Mexico in 2015. He was sprung from Mexico's maximum-security Altiplano prison after his sons bought a property near the prison and a GPS watch smuggled into the prison gave diggers his exact location. He escaped by riding a specially adapted small motorcycle through the tunnel. This video can not be played El Chapo trial: Five facts about Mexican drug lord JoaquÃ­n GuzmÃ¡n Court documents said Ms Coronel Aispuro was allegedly involved in planning another prison escape for her husband before he was extradited to the US in January 2017. She has not commented on the charges. Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said the arrest was ""a matter that the United States will decide"" but added that he hoped the US would share more of the details. Ms Coronel Aispuro is a dual US-Mexico citizen, a former beauty pageant winner and journalism student, and the mother of twins with GuzmÃ¡n. According to previous interviews gave to US media, she first met GuzmÃ¡n at a dance when she was 17 and he was 49. She attended nearly every day of her husband's three-month trial in New York, during which she heard not only grim accounts of murder and rape, but also claims he had spied on her and other mistresses. She came under the media spotlight during that trial. In one instance, she appeared to laugh during the tearful testimony of one of GuzmÃ¡n's mistresses. On another day she and GuzmÃ¡n wore similar velvet jackets, which many people interpreted as a show of solidarity. El Chapo's beauty queen wife stays loyal She remained supportive of GuzmÃ¡n throughout, saying at the end of the trial: ""I don't know my husband as the person they are trying to show him as, but rather I admire him as the human being that I met, and the one that I married."" GuzmÃ¡n came from a poor family in Sinaloa state, north-west Mexico. His organised crime business grew so big that he entered Forbes' 2009 list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn (Â£709m).

"Audio-only social network Clubhouse has confirmed that a user managed to stream content from the app on their website. The app allows users to participate in public or private audio chatrooms, promising that the content has to be experienced live and is not recorded. US cyber-security researchers said a user found a way to stream feeds from multiple chatrooms on Sunday. Clubhouse confirmed the spill, which is when data is released to a place that is not authorised to have access to it. The firm told Bloomberg it had banned the user,externaland installed new ""safeguards"" to prevent conversations from being streamed again. Clubhouse told the BBC that recording or streaming without the explicit permission of the speakers violates the app's terms and conditions. A spokeswoman said: ""Over the weekend, an individual temporarily streamed multiple rooms from their own feed to a website. ""This individual's account has been permanently banned from the service and we have added additional safeguards to prevent people from doing this in the future."" Clubhouse: App's popularity attracts Chinese users Clubhouse downloads 'more than double' in two weeks Stanford University's Internet Observatory reported the incident first, but the programme's chief technology officer David Thiel stressed that the data spill was not malicious or a ""hack"". Instead, he said that it seemed a user had decided to violate Clubhouse's terms. Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter, who built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre, agrees. He explained that a ""data spillage"" was different to a ""data breach"", in that data breaches are deliberate and usually carried out by someone hacking into a system to steal data. A data spillage, on the other hand, is an incident whereby confidential information is released into an environment that is not authorised to have access to the information. Clubhouse does have a problem - it's just immature, says cyber-security expert Robert Potter According to him, the incident occurred because a user had realised that it was possible to be in multiple chatrooms at once. By understanding how this worked, the user could connect a Clubhouse API to his website, and essentially ""share"" his login remotely with anyone on the internet who wanted to listen to the audio chats from the app. ""If you're popular, people will make a third-party app that scrapes data from the service, for example all the third-party programs that scrape information from Twitter,"" Mr Potter told the BBC. Sunday's incident comes after Clubhouse made assurances that user data couldn't be stolen by cyber-criminals or state-sponsored hackers, in response to a warning from Stanford University's Internet Observatory, which is headed by Facebook's former security chief Alex Stamos. Stanford's cyber-security researchersdiscovered several security flaws,external, including the fact that the users' unique ID numbers and the ID numbers of the Clubhouse chatrooms they created were being transmitted in plaintext and it could be possible connect IDs to specific user profiles. The researchers were also concerned that the Chinese government could gain access to the raw audio files on Clubhouse's servers, because its back-end infrastructure is provided by a real-time engagement API firm called Agora, which has offices in both Shanghai and San Francisco. When Agora went public on Wall Street in June, it mentionedin its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),externalthat in China it would be required ""to provide assistance and support in accordance with the law for public security and national security authorities to protect national security or assist with criminal investigations"". Stanford Internet Observatory informed Clubhouse about the security flaws and on 12 February said that it was working with the app firm to improve its security. While it might sound alarming to hear that audio conversations on Clubhouse can be taken out of the app, this isn't exactly new. Users are already using the video and audio recording functions on their devices to capture conversations had by celebrities like Elon Musk and Kevin Hart, and uploading them to YouTube. A screenshot of an recording of Elon Musk's Clubhouse interview on the app Again, this is against the app's terms of service, but it does mean that no-one should expect their conversations to actually be private, warns Mr Thiel. ""Consider Clubhouse chats to be semi-public, given issues with Agora and the fact we all have microphones,""he tweeted,external. Mr Potter thinks the problem is more that Clubhouse is young and still immature as a service. ""I feel like there's a bunch of users who got really enthusiastic because it's a new thing and because you need an invitation, the conversations must be private,"" he said. ""It happened with Zoom and Tiktok - again and again, we see an app that has really high growth, it goes viral, and then they have a privacy problem, or they find lots of problems that weren't so big a deal when they were smaller, and cyber-security comes later."" He added that consumers needed to be realistic about what services do with their data. ""I think people just need to realise that the privacy and cyber-security of newer social media platforms isn't going to be as good as mature ones,"" said Mr Potter. ""If you're going to be an early adopter and try out new apps and new smartphones, there's going to be bugs."" Clubhouse: What is it and how do you get invited?

Sunday's incident comes after Clubhouse made assurances that user data couldn't be stolen by cyber-criminals or state-sponsored hackers, in response to a warning from Stanford University's Internet Observatory, which is headed by Facebook's former security chief Alex Stamos. Stanford's cyber-security researchersdiscovered several security flaws,external, including the fact that the users' unique ID numbers and the ID numbers of the Clubhouse chatrooms they created were being transmitted in plaintext and it could be possible connect IDs to specific user profiles. The researchers were also concerned that the Chinese government could gain access to the raw audio files on Clubhouse's servers, because its back-end infrastructure is provided by a real-time engagement API firm called Agora, which has offices in both Shanghai and San Francisco. When Agora went public on Wall Street in June, it mentionedin its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),externalthat in China it would be required ""to provide assistance and support in accordance with the law for public security and national security authorities to protect national security or assist with criminal investigations"". Stanford Internet Observatory informed Clubhouse about the security flaws and on 12 February said that it was working with the app firm to improve its security. While it might sound alarming to hear that audio conversations on Clubhouse can be taken out of the app, this isn't exactly new. Users are already using the video and audio recording functions on their devices to capture conversations had by celebrities like Elon Musk and Kevin Hart, and uploading them to YouTube. A screenshot of an recording of Elon Musk's Clubhouse interview on the app Again, this is against the app's terms of service, but it does mean that no-one should expect their conversations to actually be private, warns Mr Thiel. ""Consider Clubhouse chats to be semi-public, given issues with Agora and the fact we all have microphones,""he tweeted,external. Mr Potter thinks the problem is more that Clubhouse is young and still immature as a service. ""I feel like there's a bunch of users who got really enthusiastic because it's a new thing and because you need an invitation, the conversations must be private,"" he said. ""It happened with Zoom and Tiktok - again and again, we see an app that has really high growth, it goes viral, and then they have a privacy problem, or they find lots of problems that weren't so big a deal when they were smaller, and cyber-security comes later."" He added that consumers needed to be realistic about what services do with their data. ""I think people just need to realise that the privacy and cyber-security of newer social media platforms isn't going to be as good as mature ones,"" said Mr Potter. ""If you're going to be an early adopter and try out new apps and new smartphones, there's going to be bugs."" Clubhouse: What is it and how do you get invited?

"Keighlie Holt has not been able to work as a hairdresser and is retraining as a social media analyst The unemployment rate has risen to its highest level in almost five years, with younger workers bearing the brunt of the job losses, official figures show. The UK's jobless rate rose to 5.1% in the three months to December,external, with the number of people on company payrolls down 726,000 on pre-pandemic levels. Almost three-fifths of these were younger than 25 years. There were, however, some early signs of stabilisation in the jobs market. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a small increase in the numbers of employees paid through payroll over the past couple of months, with 83,000 more people on the books in January compared with the previous month. Average pay rose, too, by 4.7% including bonuses, although this was said to be a statistical quirk rather than a sign of lasting wage growth, Statisticians said this was partly because of the disproportionate fall in the number of young, typically lower-paid workers. Adjusting for this, the ONS said underlying wage growth was ""likely to be under 3%"". The ONS said 1.74 million people were unemployed in the October to December period, up 454,000 from the same quarter in 2019. How high could the unemployment rate go? ""Our survey shows that the unemployment rate has had the biggest annual rise since the financial crisis,"" said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics. ""However, the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for work has stabilised after rising sharply at the start of the pandemic, with many people who lost their jobs early on having now started looking for work."" More than half of UK firms plan to hire new staff Fewest firms planning job cuts since Covid began Despite this, Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that the true underlying picture was not yet clear due to the high number of people still on furlough. He said figures from early February suggested that about six million people were currently furloughed, adding: ""There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what will happen to them when that scheme ends."" The Bank of England is forecasting that the unemployment rate will rise sharply, peaking at an estimated 7.8% later in the year. Keighlie Holt is a 20 year-old hairdresser from Blackpool, which has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. The impact of covid on her industry means she has has only worked for a fraction of the year. She is now retraining as a social media analyst: ""Last year I did what felt like, literally, three months of work. ""December wasn't anywhere near what it's like on any other December, that's normally our busiest time. And then it just wasn't going to go back to normal. No one wanted to get their hair done. No, I wasn't going anywhere."" Today's labour market figures show that pay was up by an average of nearly 5% compared with a year ago - a much bigger pay rise than has been typical for most of the past decade. If you're an employee you may not recognise that figure as anywhere near your own pay rise; a big part of it is because it is an average figure. If you remove nearly 730,000 workers from employers' payrolls, many of whom have been in low-paid occupations such as accommodation and food services - where pay rises have been modest or non-existent - then it flatters the average. However, even allowing for those ""compositional"" effects, the Office for National Statistics estimates that there was still pay growth of 3% overall - far more than inflation at 0.7%. And in some sectors it was better than that: according to the ONS, pay in health and social work rose by an average of 6.2% - some modest compensation, perhaps, for the risks those workers have been taking. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing for next week's Budget, which is expected to set out further plans to help the labour market. ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy,"" Mr Sunak said. ""At the Budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery."" Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, claimed some businesses were ""throwing in the towel"" because the government was taking too long to confirm what business support would be available to them over the next six months. Ms Dodds criticised the government for announcing its roadmap to ending lockdown ""without the clarity of business support"".  She told the BBC ministers ""may relish the theatre of budget"" but it was ""wrong to put decisions off until the Budget"", as some businesses had decided to ""give up"".

"Healthy rivers are essential for fish to thrive A report has warned of a ""catastrophic"" decline in freshwater fish, with nearly a third threatened by extinction. Conservation groups said 80 species were known to have gone extinct, 16 in the last year alone. Millions of people rely on freshwater fish for food and as a source of income through angling and the pet trade. But numbers have plummeted due to pressures including pollution, unsustainable fishing, and the damming and draining of rivers and wetlands. The report said populations of migratory fish have fallen by three-quarters in the last 50 years. Over the same time period, populations of larger species, known as ""megafish"", have crashed by 94%. ,external' Hedge trimmer' fish facing global extinction 'Hedge trimmer' fish facing global extinction 'You can't be afraid when fishing for sharks' The report, The World's Forgotten Fishes, is by 16 conservation groups, including WWF, the London Zoological Society (ZSL), Global Wildlife Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. Dead fish in the water near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In UK waters, the sturgeon and the burbot have vanished, salmon are disappearing and the European eel remains critically endangered. According to the WWF, much of the decline is driven by the poor state of rivers, mostly as a result of pollution, dams and sewage. It has called on the government to restore freshwater habitats to good health through proper enforcement of existing laws, strengthening protections in the Environment Bill and championing a strong set of global targets for the recovery of nature. Dave Tickner, from WWF, said freshwater habitats are some of the most vibrant on earth, but - as this report shows - they are in catastrophic decline around the world. ""Nature is in freefall and the UK is no exception: wildlife struggles to survive, let alone thrive, in our polluted waters,"" said the organisation's chief adviser on freshwater. ""If we are to take this government's environmental promises seriously, it must get its act together, clean up our rivers and restore our freshwater habitats to good health. "" Large fish such as sturgeon are dying out faster Carmen Revenga of The Nature Conservancy said freshwater fish are a diverse and unique group of species that are not only essential for the healthy functioning of our rivers, lakes and wetlands, but millions of people, particularly the poor, also depend on them for their food and income. ""It's now more urgent than ever that we find the collective political will and effective collaboration with private sector, governments, NGOs and communities, to implement nature-based solutions that protect freshwater species, while also ensuring human needs are met,"" she said. Commenting, Dr Jeremy Biggs, of the Freshwater Habitats Trust, said to protect freshwater biodiversity, we need to consider both large and small waters, and to protect all our freshwaters: ponds, lakes, streams and rivers.

"This video can not be played Hancock: 'This is on everyone to act together' Everybody has to ""play their part"" to meet the dates for England's lockdown to be eased, Matt Hancock has said. But it is currently ""too early"" to say how long social distancing will be in place, the health secretary said. The aim is for measures like masks to become a ""matter of personal responsibility"", rather than law, in the future. Boris Johnson has outlined a strategy that could see restrictions lifted by 21 June - if strict conditions are met. Nicola Sturgeon is to revealplans to ease restrictionsin Scotland later. She has said Scotland will return to a tiered system, meaning different parts of the country could be under different rules. Kuenssberg: PM steers country towards the exit Why can't we unlock more quickly? What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? Holiday bookings surge on lockdown exit plans The health secretary told the BBC it is ""vital"" that ""everybody plays their part"" to make sure ""that we hit these dates and get out of this as soon as we possibly can, safely"". People should be able to hug friends and family from 17 May, when the most vulnerable groups have had two coronavirus vaccine jabs, he said. Mr Hancock said eradicating Covid-19 completely is ""not going to be possible"" and that everyone would have to ""learn to live with it"", as we do with flu. He said he wanted measures to become a ""matter of personal responsibility and social norms"" that could see people choosing to wear masks on public transport, for example. There is already evidence that the vaccines were working, with the number of deaths ""coming down really sharply"", he added. He urged people to take up their vaccine offer, amid warnings the virus could persist in inner city communities where uptake is low. Dr Mike Tildesley, reader in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the University of Warwick and member of government advisory group SPI-M, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this was a ""real concern"". ""It's really important that we get the vaccines out to those deprived communities to prevent a potential wave of infections occurring as we do unlock,"" he added. Mr Hancock said it is ""absolutely on all of us"" to get the vaccine when invited. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show coronavirus deaths continue to decline. In the week of 12 February, there were 17,136 deaths registered in the UK, down by 1,710 on the previous week. Deaths are still running above usual levels for this time of year, however. They were 26% higher than the average for the same week over the past five years. In the first step of the prime minister's roadmap, all pupils in England's schools are expected to return to class from8 March, with mass testing and wider use of face masks in secondary schools. There will be a further easing on29 March,with groups of up to six people or two households allowed to gather in parks and gardens. Shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality, as well as self-contained holiday accommodation, could reopen on12 April.A review of international leisure travel restrictions will be completed by this date. From17 May,two households or a group of six may be able to meet indoors in a pub or other hospitality venue such as restaurants. Cinemas, museums, hotels, performances and sporting events will also reopen, with up to 30 people able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes. The final step from21 Junewill potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs. Progressing along the schedule will depend on four tests: the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence of vaccine efficacy, an assessment of new variants, and keeping infection rates below a level that could put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. There will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. This video can not be played Watch the full statement by Boris Johnson on England's roadmap out of the Covid-19 lockdown On Monday, Mr Johnson told a Downing Street news conference he could not guarantee his plan would be irreversible ""but the intention is that it should be"". He added that the coming spring and summer would be ""seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all"". As part of its plans, the government wants to determine whether offering ""Covid status"" certificates, which could be used by people to demonstrate they had received a vaccine or a negative coronavirus test, could help venues open again. Mr Johnson acknowledged there were ""clearly some quite complex issues, some ethical issues"" but later told a meeting of his own MPs that ""a debate had to be had"". MPs will vote on the roadmap in late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers. Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that without clarity on business support - like the VAT reduction and the business rates holiday - ""many businesses are simply throwing in the towel now and we cannot afford that in the UK when we've already had record redundancies"". Conservative MP Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory lockdown-sceptics, said the ""pace of change will be a hammer blow"" to industries such as aviation, hospitality and the arts. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterwants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schoolsfollowing Mr Johnson's announcement in England. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"The Welsh Government spells out how it will strengthen day to day businesses post-Covid Town centres are to be the focus of the Welsh Government's ""mission"" for post-Covid economic recovery. An extra Â£270m is to be made available to offer long-term financial help to businesses. However firms that are given government support will be expected to reduce carbon use and be fair employers. Deputy Minister Lee Waters said Wales must set out a ""green, prosperous and a fairer"" economic recovery from the pandemic. In its Economic Resilience and Reconstruction Mission, the Welsh Government has spelt out how it aims to strengthen businesses and help those firms that innovate, to offer skilled jobs. Employers will be encouraged to show how their organisations are reducing their impact on the environment and promise permanent work. Firms accuse ministers of 'silence' over reopening Welsh economy in decline before Covid hit ""If businesses want support from the government they have to sign up to give something back as well - an economic and social contract which respects fair work, respects the environment and can harness and support workers mental health, I think that's a fair deal,"" said Mr Waters. More public sector money will be encouraged to be spent within Wales With high streets in Wales already changing, the mission said Covid has increased the speed of that change - as seen with the closure ofDebenhamsandTopshopstores, among others. The Welsh Government said different departments are working to help towns have a new future, by repurposing buildings and encouraging hubs where people can work closer to home rather than commuting. The public sector in Wales spends around Â£6bn a year and the plan is for more to be spent within Wales, to help jobs and prosperity. NHS Wales, for example, spends Â£22m a year on food - 48% of which is being spent with businesses outside Wales. Last decade's progress to reduce unemployment has been partly reversed by efforts to combat Covid However, the Welsh Government claimed efforts to combat Covid and effects of Brexit have reversed the last decade's progress in reducing unemployment and economic inactivity. Young people, women, disabled people and ethnic communities are being hit hardest with job losses and working fewer hours because of Covid, ministers say. The mission also wants business success to be measured by the percentage of people in permanent employment, narrowing the gender pay gap, household incomes, air pollution levels, greenhouse gas emissions and the percentage of companies carrying out research and development. Welsh Conservative economy spokesman, Russell George MS, welcomed the additional support but said it is ""disappointing Labour ministers continue to drag their heels"" on extending the business rates holiday. ""We now face a huge challenge to rebuild Wales after the pandemic, and Welsh Labour's dismal track record has stifled economic growth to the extent where ministers have admitted they don't know what they've been doing on the economy,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's economy spokeswoman, Helen Mary Jones, said the Welsh Government's plan was ""a pale imitation"" of her party's Â£6bn Welsh Green Deal, which claims to see 60,000 jobs created. ""Twenty years of a Labour government in Wales has been characterised by a failure of delivery,"" she said.

"The Cherokee Nation wants Jeep to stop using its name to sell the firm's classic sports utility vehicles. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr said ""it's time"" for companies and sports teams to retire Native American iconography from logos, mascots and other products.

""We are, more than ever, committed to a respectful and open dialogue with Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr."" Jeep, which is owned by multinational Stellantis after the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group, is one of many corporations under pressure to update branding. Amid widespread Black Lives Matter protests last summer, food companies such as PepsiCo said they would overhaul certain products, after criticism that its brands relied on racist tropes. Some sports teams have also announced changes. The Cherokee Indians say they do not feel honoured by having their name on the side of a car ""I think we're in a day and age in this country where it's time for both corporations and team sports to retire the use of Native American names, images and mascots from their products, team jerseys and sports in general,"" Mr Hoskin said in a statement.

""It's really important that we get the vaccines out to those deprived communities to prevent a potential wave of infections occurring as we do unlock,"" he added. Mr Hancock said it is ""absolutely on all of us"" to get the vaccine when invited. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show coronavirus deaths continue to decline. In the week of 12 February, there were 17,136 deaths registered in the UK, down by 1,710 on the previous week. Deaths are still running above usual levels for this time of year, however. They were 26% higher than the average for the same week over the past five years. In the first step of the prime minister's roadmap, all pupils in England's schools are expected to return to class from8 March, with mass testing and wider use of face masks in secondary schools. There will be a further easing on29 March,with groups of up to six people or two households allowed to gather in parks and gardens. Shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality, as well as self-contained holiday accommodation, could reopen on12 April.A review of international leisure travel restrictions will be completed by this date. From17 May,two households or a group of six may be able to meet indoors in a pub or other hospitality venue such as restaurants. Cinemas, museums, hotels, performances and sporting events will also reopen, with up to 30 people able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes. The final step from21 Junewill potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs. Progressing along the schedule will depend on four tests: the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence of vaccine efficacy, an assessment of new variants, and keeping infection rates below a level that could put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. There will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. This video can not be played Watch the full statement by Boris Johnson on England's roadmap out of the Covid-19 lockdown On Monday, Mr Johnson told a Downing Street news conference he could not guarantee his plan would be irreversible ""but the intention is that it should be"". He added that the coming spring and summer would be ""seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all"". As part of its plans, the government wants to determine whether offering ""Covid status"" certificates, which could be used by people to demonstrate they had received a vaccine or a negative coronavirus test, could help venues open again. Mr Johnson acknowledged there were ""clearly some quite complex issues, some ethical issues"" but later told a meeting of his own MPs that ""a debate had to be had"". MPs will vote on the roadmap in late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers. Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that without clarity on business support - like the VAT reduction and the business rates holiday - ""many businesses are simply throwing in the towel now and we cannot afford that in the UK when we've already had record redundancies"". Conservative MP Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory lockdown-sceptics, said the ""pace of change will be a hammer blow"" to industries such as aviation, hospitality and the arts. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterwants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schoolsfollowing Mr Johnson's announcement in England. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"The new law requires tech firms to pay for displaying links to news stories Facebook has announced it will restore news content to its users in Australia. The tech giant has blocked news to Australians on its platform since last Thursday amid a dispute over a proposed law which would force it and Google to pay news publishers for content. Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg had told him the ban would end ""in the coming days"", after the pair had talks. Mr Frydenberg said amendments would be made to the law. ""Facebook has re-friended Australia,"" he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. The government has been debating the law - seen as a possible test case for regulation globally - in the Senate, after it was passed in the lower house last week. Last Thursday, Australians woke up to find they could not access or share any news stories on their accounts. Facebook argued it had been forced to block Australian news in response to the proposed legislation. The government's news code aims to set up a ""fairer"" negotiation process between the tech giants and news companies over the value of news content. What happened after Facebook blocked news in Australia? Facebook blocks news content in Australia But it has been strongly opposed by Facebook and Google - both argue the code misunderstands how the internet works. Facebook has also said it gets little commercial gain from news content. This video can not be played Australians react to Facebook's news ban (18 February) But the Australian government says the code is needed to ""level the playing field"" for news publishers, which have seen profits slump in the internet age. By Tuesday evening it was reported that multiple companies, including the Guardian Australia and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, had resumed talks with the social media giant. Seven West Media, a large media company, then announced in a statement they had signed a letter of intent to provide its news content to the platform after reaching an agreement. Facebook said on Tuesday that it had been reassured by recent discussions with the government. ""Going forward, the government has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won't automatically be subject to forced negotiation,"" said Campbell Brown, vice president of global news partnerships at Facebook. ""We have come to an agreement that will allow us to support the publishers we choose to, including small and local publishers."" Facebook already has its own ""showcase"" product - Facebook News Tab - through which it pays media organisations a fee to display their stories on its platform. This feature however, is only available in the UK and US. Google had also threatened to withdraw its primary search engine from Australia, but the company has recently agreed deals with local media companies. Facebook's move to ban Australian news was a big risk last week. It made global headlines - not least because it also initially restricted some government health-department and emergency services pages. Some have been perplexed by the move. Why would Facebook openly court such negative headlines? Critics called the move undemocratic - authoritarian even. There are claims that fake news on the platform increased since the ban - though that's difficult to prove. But Facebook isn't the only voice to say these new laws are badly drafted. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web, said he was concerned that forcing companies to pay for certain content could make the internet ""unworkable"". The proposed law was also seen by some as heavily influenced by the lobbying operations of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp - which owns many of Australia's major newspapers. The law's intention was to protect struggling journalism, not to line the pockets of a media dynasty. There does now appear to be movement on both sides. Crucially, Facebook objected to the idea of a ""forced negotiation' with news outlets, which it now believes is off the table. However although both sides have moved, and both will claim victory, this whole episode has damaged Facebook. Politicians from across the world offered support to the Australian government - there were even accusations of bullying by the social network. And considering Facebook desperately doesn't want these laws replicated in other countries, antagonising Australia's allies may not have been the smartest of moves. The government and Facebook have reached a compromise of sorts. Australian authorities will introduce four further amendments, including one that means the government may not apply the code to Facebook if it can demonstrate a ""significant contribution"" to local journalism. They include a two-month mediation period before government-enforced arbitration kicks in - giving parties more time to reach a private deal. Australia's largest locally-owned company Nine Entertainment said it was ""pleased"" the government had found a compromise and was looking forward to resuming talks about a commercial arrangement.

"Hayley Arceneaux, a cancer survivor, will achieve a number of firsts when she goes to space this year The first bone cancer survivor to become an astronaut. The first person with a prosthetic body part to visit space. And the youngest American ever to orbit Earth. These are the impressive firsts that could soon be attributable to 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. In January, the physician assistant was picked to join the crew of the world's first all-civilian space mission. Ms Arceneaux was ecstatic but, at first, she had to keep her lips sealed. ""I've held onto the biggest secret of my life for a month and a half. So now I get to share it with the world,"" she told the BBC. Her selection for the historic mission was announced on Monday by the St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where Ms Arceneaux was once a cancer patient as a child and now works. Later this year, she will launch from Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket made by SpaceX, the company founded by business mogul Elon Musk. ""I think this mission is going to inspire people in so many ways,"" Ms Arceneaux said. ""It shows them that anything is possible."" Ms Arceneaux works as a physician's assistant in the hospital where she was a patient There will be no professional astronauts on board the spacecraft. Rather, Ms Arceneaux will be joined by two contest winners and flight commander Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire who is paying for the entire mission. The mission is the pet project of Mr Isaacman, who announced on 1 February that he had bought the rocket launch. Mr Isaacman is aiming to use the flight to raise $200m (Â£142m) for St Jude, half of which he said he will donate himself. Of the four available seats on the spacecraft, one was offered to a member of staff at the hospital. ""From the start, we wanted a crew member that represented the mission's spirit of hope,"" Mr Isaacman said. ""I can't think of a better person than Hayley to fulfil that responsibility."" For Ms Arceneaux, the flight will be the realisation of a feat she never thought was possible. At the age of 10, Ms Arceneaux was a bone cancer patient at St Jude. As part of her treatment at the hospital, Ms Arceneaux had chemotherapy and surgery to replace some of her leg bones with artificial ones. Ms Arceneaux was diagnosed with bone cancer as a child In a different era, Ms Arceneaux's prosthetic leg bones would have grounded her ambitions for space travel as a Nasa astronaut, because of the agency's strict medical requirements. But the emergence of private space missions in recent years has enabled more of us to reach for the stars. ""Until this mission, I could have never been an astronaut,"" Ms Arceneaux said. ""This mission is opening space travel to people who are not physically perfect."" Ms Arceneaux was at home in Tennessee when she got the ""out of the blue"" call on 5 January asking if she would join the mission. Her response? ""Immediately, I said, 'yes, yes please'."" After checking with her family to ""make sure they were not adamantly opposed"", and her brother and sister-in-law who - as aerospace engineers - ""really reassured me how safe space travel is"", she agreed to join the crew. Mr Isaacman is planning to select and reveal the remaining two crew members by March. One will be the winner of a sweepstake competition, whose proceeds will be donated to St Jude. The other will go to the winner of a contest which asks entrepreneurs to design an online store using software made by Shift4, Mr Isaacman's payment technology company. Mr Isaacman will be the commander of the spacecraft Once selected, the crew will undergo a rigorous, months-long training programme, including mission simulations in zero gravity. Ms Arceneaux -  the flight's medical officer - has already tried on her space suit. It was ""so cool"" but ""heavier than I expected"", she said. She will presumably get used to it by the time the rocket lifts off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, sometime at the latter end of 2021. Then, Ms Arceneaux will be wearing the suit for several days as her spacecraft - a SpaceX Dragon capsule - circles the globe. At the end of the mission, the Dragon will re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a soft-water landing off the east coast of the US. Are Ms Arceneaux's nerves jangling? Ms Arceneaux said she hoped her space mission would inspire people with cancer ""I'm really not nervous. I've met the lead engineers for every aspect of this mission. I really trust them."" Compared to what she went through as a child, space travel should be no problem. ""Getting to represent cancer patients and survivors is an incredible honour. It really wasn't that long ago that I was in their shoes,"" she said. ""When you're going through cancer treatment, you're so focused on the day-to-day. It can be really difficult to look toward the future. I hope that this mission will allow them to imagine their future.""

"This video can not be played Biden: ""This nation will smile again"" President Joe Biden has addressed the nation as the US passed the figure of 500,000 Covid-related deaths, the highest number of any country. ""As a nation, we can't accept such a cruel fate. We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow,"" he said on Monday. The president and vice-president, and their spouses, then observed a moment of silence outside the White House during a candle-lighting ceremony. Confirmed US infections now stand at 28.1 million, also a global record. What 500,000 US deaths look like ""Today I ask all Americans to remember. Remember those we lost and remember those we left behind,"" President Biden said, calling for Americans to fight Covid together. This video can not be played The 'colourful' lives lost to Covid - how obituaries are helping us all mourn The president ordered all flags on federal property to be lowered to half mast for the next five days. At the White House, he opened his speech by noting that the number of American deaths from Covid was higher than the death toll from World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War combined. ""Today we mark a truly grim, heartbreaking milestone - 500,071 dead,"" he said. ""We often hear people described as ordinary Americans,"" he went on to say. ""There's no such thing, there's nothing ordinary about them. The people we lost were extraordinary. They span generations. Born in America, emigrated to America."" ""So many of them took their final breath alone in America."" Family mourn Gregory Blanks, 50, who died with Covid in January in Texas He drew on his own experience with grief - his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 and one of his sons died from brain cancer in 2015. ""I know what it's like to not be there when it happens. I know what it's like when you are there holding their hands; there's a look in their eye and they slip away,"" he said. ""For me, the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose."" Mr Biden's approach to the pandemic is different to his predecessor, Donald Trump, who cast doubt on the impact of the deadly virus and was viewed as having politicised the wearing of masks and other measures needed to prevent the spread of the virus. President Biden, Vice-President Harris, the First Lady and the Second Gentleman during a moment of silence On 19 January, one day before Mr Biden took office, he held an event to mark 400,000 Americans dying of the disease. Monday's event, marking the latest death toll, comes about one month later. Elsewhere in Washington, the bells at the National Cathedral tolled 500 times, once for every 1,000 Americans lost during the pandemic. Although numbers are now going in the right direction, hospital admissions - and deaths - remain high, as the key statistics show: The 28.1 million confirmed US infections is nearly double that of second-highest India (11 million) and Brazil (10.1 million),according to Johns Hopkins University research,external But the US ranks ninth in terms of deaths per 100,000 population, behind countries like the UK and Italy At least 90,000 more Americans are expected to have died with the virus by 1 June, an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projection says. By late May, the virus will kill around 500 Americans per day - down from approximately 2,000 now Hospital admission rates have fallen for 40 straight days Average vaccine administrations per day now stand at 1.7 million, twice as many as when Mr Biden took office The growing number of variants, which could spark new deadly outbreaks, remains a concern Dr Ashish Jha, dean of the school of public health at Brown University, told BBC News: ""A year ago I could not have imagined that half a million Americans would lose their lives to this disease. ""We have so much capability, so many resources... this was all preventable and should not have happened. And yet here we are."" Covid world map: Where have the 111m cases been? The nation's top immunologist, Dr Anthony Fauci, told CNN on Sunday: ""People decades from now are going to be talking about this as a terribly historic milestone in the history of this country, to have these many people to have died from a respiratory-borne infection."" Americans' average life expectancy has dropped by one full year due to Covid-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week. The change has been most acute among racial minorities, who have been disproportionally affected by the deadly virus. US life expectancy falls by a year amid pandemic Black men suffered the largest decline, with life expectancy dropping by three years between January and June 2020. And Hispanic men saw a fall in life expectancy of 2.4 years during that period. When did you first say 'coronavirus'? About a year ago, the pandemic hit.

"Healthy rivers are essential for fish to thrive A report has warned of a ""catastrophic"" decline in freshwater fish, with nearly a third threatened by extinction. Conservation groups said 80 species were known to have gone extinct, 16 in the last year alone. Millions of people rely on freshwater fish for food and as a source of income through angling and the pet trade. But numbers have plummeted due to pressures including pollution, unsustainable fishing, and the damming and draining of rivers and wetlands. The report said populations of migratory fish have fallen by three-quarters in the last 50 years. Over the same time period, populations of larger species, known as ""megafish"", have crashed by 94%. ,external' Hedge trimmer' fish facing global extinction 'Hedge trimmer' fish facing global extinction 'You can't be afraid when fishing for sharks' The report, The World's Forgotten Fishes, is by 16 conservation groups, including WWF, the London Zoological Society (ZSL), Global Wildlife Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. Dead fish in the water near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In UK waters, the sturgeon and the burbot have vanished, salmon are disappearing and the European eel remains critically endangered. According to the WWF, much of the decline is driven by the poor state of rivers, mostly as a result of pollution, dams and sewage. It has called on the government to restore freshwater habitats to good health through proper enforcement of existing laws, strengthening protections in the Environment Bill and championing a strong set of global targets for the recovery of nature. Dave Tickner, from WWF, said freshwater habitats are some of the most vibrant on earth, but - as this report shows - they are in catastrophic decline around the world. ""Nature is in freefall and the UK is no exception: wildlife struggles to survive, let alone thrive, in our polluted waters,"" said the organisation's chief adviser on freshwater. ""If we are to take this government's environmental promises seriously, it must get its act together, clean up our rivers and restore our freshwater habitats to good health. "" Large fish such as sturgeon are dying out faster Carmen Revenga of The Nature Conservancy said freshwater fish are a diverse and unique group of species that are not only essential for the healthy functioning of our rivers, lakes and wetlands, but millions of people, particularly the poor, also depend on them for their food and income. ""It's now more urgent than ever that we find the collective political will and effective collaboration with private sector, governments, NGOs and communities, to implement nature-based solutions that protect freshwater species, while also ensuring human needs are met,"" she said. Commenting, Dr Jeremy Biggs, of the Freshwater Habitats Trust, said to protect freshwater biodiversity, we need to consider both large and small waters, and to protect all our freshwaters: ponds, lakes, streams and rivers.

"More than 70 people died following the fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017 The use of a company's cladding at Grenfell Tower was ""an accident waiting to happen"", one of its bosses has agreed at a public inquiry. Claude Schmidt said ""maybe yes"" to a barrister's description of the risk. Mr Schmidt, Arconic's French president, was giving his fifth day of evidence to the Grenfell Tower public inquiry. The inquiry heard that even after the fire, an ""error"" on a draft product certificate for the cladding suggested it could be used on tall buildings. Mr Schmidt was being questioned by Richard Millett QC, the inquiry's senior counsel, about the weeks after the fire on 14 June 2017, which led to 72 deaths. Grenfell cladding email: Keep test 'confidential' Grenfell cladding firm gave fire test 'half-truth' Newscast: 'Half-truths' at the Grenfell Inquiry London Fire Brigade still to fix Grenfell failings Â£3.5bn for unsafe cladding 'too little, too late' Arconic's cladding panels had quickly emerged as a likely cause of the swift spread of flames across Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London. On 26 June, Arconic withdrew the product from the market for buildings taller than 18m, claiming that it had realised it was being ""incorrectly used"", including on Grenfell. Mr Millett asked him ""isn't the reality that Grenfell, as far as the use of Reynobond PE 55 [cladding] was concerned, that it was an accident waiting to happen and only then did you withdraw it from the market"". Mr Schmidt's response, as translated from French, was ""maybe yes."" But he said the company ""were among the only ones to withdraw the product from the market. It was because we couldn't control the supply chain."" Arconic's case is that it realised after the fire it could not be sure customers would use its flammable polyethylene version of the cladding safely. Mr Millett said ""wasn't that all the more reason to stop selling"". ""Yes"", Mr Schmidt agreed. He said that the decision not to sell the cladding for high-rise buildings was not made because it was ""inherently dangerous"" but said it did ""have certain characteristics which, if it is used incorrectly, can increase the risk of fire spread"". The inquiry says the cladding was a major cause of the rapid spread of flames during the disaster and this phase of its hearings are determining why it was used. The inquiry has heard, and Mr Schmidt also agreed, that for 12 years before the Grenfell fire, Arconic failed to reveal poor fire test data for the cassette form of its cladding to an important British building industry body. The British Board of AgrÃ©ment had issued a standards certificate for the product, relied on by the industry, which suggested all versions of the cladding met British standards. This document was sent to the contractors for Grenfell. They selected the Arconic cladding, and a design which would use it in exactly the cassette configuration which the tests suggested would allow fires to spread. Even after the fire, a redrafted BBA certificate continued to claim better fire test data than the company had. It also emerged at the inquiry thata BBC investigation into Arconic in 2018prompted the Board to challenge the cladding firm about what information it had been given. The BBC had discovered the series of poor fire tests reports, commissioned by Arconic, which have been at the heart of this phase of the inquiry. They were carried out in France, but were not published in the UK, and not passed to the British Board of AgrÃ©ment. In March 2018 the BBC shared them with the Board, which confirmed the information, crucial to the product certificate, had not been handed over. Challenged by the BBA, Mr Schmidt said he was ""happy"" to send them.  Brian Moore, from the BBA, responded that it was ""concerning"" to hear that Arconic had the reports. But despite this exchange of emails, they were never handed over, due to legal advice, Mr Schmidt said. By this point, the inquiry, and the police had begun in-depth investigations.
