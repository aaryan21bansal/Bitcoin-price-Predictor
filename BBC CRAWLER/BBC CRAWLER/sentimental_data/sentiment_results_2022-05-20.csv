"MicheÃ¡l Martin said he had always been critical of any moves to ""collapse the assembly"" The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) cannot be allowed to block the Northern Ireland Assembly the Irish PM has said. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin has met the main Stormont parties to discuss the Northern Ireland Protocol and the assembly crisis. The DUP is refusing to return to power-sharing unless its issues with the protocol are resolved. Mr Martin said those issues can be resolved, but only in a negotiated settlement between the UK and EU. The assembly is not sitting afterthe DUP refused to support the election of a new Speakerfollowing the election on 5 May as part of its ongoing protest against the protocol. The party took the action as part of its ongoing protest over thepost-Brexit trade arrangement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. Without the election of a new Speaker, assembly members (MLAs) cannot take their seats at Stormont. After his meetings, Mr Martin said all parties had indicated a ""desire"" to have the assembly running and an executive formed. ""It's my view, that after any election in any democratic part of the world, the natural follow-on is the convening of the parliament that has been elected by the people,"" he said. The taoiseach said he accepted there are some issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol, but said they could only be resolved with ""substantive, serious negotiations between the European Union and the UK government"". Referring to the DUP, Mr Martin said the party was willing to take up the post of deputy first minister in any new executive, but their issues with the protocol were preventing that happening. Mr Martin added that ""the assembly and the executive should operate in parallel with the UK government and the EU in the context of substantive negotiation to resolve issues with the protocol"". The SDLP said it had a ""good"" chat with the taoiseach It is the first time the DUP leader, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood, have met the taoiseach in personsince the assembly election. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party and the taoiseach both agreed the assembly and the executive needs to formed immediately. He said: ""People have real priorities out there. The cost of living crisis is crippling families all across the north - we know the number of people who are on health waiting lists - and Jeffrey Dondaldson is playing a political game about an issue he cant resolve. ""Playing these sorts of games will not sort anybody's problems out, so it's over to Jeffrey Donaldson now. ""He can sit back and let the pressure build on him if he wants. My view is we should be sitting down together, working on the people's priorities."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney also met on Friday. Following the meeting, Mr Coveney tweeted that he had ""made clear"" to Ms Truss ""Ireland's opposition to the UK breaching international law"". ""The UK needs to get back to talks with the EU,"" he added. It comes as the US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the protocol must remain. Mrs Pelosi said the UK government's suggestion it could act unilaterally to change the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland was deeply concerning and could negatively affect the Good Friday Agreement. Responding to Mrs Pelosi, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it was ""absolutely evident"" that the protocol was undermining the agreement. ""It has made it impossible to have power-sharing on the basis of consensus,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster. ""If Nancy Pelosi wants to see the agreement protected then she needs to recognise that in fact it's the protocol that is harming and undermining the agreement and that's why we have to deal with it."" UUP leader Doug Beattie said Mrs Pelosi's comments ""are not just deeply regrettable and misinformed, but are completely wrong"". He told the BBC's Talkback programme the comments ""would harden people's positions"" . ""It is more negative than positive, I think we all have to watch our language in regards to these negotiations, but what we do need to do is make sure we keep negotiating,"" he said. Mr Beatie said he would support the UK government changing the rules to allow an assembly Speaker to be elected. Under existing rules, both unionists and nationalists must agree to a Speaker, which is why the DUP have been able to stall the process. Michelle O'Neill said it was important for MicheÃ¡l Martin to assert his role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement Ahead of his meeting with the taoiseach, Sir Jeffrey said ""the unionist viewpoint can no longer be ignored"". In a statement, Sir Jeffrey added that power-sharing ""only works with the consent of unionists and nationalists"" and while he wanted to see Stormont's political institutions working fully, that could only happen by ""building consensus"". Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said Mr Martin had ""a very significant role in terms of being the co-guarantor"" of the Good Friday Agreement and it was important for him to ""assert"" that role at a time when ""democracy is being denied"". She said the DUP was ""holding up progress"" and it was ""unacceptable"" that money could not be put into the pockets of people to deal with a cost of living crisis because there was no executive. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem On Thursday, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said she had a ""good conversation"" with Mr Martin. She said the EU and Ireland were on ""the same page"" when it came to the protocol and they agreed ""international agreements cannot be disapplied unilaterally"". Mr Martin also held an hour-long video call with Alliance Party leader Naomi Long on Thursday. Earlier this week he met Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill in Dublin, ahead ofPrime Minister Boris Johnson's visit to Belfast. On Friday, Ms O'Neillmet with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon,externalin Edinburgh, to discuss what she called ""a number of shared priorities"", as well as the political developments at Stormont.

"Boris Johnson - seen here with DUP politicians - was in Northern Ireland on Monday to encourage the parties to re-form Stormont Every high-wire act needs a safety net and Stormont is no different. It came in the form of legislation designed to ensure that no matter what happened, the facade of government would survive. All the bases were covered or so officials thought. A functional assembly providing cover for a dysfunctional executive. But that safety net,carefully woven at Westminster, fell apart when the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) blocked the election of a Speaker as part of its protest against the protocol. But is the DUP defiance now starting to soften? What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Claims about Northern Ireland's Brexit fact-checked Truss sets out new law on Northern Ireland trade deal The government's pledge to legislate ""within weeks"" to override parts of theNorthern Ireland Protocolchanged the mood on the DUP benches. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it was a ""significant"" first step but not significant enough to bring back the assembly. The protocol is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods Instead, he pointed to a ""graduated"" response from his party. That could mean if and when the government protocol legislation is laid at Westminster, DUP assembly members returning to Stormont to support the election of a Speaker. If as promised by the government the legislation is moved within weeks, that could pave the way for the assembly's return in June. But do not expect the DUP to take their seats around the executive table. That card will likely be held until the legislation passes its final hurdle, or if a deal is reached with the EU on protocol changes which the DUP can live with. Scrapping the protocol is not on the radar and it was noted how both the DUP leader and the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss talked about ""revised"" arrangements. But there is little prospect of a deal anytime soon and negotiations are likely to run in tandem with the protocol-busting legislation passing through parliament. So while we may see assembly members back in the chamber before the summer recess we are unlikely to see a fully-functioning executive restored. That will bring pressure at a time when energy bills are set to soar in the autumn. That will also bring us closer to the 24-week deadline to form an executive and the point when the secretary of state, Brandon Lewis, is legally bound to call an election. Another poll cannot be ruled out, but if by then Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill has still been denied the keys to the first minister's office, expect the green vote to be energised like never before. Holding out for another election carries many risks for the DUP. Holding out for the prime minister to deliver on a protocol promise is also high risk, but it may be the easier option as it buys some time.

"The evacuation of Ukrainian troops from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks, after two months inside, is the latest setback in Ukraine's efforts to defend the port city. Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine, has been encircled since the start of March and is now mostly under the control of Kremlin forces. Control of Mariupol would give Russia a land bridge to Crimea and full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off Ukraine's maritime trade. It would also deliver a propaganda coup for Vladimir Putin. However, the process of capturing the city has been slow and bloody. Fires in Mariupol after Russian military operation, 3 March 2022 Just days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Mariupol, a port city of some 430,000 people, found itself surrounded. From the start of Russia's invasion on 24 February, Mariupol had come under relentless shelling. By 2 March, Russian troops were several kilometres from the city on all sides, deputy mayorSerhiy Orlov told the BBC. After 15 hours of continuous bombardment, Mariupol was already ""near to a humanitarian catastrophe"", he said. Strikes to infrastructure had cut water and power supplies to parts of the city, he added, and there were also food shortages. Satellite photos showed civilian homes and buildings had been destroyed. One densely populated residential district had been ""nearly totally destroyed"", the deputy mayor said. Sieges - an ancient tactic of warfare - were now a consistent feature of this 21st Century conflict. By this point the Russian military had also surrounded the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and the city of Kherson. And in the weeks ahead, the invading forces would encircle Mariupol ever closer. Destruction of hospital in Mariupol, 9 March 2022 It was a sight that shocked the world - a maternity and children's hospital, hit by a Russian air strike. Initialreportssaid three people - including a child - had been killed. Later, a woman photographed in the wake of the attack on a stretcherdied along with her baby. At least 16 others, including both staff and patients, were injured, according to local officials. There was widespread revulsion in the wake of the attack. President Volodymyr Zelensky described it as a war crime: ""What kind of a country is Russia, that it is afraid of hospitals and maternity wards and destroys them?"" he asked. The image of heavily-pregnant Marianna Vyshemirsky, her face smeared with blood, as she stepped over rubble down a flight of stairs was also widely shared. The Russian embassy in the UK tweeted a conspiracy theory that Ms Vyshemirsky was an actress and the aftermath of the attack had been staged. But the BBC's disinformation team found evidencecontradicting these unfounded claimsand eventuallyspoke to Ms Vyshemirsky herself, after she had given birth to a daughter. An injured Marianna Vyshemirsky walks downstairs in a maternity hospital damaged by shelling in Mariupol Graves of people killed by shelling in Mariupol By mid-March, Mariupol's civilian death toll exceeded 2,100, according to the city council. But heavy Russian shelling had stood in the way of any mass evacuation. On 14 March a humanitarian corridor was agreed with Russia and a convoy of at least 160 private cars managed to leave Mariupol. By mid-afternoon on 15 March, 2,000 cars had left. But many more had not yet managed to leave. And so the BBC reported that improvised burial sites werenow being dugin the city. The deputy mayor was unable to quantify the number of bodies buried in this way. But he told the BBC there were 67 at one site alone. ""We can't bury [the victims] in private graves, as those are outside the city and the perimeter is controlled by Russian troops,"" Serhiy Orlov said. ""Some we can't identify but some had documents."" With municipal services having collapsed, street cleaners and road repair teams were collecting bodies in the streets, Mr Orlov said, adding: ""We've had no electricity, or heating, sanitation, water, food for 11 days."" Mariupol was not alone. There were reports of mass graves, too, in the town of Bucha, and the city of Chernihiv, both in the north of Ukraine. Later, a US satellite firm said it hadidentifieda mass burial site containing about 200 graves near a village called Manhush, about 20km (12 miles) west of Mariupol. For Ukrainians all this evoked memories of World War Two, when Jews and Soviet partisans were murdered by Nazis, and the Holodomor in the early 1930s, after Stalin forced Ukraine's peasants into collective farms and seized all their grain and livestock. For days the Donetsk Regional Theatre of Drama had been a place of safety for civilians sheltering from Russia's aerial assault. Then came an attack that, according to officials, killed 300 people - thought to be the worst known loss of life in a single strike since the invasion began. The vast Soviet-era building in the middle of a square in the city centre had been clearly marked as a civilian shelter.According to an adviser to the mayor, some 600 people had been inside when it was hit. At the time of the strike, the word ""children"" had been written in giant letters on the ground outside the theatre building in the centre of the city. The BBC spoke to survivors who told of mothers searching for their children under the rubble and a five-year-old child screaming:""I don't want to die."" This video can not be played Ukraine said hundreds of civilians died when Mariupol's theatre was attacked in March Russia denied that it had any role in attacking the theatre. But there was widespread international condemnation of Moscow's actions. Russian Col-Gen Mikhail Mizintsev, who the British government described as the ""Butcher of Mariupol"" for his role in the bombardment of the city, was later sanctioned by the UK. Russia said its forces had entered the centre of Mariupol. Mayor Vadym Boichenko said fighting in the city was ""really active"". Then came the allegation that Russia had been forcibly relocating hundreds of civilians from Mariupol. On March 24, Mariupol authorities updated the figure to 15,000. By 27 March, Russia was housing an estimated 5,000 at a temporary camp in Bezimenne, east of Mariupol, seen insatellite images. In parts of Mariupol now under Russian control, reports suggested that civilians - without access to food, water and medicine - had little choice but to leave for Russian-controlled areas and Russia itself. Some Ukrainian officials described Russia's actions as ""deportations"" to so-called filtration camps. A warring party deporting civilians to its territory is an internationally-recognised abuse of human rights. Over time, accounts emerged of conditions inside these facilities. One coupledescribedhow they were driven to a refugee hub that was ""like a true concentration camp"", in which their phones were searched and elderly people slept in corridors without mattresses or blankets. The office of Mayor Boichenko, who had by this point left the city, estimated that nearly 5,000 people had been killed in Mariupol since the start of the siege. It also said 90% of buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed. The estimated number of people who were thought to still be trapped numbered about 170,000. Evacuees wait for a bus before leaving Mariupol, 24 March 2022 By late March, weeks of relentless Russian shelling had reduced Mariupol to ruins. But attempts to establish a ceasefire in the city to allow evacuations had collapsed amid accusations of bad faith on both sides of the conflict. Ukraine claimed that Russian troops had carried on shelling the evacuation routes. Russia was thenaccused by Ukraineof blocking a bus convoy on its way to evacuate Mariupol. Meanwhile,French officials saidVladimir Putin had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city during an hour-long phone call with France's President Emmanuel Macron. But the Kremlin said the Russian leader had insisted that shelling of the city would only cease when Ukraine surrendered. Russia's defence ministry said 1,026 soldiers of Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had surrendered in Mariupol. Two days later, the mayortold the Associated Press,externalthat an estimated 120,000 people still remained in the city. A pro-Russian tank lets out a cloud of diesel smoke as it moves towards the Azovstal works, Mariupol As Russian forces overwhelmed Mariupol, the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - became its last centre of the Ukrainian resistance. On 18 April the city's council said there were still 1,000 civilians hiding at the site - a mass of tunnels and workshops. As Russian forces advanced slowly into the heart of Mariupol, the sprawling complex also became a home to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters from the Azov battalion - a national guard unit with former links to the far-right. A Russian deadline for the surrender of Ukrainian forces in Mariupol passed with no sign that the troops had complied. But then in a televised meeting on 21 April, Vladimir Putin ordered his forces tohold backfrom storming the complex. Instead, he instructed troops to block off the industrial area, so that ""not even a fly can escape"". Subsequently the Azov regimentposted a videoshowing women and children purportedly sheltering underground at the plant, saying they were running out of food and water, and pleading to be evacuated. On 2 May, the long-awaited evacuation of civilians from the steel plantgot under way. More than 100 evacuees from Mariupol made it to relative safety in Zaporizhzhia, after a journey which took several days. Among them were 69 people who had sheltered in bunkers beneath the massive Azovstal steelworks for month. Three days later it wasreported,externalanother 300 civilians had been evacuated. In a aremarkable news conferenceon 5 May, broadcast live from a bunker in the steelworks, a Ukrainian fighter said his country's government had ""failed"" in the defence of Mariupol but insisted surrender was ""unacceptable"". By 7 May it wasannouncedthat all remaining women, children and elderly people had left the plant. Fighting continued until 17 May, when it was announced thatmore than 260 fighters - some of badly wounded - had been evacuated, marking the end of the Ukrainian military operation to defend the site. The soldiers were taken to Russian-controlled territory late on 16 May. It was suggested they could be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war, but this is unconfirmed. People remain trapped in the Azovstal plant and efforts to rescue them are said to be ongoing. Hanna Maliar, Ukraine's deputy defence minister, said Ukraine's military, intelligence, National Guard and Border Service were ""carrying out joint efforts to save"" those left behind. She also hailed the actions of the plant's defenders, who she said had ""fully accomplished all missions assigned by the command"". But she noted that their position had become untenable after it became ""impossible to unblock Azovstal by military means"". In a message posted to Facebook on Monday night, Ukraine's General Staff called the troops ""heroes of our time"" and said their efforts had helped Kyiv organise the defence of its southern flank.

"The Northern Ireland assembly sits at Stormont in east Belfast Sinn FÃ©in has emerged as the biggest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, after last week's elections. However, the party's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, cannot become first minister unless the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - which had been the largest party since 2007 but has now been pushed into second place - nominates for the position of deputy first minister. This is because of Northern Ireland's power-sharing system of government, which was introduced in the 1990s as a way of ending decades of violence. The principle of power sharing is what sets Northern Ireland apart from the UK's other nations. It means that in any government there must be representatives from both the nationalist community - who favour unity with the Republic of Ireland - and unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. The idea is that, whatever their historic differences, both communities have a vested interest in the system. Essential guide to the Northern Ireland election A chamber of 90 members (MLAs) is elected to the assembly at least once every five years. Five MLAs are elected in each of the 18 constituencies using a system called single transferable vote (STV), which ranks candidates by preference. Northern Ireland has a first minister and a deputy first minister - one unionist, the other nationalist. Seamus Mallon from the SDLP was deputy first minister, alongside the UUP's David Trimble as first minister in 1998 Since 2006 the first minister has been chosen by the largest party in the assembly. If this is a unionist party, then the deputy minister is drawn from the largest nationalist party, and vice versa. Both ministers have equal powers, and one cannot be in office without the other. If either the first minister or the deputy first minister resigns, the other is also forced to resign, whether they want to or not. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next? HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:What does the party want? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts The executive, or cabinet is multi-party, and ministers are drawn from both unionist, nationalist and non-aligned parties, based on how many seats they have won in an election. This also means that politicians from smaller parties can be appointed as ministers. The assembly exercises powers over matters including the economy, education, health, and more recently, Covid. Certain areas - including international relations and defence - remain reserved for the UK government in London. Northern Ireland was createdin 1921 and remained part of the UK, when the rest of Ireland became an independent state. This created a split in the population between the unionists - who were mainly Protestant - and nationalists, who were predominantly Catholic. From the late 1960s, armed groups from both sides, such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA), carried out out bombings and shootings. This period was known as the Troubles - it lasted almost 30 years, and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people. Peace talks started in the early 1990s, culminating in the signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which ended the worst of the violence. It was endorsed in a referendum with 71% voting in favour. Under its terms, Northern Ireland found itself run by a new power-sharing assembly. When Stormont was restored in 2007, following a five-year suspension, the DUP's Ian Paisley was first minister and Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness deputy first minister The assembly has endured but it has also been suspended a number of times. The longest suspension was between 2002 and 2007, during which time Northern Ireland was run once more from London. Relations between the two main parties broke down again in 2017, and the assembly and ruling executive were not restored until January 2020. In February this year the DUP's Paul Givanresigned as first minister, in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem This is the section of the UK's Brexit deal with the EU which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European single market, and protects the movement of goods across the border with the Irish Republic. However, it also involves creating border controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. While most of the politicians elected to the assembly are in favour of the protocol remaining in place, unionists are not happy at what they perceive as a weakening of Northern Ireland's bond with Great Britain. The issue has caused street protests and unrest in some areas. Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan are currently deputy first minister and first minister Now that Sinn FÃ©in has become the largest party in the Assembly, its deputy leader, Michelle O'Neill, stands to become first minister. While DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said that his party would respect the election result, his party says it won't nominate any ministers to an executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed by the UK government. And on Thursday, the party said Sir Jeffrey would not be taking up his Assembly seat in Lagan Valley, instead choosing to remain an MP until issues with the the protocol were resolved. Former MLA and MP Emma Little-Pengelly was co-opted to his seat at Stormont. Sinn FÃ©in has accused DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson of holding society to ransom by threatening to paralyse the Assembly. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said the UK will have ""no choice but to act"" if the EU does not show flexibility over the protocol, but it's unlikely any movement will happen before the Northern Ireland Assembly sits on Friday. If no agreement is reached on the protocol and the DUP do not nominate a deputy first minister, other executive ministers who held office before the election - such as the health minister and education minister - can stay in post for up to six months. If a solution cannot be found after that time, there would either need to be further negotiations or a fresh election. The DUP has also refused to say if it will support the election of a new Speaker to the assembly. If it does not the assembly cannot function, MLAs cannot hold debates in the chamber or scrutinise ministers. Sinn FÃ©in: What happens now in Northern Ireland?

"The UK's dispute with the European Union over Northern Ireland trade risks undermining Western unity during the Ukraine war, a senior US official says. Derek Chollet told the BBC the US hoped the row over Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trade deal could be resolved. He said ""a big fight between the UK and the EU"" was ""the last thing"" Washington wanted. Vladimir Putin would ""use any opportunity he can to show that our alliance is fraying"", he added. Mr Chollet, the most senior adviser to US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, said: ""We want to see this issue resolved and we want to see the temperature lowered and no unilateral acts. ""And it's particularly important right now where we need to send a message of unity to the world and not undermine all the things that we've been so successful in working on together over the last several months and showing unity in Ukraine."" What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Mr Chollet's intervention is significant. It is rare for senior US officials to comment on the UK's domestic affairs given the historically close relationship between the two nations. But his comments build on recent concerns expressed by senior US politicians, including President Joe Biden and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, about the UK government threatening to override the Northern Ireland Protocol. These concerns have so far largely focused on what the US sees as the possible risks to peace in Northern Ireland. But the senior State Department official is making a new argument, that now is not the time for the UK and the EU to be having a fight. There are bigger fish to fry over Ukraine. The US wants its allies united, not scrapping over legacy Brexit issues. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem Derek Chollet, a senior adviser to the US secretary of state, has urged the UK and the EU to cool tensions On Thursday Ms Pelosi said she was ""deeply concerned"" that the UK was seeking to ""unilaterally discard"" Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trade arrangements, set out in the protocol. She said the US Congress would not support a trade agreement with the UK if its actions jeopardised the peace process in Northern Ireland. The UK government has argued that changes to the way goods are shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are needed to restore its devolved government. A power-sharing administration cannot be formed without the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has refused to join one until significant changes are made to the protocol. The DUP says the protocol, which was agreed by the UK and the EU in December 2020, has created economic barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. On TuesdayForeign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK government would introduce a lawto change the protocol unilaterally should negotiations with the EU fail. Ms Pelosi warned against any action that might endanger the Good Friday Agreement, the peace deal that ended decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. In the first of several tweets,external, she wrote: ""Ensuring there is no physical border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland is necessary for upholding this landmark agreement, which transformed Northern Ireland."" But the UK's former Brexit minister, Lord Frost, has criticised Ms Pelosi for making what he called an ""ignorant"" statement about the situation in Northern Ireland. Lord Frost, who negotiated the protocol with the EU, said there was no plan to put a physical border in place on the island of Ireland. ""Nobody's ever suggested that. So I don't know why she's suggesting that in her statement,"" Lord Frost told the Week in Westminster on BBC Radio 4. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was concerned about the UK's actions He also denied that making changes to the arrangements would undermine the Good Friday Agreement. ""It is the protocol itself that's undermining [the Good Friday Agreement] and people who can't see that really shouldn't be commenting on the situation in Northern Ireland,"" said the former minister. On Friday afternoon DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he thought Ms Pelosi's contributions were ""entirely unhelpful, offer no solution, offer no help and merely repeat a mantra that frankly is hopelessly out of date."" He spoke asthe Irish Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin met Northern Ireland's main partiesto discuss the protocol and the political crisis. Meanwhile, a US Congress delegation flew to Brussels for a meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, who has been leading negotiations with the UK.

"Twenty cases of monkeypox have now been confirmed in the UK Monkeypox could have a ""massive impact"" on access to sexual health services, doctors have warned. Staff at clinics are already having to isolate if they have come into contact with anyone infected. In London, where most of the UK's 20 identified cases have been detected, sexual health clinics have stopped people walking in altogether. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said it was concerned about the effect on other infections. Cases of monkeypox, which is generally mild, are rare outside Central and West Africa, butabout 80 cases have been confirmed in at least 12 countries,the World Health Organization says. Infections were confirmed in Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the US and Canada, as well as the UK - where the first European case was reported. The WHO says another 50 suspected cases are being investigated. What is monkeypox? Time to worry or one to ignore? Eighty monkeypox cases confirmed in 11 countries Monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, or through the eyes, nose or mouth. It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. And the most recent UK cases are in gay or bisexual men which has prompted the UK Health Security Agency to encourage men who have sex with men to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions. They are being asked to contact their local sexual health service if they have concerns. Dr Claire Dewsnap, a consultant in genitourinary medicine and president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said staff in sexual health clinics were ""already under significant pressure"" and monkeypox was making that situation worse. ""It is already stretching the workforce and will have a massive impact if staff have to isolate if they are in close contact with someone who's infected,"" Dr Dewsnap said. ""I am concerned about the potential impact on access to sexual health generally."" In London, clinics are asking all patients to contact staff in advance and tell them their symptoms before being offered an appointment. This is so those with monkeypox symptoms can be kept away from waiting rooms or clinics where other people are present. Clinics elsewhere are asking only those with an unusual rash to call ahead so they can be seen in separate areas. Some staff in sexual health clinics have already received a smallpox vaccine to help protect them against monkeypox - a smallpox jab offers some good protection since the two viruses are quite similar. The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to Central or West Africa, but some of the cases that have been occurring outside these countries have had no travel link. It does not spread easily between people, but it can be spread through: touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs the coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages - a bit like chicken pox - before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Read moreabout the virus here. Twenty cases of monkeypox have now been confirmed in the UK, with a further 11 announced on Friday, and most have been mild. However, the disease can be more severe, especially in young children, pregnant women, and people who have weakened immune systems. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Friday that the UK was stocking up on smallpox vaccine doses to help protect some groups against the virus. A smallpox jab offers some good protection against monkeypox since the two viruses are quite similar. Ten other countries, including the US, Portugal, Spain and Canada, have also detected cases. The World Health Organization is convening an emergency meeting with experts about the spread of the virus which is normally found in remote parts of central and west Africa. Sir Peter Horby, director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""it is an unusual situation where we seem to have had the virus introduced but now ongoing transmission within certain communities"". He said that the key message to people with symptoms was to ""seek attention, get diagnosed and then to be isolated in some way at home so that they don't spread it on"". Asked how effective current treatments are, he said there was a post-exposure prophylaxis that can be given to close contacts and an anti-viral drug was also being tested in central Africa ""so there's a lot that can be done"".

"This video can not be played Warning: This video contains distressing images A woman who was terrorised and abused by an MI5 agent is taking legal action against the security service. Beth, not her real name, has lodged a formal complaint with the watchdog for the intelligence agencies, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). On Thursday, a BBC investigation revealed her then partner used his security status to coercively control her. He also attacked her with a machete and threatened to kill her. The Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ) said Beth was asking the IPT to investigate MI5's recruitment and handling of the agent, X, and whether any steps were taken to address the clear risk of harm he posed. She will also argue that MI5's conduct may have breached her human rights by ""enabling X to subject her to serious violence and abuse with impunity"". MI5 agent used secret status to terrorise girlfriend Court ruling allows BBC to tell MI5 agent story The IPT is an independent, official panel that considers complaints about conduct by or on behalf of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. The IPT has the power to consider alleged breaches of human rights by intelligence agencies. If it ultimately ruled that MI5 failed to take appropriate action to protect Beth from harm, that could impact all the UK's intelligence and security agencies that recruit and task undercover informants. In practical terms that could force more detailed assessments of the risks that agents pose. It could potentially mean agencies decide some informants are too dangerous to recruit, no matter the value of the intelligence they may have. In a recent ground-breaking case against the police, theIPT awarded Â£230,000 compensation to a womanwho had been tricked into a sexual relationship with an undercover officer. And so a ruling against MI5 in this case would almost certainly lead to damages for Beth. If the IPT decides to examine the complaint, its panel will have to balance human rights considerations with wider questions about why the information provided by X was thought to be operationally vital. Behind closed doors, the tribunal would be likely to examine MI5's paperwork and witness evidence about why this agent was important. The questions Beth's case raise mean its outcome could become a major moment in the law governing undercover operations. The CWJ said it was also exploring possible action against a police force which ""failed to take action against the perpetrator despite repeated reports"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has described the findings of the BBC investigation as ""harrowing and horrific"". He said no one should be in any doubt how seriously ministers took violence against women or girls, but he could not comment further ""because of national security"". His cabinet colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg praised the BBC for performing a ""public service.. in bringing this story to light"", but added that ""the national security card does sometimes have to be played"". The High Court has ruled X can not be named for security reasons. Labour's Yvette Cooper said Home Secretary Priti Patel needed to ensure there was an independent assessment of ""this very troubling case and how it has been handled"". The shadow home secretary said this should include looking at safeguarding responsibilities, the way that concerns about domestic abuse are handled by MI5, and the criminal investigation that took place. Domestic violence charity Refuge said the government's determination to protect X's identity was ""terrifying"". X also made threats about killing and sexually abusing young girls, the BBC investigation found. A video filmed by Beth shows him attacking her with a machete. Watch the full investigation This is the story of a dangerous MI5 agent, which the government tried to keep secret. Available nowon BBC iPlayer Police evidence seen by the BBC shows that he is a right-wing extremist with a violent past. He moved abroad to work for a foreign intelligence agency while under police investigation. At the High Court, the BBC argued that women had a right to know his identity and it would protect potential victims from harm. The government said disclosing his identity would threaten national security and endanger his life. A judge backed that - but ruled that details of the case could be revealed. Refuge, a charity which helps victims of domestic violence, said it was horrified by the BBC's revelations. Chief executive Ruth Davison said women were often told no one would believe them. ""Imagine those words being spoken by someone who works for the security service."" She said the news that the agent had used his status to perpetrate domestic abuse was abhorrent, and the fact that his identity was being protected while he was expressing ""murderous intents"" was ""terrifying for women and girls"". MI5's London headquarters Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who also used to chair Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, told Today the committee would be entitled to investigate whether MI5 had handled the case correctly according to its rules. But he added he would have been ""astonished"" if the security service had not tried to protect the agent's identity. If it hadn't, Mr Grieve said, it would have exposed the man to serious risk, and would not be able to recruit agents in future. He said it was naive to think that vital information necessary to protect the public would always come from ""individuals living within the law"".

"Finland imports most of its gas from Russia but says it can cope with the disruption Russia has halted its gas supply to Finland - the latest escalation of an energy payments row with the West. Russia's gas giant Gazprom confirmed it had completely halted exports to Finland at 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Finland said all the deliveries had stopped, but added there would be no disruption to customers. Helsinki has been refusing to pay for its supplies in roubles. But the cut-off also follows an announcement that Finland will apply for Nato membership. Despite its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Russia continues to supply gas to many European countries. After Western powers sanctioned Russia over the war, Russia said ""unfriendly"" countries must pay for gas using the Russian currency, a move the EU considers blackmail. Reliance on Russian energy is a contributing factor in the cost-of-living crisis faced by many consumers. Finland imports most of its gas from Russia but gas accounts for less than a tenth of the country's energy consumption. On Saturday,the Finnish state-owned company Gasgrid Finland said in a statement that gas supplies through the Imatra entry point were stopped on 21 May.,external ""The amount of gas needed by the Finnish gas market is imported into the Finnish gas system through Balticconnector entry point in accordance with the nominations made by the market parties. Gasgrid Finland has directed gas imports in Balticconnector and the gas system is currently in balance,"" it said. Earlier, the Finnish state-owned energy firm Gasum described the Russian move as ""highly regrettable"". ""However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months,""Gasum CEO Mika Wiljanen said in a statement.,external Asked about the matter, a Kremlin spokesman said ""it is obvious that nobody is going to deliver anything for free"". Last Sunday, Russia also cut electricity supplies to Finland. It had threatened retaliation should Finland apply to join Nato. In a separate development, Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft said on Friday that former German Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der had informed them he would no longer serve on their board. Mr SchrÃ¶der has faced increasing public outrage over the lucrative role. He has refused to criticise Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who he counts as a personal friend, over his decision to invade Ukraine.

"The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has denied claims that he groped and exposed himself to an employee at his SpaceX rocket company six years ago. A report in the Business Insider news outlet on Thursday alleged SpaceX paid the ex-flight attendant $250,000 (Â£200,000) to settle the claim. ""Those wild accusations are utterly untrue,"" he wrote on Twitter. Mr Musk told Business Insider its article was a ""politically motivated hit piece"". The SpaceX founder suggested the piece was intended to interfere with his stalled $44bn (Â£35bn) acquisition of Twitter and malign the recent shift in his politics. He had used the social media site to announce he ""can no longer support"" the Democratic Party on Wednesday, saying he plans to vote for Republicans in future elections. Shares in his electric car company, Tesla, dropped on Friday. Who is Elon Musk? Elon Musk puts $44bn Twitter deal on hold How Elon Musk might change Twitter According to Business Insider, SpaceX paid the unnamed woman a severance agreement that was settled out of court and, as part of the deal, she was not allowed to sue the company or talk about the alleged incident. The magazine quotes an anonymous friend of the flight attendant, who it claimed had provided a signed declaration as part of the settlement process. The friend said Mr Musk had exposed himself to the former employee - a cabin crew member on contract for SpaceX's corporate jet fleet - in 2016 while receiving a massage from her aboard his private jet. He is said to have exposed his genitals to her, touched her leg without consent, and offered to buy her a gift if she would ""do more"" - referring to the performance of sex acts. The BBC has not been able to confirm these reports independently. In a series of tweets late on Thursday night, he alleged the friend quoted in the report was ""a far left activist/actress in [Los Angeles] with a major political axe to grind"" - and challenged her to verify the claims by describing his intimate body parts. Nicholas Carlson, the magazine's editor-in-chief, defended his outlet's work, writing on Twitter: ""We stand by our story, which is based on documents and interviews and speaks for itself.""

"Mustard is a popular ingredient in French cuisine French shoppers are facing a sour sight in supermarkets this summer - no mustard. The nationwide shortage is due to a lack of mustard seeds needed to produce the condiment. Severe drought in Canada, poor harvests in France and the war in Ukraine have combined to reduce the supplies of mustard seeds available to producers. The price of mustard has shot up by 10% in France as a result, and some shops are struggling to restock jars. Canada, where France imports many of its mustard seeds from, was hit by drought last year that collapsed crop yields in the country's agricultural west. Not all droughts are due to climate change, but excess heat in the atmosphere is drawing more moisture out of the earth and making droughts worse. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Meanwhile in France domestic mustard seed harvests have fallen short of expectations for three years in a row, most recently due to a wet winter and cold spring. Luc Vondermaeson, who is managing director of France's third-largest mustard manufacturer La Reine de Dijon, told the BBC that production was running at 20-25% below normal. Seeds could still be found in January and February, he said, but availability had dwindled since then. ""The market is totally empty. Everything has been booked and we have difficulty obtaining seeds."" Mustard seed plants before harvest in France French producers had originally hoped to import additional mustard seeds from Russia or Ukraine to make up for the shortfall, but since the invasion this has no longer been possible. The war has disrupted global supply chains for many agricultural products. Russia's attacks on and blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports and Western sanctions on Moscow have combined to severely limit the amount of food either country is exporting to the rest of the world. Earlier this week theUnited Nations warned that the invasion could cause a global food crisis lasting for years.. And in the UK, disruption of supplies of sunflower oil from Ukraine last month led to supermarketslimiting how many bottles of cooking oil customers could buy.

"Polandâs president has given the first address in person by a foreign leader to the Ukrainian parliament since the Russian invasion began Andrzej Duda received a standing ovation after he declared that only Ukrainians themselves could decide their future Earlier, the Ukrainian government said Kyiv would not agree a ceasefire deal with Moscow that involved giving away any territory Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, said making concessions would result in Moscow starting an even larger, more bloody offensive in the longer term Russian forces have continued their attacks on the eastern Donbas region following their capture of Mariupol They are said to have made limited advances towards Severodonetsk â where it is thought they are planning a new siege Edited by Ben Tobias We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for a few hours. We'll be back on Monday morning Ukraine time. You can find all our most recent coverage of the war on our website. The Polish leader was given a standing ovation for his address in Ukraine's parliament Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a snapshot of the day's headlines. Oleksandr Zinchenko draped the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy After winning the English Premier League title for the fourth time with his club Manchester City, Ukrainian footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko has said he found it hard to even think about football after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Speaking to Sky Sports after draping the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy, an emotional Zinchenko called it an unforgettable moment. ""I'm so proud to be Ukrainian,"" he said. ""I would love to one day bring this title to Ukraine, for all Ukrainian people, because they deserve it."" Zinchenko said the time since the invasion began was the ""toughest period in my life"". In an interview with BBC Sport's Gary Linekersoon after the start of the war, the Manchester City defender said he could not count the number of times he had cried since Russia's invasion began. Lithuania is no longer importing energy from Russia as of today. Its energy minister said purchases of gas, oil and electricity from Moscow were stopping to show ""solidarity"" with Ukraine - and to cut funding for the ""Russian war machine"". He hoped electricity demands could be met through local green energy production instead. Lithuania, a former Soviet state and a Nato member, is a strong ally of Ukraine. Despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to provide fuel to many European countries. However, Finland's gas supply was cut off yesterday after it refused Moscow's demand to pay in roubles. The port city's been largely destroyed by Russian shelling People are being deported from Mariupol to other Russian-held territory at a faster and faster rate, according to a mayoral adviser in the fallen port city. Petro Andryushchenko wrote on the Telegram app that 313 Mariupol residents were taken away to a so-called ""filtration camp"" in Russian-occupied Bezimenne on Saturday. 55 of them were children. Andryushchenko said many of those being taken to camps were later being sent to Russia itself. The BBC has not been able confirmed the claims, and Russia has previously denied any forced deportations. Mariupol is now under total Russian control after its last defenders surrendered at an industrial plant on Friday. New pictures from the Reuters news agency have given a flavour of life for Ukraine's military personnel. Soldiers are seen performing exercises or taking breaks. The photos were taken in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east - the focus of fierce fighting. An update now on Andriy Shevchyk, the man installed by Russia as the mayor of occupied Enerhodar. Shevchyk is now in intensive care after being injured in an explosion, Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news agency reports. No further details were available. Earlier we reported thatShevchyk and his bodyguards were hurtin what appeared to be a ""precise and targeted attack"", according to the city's elected mayor - who was ousted from power by the Russians. James FitzGeraldBBC News The Luhansk regional governor blamed Russian 'orcs' for destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk The governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region has accused Russian ""orcs"" of destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, amid fierce fighting in the area. Serhiy Haidai is just the latest Ukrainian official to compare Russian troops to a type of mythical monster popularised by JRR
Tolkienâs book The Lord of the Rings. In the epic novel, orcs are seen as âbrutal, aggressive
and chaoticâ says Ostap Slyvynsky, an associate
professor at Lviv University specialising in the literature of east-central
Europe. Some Ukrainians even call Russia itself
âMordorâ â alluding to a dark land in Tolkienâs fantasy. The images give Ukrainians an easy-to-understand metaphor for what's going on in real life. ""The fantasy world has a
very clear accent on what is good and what is bad,"" Slyvynsky explains. âThese terms are kind of euphemisms,â he adds. âIt is better to call Russians âorcsâ than more vulgar words.â The trend emerged some time after 2014 - the year Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed
separatists seized parts of the eastern Donbas region. As for the Russians: they've been labelling Ukrainians âelvesâ - another Tolkien allusion - in the belief that those fictional beings embody weakness, Slyvynsky says. Adam EastonReporting from Warsaw The Polish president has delivered a message of strong support for Ukraine during the first address in person by a foreign leader to the parliament in Kyiv since the Russian invasion began. During his speech Andrzej Duda thanked Ukraine for defending Europe against what he called âRussian imperialismâ. âThe free worldâ, he said, âhas the face of Ukraineâ. Duda said recent calls for Kyiv to negotiate with President Putin, and even give into some of his demands, were disturbing. No decisions about your future will be made without you, he said. Poland has been one of Ukraineâs staunchest supporters, taking in millions of refugees fleeing the fighting and sending tanks and rocket launchers to the Ukrainian military. Duda, who received a standing ovation after his speech, said Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the European Union. An exhibition of destroyed Russian tanks is proving popular with the public in Kyiv. The vehicles have gone on show at Mykhailivska Square. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine have met in Kyiv today Polish citizens living in Ukraine are to be
granted the same rights that Ukrainian refugees in Poland are
currently receiving. Ukraine's President Zelensky announced the plan during a visit from his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. A bill will be tabled in parliament to make the changes happen. Poland has granted the right to live, work and claim
social security payments to more than three million Ukrainian refugees
who've fled Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian parliament has passed a bill banning symbols of the Russian invasion, including those containing the letters Z and V, MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram. Zheleznyak noted that the document included President Zelensky's proposals, which he submitted when he vetoed the previous draft law passed on 14 April. The new version of the law widens the range of cases when the display of the symbols is allowed, namely in museums, libraries, scientific works, textbooks and so on, according to our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. The new bill, however, bans the creation of NGOs which use Russian war symbols and whose activities are aimed at spreading war propaganda and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The letters ""Z"" and ""V"", which don't exist in the Russian alphabet, have been widely used to symbolise support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They are used to mark Russian military vehicles on the battlefield. A bid by Ukraine to join the EU could not be finalised for ""15 or 20 years,"" France's minister for European affairs has said. Speaking on Radio J in Paris, Clement Beaune said: ""We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you're lying. ""It's probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time."" His comments poured cold water on Volodymyr Zelensky's hopes for expedited entry to the bloc in the wake of Russia's invasion. Beaune repeated French President Emmanuel Macron's offer to create a looser ""European political community"" that could help integrate Ukraine sooner, adding: ""I don't want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies."" Zelensky has turned down what he called ""such compromises"" and insisted on an immediate start of the process towards full EU membership. Beaune said Macron's proposal is not ""an alternative to joining the European political community"", emphasising: ""It doesn't prevent membership later on."" Ukraine's aspirations to join the EU and Nato are seen as the main reason Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. Macron's European political community initiative is due to be debated at an EU summit in June. Ukraine has extended martial law for three months until 23 August. President Volodymyr Zelensky first signed the decree, along with a general military mobilisation call, on 24 February and since then has extended it for a month on two occasions. Today, Ukraine's parliament voted by an absolute majority for a third extension as Russia continues to focus its offensive on the eastern Donbas region. Zelensky's representative at the Constitutional Court, Fedir Venislavskyy, said the decision to extend it for 90 days this time is because a ""counter-offensive takes more time than defence"". Poland's President Andrzej Duda meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv If you're just joining us, here's a look at the main news from the war in Ukraine so far today: Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukraine remains vulnerable to aerial strikes Military and financial support from Western
countries is increasingly making a difference. At the start of the war, President Zelensky was saying they
needed more and they needed it faster. But his position has gradually shifted, to acknowledge that the Ukrainians are getting the support they need with the urgency they
need. The big missing piece in the puzzle is still air defences. A statement yesterday from the Russians
- saying theyâd destroyed a big shipment of military aid â shows Ukraine is
still not getting the latest in air defence systems. On every other front, I think the support is starting to
come through. Iâve seen modern Western equipment being sent to the front lines. They are always going to need more though, especially
given the increased Russian pushes weâve been seeing. Andriy Shevchyk, a mayor installed by Russia in the occupied city of Enerhodar, has reportedly been injured in an explosion. The city's elected mayor Dmytro Orlov - who is currently in nearby Zaporizhzhia - wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Shevchyk and his bodyguards had been taken to hospital after being wounded. Orlov noted that the circumstances were still being established. He added that nobody else had been hurt in the blast - suggesting this had been a ""precise and targeted attack"". There was no immediate comment from the Russian side. Enerhodar, a city of about 50,000 people which serves Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine embraced in the chamber earlier today ""Only Ukraine has the right to
decide its future"", the Polish president has said in a speech to the Ukrainian parliament. Andrzej Duda said ""worrying voices"" were suggesting Ukraine should give in to Russia's President Putin, according to comments quoted by the Reuters news agency. He told lawmakers that those voices should not be heeded - because ceding even an inch of Ukrainian territory would be a blow to the whole West. Duda also reportedly stressed that Poland supported Ukraine in its bid to gain full membership of the European Union - a matter on which EU countries have not reached a consensus. He was the first foreign leader to give an in-person speech to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia invaded on 24 February. Photos posted on Twitter by Duda's office showed him receiving a standing ovation in parliament and embracing Zelensky. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia attacked Ukrainian forces with airstrikes and artillery in the east and the south, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, according to an update from the Russian defence ministry. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points, 13 areas where troops and Ukrainian military equipment were amassed, as well as four ammunition depots in the Donbas region, the Reuters news agency reported. In Ukraine's southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets hit a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, around 100km northeast of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said. The BBC has not been able to confirm this independently. Authorities in Ukraine's south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region have reported civilian injuries - following Russian missile strikes on a village. Explosions were said to have woken people up in the middle of the night. Emergency workers attended the scene, the regional administration posted on the Telegram messaging app. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ellen Barkin's testimony, recorded in 2019, was played in court Johnny Depp was controlling and jealous and once threw a wine bottle across a room, one of his ex-girlfriends and co-stars said in a video played during his court case against Amber Heard. In the video, actress Ellen Barkin said Mr Depp was ""drunk a lot of the time"" during their relationship in the 1990s. The testimony, filmed in 2019, was played in court, where Mr Depp is suing his former wife for defamation. Ms Heard has accused the Hollywood star of being violent, which he has denied. The trial's jury watched the recorded testimony from Ms Barkin, who said her relationship with the Pirates of the Caribbean actor lasted between three and six months. Johnny Depp and Ellen Barkin in 1994 She said: ""He's just a jealous man, controlling - 'Where are you going? Who are you going with? What did you do last night?' ""I had a scratch on my back once that got him very, very angry because he insisted it came from me having sex with a person who wasn't him."" She added that the actor ""was always drinking and or smoking a joint"". Ms Barkin said the incident with the bottle happened while she and Mr Depp were filming the 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, adapted from the book by Hunter S Thompson. ""Mr Depp threw a wine bottle across the room, the hotel room in Las Vegas,"" she said. ""I don't know why he threw the bottle."" Heard denies striking Depp and doctoring photos Depp v Heard: Trial hears claims of drugs and violence Johnny Depp testifies he never hit Amber Heard However, she recalled that he may have had an argument with friends or an assistant. Also on Thursday, Mr Depp's former agent Tracey Jacobs told the trial that his career suffered after 2010 because of ""unprofessional behaviour"" including drug and alcohol use and consistently showing up late on set. And the star's former business manager Josh Mandel said he became ""extremely concerned"" about Mr Depp's financial situation in 2015, with the actor spending $300,000 (Â£193,000) a month on full-time staff at one point.

"Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said another 11 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in the UK. The new cases come on top of the nine already identified in the country. Mr Javid said ""most cases"" are mild. He has now updated G7 health ministers on the spread of the virus, which has been detected in nine other countries outside Central and West Africa. He said the UK was stocking up on smallpox vaccines to help guard against monkeypox. ""I can confirm we have procured further doses,"" he said. A smallpox jab offers some good protection against monkeypox since the two viruses are quite similar. The World Health Organization is convening an emergency meeting with experts about the spread. Dr Hans Henri Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, is concerned that transmission could accelerate as countries enter the summer ""festival"" season. Cases of the disease outside Central and West Africa are rare, but some have been occurring recently in Europe, USA, Canada and Australia. It is not clear how much vaccine stock has been bought by the UK, or how many jabs might be given. Reports say Spain is preparing to order thousands of doses of smallpox vaccine to use against monkeypox. Even without a vaccine, most cases clear up on their own within a few weeks. Severe cases sometimes can occur though. The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to Central or West Africa, but some of the cases that have been occurring outside these countries have had no travel link. It does not spread easily between people, but it can be spread through: touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs the coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages - a bit like chicken pox - before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Read moreabout the virus here. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says the risk to the public remains very low. Anyone with concerns that they could be infected should see a health professional, but make contact with the clinic or surgery ahead of a visit. NHS 111 can also give advice. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UKHSA said ""a notable proportion"" of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men ""so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned"". Her colleague, Prof Kevin Fenton, said: ""We are asking everybody to be aware of the signs and symptoms, which include rashes around the mouth as well as around the genital area."" TheImvanex smallpox vaccine,externalis about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox, studies suggest. Vaccination after a monkeypox exposure may help prevent the disease or make it less severe. Vaccines work by teaching the immune system how to defend itself against a disease. Routine smallpox vaccination ended in the 1970s in Britain, around the time the disease was eradicated, meaning many people have not got any protection or immune memory against these types of viruses.

"The BBC's Frank Gardner was left on a plane after everyone else had disembarked while he waited for his wheelchair If you use Twitter you may have seen Frank Gardner tweet his frustration at being left on a plane at the weekend after Heathrow Airport failed to deliver his wheelchair to him when he landed. It's a problem lots of wheelchair-users have faced - but what causes it? ""It's happened again. Stuck on an empty plane at Heathrow airport long after everyone else is off,"" Frank angrily typed on Sunday night from a runway at the UK's largest airport having arrived from Estonia via Helsinki. ""'No staff to get my wheelchair off the plane'. I am SO disappointed."" The security correspondent's tweet was liked 43,400 times as followers sympathised or expressed their shock at the incident. While many wheelchair-users told theBBC's Access All podcastthey had often experienced similar incidents, Heathrow Airport cited Covid-19 as the problem. Ben Furner experienced the same thing just weeks earlier at a different British airport. He was left on a plane while someone went in search of his mobility scooter. ""It had been agreed that the mobility scooter would be made available to me at the entrance of the plane, but there was nobody to fetch it up, so I was left."" He was offered the use of an airport wheelchair and told he could go to baggage reclaim to collect his scooter. But Ben explains this is unacceptable. Wheelchairs are often customised and built to personal specifications and a generic, ill-fitting, wheelchair won't necessarily support someone in a safe and comfortable way. In the end, when the new crew boarded the plane to prepare for the next flight and found Ben still sitting there, the captain intervened and arranged for his scooter to be retrieved. ""I was lucky because the captain took a personal and direct interest...that of course, shouldn't be required."" According to the Civil Aviation Authority, the UK's regulator, the responsibility lies with the airport to provide assistance to passengers when they are on the ground. That includes retrieving wheelchairs from the hold and returning them to passengers who have landed. When the system doesn't work, or the communication breaks down, it's frustrating and it's not always a one-off. ""This is now the fourth time that this has happened to me in just over four years,"" Frank sighs. The UK government recommends passengers request assistance through their airline, tour operator or travel agent at least 48 hours before travel If a passenger has not pre-notified, assistance will always still be provided but you might have to wait longer to be helped If things go wrong and you're unhappy, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) recommends you take your complaint directly to the airline or airport If you remain dissatisfied, you can refer your complaint to an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) body which provides alternative methods, such as mediation and conciliation, instead of going to court Heathrow Airport says it wants all passengers to have a ""seamless journey"" and it was ""disappointed"" for Frank. ""We apologise for this,"" it said, citing Covid-19 and the subsequent impact as the reason. ""As the airport rebuilds post-pandemic, all organisations across the airport are scaling-up resources so that we can get back to operating at a more normal level as quickly as possible. ""Unfortunately, the delay Mr Gardner experienced was a result of the airline's ground handling agents struggling with a colleague shortfall."" Improvements to passenger access support at airports was on the horizon in 2018 when the government announced the launch of Aviation 2050, its consultation and strategy for the next three decades of air travel, but that initiative has also stalled due to Covid-19. The results of the consultation were due to be released in 2019 with a focus on helping the industry thrive post-Brexit,  improve its impact on the environment and improve access with the introductory report admitting ""there is more work to do"". But many disabled passengers remain unsatisfied. According to the document, more than 3 million requests were made for special assistance in the UK in 2017, a figure which is only ""increasing"". It says 25% of passengers who fly have a disability or health condition and, of those, 60% find it difficult to access and use airports. It admits there are a ""number of common challenges"" including a ""lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities across airlines, airports and airside services"". This is the biggest bugbear wheelchair-users have, but although Aviation 2050 was set to be published in 2019, it's still not been seen, three years on. The Department for Transport has admitted that due to ""unprecedented challenges"" related the the pandemic, a formal response to the Aviation 2050 consultation has not been published. It says it will now publish a strategy, in due course, which will focus on the next 10 years, instead. Ellis Palmer using his handcycle ""While these are challenging times for the industry, disabled passengers deserve better,"" it said in a statement. It says it's ready and ""determined"" to make improvements using its Aviation Consumer Policy Reform Consultation, a different strategy which includes a suggestion of greater financial insurance if wheelchairs are damaged on UK domestic flights - another gripe for many wheelchair-users. The result of this consultation is due in the next few weeks. Ellis Palmer, a wheelchair-using journalist, says he finds plane travel ""anxiety-inducing"" but is sanguine. ""There's no point stressing about being the last person on the plane because ultimately they have to bring that chair up to you at some point,"" he says. From his experience he finds smaller, regional, airports to be ""absolutely fantastic"" at assistance, while international hubs are more difficult. And he finds Spanish airports particularly stress-free where access workers wear yellow t-shirts. ""They're really easy to find when you're going around the airport in a way that they're just not at UK airports."" For Frank, while his tweets might seem a harmless way to express frustration, they have been effective at making change happen in the past. After a tweet in 2018 about this very situation - being left on a plane - the BBC journalist forced Heathrow to change its policy which is why wheelchairs are now delivered to plane doors rather than the terminal, even if it doesn't always work. He says he has further ideas on how this system can be improved. ""To me, this is about allocating the right resources where they're needed,"" he says, suggesting the departure airport could inform the destination airport that a passenger might need assistance, before the plane has even left the ground. ""That would be a way of pre-empting this,"" Frank says. ""It's not that they don't care, but it is a huge busy airport and they are frankly, not at the moment, up to the task of giving disabled passengers the service that they deserve."" After his latest apology from Heathrow, Frank quickly updated his followers: ""Clearly still a way to go to stop this happening. Every time it happens to me it's happening to others around the UK.""

"America's top negotiator has insisted UK trade talks are moving in the right direction but she refused to make a firm commitment to a free trade deal. Katherine Tai urged the UK and the EU to work together to ensure that the risk from Brexit to the Northern Ireland peace process is eliminated. Her comment came at the end of two days of talks in Aberdeen and London with UK counterpart Anne-Marie Trevelyan. The UK government is keen to get a US deal, to show post-Brexit progress. Plans have been floated for an Act of Parliament that would effectively revoke the protocol agreed with the European Union, risking the return of border posts around Northern Ireland and a destabilisation of the Good Friday peace agreement. Good Friday Agreement was 'work of genius' Good Friday Agreement - 20 years on To provide building blocks to help improve trade relations, the Department for International Trade is pushing for agreements with individual US states and cities, although they have limited powers to change the rules of trade. On the question of the plans for an Act of Parliament, Ambassador Tai told BBC Scotland: ""This is a matter for the UK and for UK people to decide."" ""We're watching closely and feel very, very strongly about the legacy of peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland and we care very much about the fate of all the people here."" She added: ""Let me affirm that it's a big issue. We are watching, but it's actually a big issue for the UK and for Europe as well. ""There's a lot of interest in the US, from the president and from leading members of Congress, and also from our very, very large Irish-American population. ""We are fully supportive of the UK and EU continuing to bring co-operation and courage to the conversations between them."" Asked if the threat to repudiate the protocol is making the job of getting new free trade agreements more difficult, Ms Trevelyan responded: ""The ambassador and I have discussed this at some length, and I have also with many members of Congress. ""We're all committed to the Good Friday agreement remaining absolutely solid, and that's in very large part about trade. So it's so important that the US and UK continue to have these conversations."" With the US agenda for trade talks expected to focus on farm subsidies, Katherine Tai said she and the US agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack, had been working closely, and wanted to remove the negative perceptions of free trade, to present it to trading partners as benefiting all sides. Asked what message she would send to Aberdeenshire farmers about reducing subsidies, she said: ""Agricultural trade is very important. ""We all support our farmers, but we all have an interest in international global trade in agriculture. It's important to food security, to all of our abilities to provide, and to promote prosperity and a sense of security for our citizens. ""We are very focused on approaches to trade in agriculture that are going to strengthen the economies of our respective trading partners and ourselves, and also the flow of agricultural trade around the world. ""So, in trade discussions, when we talk about agriculture, when this is seen as a difficult and contentious issue, there has to be a win-win approach to how we approach the production of food and trade in agriculture."" The NFU reiterated its position that any negotiations must not undermine standards or protections, given the different regulatory approaches. NFU President Minette Batters said: ""Any trade deal between the UK and US must be balanced and provide wins for both sides. ""The US is already a major market for UK exports, with almost Â£2bn worth of exports sent in 2021. A trade deal could provide an opportunity for farmers to sell more great British food overseas. ""However, it's crucial our farmers are allowed to compete on fair terms. There are significant challenges in these negotiations that should not be underestimated, particularly the very different regulatory approaches to food safety, environmental protection and animal welfare between the UK and US."" The visit to Aberdeen included discussions with business leaders, representing Walker's Shortbread and American investors in the Glendronach distilleries group, along with a visit to energy engineering specialist Enpro-Subsea. Also attending was Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, who was there to discuss improving US trade links with the north of England.

"Anders Holch Povlsen made his fortune through a clothing and retail empire based in his native Denmark Danish fashion tycoon Anders Holch Povlsen is still the richest person in Scotland, according to a study of the UK's wealthiest people. The 2022 Sunday Times Rich List found there were 10 billionaires in Scotland. Brothers Sandy and James Easdale, former directors of Rangers football club, are the wealthiest newcomers to the list. But Jim McColl, a former owner of the Ferguson Marine shipyard, lost his billionaire status. The 10 billionaires at the head of the 2022 Rich list have a combined wealth of Â£23.054bn - more than a quarter of this is in the hands of Mr Holch Povlsen. Holch Povlsen is Scotland's biggest private landowner and owner of the Danish fashion retailer Bestseller. His personal fortune increased by Â£500m in the past year to Â£6.5bn, according to The Sunday Times Rich List. The 49-year-old owns 220,000 acres of land in Scotland, as well as a 25% stake in the British online fashion retailer Asos. He bought the 42,000-acre Glenfeshie estate in the Cairngorms for Â£8m in 2006 and nowowns 12 Highland estates. Holch Povlsen and his wife Ann have committed to rewilding the land andopposed the development of the Space Hub Sutherland, which is close to some of their property. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw is considered to be India's wealthiest self-made woman Glenn Gordon, the chairman of Moray-based distiller William Grant & Sons, is the second richest person in Scotland with Â£3.395bn, a drop of Â£200m. John Shaw andKiran Mazumdar-Shaw, who owns pharmaceutical firm Bioconand is considered to be India's wealthiest self-made woman, saw their assets fall by Â£446m to an estimated Â£2.496bn - putting them in third place. New to the list are the Easdale brothers whose Â£1.363bn fortune, based upon transport and property acquisitions, makes them eighth richest. However, Monaco-based Jim McColl, 70, head of Clyde Blowers, the East Kilbride engineering operation, is no longer a billionaire. He lost Â£4m after a fall in the value of investments, leaving him with assets worth Â£996m and in 11th place on the list.

"Drivers have declined to work rest days but the system is heavily reliant on the practice to function fully Railway workers in Scotland are to be balloted on strike action after the RMT union rejected ScotRail's 2.2% pay offer as ""derisory"". The announcement came just days before the operator cuts almost a third of train services to cope with a dispute with the train drivers' union Aslef. Some drivers are declining to work overtime on rest days while the pay dispute remains unresolved. The RMT said the timing of its strike ballot would be set out in due course. ScotRail - which was nationalised by the Scottish government seven weeks ago - will begin a temporary timetable on Monday which it said would ""give certainty"" to passengers during the driver shortage. The new timetable will cut about 700 services per day and the last train on many routes will leave up to four hours earlier than usual. Hospitality and entertainment businesses fear the transport situation will affect their income, while commuters are concerned they could be struggling to get home using the rail network. It is believed ScotRail needs 130 new drivers to end its reliance on rest-day working. Jenny Gilruth said the railway network was dependent on rest-day working at present Speaking onBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth said 38 drivers were expected to be trained by the end of this summer, with the figure rising to 55 by the end of the year and to 100 by June 2023. She was asked if that meant the reduced timetable would be in place until the summer of next year. The minister said: ""Absolutely not. We want trade unions to come back to the table. But it is absolutely true to say that the network is dependent on rest-day working at the present time. ""We need to phase out that practice. I know the unions are supportive of that. And I think too it's time for the unions to come back to the table to work with ScotRail."" She added: ""We need to get to a resolution on pay and I am absolutely committed to doing so with our trade union partners."" A typical ScotRail driver salary is more than Â£50,000, with drivers being offered a 2.2% pay rise and the opportunity to participate in a revenue share arrangement which would take the total package to 5%. Aslef has rejected this offer. Anger over 'devastating' cuts to ScotRail services Now the RMT, which agreed a backdated pay rise of 2.5% in October, has also rejected this year's pay offer. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, the highest for 40 years. The RMT union said workers had already been subject to repeated pay freezes and real terms cuts in living standards. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""ScotRail needs to put its hands deeper into its pockets and start rewarding their staff properly. ""We are in the midst of a brutal cost of living crisis for workers, but it is still party time for shareholders, speculators and big business executives. ""All we are asking for is a pay award that reflects the value of railway workers and the service they provide to the public day in, day out.""

"This video can not be played Warning: This video contains distressing images A woman who was terrorised and abused by an MI5 agent is taking legal action against the security service. Beth, not her real name, has lodged a formal complaint with the watchdog for the intelligence agencies, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). On Thursday, a BBC investigation revealed her then partner used his security status to coercively control her. He also attacked her with a machete and threatened to kill her. The Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ) said Beth was asking the IPT to investigate MI5's recruitment and handling of the agent, X, and whether any steps were taken to address the clear risk of harm he posed. She will also argue that MI5's conduct may have breached her human rights by ""enabling X to subject her to serious violence and abuse with impunity"". MI5 agent used secret status to terrorise girlfriend Court ruling allows BBC to tell MI5 agent story The IPT is an independent, official panel that considers complaints about conduct by or on behalf of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. The IPT has the power to consider alleged breaches of human rights by intelligence agencies. If it ultimately ruled that MI5 failed to take appropriate action to protect Beth from harm, that could impact all the UK's intelligence and security agencies that recruit and task undercover informants. In practical terms that could force more detailed assessments of the risks that agents pose. It could potentially mean agencies decide some informants are too dangerous to recruit, no matter the value of the intelligence they may have. In a recent ground-breaking case against the police, theIPT awarded Â£230,000 compensation to a womanwho had been tricked into a sexual relationship with an undercover officer. And so a ruling against MI5 in this case would almost certainly lead to damages for Beth. If the IPT decides to examine the complaint, its panel will have to balance human rights considerations with wider questions about why the information provided by X was thought to be operationally vital. Behind closed doors, the tribunal would be likely to examine MI5's paperwork and witness evidence about why this agent was important. The questions Beth's case raise mean its outcome could become a major moment in the law governing undercover operations. The CWJ said it was also exploring possible action against a police force which ""failed to take action against the perpetrator despite repeated reports"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has described the findings of the BBC investigation as ""harrowing and horrific"". He said no one should be in any doubt how seriously ministers took violence against women or girls, but he could not comment further ""because of national security"". His cabinet colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg praised the BBC for performing a ""public service.. in bringing this story to light"", but added that ""the national security card does sometimes have to be played"". The High Court has ruled X can not be named for security reasons. Labour's Yvette Cooper said Home Secretary Priti Patel needed to ensure there was an independent assessment of ""this very troubling case and how it has been handled"". The shadow home secretary said this should include looking at safeguarding responsibilities, the way that concerns about domestic abuse are handled by MI5, and the criminal investigation that took place. Domestic violence charity Refuge said the government's determination to protect X's identity was ""terrifying"". X also made threats about killing and sexually abusing young girls, the BBC investigation found. A video filmed by Beth shows him attacking her with a machete. Watch the full investigation This is the story of a dangerous MI5 agent, which the government tried to keep secret. Available nowon BBC iPlayer Police evidence seen by the BBC shows that he is a right-wing extremist with a violent past. He moved abroad to work for a foreign intelligence agency while under police investigation. At the High Court, the BBC argued that women had a right to know his identity and it would protect potential victims from harm. The government said disclosing his identity would threaten national security and endanger his life. A judge backed that - but ruled that details of the case could be revealed. Refuge, a charity which helps victims of domestic violence, said it was horrified by the BBC's revelations. Chief executive Ruth Davison said women were often told no one would believe them. ""Imagine those words being spoken by someone who works for the security service."" She said the news that the agent had used his status to perpetrate domestic abuse was abhorrent, and the fact that his identity was being protected while he was expressing ""murderous intents"" was ""terrifying for women and girls"". MI5's London headquarters Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who also used to chair Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, told Today the committee would be entitled to investigate whether MI5 had handled the case correctly according to its rules. But he added he would have been ""astonished"" if the security service had not tried to protect the agent's identity. If it hadn't, Mr Grieve said, it would have exposed the man to serious risk, and would not be able to recruit agents in future. He said it was naive to think that vital information necessary to protect the public would always come from ""individuals living within the law"".

"The UK's dispute with the European Union over Northern Ireland trade risks undermining Western unity during the Ukraine war, a senior US official says. Derek Chollet told the BBC the US hoped the row over Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trade deal could be resolved. He said ""a big fight between the UK and the EU"" was ""the last thing"" Washington wanted. Vladimir Putin would ""use any opportunity he can to show that our alliance is fraying"", he added. Mr Chollet, the most senior adviser to US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, said: ""We want to see this issue resolved and we want to see the temperature lowered and no unilateral acts. ""And it's particularly important right now where we need to send a message of unity to the world and not undermine all the things that we've been so successful in working on together over the last several months and showing unity in Ukraine."" What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Mr Chollet's intervention is significant. It is rare for senior US officials to comment on the UK's domestic affairs given the historically close relationship between the two nations. But his comments build on recent concerns expressed by senior US politicians, including President Joe Biden and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, about the UK government threatening to override the Northern Ireland Protocol. These concerns have so far largely focused on what the US sees as the possible risks to peace in Northern Ireland. But the senior State Department official is making a new argument, that now is not the time for the UK and the EU to be having a fight. There are bigger fish to fry over Ukraine. The US wants its allies united, not scrapping over legacy Brexit issues. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem Derek Chollet, a senior adviser to the US secretary of state, has urged the UK and the EU to cool tensions On Thursday Ms Pelosi said she was ""deeply concerned"" that the UK was seeking to ""unilaterally discard"" Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trade arrangements, set out in the protocol. She said the US Congress would not support a trade agreement with the UK if its actions jeopardised the peace process in Northern Ireland. The UK government has argued that changes to the way goods are shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are needed to restore its devolved government. A power-sharing administration cannot be formed without the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has refused to join one until significant changes are made to the protocol. The DUP says the protocol, which was agreed by the UK and the EU in December 2020, has created economic barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. On TuesdayForeign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK government would introduce a lawto change the protocol unilaterally should negotiations with the EU fail. Ms Pelosi warned against any action that might endanger the Good Friday Agreement, the peace deal that ended decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. In the first of several tweets,external, she wrote: ""Ensuring there is no physical border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland is necessary for upholding this landmark agreement, which transformed Northern Ireland."" But the UK's former Brexit minister, Lord Frost, has criticised Ms Pelosi for making what he called an ""ignorant"" statement about the situation in Northern Ireland. Lord Frost, who negotiated the protocol with the EU, said there was no plan to put a physical border in place on the island of Ireland. ""Nobody's ever suggested that. So I don't know why she's suggesting that in her statement,"" Lord Frost told the Week in Westminster on BBC Radio 4. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was concerned about the UK's actions He also denied that making changes to the arrangements would undermine the Good Friday Agreement. ""It is the protocol itself that's undermining [the Good Friday Agreement] and people who can't see that really shouldn't be commenting on the situation in Northern Ireland,"" said the former minister. On Friday afternoon DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he thought Ms Pelosi's contributions were ""entirely unhelpful, offer no solution, offer no help and merely repeat a mantra that frankly is hopelessly out of date."" He spoke asthe Irish Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin met Northern Ireland's main partiesto discuss the protocol and the political crisis. Meanwhile, a US Congress delegation flew to Brussels for a meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, who has been leading negotiations with the UK.

"Ellen Barkin's testimony, recorded in 2019, was played in court Johnny Depp was controlling and jealous and once threw a wine bottle across a room, one of his ex-girlfriends and co-stars said in a video played during his court case against Amber Heard. In the video, actress Ellen Barkin said Mr Depp was ""drunk a lot of the time"" during their relationship in the 1990s. The testimony, filmed in 2019, was played in court, where Mr Depp is suing his former wife for defamation. Ms Heard has accused the Hollywood star of being violent, which he has denied. The trial's jury watched the recorded testimony from Ms Barkin, who said her relationship with the Pirates of the Caribbean actor lasted between three and six months. Johnny Depp and Ellen Barkin in 1994 She said: ""He's just a jealous man, controlling - 'Where are you going? Who are you going with? What did you do last night?' ""I had a scratch on my back once that got him very, very angry because he insisted it came from me having sex with a person who wasn't him."" She added that the actor ""was always drinking and or smoking a joint"". Ms Barkin said the incident with the bottle happened while she and Mr Depp were filming the 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, adapted from the book by Hunter S Thompson. ""Mr Depp threw a wine bottle across the room, the hotel room in Las Vegas,"" she said. ""I don't know why he threw the bottle."" Heard denies striking Depp and doctoring photos Depp v Heard: Trial hears claims of drugs and violence Johnny Depp testifies he never hit Amber Heard However, she recalled that he may have had an argument with friends or an assistant. Also on Thursday, Mr Depp's former agent Tracey Jacobs told the trial that his career suffered after 2010 because of ""unprofessional behaviour"" including drug and alcohol use and consistently showing up late on set. And the star's former business manager Josh Mandel said he became ""extremely concerned"" about Mr Depp's financial situation in 2015, with the actor spending $300,000 (Â£193,000) a month on full-time staff at one point.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty are estimated to be worth Â£730m Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty have made the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK's wealthiest 250 people for the first time. Their joint Â£730m fortune ranks them at 222 of thepaper's annual list,external. Recently, Ms Murty's tax affairs came under scrutiny after it was revealed she had ""non-dom"" status - meaning she did not pay UK tax on overseas income. Ms Murty, the daughter of an Indian IT billionaire, lateragreed to pay UK taxes on all her earnings. Her 0.9% stake in her father Narayana Murty's IT company Infosys, estimated to be worth around Â£690m, earned her Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. It is estimated her use of non-dom status could have saved her Â£20m in taxes. The Sunday Times said the couple had made their first appearance on the Rich List now because it was only able to confirm Ms Murty's stake in her father's business over the last year. Mr Sunak was later cleared of breaching the ministerial code after referring himself to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's standards adviser to check if he had properly declared all his interests. Labour pledges to replace non-dom tax status What we know about the Sunak familyâs wealth What is a non-dom? A ""non-dom"" tax designation, short for ""non-domiciled individual"", is a term used for a UK resident whose permanent home, or domicile, is outside the UK. Someone with the status only pays UK tax on money earned in the UK, but does not have to pay any tax to the British government on money made elsewhere in the world (unless they pay that money into a UK bank account). Meanwhile, the latest ranking of the 250 richest people in Britain also revealed a record 177 billionaires in the UK this year, the Sunday Times said. Overall, the richest individuals and families in the UK this year are worth Â£711bn, an 8% rise on last year's Â£658bn. The expanding fortunes of Britain's wealthiest people comes amid a growing cost of living crisis, with UK inflation rising sharply to 9% in the year to April - meaningprices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. In February, Mr Sunak announced a Â£9bn package of measures, including a Â£150 discount to council tax and a Â£200 loan for energy bills in the autumn, but he isunder increasing pressureto offer more support to households as energy bills and food prices continue to rise. Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the India-based conglomerate Hinduja Group, topped the list with their Â£28.47bn fortune - a growth of more than Â£11bn in a year. Entrepreneur Sir James Dyson and his family jumped to second in the rich list after a Â£6.7bn increase to Â£23bn. According to the Sunday Times, the 10 richest families and individuals in the UK, the estimated value of their fortunes and the primary source of their wealth are: Sri and Gopi Hinduja and family - Â£28.47bn (industry and finance) Sir James Dyson and family - Â£23bn (household goods and technology) David and Simon Reuben and family- Â£22.26bn (property and internet) Sir Leonard Blavatnik - Â£20bn (investment, music and media) Guillaume Pousaz- Â£19.259bn (online payments) Lakshmi Mittal and family - Â£17bn (steel) Guy, George, Alannah and Galen Weston and family - Â£13.5bn (retailing) Kirsten and Jorn Rausing - Â£12bn (inheritance and investment) Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken and Michel de Carvalho - Â£11.42bn (inheritance, brewing and banking) Michael Platt - Â£10bn Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich's ranking dropped sharply after being sanctioned over the Ukraine war However, Chelsea owner and Russian steel magnate Roman Abramovich's wealth halved in a year to Â£6bn - dropping him 20 places from his 2021 ranking to 28th on this year's rich list. The oligarch is the biggest loser of all in this year's Rich List, the Sunday Times said. The plummet in Mr Abramovich's fortunes followed his being sanctioned over the war in Ukraine, the enforced sale of Chelsea and the sharp fall in his shares in steel company Evraz. The premier league club is expected to be sold in late May, afterÂ£4.25bn deal to purchase it was agreedwith a consortium led by American businessmen Todd Boehly. Another notable billionaire with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin whose fortunes have suffered since sanctions were imposed, if not so dramatically, is Uzbek-born Russian oil oligarch Alisher Usmanov. His estimated worth dropped by Â£3bn to Â£10bn, falling from sixth to 11th place. Update 30th August: We have removed Christoph Henkel and family from the top 10 after the Sunday Times issued a clarification advising that they changed their assessment of the Henkel's wealth since the publication of the Rich List in May 2022.

"A union has accused ministers of bullying civil servants into working from the office, as figures show there are more workers at the Department for Education than available desks. Earlier this week, the department said it had 8,009 ""full-time equivalent"" staff but only 4,525 operational desks. Ministers have said they want more civil servants to return to offices. But Schools Weekhas reported,externalsome have been forced to work in the corridors and canteen because of a lack of space. Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, employees were told to work from home unless absolutely necessary. However as restrictions have eased, Jacob Rees-Mogg - the government's efficiencies minister - has argued that working in offices provides ""value for money"" and benefits staff's career development. In April, he left notes on empty desks in his department saying: ""Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon."" Rees-Mogg empty desk note insulting, says union Civil servants must return to office - Rees-Mogg Sunak warns young home working may hurt career Responding to the desk space figures, Mark Serwotka - general secretary of the PCS trade union which represents many civil servants - said: ""Jacob Rees-Mogg's Post-It note stunt has been exposed for what it is - an unprofessional and unfair political attack on our members. ""To try to shame them back into the office when they have been working hard and successfully at home throughout the pandemic is bad enough, but when there aren't enough desks - when it's not physically possible - looks like the action of a bully."" He said civil servants should be ""treated with respect, not treated like naughty school children"". The note, printed on government paper with Mr Rees-Mogg's title, were left at empty desks Replying toa written question,external, Education Minister Michelle Donelan said the department had 8,009 full-time equivalent (FTE) employed and 4,525 operational desks across 12 locations in the country. FTE calculates the total number of hours employees work and how many full-time employees that figure equates to. She added that the staff headcount included some who ""regularly attend other 'work settings' as part of their role, for example schools, colleges and learning providers"". She said the department had introduced a policy of hybrid working ""to capture the benefits of both remote working and office attendance"", but that numbers going into the office had ""steadily increased"" since January 2022 and daily occupancy was around 60-70% - similar to pre-pandemic occupancy levels. A government spokesperson said: ""Ministers have been clear that departments should make maximum use of office space and progress is being monitored."" The FDA union, which represents senior civil servants said: ""The reports about the lack of desk space for staff returning to the office at the Department for Education are hardly surprising given the way this matter has been handled."" ""The edict to return to offices shows a complete lack of awareness of the impact on individuals."" What are the new working from home rules? Civil servants must return to office - Rees-Mogg Don't force us back into office - civil servants Home-working officials won't get less pay - minister Sunak warns young home working may hurt career Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"MicheÃ¡l Martin said he had always been critical of any moves to ""collapse the assembly"" The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) cannot be allowed to block the Northern Ireland Assembly the Irish PM has said. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin has met the main Stormont parties to discuss the Northern Ireland Protocol and the assembly crisis. The DUP is refusing to return to power-sharing unless its issues with the protocol are resolved. Mr Martin said those issues can be resolved, but only in a negotiated settlement between the UK and EU. The assembly is not sitting afterthe DUP refused to support the election of a new Speakerfollowing the election on 5 May as part of its ongoing protest against the protocol. The party took the action as part of its ongoing protest over thepost-Brexit trade arrangement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. Without the election of a new Speaker, assembly members (MLAs) cannot take their seats at Stormont. After his meetings, Mr Martin said all parties had indicated a ""desire"" to have the assembly running and an executive formed. ""It's my view, that after any election in any democratic part of the world, the natural follow-on is the convening of the parliament that has been elected by the people,"" he said. The taoiseach said he accepted there are some issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol, but said they could only be resolved with ""substantive, serious negotiations between the European Union and the UK government"". Referring to the DUP, Mr Martin said the party was willing to take up the post of deputy first minister in any new executive, but their issues with the protocol were preventing that happening. Mr Martin added that ""the assembly and the executive should operate in parallel with the UK government and the EU in the context of substantive negotiation to resolve issues with the protocol"". The SDLP said it had a ""good"" chat with the taoiseach It is the first time the DUP leader, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood, have met the taoiseach in personsince the assembly election. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party and the taoiseach both agreed the assembly and the executive needs to formed immediately. He said: ""People have real priorities out there. The cost of living crisis is crippling families all across the north - we know the number of people who are on health waiting lists - and Jeffrey Dondaldson is playing a political game about an issue he cant resolve. ""Playing these sorts of games will not sort anybody's problems out, so it's over to Jeffrey Donaldson now. ""He can sit back and let the pressure build on him if he wants. My view is we should be sitting down together, working on the people's priorities."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney also met on Friday. Following the meeting, Mr Coveney tweeted that he had ""made clear"" to Ms Truss ""Ireland's opposition to the UK breaching international law"". ""The UK needs to get back to talks with the EU,"" he added. It comes as the US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the protocol must remain. Mrs Pelosi said the UK government's suggestion it could act unilaterally to change the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland was deeply concerning and could negatively affect the Good Friday Agreement. Responding to Mrs Pelosi, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it was ""absolutely evident"" that the protocol was undermining the agreement. ""It has made it impossible to have power-sharing on the basis of consensus,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster. ""If Nancy Pelosi wants to see the agreement protected then she needs to recognise that in fact it's the protocol that is harming and undermining the agreement and that's why we have to deal with it."" UUP leader Doug Beattie said Mrs Pelosi's comments ""are not just deeply regrettable and misinformed, but are completely wrong"". He told the BBC's Talkback programme the comments ""would harden people's positions"" . ""It is more negative than positive, I think we all have to watch our language in regards to these negotiations, but what we do need to do is make sure we keep negotiating,"" he said. Mr Beatie said he would support the UK government changing the rules to allow an assembly Speaker to be elected. Under existing rules, both unionists and nationalists must agree to a Speaker, which is why the DUP have been able to stall the process. Michelle O'Neill said it was important for MicheÃ¡l Martin to assert his role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement Ahead of his meeting with the taoiseach, Sir Jeffrey said ""the unionist viewpoint can no longer be ignored"". In a statement, Sir Jeffrey added that power-sharing ""only works with the consent of unionists and nationalists"" and while he wanted to see Stormont's political institutions working fully, that could only happen by ""building consensus"". Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said Mr Martin had ""a very significant role in terms of being the co-guarantor"" of the Good Friday Agreement and it was important for him to ""assert"" that role at a time when ""democracy is being denied"". She said the DUP was ""holding up progress"" and it was ""unacceptable"" that money could not be put into the pockets of people to deal with a cost of living crisis because there was no executive. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem On Thursday, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said she had a ""good conversation"" with Mr Martin. She said the EU and Ireland were on ""the same page"" when it came to the protocol and they agreed ""international agreements cannot be disapplied unilaterally"". Mr Martin also held an hour-long video call with Alliance Party leader Naomi Long on Thursday. Earlier this week he met Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill in Dublin, ahead ofPrime Minister Boris Johnson's visit to Belfast. On Friday, Ms O'Neillmet with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon,externalin Edinburgh, to discuss what she called ""a number of shared priorities"", as well as the political developments at Stormont.

"The revised operating date is June 2027 and the budget has increased by Â£3bn The nuclear power station being built at Hinkley Point will start operating a year later than planned and will cost an extra Â£3bn, EDF has said. The revised operating date for the site in Somerset is now June 2027 and total costs are estimated to be in the range of Â£25bn to Â£26bn. EDF said it would have no cost impact on British consumers or taxpayers. The French energy giant developing the site largely put the delays down to the impact of the pandemic. EDF has published the findings of a review into the cost and schedule of the power station, taking into account the continuing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Both EDF and the government said the delay and extra cost would have no cost impact on British consumers or taxpayers A reduction in workers allowed on site due to Covid safety measures had resulted in the loss of more than half a million days of critical work in 2020 and 2021, it said. Stuart Crooks, managing director of Hinkley Point C, said they had to ""suddenly cut numbers on site from more than 5,000 to around 1,500"". He added this meant ""we had no choice but to become less efficient"" with the supply chain ""also hit hard"". ""In April 2020, 180 suppliers were fully shut down, but even as late as February this year, more than 60 suppliers were operating with reduced productivity due to Covid,"" he said. Looking ahead EDF said the power station was ""needed more than ever"" Mr Crooks said that in January 2021, EDF estimated a six-month Covid impact, assuming an imminent return to normal conditions, but then a second wave of Covid-19 hit. ""In total, the start date for Unit 1 has gone back 18 months since construction started in 2016. ""In such a complex project, it wouldn't be credible to say we can measure exactly how much of this is due to Covid-19 impact, but it is clearly in excess of 12 months."" Mr Crooks said ""other factors have affected the schedule and costs"" and the firm is ""facing the same issues as other major projects with UK-wide supply and labour shortages and inflation"". A government spokesman confirmed: ""While the Covid pandemic has understandably led to delays, the revised Hinkley Point C construction forecast will have no impact on British billpayers or taxpayers, with any increase in costs borne entirely by the developers."" The spokesman continued: ""We will continue to work closely with EDF to bring Hinkley Point C to completion, the first new nuclear power station in a generation, which has created and supported over 22,000 jobs across the UK. ""New nuclear power is essential to the UK's energy security, providing clean and affordable homegrown power."" Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Polandâs president has given the first address in person by a foreign leader to the Ukrainian parliament since the Russian invasion began Andrzej Duda received a standing ovation after he declared that only Ukrainians themselves could decide their future Earlier, the Ukrainian government said Kyiv would not agree a ceasefire deal with Moscow that involved giving away any territory Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, said making concessions would result in Moscow starting an even larger, more bloody offensive in the longer term Russian forces have continued their attacks on the eastern Donbas region following their capture of Mariupol They are said to have made limited advances towards Severodonetsk â where it is thought they are planning a new siege Edited by Ben Tobias We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for a few hours. We'll be back on Monday morning Ukraine time. You can find all our most recent coverage of the war on our website. The Polish leader was given a standing ovation for his address in Ukraine's parliament Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a snapshot of the day's headlines. Oleksandr Zinchenko draped the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy After winning the English Premier League title for the fourth time with his club Manchester City, Ukrainian footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko has said he found it hard to even think about football after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Speaking to Sky Sports after draping the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy, an emotional Zinchenko called it an unforgettable moment. ""I'm so proud to be Ukrainian,"" he said. ""I would love to one day bring this title to Ukraine, for all Ukrainian people, because they deserve it."" Zinchenko said the time since the invasion began was the ""toughest period in my life"". In an interview with BBC Sport's Gary Linekersoon after the start of the war, the Manchester City defender said he could not count the number of times he had cried since Russia's invasion began. Lithuania is no longer importing energy from Russia as of today. Its energy minister said purchases of gas, oil and electricity from Moscow were stopping to show ""solidarity"" with Ukraine - and to cut funding for the ""Russian war machine"". He hoped electricity demands could be met through local green energy production instead. Lithuania, a former Soviet state and a Nato member, is a strong ally of Ukraine. Despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to provide fuel to many European countries. However, Finland's gas supply was cut off yesterday after it refused Moscow's demand to pay in roubles. The port city's been largely destroyed by Russian shelling People are being deported from Mariupol to other Russian-held territory at a faster and faster rate, according to a mayoral adviser in the fallen port city. Petro Andryushchenko wrote on the Telegram app that 313 Mariupol residents were taken away to a so-called ""filtration camp"" in Russian-occupied Bezimenne on Saturday. 55 of them were children. Andryushchenko said many of those being taken to camps were later being sent to Russia itself. The BBC has not been able confirmed the claims, and Russia has previously denied any forced deportations. Mariupol is now under total Russian control after its last defenders surrendered at an industrial plant on Friday. New pictures from the Reuters news agency have given a flavour of life for Ukraine's military personnel. Soldiers are seen performing exercises or taking breaks. The photos were taken in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east - the focus of fierce fighting. An update now on Andriy Shevchyk, the man installed by Russia as the mayor of occupied Enerhodar. Shevchyk is now in intensive care after being injured in an explosion, Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news agency reports. No further details were available. Earlier we reported thatShevchyk and his bodyguards were hurtin what appeared to be a ""precise and targeted attack"", according to the city's elected mayor - who was ousted from power by the Russians. James FitzGeraldBBC News The Luhansk regional governor blamed Russian 'orcs' for destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk The governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region has accused Russian ""orcs"" of destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, amid fierce fighting in the area. Serhiy Haidai is just the latest Ukrainian official to compare Russian troops to a type of mythical monster popularised by JRR
Tolkienâs book The Lord of the Rings. In the epic novel, orcs are seen as âbrutal, aggressive
and chaoticâ says Ostap Slyvynsky, an associate
professor at Lviv University specialising in the literature of east-central
Europe. Some Ukrainians even call Russia itself
âMordorâ â alluding to a dark land in Tolkienâs fantasy. The images give Ukrainians an easy-to-understand metaphor for what's going on in real life. ""The fantasy world has a
very clear accent on what is good and what is bad,"" Slyvynsky explains. âThese terms are kind of euphemisms,â he adds. âIt is better to call Russians âorcsâ than more vulgar words.â The trend emerged some time after 2014 - the year Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed
separatists seized parts of the eastern Donbas region. As for the Russians: they've been labelling Ukrainians âelvesâ - another Tolkien allusion - in the belief that those fictional beings embody weakness, Slyvynsky says. Adam EastonReporting from Warsaw The Polish president has delivered a message of strong support for Ukraine during the first address in person by a foreign leader to the parliament in Kyiv since the Russian invasion began. During his speech Andrzej Duda thanked Ukraine for defending Europe against what he called âRussian imperialismâ. âThe free worldâ, he said, âhas the face of Ukraineâ. Duda said recent calls for Kyiv to negotiate with President Putin, and even give into some of his demands, were disturbing. No decisions about your future will be made without you, he said. Poland has been one of Ukraineâs staunchest supporters, taking in millions of refugees fleeing the fighting and sending tanks and rocket launchers to the Ukrainian military. Duda, who received a standing ovation after his speech, said Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the European Union. An exhibition of destroyed Russian tanks is proving popular with the public in Kyiv. The vehicles have gone on show at Mykhailivska Square. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine have met in Kyiv today Polish citizens living in Ukraine are to be
granted the same rights that Ukrainian refugees in Poland are
currently receiving. Ukraine's President Zelensky announced the plan during a visit from his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. A bill will be tabled in parliament to make the changes happen. Poland has granted the right to live, work and claim
social security payments to more than three million Ukrainian refugees
who've fled Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian parliament has passed a bill banning symbols of the Russian invasion, including those containing the letters Z and V, MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram. Zheleznyak noted that the document included President Zelensky's proposals, which he submitted when he vetoed the previous draft law passed on 14 April. The new version of the law widens the range of cases when the display of the symbols is allowed, namely in museums, libraries, scientific works, textbooks and so on, according to our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. The new bill, however, bans the creation of NGOs which use Russian war symbols and whose activities are aimed at spreading war propaganda and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The letters ""Z"" and ""V"", which don't exist in the Russian alphabet, have been widely used to symbolise support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They are used to mark Russian military vehicles on the battlefield. A bid by Ukraine to join the EU could not be finalised for ""15 or 20 years,"" France's minister for European affairs has said. Speaking on Radio J in Paris, Clement Beaune said: ""We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you're lying. ""It's probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time."" His comments poured cold water on Volodymyr Zelensky's hopes for expedited entry to the bloc in the wake of Russia's invasion. Beaune repeated French President Emmanuel Macron's offer to create a looser ""European political community"" that could help integrate Ukraine sooner, adding: ""I don't want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies."" Zelensky has turned down what he called ""such compromises"" and insisted on an immediate start of the process towards full EU membership. Beaune said Macron's proposal is not ""an alternative to joining the European political community"", emphasising: ""It doesn't prevent membership later on."" Ukraine's aspirations to join the EU and Nato are seen as the main reason Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. Macron's European political community initiative is due to be debated at an EU summit in June. Ukraine has extended martial law for three months until 23 August. President Volodymyr Zelensky first signed the decree, along with a general military mobilisation call, on 24 February and since then has extended it for a month on two occasions. Today, Ukraine's parliament voted by an absolute majority for a third extension as Russia continues to focus its offensive on the eastern Donbas region. Zelensky's representative at the Constitutional Court, Fedir Venislavskyy, said the decision to extend it for 90 days this time is because a ""counter-offensive takes more time than defence"". Poland's President Andrzej Duda meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv If you're just joining us, here's a look at the main news from the war in Ukraine so far today: Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukraine remains vulnerable to aerial strikes Military and financial support from Western
countries is increasingly making a difference. At the start of the war, President Zelensky was saying they
needed more and they needed it faster. But his position has gradually shifted, to acknowledge that the Ukrainians are getting the support they need with the urgency they
need. The big missing piece in the puzzle is still air defences. A statement yesterday from the Russians
- saying theyâd destroyed a big shipment of military aid â shows Ukraine is
still not getting the latest in air defence systems. On every other front, I think the support is starting to
come through. Iâve seen modern Western equipment being sent to the front lines. They are always going to need more though, especially
given the increased Russian pushes weâve been seeing. Andriy Shevchyk, a mayor installed by Russia in the occupied city of Enerhodar, has reportedly been injured in an explosion. The city's elected mayor Dmytro Orlov - who is currently in nearby Zaporizhzhia - wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Shevchyk and his bodyguards had been taken to hospital after being wounded. Orlov noted that the circumstances were still being established. He added that nobody else had been hurt in the blast - suggesting this had been a ""precise and targeted attack"". There was no immediate comment from the Russian side. Enerhodar, a city of about 50,000 people which serves Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine embraced in the chamber earlier today ""Only Ukraine has the right to
decide its future"", the Polish president has said in a speech to the Ukrainian parliament. Andrzej Duda said ""worrying voices"" were suggesting Ukraine should give in to Russia's President Putin, according to comments quoted by the Reuters news agency. He told lawmakers that those voices should not be heeded - because ceding even an inch of Ukrainian territory would be a blow to the whole West. Duda also reportedly stressed that Poland supported Ukraine in its bid to gain full membership of the European Union - a matter on which EU countries have not reached a consensus. He was the first foreign leader to give an in-person speech to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia invaded on 24 February. Photos posted on Twitter by Duda's office showed him receiving a standing ovation in parliament and embracing Zelensky. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia attacked Ukrainian forces with airstrikes and artillery in the east and the south, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, according to an update from the Russian defence ministry. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points, 13 areas where troops and Ukrainian military equipment were amassed, as well as four ammunition depots in the Donbas region, the Reuters news agency reported. In Ukraine's southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets hit a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, around 100km northeast of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said. The BBC has not been able to confirm this independently. Authorities in Ukraine's south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region have reported civilian injuries - following Russian missile strikes on a village. Explosions were said to have woken people up in the middle of the night. Emergency workers attended the scene, the regional administration posted on the Telegram messaging app. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The theatre has often been described as the heart of the city After almost three months of relentless assault, Mariupol has fallen. Ukraine's military says its combat mission in the besieged port is over. More than any other Ukrainian city, Mariupol has come to symbolise the ferocious brutality of Russia's assault and the stubbornness of Ukraine's resistance. On Wednesday 23 February, Ivan Stanislavsky left his camera bag at the office. He was on his way to see the layout of his new book on Mariupol's Soviet-era murals at a colleague's house, and didn't want to lug the gear around. He could always pick it up the next day. But on Thursday, as he stood in the street outside his locked and deserted office, he could hear thunderous sounds rolling in from the east. The city was under fire. As the conflict intensified, and gunfire became audible to the west too, Ivan moved his mattress into the hall. He piled up his large collection of art books - including the Encyclopaedia of Ukrainian Rock Music - against the windows of his flat in the district of Primorsky. ""Let's say it was not a waste of a library,"" says the 36-year-old photographer, who is also a press officer at Ukrainian premier league football club FC Mariupol. Ivan Stanislavsky loved to photograph his city of Mariupol Across town in the neighbourhood of Kalmiusky, businessman Yevhen was also taking precautions. The 47-year-old had told his family to pack so they could escape the city. But when he returned from the office, he found no packing had been done. His family refused to leave. In an apartment in the same block, metallurgists from the nearby steelworks, Nataliia, 43, and Andrii, 41, were already slicing the last two loaves they had been able to buy, leaving them to dry out so they could eat them piece by piece over the weeks ahead. The Illich steel plant dominates this view of Mariupol Volodymyr, a 52-year-old paramedic in Kalmiusky, was also in his kitchen, trying to absorb the news. When reports came in of Russians marching through the village of Chonhar - on a strategic road out of Crimea to the west - he choked. This was a coordinated attack, he realised. The ambulance dispatcher was on the phone. She instructed Volodymyr to ignore routine calls. ""Find the wounded"", he was told. Twenty-two-year-old engineering graduate Mariia thought the first explosion she heard was simply a storm. Then she heard a second. ""We didn't know what to do,"" says Mariia, who like Ivan, lived in Primorsky. ""I didn't have time to think about my future, my plans. I had to think about what I'd eat and drink... [And] what to do with the cats."" It suddenly dawned on her why, in the past few days, soldiers had appeared in the paint shop where she worked, asking to buy blue and yellow tape. They needed it to mark their uniforms. The Mariupol seafront was a beloved destination Four days into the war, with the fighting closing in, Ivan and his wife sought shelter in a basement underneath his local supermarket. It offered good protection, and Ivan found that the muffling of sound dulled his sense of mounting anxiety. Daily life was being stripped down to bare essentials. ""We lived like primitive people,"" he told the BBC from Lviv, where he has now fled. ""We broke trees, made fires, cooked food on fires. I even heard of people eating pigeons."" He watched as order gradually broke down all around him. He kept avivid diary, later published online,external. ""The Stone Age has arrived,"" he says in his 6 March entry. He writes of watching his fellow Ukrainian citizens raiding abandoned shops, making off with everything from computers and freezers to swimsuits and underwear. One evening a drunk woman interrupts a session of evening gossip in the basement. ""Treat yourself,"" she says, as a flashlight revealed a bottle of Californian Merlot, taken from Wines of the World on nearby Italiiska Street. But aware that even medical supplies and cash tills were being taken, Ivan says he felt disgust. ""We are our own worst enemies,"" he writes. But is this, he wonders, how the fittest survive? After a while, each day became a ""combat mission"". Over a few short weeks, Mariupol fell apart. The Russian military laid siege to the city, attacking power and water supplies. A Russian airstrike hit the maternity hospital on 9 March, and a plane bombed its theatre - clearly marked as a civilian shelter - a week later. Ivan was stunned at how quickly it all happened. The theatre after it was bombed ""The whole city, all its infrastructure, supply system, logistics, energy supply were destroyed in a matter of days,"" he says. Sitting underground at night, he sensed people becoming passive. ""You can only wait in the shelter,"" he writes in his diary. ""Some are waiting for spring, some - for the morning to come, some - for the end of the war. And someone is waiting for the bomb to come and kill everyone."" And all this just as Mariupol had seemed destined to turn a corner. Money began to pour in, adding lustre to a city previously associated mainly with heavy industry - and war. ""It was a city aspiring to something,"" Ivan says. It hadn't always been this way. Long before this year's invasion, Mariupol had a ringside seat to Ukraine's simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk, the two regions that make up the neighbouring area known as Donbas. An activist guards a barricade outside the Mariupol government building seized by pro-Russia activists on 17 April 2014 When fighting first broke out there in 2014, the government briefly lost control of Mariupol after clashes with pro-Russian protesters. In January 2015, a devastating rocket attack by the rebels on the eastern edge of the city killed almost 30 civilians. Even though the war gradually receded, the sound of artillery booming in the distance was part of Mariupol's daily soundscape. But the city moved on. The Ukrainian government briefly made Mariupol the administrative capital of the Donetsk Oblast. People migrated from rebel-held areas and the city started attracting investment. ""It started receiving all of the resources and all of the attention,"" Ivan says. A view of Mariupol along its coast Public buildings were renovated, cafÃ©s opened, and new parks created. In a podcast last October, the city's mayor Vadym Boychenko boasted of creating the best municipal services in the country, opening an IT school, and promoting contemporary art and sports. Plans were afoot, he said, for the largest water park in Ukraine and a version of Disneyland ""which will probably be called Mariland"". In fact, Mariupol was declared Ukraine's ""Big Capital of Culture"" in 2021. But while Mariupol flourished, rebel-held Donetsk mouldered. When the rebels returned to Mariupol, Volodymyr, the paramedic, believed they were driven by revenge to destroy the city. ""'If we live in shit, then you will live in shit as well,'"" Volodymyr says they told him at a checkpoint as he finally escaped the city. ""They just looked at us and envied how we lived."" Volodymyr thinks the Russian-backed separatists were motivated by revenge Yevhen, the businessman, describes life in Mariupol in the past five years as ""a fairytale"". ""The city was being reconstructed,"" he says, ""all roads were renovated, public transport was improved."" His buildings restoration firm was responsible, among other projects, for the reconstruction of Mariupol's iconic water tower in time for the city's 240th birthday. ""This is a city of hard workersâ¦ It was hard for me to explain that my workers should finish at 6pm - they wanted to work longer."" Ivan's photograph of Mariupol's iconic water tower Like many others, weekends would be spent with family in the city's revived parks or on the seafront. ""For me, this is a [key] question - if you want to capture the city, why destroy it? [The Russians] don't need thinking people, they need territory,"" he says. And, he adds, he is now getting calls from the Russians to return to Mariupol to help rebuild it. ""But if Mariupol is occupied by Russia, there will be no future thereâ¦ there will be nothing to live for. To live in unrecognised territory is to bury your children's future."" About 150,000 people remain in the city, from a population of almost half a million. Most of those left there, he says, are also trying to escape. ""I left Mariupol but my soul is there,"" he says, tears in his eyes. Businessman Yevhen is already getting calls from Russians to rebuild Mariupol Nataliia and her husband Andrii worked at the Illich plant, one of two iron and steel works which tower over the city's skyline and loom large in Ivan Stanilavsky's photographs. They spent long days at work, and leisure time was precious. ""The city authorities laid out marble tiles, made piers [so that] it was possible to sit on a bench right in the sea,"" Andrii says. ""It was a wonderful warm city with parks, concerts, fountains,"" his wife says. ""A European city."" Mariupol's industry makes for a dramatic backdrop This recent blossoming was captured by Ivan, but as a photographer with a passion for his city's past, his pet project was documenting Mariupol's remarkable collection of Soviet murals, one of the most extensive in Ukraine. The cultural importance of preserving such remarkable works seems undeniable, but in Mariupol nostalgia for the Soviet Union jostled uneasily with Ukraine's modern, increasingly European identity, Ivan says. ""Politics was already preventing this cultural heritage from being integrated into Ukraine's artistic context,"" he says. A mosaic picturing three strong youths So inevitably, when the war came, culture found itself fought over too. On 28 April, Mariupol's city council denounced the alleged theft by Russia of more than 2,000 exhibits from the city's museums, including ancient icons, a handwritten Torah scroll and more than 200 medals. The director of Mariupol's Local History Museum, Natalia Kapustnikova, later told Russian newspaper Izvestia that she had personally handed over paintings to the Russians by Ivan Aivazovsky and Arkhip Kuindzhi, and claimed that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" had burned 95% of the museum's exhibits. She wasn't the only local official harbouring pro-Russian sentiments. On 9 April, Ukraine's prosecutor general charged a member of Mariupol's city council, Kostyantyn Ivashchenko, with treason after he was declared mayor by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk. Ivashchenko's pro-Russian party had been well supported in the city's last elections, coming second, while President Volodymyr Zelensky's party came a distant fifth place. In a poll conducted just before the elections by the Kyiv-based Centre for Social Indicators, almost half the city's population identified themselves as ""Russian"", though 80% also described themselves as ""Ukrainian"". More tellingly, perhaps, fewer than 20% self-identified as ""European"", while more than 50% said they were ""Soviet"". Mariia says that after the invasion she began to hate all things Russian Nataliia, whose father is Russian, says she asked her husband for forgiveness when the bombing started. ""I was ashamed that I was Russian."" Mariia, the engineer, says that before the war her first language was Russian, but when the bombing began ""I started to hate all things Russian - language, movies, objects"". Mariupol's complex identity is hardly unique in today's Ukraine, a country which formed an integral part of the Soviet Union until the collapse of communism at the end of the 1980s. And it's doubtful that any of those who described themselves as ""Russian"" or ""Soviet"" wanted to see their city destroyed in a violent effort to pull it back into Moscow's orbit. Ironically, when the moment arrived to defend the city from Russian invaders, it was another part of Mariupol's Soviet-era legacy that came to play an almost iconic role. This legacy, buried deep underground, is the maze of bunkers beneath Mariupol's other steel works, Azovstal, built by the Soviet authorities during the Cold War. The 36 bomb shelters provided room for more than 12,000 people. After independence in 1991, no-one thought that much about them. But then the fighting in 2014 began. ""We started thinking about what we would do if fighting spread further into the city,"" Enver Tskitishvili, Azovstal's director general, says. Training on the use of the bunkers and their connecting tunnels went on every day for years. In early February, as the fear of renewed conflict loomed larger, preparations swung into high gear. Food and water were brought in the week before Russia's invasion. Officials at the plant knew the bomb shelters would soon be occupied, but had little idea that Azovstal, surrounded by water on three sides, would become the scene of Mariupol's last stand. An injured Ukrainian serviceman inside the Azovstal iron and steel works factory As the days went by, the war got closer and closer to Ivan Stanislavsky's apartment. Excursions in search of food, even to the nearby Dzerkalnyy store, just 400m up the road, were increasingly perilous. Sometimes, a Ukrainian mortar team would arrive by truck, fire off a few rounds, and leave before the inevitable Russian reply. There was little communication between civilians and soldiers. One day, a tank from the Azov Regiment arrived near Dzerkalnyy, sending locals running, fearful of an impending battle. The regiment emerged in 2014 as a highly effective volunteer militia with far right and, in some cases, neo-Nazi affiliations, before being folded into Ukraine's National Guard. Vladimir Putin has made extensive use of the Azov's controversial origins, in an effort to bolster his argument that he is trying to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities say the regiment's origins are a thing of the past and points out that far-right parties have had very little electoral success. In his diary Ivan describes the members he knows as a motley assortment of Mariupol natives - bikers, lawyers, football hooligans, and an amateur actor -  driven not by ideology, but by a fierce hatred of those who were trying to ruin their lives. ""Together they formed a 'Nazi' battalion and intimidated the entire Russian army,"" he writes. Intimidating and effective, but not enough, eventually, to stem the Russian tide. While the city's defenders fought their losing battle, Ivan heard voices in his basement starting to curse President Zelensky for leaving Mariupol to its own devices. President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) and children play in a fountain during his first official visit to Mariupol on 15 June 2019 For all the praise heaped on the city's defenders, it was clear from the start that Mariupol was not the government's main priority. Faced with Russian threats on a number of fronts, the Zelensky government chose to secure the capital, thwarting what was arguably Vladimir Putin's top priority. Ultimately, that meant letting Russian forces achieve another of their pre-war goals: the establishment of a land corridor between Crimea - annexed by Moscow in 2014 - and the separatists in the Donbas. But for those trapped in the city, fighting or just trying to survive, it was a bitter pill. ""Some say Mariupol was given the status of a hero city,"" Ivan wrote in his diary on 13 March. ""It looks like the award will be posthumous."" Ivan's photo of the inside of the water tower By now, Ivan couldn't stand any more. Outside Dzerkalnyy supermarket, he saw corpses neatly stacked under a wall. People who once queued for food were now in ""the queue of the dead"", waiting to be buried. So on 15 March Ivan bundled four family members and his cat into his miraculously unscathed Skoda Fabia and joined a convoy for the tortuous journey north-west to government-held Zaporizhzhia. At an observation point on Markelova St looking towards the port and the beach, Ivan allowed himself a brief moment of reflection. ""In my head I'm saying goodbye to this place,"" he writes in his diary. ""I have a feeling we will never return here."" A day later, Mariia and five relatives also left by car, carrying just personal belongings and the family's dog. As they made their way out of Mariupol, their convoy came under attack and the cars had to accelerate out of danger, headed first to Zaporizhzhia, then to Dnipro. The following day, Nataliia and Andreii left, after a neighbour offered them a space in his car. The couple eventually reached the city of Khmelnytskyi where they have been selling the family's coin collection in order to survive. In that same convoy, Yevhen travelled with his wife and two other relatives. He's now in Dnipro, helping other residents who escaped Mariupol, and trying to reach those who remain. The apartment block where Ivan lived has been destroyed Volodymyr, the paramedic, stayed in Mariupol as long as he could, to look after his elderly mother. But deprived of food and special medicine, she died. He then left the city on 21 April, and is volunteering at a hospital in Dnipro. ""There are thousands and thousands of families like mine,"" he says. ""How many people have died? How many families have been lost?"" Two months after escaping, Ivan is still watching the death throes of Mariupol from the relative safety of Lviv. In his diary's poignant epilogue, he writes of flashbacks, text messages about deaths or lucky escapes, and phone calls that go unanswered. ""The subscriber is out of range.""

"Polandâs president has given the first address in person by a foreign leader to the Ukrainian parliament since the Russian invasion began Andrzej Duda received a standing ovation after he declared that only Ukrainians themselves could decide their future Earlier, the Ukrainian government said Kyiv would not agree a ceasefire deal with Moscow that involved giving away any territory Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, said making concessions would result in Moscow starting an even larger, more bloody offensive in the longer term Russian forces have continued their attacks on the eastern Donbas region following their capture of Mariupol They are said to have made limited advances towards Severodonetsk â where it is thought they are planning a new siege Edited by Ben Tobias We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for a few hours. We'll be back on Monday morning Ukraine time. You can find all our most recent coverage of the war on our website. The Polish leader was given a standing ovation for his address in Ukraine's parliament Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a snapshot of the day's headlines. Oleksandr Zinchenko draped the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy After winning the English Premier League title for the fourth time with his club Manchester City, Ukrainian footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko has said he found it hard to even think about football after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Speaking to Sky Sports after draping the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy, an emotional Zinchenko called it an unforgettable moment. ""I'm so proud to be Ukrainian,"" he said. ""I would love to one day bring this title to Ukraine, for all Ukrainian people, because they deserve it."" Zinchenko said the time since the invasion began was the ""toughest period in my life"". In an interview with BBC Sport's Gary Linekersoon after the start of the war, the Manchester City defender said he could not count the number of times he had cried since Russia's invasion began. Lithuania is no longer importing energy from Russia as of today. Its energy minister said purchases of gas, oil and electricity from Moscow were stopping to show ""solidarity"" with Ukraine - and to cut funding for the ""Russian war machine"". He hoped electricity demands could be met through local green energy production instead. Lithuania, a former Soviet state and a Nato member, is a strong ally of Ukraine. Despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to provide fuel to many European countries. However, Finland's gas supply was cut off yesterday after it refused Moscow's demand to pay in roubles. The port city's been largely destroyed by Russian shelling People are being deported from Mariupol to other Russian-held territory at a faster and faster rate, according to a mayoral adviser in the fallen port city. Petro Andryushchenko wrote on the Telegram app that 313 Mariupol residents were taken away to a so-called ""filtration camp"" in Russian-occupied Bezimenne on Saturday. 55 of them were children. Andryushchenko said many of those being taken to camps were later being sent to Russia itself. The BBC has not been able confirmed the claims, and Russia has previously denied any forced deportations. Mariupol is now under total Russian control after its last defenders surrendered at an industrial plant on Friday. New pictures from the Reuters news agency have given a flavour of life for Ukraine's military personnel. Soldiers are seen performing exercises or taking breaks. The photos were taken in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east - the focus of fierce fighting. An update now on Andriy Shevchyk, the man installed by Russia as the mayor of occupied Enerhodar. Shevchyk is now in intensive care after being injured in an explosion, Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news agency reports. No further details were available. Earlier we reported thatShevchyk and his bodyguards were hurtin what appeared to be a ""precise and targeted attack"", according to the city's elected mayor - who was ousted from power by the Russians. James FitzGeraldBBC News The Luhansk regional governor blamed Russian 'orcs' for destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk The governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region has accused Russian ""orcs"" of destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, amid fierce fighting in the area. Serhiy Haidai is just the latest Ukrainian official to compare Russian troops to a type of mythical monster popularised by JRR
Tolkienâs book The Lord of the Rings. In the epic novel, orcs are seen as âbrutal, aggressive
and chaoticâ says Ostap Slyvynsky, an associate
professor at Lviv University specialising in the literature of east-central
Europe. Some Ukrainians even call Russia itself
âMordorâ â alluding to a dark land in Tolkienâs fantasy. The images give Ukrainians an easy-to-understand metaphor for what's going on in real life. ""The fantasy world has a
very clear accent on what is good and what is bad,"" Slyvynsky explains. âThese terms are kind of euphemisms,â he adds. âIt is better to call Russians âorcsâ than more vulgar words.â The trend emerged some time after 2014 - the year Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed
separatists seized parts of the eastern Donbas region. As for the Russians: they've been labelling Ukrainians âelvesâ - another Tolkien allusion - in the belief that those fictional beings embody weakness, Slyvynsky says. Adam EastonReporting from Warsaw The Polish president has delivered a message of strong support for Ukraine during the first address in person by a foreign leader to the parliament in Kyiv since the Russian invasion began. During his speech Andrzej Duda thanked Ukraine for defending Europe against what he called âRussian imperialismâ. âThe free worldâ, he said, âhas the face of Ukraineâ. Duda said recent calls for Kyiv to negotiate with President Putin, and even give into some of his demands, were disturbing. No decisions about your future will be made without you, he said. Poland has been one of Ukraineâs staunchest supporters, taking in millions of refugees fleeing the fighting and sending tanks and rocket launchers to the Ukrainian military. Duda, who received a standing ovation after his speech, said Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the European Union. An exhibition of destroyed Russian tanks is proving popular with the public in Kyiv. The vehicles have gone on show at Mykhailivska Square. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine have met in Kyiv today Polish citizens living in Ukraine are to be
granted the same rights that Ukrainian refugees in Poland are
currently receiving. Ukraine's President Zelensky announced the plan during a visit from his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. A bill will be tabled in parliament to make the changes happen. Poland has granted the right to live, work and claim
social security payments to more than three million Ukrainian refugees
who've fled Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian parliament has passed a bill banning symbols of the Russian invasion, including those containing the letters Z and V, MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram. Zheleznyak noted that the document included President Zelensky's proposals, which he submitted when he vetoed the previous draft law passed on 14 April. The new version of the law widens the range of cases when the display of the symbols is allowed, namely in museums, libraries, scientific works, textbooks and so on, according to our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. The new bill, however, bans the creation of NGOs which use Russian war symbols and whose activities are aimed at spreading war propaganda and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The letters ""Z"" and ""V"", which don't exist in the Russian alphabet, have been widely used to symbolise support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They are used to mark Russian military vehicles on the battlefield. A bid by Ukraine to join the EU could not be finalised for ""15 or 20 years,"" France's minister for European affairs has said. Speaking on Radio J in Paris, Clement Beaune said: ""We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you're lying. ""It's probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time."" His comments poured cold water on Volodymyr Zelensky's hopes for expedited entry to the bloc in the wake of Russia's invasion. Beaune repeated French President Emmanuel Macron's offer to create a looser ""European political community"" that could help integrate Ukraine sooner, adding: ""I don't want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies."" Zelensky has turned down what he called ""such compromises"" and insisted on an immediate start of the process towards full EU membership. Beaune said Macron's proposal is not ""an alternative to joining the European political community"", emphasising: ""It doesn't prevent membership later on."" Ukraine's aspirations to join the EU and Nato are seen as the main reason Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. Macron's European political community initiative is due to be debated at an EU summit in June. Ukraine has extended martial law for three months until 23 August. President Volodymyr Zelensky first signed the decree, along with a general military mobilisation call, on 24 February and since then has extended it for a month on two occasions. Today, Ukraine's parliament voted by an absolute majority for a third extension as Russia continues to focus its offensive on the eastern Donbas region. Zelensky's representative at the Constitutional Court, Fedir Venislavskyy, said the decision to extend it for 90 days this time is because a ""counter-offensive takes more time than defence"". Poland's President Andrzej Duda meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv If you're just joining us, here's a look at the main news from the war in Ukraine so far today: Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukraine remains vulnerable to aerial strikes Military and financial support from Western
countries is increasingly making a difference. At the start of the war, President Zelensky was saying they
needed more and they needed it faster. But his position has gradually shifted, to acknowledge that the Ukrainians are getting the support they need with the urgency they
need. The big missing piece in the puzzle is still air defences. A statement yesterday from the Russians
- saying theyâd destroyed a big shipment of military aid â shows Ukraine is
still not getting the latest in air defence systems. On every other front, I think the support is starting to
come through. Iâve seen modern Western equipment being sent to the front lines. They are always going to need more though, especially
given the increased Russian pushes weâve been seeing. Andriy Shevchyk, a mayor installed by Russia in the occupied city of Enerhodar, has reportedly been injured in an explosion. The city's elected mayor Dmytro Orlov - who is currently in nearby Zaporizhzhia - wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Shevchyk and his bodyguards had been taken to hospital after being wounded. Orlov noted that the circumstances were still being established. He added that nobody else had been hurt in the blast - suggesting this had been a ""precise and targeted attack"". There was no immediate comment from the Russian side. Enerhodar, a city of about 50,000 people which serves Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine embraced in the chamber earlier today ""Only Ukraine has the right to
decide its future"", the Polish president has said in a speech to the Ukrainian parliament. Andrzej Duda said ""worrying voices"" were suggesting Ukraine should give in to Russia's President Putin, according to comments quoted by the Reuters news agency. He told lawmakers that those voices should not be heeded - because ceding even an inch of Ukrainian territory would be a blow to the whole West. Duda also reportedly stressed that Poland supported Ukraine in its bid to gain full membership of the European Union - a matter on which EU countries have not reached a consensus. He was the first foreign leader to give an in-person speech to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia invaded on 24 February. Photos posted on Twitter by Duda's office showed him receiving a standing ovation in parliament and embracing Zelensky. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia attacked Ukrainian forces with airstrikes and artillery in the east and the south, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, according to an update from the Russian defence ministry. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points, 13 areas where troops and Ukrainian military equipment were amassed, as well as four ammunition depots in the Donbas region, the Reuters news agency reported. In Ukraine's southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets hit a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, around 100km northeast of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said. The BBC has not been able to confirm this independently. Authorities in Ukraine's south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region have reported civilian injuries - following Russian missile strikes on a village. Explosions were said to have woken people up in the middle of the night. Emergency workers attended the scene, the regional administration posted on the Telegram messaging app. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Finland imports most of its gas from Russia but says it can cope with the disruption Russia has halted its gas supply to Finland - the latest escalation of an energy payments row with the West. Russia's gas giant Gazprom confirmed it had completely halted exports to Finland at 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Finland said all the deliveries had stopped, but added there would be no disruption to customers. Helsinki has been refusing to pay for its supplies in roubles. But the cut-off also follows an announcement that Finland will apply for Nato membership. Despite its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Russia continues to supply gas to many European countries. After Western powers sanctioned Russia over the war, Russia said ""unfriendly"" countries must pay for gas using the Russian currency, a move the EU considers blackmail. Reliance on Russian energy is a contributing factor in the cost-of-living crisis faced by many consumers. Finland imports most of its gas from Russia but gas accounts for less than a tenth of the country's energy consumption. On Saturday,the Finnish state-owned company Gasgrid Finland said in a statement that gas supplies through the Imatra entry point were stopped on 21 May.,external ""The amount of gas needed by the Finnish gas market is imported into the Finnish gas system through Balticconnector entry point in accordance with the nominations made by the market parties. Gasgrid Finland has directed gas imports in Balticconnector and the gas system is currently in balance,"" it said. Earlier, the Finnish state-owned energy firm Gasum described the Russian move as ""highly regrettable"". ""However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months,""Gasum CEO Mika Wiljanen said in a statement.,external Asked about the matter, a Kremlin spokesman said ""it is obvious that nobody is going to deliver anything for free"". Last Sunday, Russia also cut electricity supplies to Finland. It had threatened retaliation should Finland apply to join Nato. In a separate development, Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft said on Friday that former German Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der had informed them he would no longer serve on their board. Mr SchrÃ¶der has faced increasing public outrage over the lucrative role. He has refused to criticise Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who he counts as a personal friend, over his decision to invade Ukraine.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty are estimated to be worth Â£730m Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty have made the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK's wealthiest 250 people for the first time. Their joint Â£730m fortune ranks them at 222 of thepaper's annual list,external. Recently, Ms Murty's tax affairs came under scrutiny after it was revealed she had ""non-dom"" status - meaning she did not pay UK tax on overseas income. Ms Murty, the daughter of an Indian IT billionaire, lateragreed to pay UK taxes on all her earnings. Her 0.9% stake in her father Narayana Murty's IT company Infosys, estimated to be worth around Â£690m, earned her Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. It is estimated her use of non-dom status could have saved her Â£20m in taxes. The Sunday Times said the couple had made their first appearance on the Rich List now because it was only able to confirm Ms Murty's stake in her father's business over the last year. Mr Sunak was later cleared of breaching the ministerial code after referring himself to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's standards adviser to check if he had properly declared all his interests. Labour pledges to replace non-dom tax status What we know about the Sunak familyâs wealth What is a non-dom? A ""non-dom"" tax designation, short for ""non-domiciled individual"", is a term used for a UK resident whose permanent home, or domicile, is outside the UK. Someone with the status only pays UK tax on money earned in the UK, but does not have to pay any tax to the British government on money made elsewhere in the world (unless they pay that money into a UK bank account). Meanwhile, the latest ranking of the 250 richest people in Britain also revealed a record 177 billionaires in the UK this year, the Sunday Times said. Overall, the richest individuals and families in the UK this year are worth Â£711bn, an 8% rise on last year's Â£658bn. The expanding fortunes of Britain's wealthiest people comes amid a growing cost of living crisis, with UK inflation rising sharply to 9% in the year to April - meaningprices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. In February, Mr Sunak announced a Â£9bn package of measures, including a Â£150 discount to council tax and a Â£200 loan for energy bills in the autumn, but he isunder increasing pressureto offer more support to households as energy bills and food prices continue to rise. Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the India-based conglomerate Hinduja Group, topped the list with their Â£28.47bn fortune - a growth of more than Â£11bn in a year. Entrepreneur Sir James Dyson and his family jumped to second in the rich list after a Â£6.7bn increase to Â£23bn. According to the Sunday Times, the 10 richest families and individuals in the UK, the estimated value of their fortunes and the primary source of their wealth are: Sri and Gopi Hinduja and family - Â£28.47bn (industry and finance) Sir James Dyson and family - Â£23bn (household goods and technology) David and Simon Reuben and family- Â£22.26bn (property and internet) Sir Leonard Blavatnik - Â£20bn (investment, music and media) Guillaume Pousaz- Â£19.259bn (online payments) Lakshmi Mittal and family - Â£17bn (steel) Guy, George, Alannah and Galen Weston and family - Â£13.5bn (retailing) Kirsten and Jorn Rausing - Â£12bn (inheritance and investment) Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken and Michel de Carvalho - Â£11.42bn (inheritance, brewing and banking) Michael Platt - Â£10bn Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich's ranking dropped sharply after being sanctioned over the Ukraine war However, Chelsea owner and Russian steel magnate Roman Abramovich's wealth halved in a year to Â£6bn - dropping him 20 places from his 2021 ranking to 28th on this year's rich list. The oligarch is the biggest loser of all in this year's Rich List, the Sunday Times said. The plummet in Mr Abramovich's fortunes followed his being sanctioned over the war in Ukraine, the enforced sale of Chelsea and the sharp fall in his shares in steel company Evraz. The premier league club is expected to be sold in late May, afterÂ£4.25bn deal to purchase it was agreedwith a consortium led by American businessmen Todd Boehly. Another notable billionaire with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin whose fortunes have suffered since sanctions were imposed, if not so dramatically, is Uzbek-born Russian oil oligarch Alisher Usmanov. His estimated worth dropped by Â£3bn to Â£10bn, falling from sixth to 11th place. Update 30th August: We have removed Christoph Henkel and family from the top 10 after the Sunday Times issued a clarification advising that they changed their assessment of the Henkel's wealth since the publication of the Rich List in May 2022.

"This video can not be played Warning: This video contains distressing images A woman who was terrorised and abused by an MI5 agent is taking legal action against the security service. Beth, not her real name, has lodged a formal complaint with the watchdog for the intelligence agencies, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). On Thursday, a BBC investigation revealed her then partner used his security status to coercively control her. He also attacked her with a machete and threatened to kill her. The Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ) said Beth was asking the IPT to investigate MI5's recruitment and handling of the agent, X, and whether any steps were taken to address the clear risk of harm he posed. She will also argue that MI5's conduct may have breached her human rights by ""enabling X to subject her to serious violence and abuse with impunity"". MI5 agent used secret status to terrorise girlfriend Court ruling allows BBC to tell MI5 agent story The IPT is an independent, official panel that considers complaints about conduct by or on behalf of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. The IPT has the power to consider alleged breaches of human rights by intelligence agencies. If it ultimately ruled that MI5 failed to take appropriate action to protect Beth from harm, that could impact all the UK's intelligence and security agencies that recruit and task undercover informants. In practical terms that could force more detailed assessments of the risks that agents pose. It could potentially mean agencies decide some informants are too dangerous to recruit, no matter the value of the intelligence they may have. In a recent ground-breaking case against the police, theIPT awarded Â£230,000 compensation to a womanwho had been tricked into a sexual relationship with an undercover officer. And so a ruling against MI5 in this case would almost certainly lead to damages for Beth. If the IPT decides to examine the complaint, its panel will have to balance human rights considerations with wider questions about why the information provided by X was thought to be operationally vital. Behind closed doors, the tribunal would be likely to examine MI5's paperwork and witness evidence about why this agent was important. The questions Beth's case raise mean its outcome could become a major moment in the law governing undercover operations. The CWJ said it was also exploring possible action against a police force which ""failed to take action against the perpetrator despite repeated reports"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has described the findings of the BBC investigation as ""harrowing and horrific"". He said no one should be in any doubt how seriously ministers took violence against women or girls, but he could not comment further ""because of national security"". His cabinet colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg praised the BBC for performing a ""public service.. in bringing this story to light"", but added that ""the national security card does sometimes have to be played"". The High Court has ruled X can not be named for security reasons. Labour's Yvette Cooper said Home Secretary Priti Patel needed to ensure there was an independent assessment of ""this very troubling case and how it has been handled"". The shadow home secretary said this should include looking at safeguarding responsibilities, the way that concerns about domestic abuse are handled by MI5, and the criminal investigation that took place. Domestic violence charity Refuge said the government's determination to protect X's identity was ""terrifying"". X also made threats about killing and sexually abusing young girls, the BBC investigation found. A video filmed by Beth shows him attacking her with a machete. Watch the full investigation This is the story of a dangerous MI5 agent, which the government tried to keep secret. Available nowon BBC iPlayer Police evidence seen by the BBC shows that he is a right-wing extremist with a violent past. He moved abroad to work for a foreign intelligence agency while under police investigation. At the High Court, the BBC argued that women had a right to know his identity and it would protect potential victims from harm. The government said disclosing his identity would threaten national security and endanger his life. A judge backed that - but ruled that details of the case could be revealed. Refuge, a charity which helps victims of domestic violence, said it was horrified by the BBC's revelations. Chief executive Ruth Davison said women were often told no one would believe them. ""Imagine those words being spoken by someone who works for the security service."" She said the news that the agent had used his status to perpetrate domestic abuse was abhorrent, and the fact that his identity was being protected while he was expressing ""murderous intents"" was ""terrifying for women and girls"". MI5's London headquarters Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who also used to chair Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, told Today the committee would be entitled to investigate whether MI5 had handled the case correctly according to its rules. But he added he would have been ""astonished"" if the security service had not tried to protect the agent's identity. If it hadn't, Mr Grieve said, it would have exposed the man to serious risk, and would not be able to recruit agents in future. He said it was naive to think that vital information necessary to protect the public would always come from ""individuals living within the law"".

"Sales of alcohol and tobacco were the main driver behind a surprise rise in overall UK retail sales in April. Despite the rising cost of living hitting household budgets, sales volumes jumped 1.4% last month, following a fall of 1.2% in March. However, official figures revealed a longer downward trend of sales overall. The Office for National Statistics said off-licences saw a boost in sales last month, which it suggested meant people were staying in to save money. Danni Hewson, a financial analyst for AJ Bell, said the ""big uptick"" in food and drink spending in supermarkets ""might indicate that people are choosing their kitchen tables over pubs and restaurants as they look to save money"". ""Whilst food spend has been largely unchanged, which suggests people are still being cautious, spend on alcohol and tobacco has soared,"" she added. ""Life's little luxuries... will have to come in under budget as those budgets are tested."" M&S warns online sales tax will damage High Street Energy bills push price rises to 40-year high Experts had expected sales in April to fall further as consumers cut back in the face of rising living costs. Earlier this week, the latest official figures showed inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9% in the 12 months to April - the highest rate for 40 years. April saw the first impact of the latest jump in energy costs, with millions of people facing an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase in bills. However, prices have been rising for months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and the Ukraine war, while wages have been failing to keep pace. The rate of inflation is expected to continue to rise this year. The ONS has previously said that people had begun to cut back on spending and use their cars less due to record petrol and diesel prices. Over the three months to the end of April, sales overall edged down by 0.3%, which revealed a longer downward trend, the ONS said. However, while sales volumes at non-food stores were down in April, online sales rose by 3.7% and the proportion of retail sales online remained substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, said Heather Bovill of the ONS. ""Clothing sales had a strong month especially online, with some retailers suggesting consumers were purchasing clothes for summer holidays and weddings,"" she said. AJ Bell's Ms Hewson said summer would be the time for ""postponed events and much anticipated holidays"". ""After a couple of years where only the top half was visible to most of the world people are updating their wardrobes,"" she added. But she warned the boost might be short-lived, saying: ""People can only spend a pound once and when that pound is worth significantly less than a year ago people have to make choices."" Surveys also suggest consumer confidence has taken a hit. The long-running GfK consumer confidence index fell by two points in May to -40, the lowest score since the survey began in 1974. GfK's Joe Staton said May's result was one point lower than the previous record set in July 2008. ""This means consumer confidence is now weaker than in the darkest days of the global banking crisis, the impact of Brexit on the economy, or the Covid shutdown,"" he said. However, Nicholas Farr, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said April's rise in retail sales suggested the higher cost of living had not caused consumer spending to collapse and meant ""the economy may have a little more momentum than we thought"". He added that rising inflation could not be solved without the Bank of England having to increase interest rates further. The Bank's response to rising prices has been to raise interest rates to try and cool them. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend which dampens demand. However, it has has faced criticism from MPs for not doing enough to tackle the crisis. This week Bank governor Andrew Bailey defended its response,insisting inflation was being driven by global forces that limited what the Bank could do.

"Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said another 11 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in the UK. The new cases come on top of the nine already identified in the country. Mr Javid said ""most cases"" are mild. He has now updated G7 health ministers on the spread of the virus, which has been detected in nine other countries outside Central and West Africa. He said the UK was stocking up on smallpox vaccines to help guard against monkeypox. ""I can confirm we have procured further doses,"" he said. A smallpox jab offers some good protection against monkeypox since the two viruses are quite similar. The World Health Organization is convening an emergency meeting with experts about the spread. Dr Hans Henri Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, is concerned that transmission could accelerate as countries enter the summer ""festival"" season. Cases of the disease outside Central and West Africa are rare, but some have been occurring recently in Europe, USA, Canada and Australia. It is not clear how much vaccine stock has been bought by the UK, or how many jabs might be given. Reports say Spain is preparing to order thousands of doses of smallpox vaccine to use against monkeypox. Even without a vaccine, most cases clear up on their own within a few weeks. Severe cases sometimes can occur though. The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to Central or West Africa, but some of the cases that have been occurring outside these countries have had no travel link. It does not spread easily between people, but it can be spread through: touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs the coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages - a bit like chicken pox - before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Read moreabout the virus here. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says the risk to the public remains very low. Anyone with concerns that they could be infected should see a health professional, but make contact with the clinic or surgery ahead of a visit. NHS 111 can also give advice. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UKHSA said ""a notable proportion"" of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men ""so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned"". Her colleague, Prof Kevin Fenton, said: ""We are asking everybody to be aware of the signs and symptoms, which include rashes around the mouth as well as around the genital area."" TheImvanex smallpox vaccine,externalis about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox, studies suggest. Vaccination after a monkeypox exposure may help prevent the disease or make it less severe. Vaccines work by teaching the immune system how to defend itself against a disease. Routine smallpox vaccination ended in the 1970s in Britain, around the time the disease was eradicated, meaning many people have not got any protection or immune memory against these types of viruses.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty are estimated to be worth Â£730m Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty have made the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK's wealthiest 250 people for the first time. Their joint Â£730m fortune ranks them at 222 of thepaper's annual list,external. Recently, Ms Murty's tax affairs came under scrutiny after it was revealed she had ""non-dom"" status - meaning she did not pay UK tax on overseas income. Ms Murty, the daughter of an Indian IT billionaire, lateragreed to pay UK taxes on all her earnings. Her 0.9% stake in her father Narayana Murty's IT company Infosys, estimated to be worth around Â£690m, earned her Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. It is estimated her use of non-dom status could have saved her Â£20m in taxes. The Sunday Times said the couple had made their first appearance on the Rich List now because it was only able to confirm Ms Murty's stake in her father's business over the last year. Mr Sunak was later cleared of breaching the ministerial code after referring himself to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's standards adviser to check if he had properly declared all his interests. Labour pledges to replace non-dom tax status What we know about the Sunak familyâs wealth What is a non-dom? A ""non-dom"" tax designation, short for ""non-domiciled individual"", is a term used for a UK resident whose permanent home, or domicile, is outside the UK. Someone with the status only pays UK tax on money earned in the UK, but does not have to pay any tax to the British government on money made elsewhere in the world (unless they pay that money into a UK bank account). Meanwhile, the latest ranking of the 250 richest people in Britain also revealed a record 177 billionaires in the UK this year, the Sunday Times said. Overall, the richest individuals and families in the UK this year are worth Â£711bn, an 8% rise on last year's Â£658bn. The expanding fortunes of Britain's wealthiest people comes amid a growing cost of living crisis, with UK inflation rising sharply to 9% in the year to April - meaningprices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. In February, Mr Sunak announced a Â£9bn package of measures, including a Â£150 discount to council tax and a Â£200 loan for energy bills in the autumn, but he isunder increasing pressureto offer more support to households as energy bills and food prices continue to rise. Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the India-based conglomerate Hinduja Group, topped the list with their Â£28.47bn fortune - a growth of more than Â£11bn in a year. Entrepreneur Sir James Dyson and his family jumped to second in the rich list after a Â£6.7bn increase to Â£23bn. According to the Sunday Times, the 10 richest families and individuals in the UK, the estimated value of their fortunes and the primary source of their wealth are: Sri and Gopi Hinduja and family - Â£28.47bn (industry and finance) Sir James Dyson and family - Â£23bn (household goods and technology) David and Simon Reuben and family- Â£22.26bn (property and internet) Sir Leonard Blavatnik - Â£20bn (investment, music and media) Guillaume Pousaz- Â£19.259bn (online payments) Lakshmi Mittal and family - Â£17bn (steel) Guy, George, Alannah and Galen Weston and family - Â£13.5bn (retailing) Kirsten and Jorn Rausing - Â£12bn (inheritance and investment) Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken and Michel de Carvalho - Â£11.42bn (inheritance, brewing and banking) Michael Platt - Â£10bn Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich's ranking dropped sharply after being sanctioned over the Ukraine war However, Chelsea owner and Russian steel magnate Roman Abramovich's wealth halved in a year to Â£6bn - dropping him 20 places from his 2021 ranking to 28th on this year's rich list. The oligarch is the biggest loser of all in this year's Rich List, the Sunday Times said. The plummet in Mr Abramovich's fortunes followed his being sanctioned over the war in Ukraine, the enforced sale of Chelsea and the sharp fall in his shares in steel company Evraz. The premier league club is expected to be sold in late May, afterÂ£4.25bn deal to purchase it was agreedwith a consortium led by American businessmen Todd Boehly. Another notable billionaire with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin whose fortunes have suffered since sanctions were imposed, if not so dramatically, is Uzbek-born Russian oil oligarch Alisher Usmanov. His estimated worth dropped by Â£3bn to Â£10bn, falling from sixth to 11th place. Update 30th August: We have removed Christoph Henkel and family from the top 10 after the Sunday Times issued a clarification advising that they changed their assessment of the Henkel's wealth since the publication of the Rich List in May 2022.

"Joe Biden alongside Sweden's Magdalena Andersson and Finland's Sauli Niinisto on Thursday Sweden and Finland have the ""full, total and complete backing"" of the US in their decision to apply for Nato membership, President Joe Biden says. Both countries submitted their applications to be part of the Western defence alliance this week, marking a major shift in European geopolitics. To join the alliance, the two nations need the support of all 30 Nato member states. But the move by the Nordic nations has been opposed by Turkey. Speaking alongside Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinisto at the White House on Thursday, Mr Biden called Sweden and Finland's applications ""a watershed moment in European security"". ""New members joining Nato is not a threat to any nation,"" he said. The president added that having two new members in the ""high north"" would ""enhance the security of our allies and deepen our security co-operation across the board"". Russia has repeatedly said it sees Nato as a threat and has warned of ""consequences"" if the block proceeds with its expansion plans. NATO:How do you join? MARIUPOL:'I hid below ground at steelworks for 60 days' ANALYSIS:The spy war within the war READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Turkey has accused both Sweden and Finland of hosting suspected militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation. However, both Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and British Defence Minister Ben Wallace have expressed confidence that these concerns will eventually be addressed. Mr Biden's comments came as the US Senate voted to approve a new $40bn (Â£32bn) bill to provide military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. It is the biggest emergency aid package so far for Ukraine. The bill - which was passed by the House of Representatives with broad bipartisan support on 10 May - was expected to be passed earlier this week, but was blocked by Kentucky Republican Rand Paul over a dispute about spending oversight. But the Republican's Senate leader Mitch McConnell dismissed these concerns and told reporters that Congress had a ""moral responsibility"" to support ""a sovereign democracy's self-defence"". ""Anyone concerned about the cost of supporting a Ukrainian victory should consider the much larger cost should Ukraine lose,"" Mr McConnell said. Last week, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Congress to approve the package and warned that the US military only had enough funds to send weapons to Kyiv until 19 May. This video can not be played From May: Sweden and Finland formally submit Nato applications Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the aid package as ""a significant US contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"". The package brings the total US aid delivered to Ukraine to more than $50bn, including $6bn for security assistance such as training, equipment, weapons and support. Another $8.7bn will be allocated to replenish stocks of US equipment already sent to Ukraine. What is Nato and which countries are members?

"Polandâs president has given the first address in person by a foreign leader to the Ukrainian parliament since the Russian invasion began Andrzej Duda received a standing ovation after he declared that only Ukrainians themselves could decide their future Earlier, the Ukrainian government said Kyiv would not agree a ceasefire deal with Moscow that involved giving away any territory Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, said making concessions would result in Moscow starting an even larger, more bloody offensive in the longer term Russian forces have continued their attacks on the eastern Donbas region following their capture of Mariupol They are said to have made limited advances towards Severodonetsk â where it is thought they are planning a new siege Edited by Ben Tobias We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for a few hours. We'll be back on Monday morning Ukraine time. You can find all our most recent coverage of the war on our website. The Polish leader was given a standing ovation for his address in Ukraine's parliament Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a snapshot of the day's headlines. Oleksandr Zinchenko draped the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy After winning the English Premier League title for the fourth time with his club Manchester City, Ukrainian footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko has said he found it hard to even think about football after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Speaking to Sky Sports after draping the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy, an emotional Zinchenko called it an unforgettable moment. ""I'm so proud to be Ukrainian,"" he said. ""I would love to one day bring this title to Ukraine, for all Ukrainian people, because they deserve it."" Zinchenko said the time since the invasion began was the ""toughest period in my life"". In an interview with BBC Sport's Gary Linekersoon after the start of the war, the Manchester City defender said he could not count the number of times he had cried since Russia's invasion began. Lithuania is no longer importing energy from Russia as of today. Its energy minister said purchases of gas, oil and electricity from Moscow were stopping to show ""solidarity"" with Ukraine - and to cut funding for the ""Russian war machine"". He hoped electricity demands could be met through local green energy production instead. Lithuania, a former Soviet state and a Nato member, is a strong ally of Ukraine. Despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to provide fuel to many European countries. However, Finland's gas supply was cut off yesterday after it refused Moscow's demand to pay in roubles. The port city's been largely destroyed by Russian shelling People are being deported from Mariupol to other Russian-held territory at a faster and faster rate, according to a mayoral adviser in the fallen port city. Petro Andryushchenko wrote on the Telegram app that 313 Mariupol residents were taken away to a so-called ""filtration camp"" in Russian-occupied Bezimenne on Saturday. 55 of them were children. Andryushchenko said many of those being taken to camps were later being sent to Russia itself. The BBC has not been able confirmed the claims, and Russia has previously denied any forced deportations. Mariupol is now under total Russian control after its last defenders surrendered at an industrial plant on Friday. New pictures from the Reuters news agency have given a flavour of life for Ukraine's military personnel. Soldiers are seen performing exercises or taking breaks. The photos were taken in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east - the focus of fierce fighting. An update now on Andriy Shevchyk, the man installed by Russia as the mayor of occupied Enerhodar. Shevchyk is now in intensive care after being injured in an explosion, Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news agency reports. No further details were available. Earlier we reported thatShevchyk and his bodyguards were hurtin what appeared to be a ""precise and targeted attack"", according to the city's elected mayor - who was ousted from power by the Russians. James FitzGeraldBBC News The Luhansk regional governor blamed Russian 'orcs' for destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk The governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region has accused Russian ""orcs"" of destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, amid fierce fighting in the area. Serhiy Haidai is just the latest Ukrainian official to compare Russian troops to a type of mythical monster popularised by JRR
Tolkienâs book The Lord of the Rings. In the epic novel, orcs are seen as âbrutal, aggressive
and chaoticâ says Ostap Slyvynsky, an associate
professor at Lviv University specialising in the literature of east-central
Europe. Some Ukrainians even call Russia itself
âMordorâ â alluding to a dark land in Tolkienâs fantasy. The images give Ukrainians an easy-to-understand metaphor for what's going on in real life. ""The fantasy world has a
very clear accent on what is good and what is bad,"" Slyvynsky explains. âThese terms are kind of euphemisms,â he adds. âIt is better to call Russians âorcsâ than more vulgar words.â The trend emerged some time after 2014 - the year Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed
separatists seized parts of the eastern Donbas region. As for the Russians: they've been labelling Ukrainians âelvesâ - another Tolkien allusion - in the belief that those fictional beings embody weakness, Slyvynsky says. Adam EastonReporting from Warsaw The Polish president has delivered a message of strong support for Ukraine during the first address in person by a foreign leader to the parliament in Kyiv since the Russian invasion began. During his speech Andrzej Duda thanked Ukraine for defending Europe against what he called âRussian imperialismâ. âThe free worldâ, he said, âhas the face of Ukraineâ. Duda said recent calls for Kyiv to negotiate with President Putin, and even give into some of his demands, were disturbing. No decisions about your future will be made without you, he said. Poland has been one of Ukraineâs staunchest supporters, taking in millions of refugees fleeing the fighting and sending tanks and rocket launchers to the Ukrainian military. Duda, who received a standing ovation after his speech, said Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the European Union. An exhibition of destroyed Russian tanks is proving popular with the public in Kyiv. The vehicles have gone on show at Mykhailivska Square. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine have met in Kyiv today Polish citizens living in Ukraine are to be
granted the same rights that Ukrainian refugees in Poland are
currently receiving. Ukraine's President Zelensky announced the plan during a visit from his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. A bill will be tabled in parliament to make the changes happen. Poland has granted the right to live, work and claim
social security payments to more than three million Ukrainian refugees
who've fled Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian parliament has passed a bill banning symbols of the Russian invasion, including those containing the letters Z and V, MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram. Zheleznyak noted that the document included President Zelensky's proposals, which he submitted when he vetoed the previous draft law passed on 14 April. The new version of the law widens the range of cases when the display of the symbols is allowed, namely in museums, libraries, scientific works, textbooks and so on, according to our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. The new bill, however, bans the creation of NGOs which use Russian war symbols and whose activities are aimed at spreading war propaganda and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The letters ""Z"" and ""V"", which don't exist in the Russian alphabet, have been widely used to symbolise support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They are used to mark Russian military vehicles on the battlefield. A bid by Ukraine to join the EU could not be finalised for ""15 or 20 years,"" France's minister for European affairs has said. Speaking on Radio J in Paris, Clement Beaune said: ""We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you're lying. ""It's probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time."" His comments poured cold water on Volodymyr Zelensky's hopes for expedited entry to the bloc in the wake of Russia's invasion. Beaune repeated French President Emmanuel Macron's offer to create a looser ""European political community"" that could help integrate Ukraine sooner, adding: ""I don't want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies."" Zelensky has turned down what he called ""such compromises"" and insisted on an immediate start of the process towards full EU membership. Beaune said Macron's proposal is not ""an alternative to joining the European political community"", emphasising: ""It doesn't prevent membership later on."" Ukraine's aspirations to join the EU and Nato are seen as the main reason Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. Macron's European political community initiative is due to be debated at an EU summit in June. Ukraine has extended martial law for three months until 23 August. President Volodymyr Zelensky first signed the decree, along with a general military mobilisation call, on 24 February and since then has extended it for a month on two occasions. Today, Ukraine's parliament voted by an absolute majority for a third extension as Russia continues to focus its offensive on the eastern Donbas region. Zelensky's representative at the Constitutional Court, Fedir Venislavskyy, said the decision to extend it for 90 days this time is because a ""counter-offensive takes more time than defence"". Poland's President Andrzej Duda meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv If you're just joining us, here's a look at the main news from the war in Ukraine so far today: Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukraine remains vulnerable to aerial strikes Military and financial support from Western
countries is increasingly making a difference. At the start of the war, President Zelensky was saying they
needed more and they needed it faster. But his position has gradually shifted, to acknowledge that the Ukrainians are getting the support they need with the urgency they
need. The big missing piece in the puzzle is still air defences. A statement yesterday from the Russians
- saying theyâd destroyed a big shipment of military aid â shows Ukraine is
still not getting the latest in air defence systems. On every other front, I think the support is starting to
come through. Iâve seen modern Western equipment being sent to the front lines. They are always going to need more though, especially
given the increased Russian pushes weâve been seeing. Andriy Shevchyk, a mayor installed by Russia in the occupied city of Enerhodar, has reportedly been injured in an explosion. The city's elected mayor Dmytro Orlov - who is currently in nearby Zaporizhzhia - wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Shevchyk and his bodyguards had been taken to hospital after being wounded. Orlov noted that the circumstances were still being established. He added that nobody else had been hurt in the blast - suggesting this had been a ""precise and targeted attack"". There was no immediate comment from the Russian side. Enerhodar, a city of about 50,000 people which serves Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine embraced in the chamber earlier today ""Only Ukraine has the right to
decide its future"", the Polish president has said in a speech to the Ukrainian parliament. Andrzej Duda said ""worrying voices"" were suggesting Ukraine should give in to Russia's President Putin, according to comments quoted by the Reuters news agency. He told lawmakers that those voices should not be heeded - because ceding even an inch of Ukrainian territory would be a blow to the whole West. Duda also reportedly stressed that Poland supported Ukraine in its bid to gain full membership of the European Union - a matter on which EU countries have not reached a consensus. He was the first foreign leader to give an in-person speech to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia invaded on 24 February. Photos posted on Twitter by Duda's office showed him receiving a standing ovation in parliament and embracing Zelensky. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia attacked Ukrainian forces with airstrikes and artillery in the east and the south, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, according to an update from the Russian defence ministry. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points, 13 areas where troops and Ukrainian military equipment were amassed, as well as four ammunition depots in the Donbas region, the Reuters news agency reported. In Ukraine's southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets hit a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, around 100km northeast of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said. The BBC has not been able to confirm this independently. Authorities in Ukraine's south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region have reported civilian injuries - following Russian missile strikes on a village. Explosions were said to have woken people up in the middle of the night. Emergency workers attended the scene, the regional administration posted on the Telegram messaging app. Â© 2025 BBC.

"MicheÃ¡l Martin said he had always been critical of any moves to ""collapse the assembly"" The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) cannot be allowed to block the Northern Ireland Assembly the Irish PM has said. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin has met the main Stormont parties to discuss the Northern Ireland Protocol and the assembly crisis. The DUP is refusing to return to power-sharing unless its issues with the protocol are resolved. Mr Martin said those issues can be resolved, but only in a negotiated settlement between the UK and EU. The assembly is not sitting afterthe DUP refused to support the election of a new Speakerfollowing the election on 5 May as part of its ongoing protest against the protocol. The party took the action as part of its ongoing protest over thepost-Brexit trade arrangement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. Without the election of a new Speaker, assembly members (MLAs) cannot take their seats at Stormont. After his meetings, Mr Martin said all parties had indicated a ""desire"" to have the assembly running and an executive formed. ""It's my view, that after any election in any democratic part of the world, the natural follow-on is the convening of the parliament that has been elected by the people,"" he said. The taoiseach said he accepted there are some issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol, but said they could only be resolved with ""substantive, serious negotiations between the European Union and the UK government"". Referring to the DUP, Mr Martin said the party was willing to take up the post of deputy first minister in any new executive, but their issues with the protocol were preventing that happening. Mr Martin added that ""the assembly and the executive should operate in parallel with the UK government and the EU in the context of substantive negotiation to resolve issues with the protocol"". The SDLP said it had a ""good"" chat with the taoiseach It is the first time the DUP leader, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood, have met the taoiseach in personsince the assembly election. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party and the taoiseach both agreed the assembly and the executive needs to formed immediately. He said: ""People have real priorities out there. The cost of living crisis is crippling families all across the north - we know the number of people who are on health waiting lists - and Jeffrey Dondaldson is playing a political game about an issue he cant resolve. ""Playing these sorts of games will not sort anybody's problems out, so it's over to Jeffrey Donaldson now. ""He can sit back and let the pressure build on him if he wants. My view is we should be sitting down together, working on the people's priorities."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney also met on Friday. Following the meeting, Mr Coveney tweeted that he had ""made clear"" to Ms Truss ""Ireland's opposition to the UK breaching international law"". ""The UK needs to get back to talks with the EU,"" he added. It comes as the US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the protocol must remain. Mrs Pelosi said the UK government's suggestion it could act unilaterally to change the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland was deeply concerning and could negatively affect the Good Friday Agreement. Responding to Mrs Pelosi, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it was ""absolutely evident"" that the protocol was undermining the agreement. ""It has made it impossible to have power-sharing on the basis of consensus,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster. ""If Nancy Pelosi wants to see the agreement protected then she needs to recognise that in fact it's the protocol that is harming and undermining the agreement and that's why we have to deal with it."" UUP leader Doug Beattie said Mrs Pelosi's comments ""are not just deeply regrettable and misinformed, but are completely wrong"". He told the BBC's Talkback programme the comments ""would harden people's positions"" . ""It is more negative than positive, I think we all have to watch our language in regards to these negotiations, but what we do need to do is make sure we keep negotiating,"" he said. Mr Beatie said he would support the UK government changing the rules to allow an assembly Speaker to be elected. Under existing rules, both unionists and nationalists must agree to a Speaker, which is why the DUP have been able to stall the process. Michelle O'Neill said it was important for MicheÃ¡l Martin to assert his role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement Ahead of his meeting with the taoiseach, Sir Jeffrey said ""the unionist viewpoint can no longer be ignored"". In a statement, Sir Jeffrey added that power-sharing ""only works with the consent of unionists and nationalists"" and while he wanted to see Stormont's political institutions working fully, that could only happen by ""building consensus"". Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said Mr Martin had ""a very significant role in terms of being the co-guarantor"" of the Good Friday Agreement and it was important for him to ""assert"" that role at a time when ""democracy is being denied"". She said the DUP was ""holding up progress"" and it was ""unacceptable"" that money could not be put into the pockets of people to deal with a cost of living crisis because there was no executive. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem On Thursday, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said she had a ""good conversation"" with Mr Martin. She said the EU and Ireland were on ""the same page"" when it came to the protocol and they agreed ""international agreements cannot be disapplied unilaterally"". Mr Martin also held an hour-long video call with Alliance Party leader Naomi Long on Thursday. Earlier this week he met Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill in Dublin, ahead ofPrime Minister Boris Johnson's visit to Belfast. On Friday, Ms O'Neillmet with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon,externalin Edinburgh, to discuss what she called ""a number of shared priorities"", as well as the political developments at Stormont.

"Sales of alcohol and tobacco were the main driver behind a surprise rise in overall UK retail sales in April. Despite the rising cost of living hitting household budgets, sales volumes jumped 1.4% last month, following a fall of 1.2% in March. However, official figures revealed a longer downward trend of sales overall. The Office for National Statistics said off-licences saw a boost in sales last month, which it suggested meant people were staying in to save money. Danni Hewson, a financial analyst for AJ Bell, said the ""big uptick"" in food and drink spending in supermarkets ""might indicate that people are choosing their kitchen tables over pubs and restaurants as they look to save money"". ""Whilst food spend has been largely unchanged, which suggests people are still being cautious, spend on alcohol and tobacco has soared,"" she added. ""Life's little luxuries... will have to come in under budget as those budgets are tested."" M&S warns online sales tax will damage High Street Energy bills push price rises to 40-year high Experts had expected sales in April to fall further as consumers cut back in the face of rising living costs. Earlier this week, the latest official figures showed inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9% in the 12 months to April - the highest rate for 40 years. April saw the first impact of the latest jump in energy costs, with millions of people facing an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase in bills. However, prices have been rising for months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and the Ukraine war, while wages have been failing to keep pace. The rate of inflation is expected to continue to rise this year. The ONS has previously said that people had begun to cut back on spending and use their cars less due to record petrol and diesel prices. Over the three months to the end of April, sales overall edged down by 0.3%, which revealed a longer downward trend, the ONS said. However, while sales volumes at non-food stores were down in April, online sales rose by 3.7% and the proportion of retail sales online remained substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, said Heather Bovill of the ONS. ""Clothing sales had a strong month especially online, with some retailers suggesting consumers were purchasing clothes for summer holidays and weddings,"" she said. AJ Bell's Ms Hewson said summer would be the time for ""postponed events and much anticipated holidays"". ""After a couple of years where only the top half was visible to most of the world people are updating their wardrobes,"" she added. But she warned the boost might be short-lived, saying: ""People can only spend a pound once and when that pound is worth significantly less than a year ago people have to make choices."" Surveys also suggest consumer confidence has taken a hit. The long-running GfK consumer confidence index fell by two points in May to -40, the lowest score since the survey began in 1974. GfK's Joe Staton said May's result was one point lower than the previous record set in July 2008. ""This means consumer confidence is now weaker than in the darkest days of the global banking crisis, the impact of Brexit on the economy, or the Covid shutdown,"" he said. However, Nicholas Farr, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said April's rise in retail sales suggested the higher cost of living had not caused consumer spending to collapse and meant ""the economy may have a little more momentum than we thought"". He added that rising inflation could not be solved without the Bank of England having to increase interest rates further. The Bank's response to rising prices has been to raise interest rates to try and cool them. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend which dampens demand. However, it has has faced criticism from MPs for not doing enough to tackle the crisis. This week Bank governor Andrew Bailey defended its response,insisting inflation was being driven by global forces that limited what the Bank could do.

"Milton Keynes applied for city status on three previous occasions A council said it was ""thrilled"" that Milton Keynes has finally won city status at the fourth attempt. The civic honour has been granted toeight places in the UK to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Milton Keynesapplied for city status,externalin 2000, in 2002 for the Golden Jubilee - and in 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee. ""People have always said that Milton Keynes looks like a city, feels like a city and now we can say, it is a city,"" said council leader Peter Marland. ""We're thrilled with the news which validates how important Milton Keynes has become to the regional and national economies. ""City status will make people even prouder to call Milton Keynes their home and gives us the platform to make our great city even greater. ""It also reflects how passionate our communities are and I'm grateful to everyone who backed and contributed to the bid."" The new town of Milton Keynes was built around a small village of the same name The Cabinet Office said the town was the ""pinnacle of the national post-war planning movement, rebuilding the nation and accommodating its growing population"". ThePlatinum Jubilee Civic Honours Competition,externalasked applicants to demonstrate how their unique communities and distinct local identity meant they deserved to be awarded city status. They were also required to highlight their royal associations and cultural heritage. Town to submit fourth bid for city status Milton Keynes' fourth bid for city status, which used adelivery robotto send the documents, cited its 27 conservation areas, 50 scheduled monuments, 1,100 listed buildings and 270 pieces of public art. The concrete cows, created by the Canadian artist Liz Leyh in 1978, became a symbol of Milton Keynes In January 1967, plans for a new town were approved - and soon a quiet Buckinghamshire village became the vast development of Milton Keynes. Then housing minister Anthony Greenwood granted permission to transform an 8,850-hectare area of villages and farmland into a town for 250,000 people. It was a grand vision - part of the third and final phase of the government's plans to relocate populations from London and other cities that suffered immense bomb damage during World War Two. Some five decades on, Milton Keynes has a population of about 280,000, has become home to more than 10,000 businesses and is used as a model for new towns across the world. It is home to the distance-learning institution, the Open University, which was established by Royal Charter in 1969 and is the largest university in the UK in terms of students enrolled. Bletchley Park, the hub of code-breaking in World War Two, is part of the Milton Keynes district The Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust established the nation's first independent medical school, and Milton Keynes was the first place to introduce kerbside recycling in the UK. It is also home to the UK's first advanced waste treatment facility, which produces renewable energy for thousands of homes and businesses and has the nation's largest network of electric vehicle charge points. Today, 140 languages are spoken in Milton Keynes' schools including those of every Commonwealth nation, and 30 religions are observed, the bid said. The town also claims to have a higher number of volunteers per head of population than any other UK city, with 84,500 citizens regularly volunteering. The mayor of Milton Keynes, Conservative councillor Amanda Marlow, who was part of the bid team, said she found out on Wednesday, just before she was accepted as the new mayor, and made her acceptance speech knowing that this ""immense news was around the corner"". ""I sat at my desk looking at my iPad and very happy tears rolled down my face because this has been months of hard work and it's been a dream that I've had for such a long time,"" she said. ""To see the place that I love finally get the city status that it deserves just means everything."" The mayor of Milton Keynes, councillor Amanda Marlow, said the city was a ""positive and forward-thinking place"" After three previously unsuccessful bids, Ms Marlow thinks it was this bid showing ""the heart of Milton Keynes"" that finally got it over the line. ""I think it encapsulates everything - that [it] is such a positive and forward-thinking place,"" she said. ""We are now going [to go] further forwards in terms of innovation, inward investment - it's going to bring more business here. ""People are going to finally see what we've been saying for years - that Milton Keynes is a fantastic place to live, to work, to raise a family - it's everything."" The director of Milton Keynes Museum, Bill Griffiths MBE, said it was ""great news"" and something the new town's original planners always wanted. ""If you go back right to the first goal - one of them was 'the creation of an attractive city',"" he said. ""That's what they wanted to produce and I think this is just an indication that we've gone further along that journey."" Melanie Beck MBE, chief executive of My Milton Keynes said there was ""real civic pride"" in the city Melanie Beck MBE, chief executive of My Milton Keynes, which is the city's Business Improvement District organisation, said it was ""such tremendous news"". ""It was such an inclusive bid we sent in. The local population were involved, we in business were involved, every sector gave their views about being a city,"" she said. ""It puts us in a different league alongside big conurbations like Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester, it gives us the opportunity to act like them, look forward for new investment, [and] really be aggressive about our stature in that playing field."" She added there was ""real civic pride"" in the city. ""We get quite upset if people diss our city and call it a concrete carbuncle... we are so much more than that,"" she said. Not everyone had such glowing praise for Milton Keynes's elevation to city status. Resident Peter Navan, who moved from London about 10 years ago, said he did not think Milton Keynes felt like a city Resident Peter Navan, who moved from London to the new town about 10 years ago, said he did not think it should be a city and that the decision was ""a mistake"". ""If you want to get around at night, everything shuts down,"" he said. Mr Navan said the ""honest truth"" was that he wished he had stayed in London ""because it's better"". However, Chloe Brooks, 27, who lives and works in Milton Keynes, said she was ""really happy"" about the news. ""I've lived here for a long time and to me it feels like a city,"" she said. ""It might bring more people to Milton Keynes, maybe it will bring bigger companies here? ""But Milton Keynes is a great place to live. ""The best thing for me is that you can get anywhere in a really short space of time, there's everything you need, you can go shopping, cinema, ice skating, there's loads to do here."" Chloe Brooks (left) and Dani Ward said they felt it had ""always been a city"" Her friend, Dani Ward, 23, agreed that she ""feels like it's always been a city"". ""I think it's going to be really good for us - I think it's going to make everything more busy and that's a good thing,"" she said. Tony Oyakhire, moved to the city from Peterborough in 1997 and lives in Newport Pagnell. On hearing the news, he said ""it's about time, we've been going for this for a quite some time and this was our season for it to happen in the Queen's jubilee"". ""I've seen the diversity, I've seen the development and forward-looking nature of the city; I'm very, very delighted."" Tony Oyakhire said now that Milton Keynes was a city he would like to see ""a local university that our children can go to"" In 2007, he co-founded SieveMK, an education charity that aims to get children ""out of the streets into education and then into employment"" he said. He believed the new status ""will make a difference - we want to bring investment into our city, we want to grow our city and we want to establish our own university [with a campus], which is in the pipeline"". Scott Jones said the ""growth of Milton Keynes has been incredible, it's just continued to grow every day"" ""Finally!"" Those were the words of Scott Jones, who runs 123 Internet Group, which has been in the city for more than 10 years. He is also the vice-president of Northamptonshire and Milton Keynes Chamber of Commerce. ""This has been a long time coming and it's a real stamp of approval for Milton Keynes,"" he said. ""The community here is incredible, over 30 religions and over 100 languages spoken - it's such a great place. He said it was ""very unique, with the road links and the grid system. It's going to be really positive for tourism."" He highlighted the city as being the home ofautonomous car testingand many big companies. ""The city was built for this reason it's a perfect set up for business, testing and technology and everything else.""

"Named one of eight towns to be made cities to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, Colchester will follow Southend-on-Sea and Chelmsford in gaining city status Thanks to the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder, Colchester - then called Camulodunum - became Britain's first recorded settlement, and later its first city and capital. Although its chances of ever ousting London as the capital city remain extremely slim, it has emerged it is to become a city once again. Just over a decade ago, Essex - despite being the seventh largest county in England - did not have a single city. It will soon have three. Namedone of eight towns to be made citiesto mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, Colchester will follow Southend-on-Sea and Chelmsford in gaining city status. What does city status mean to those who live and work in the town? Andrew Bagley says he hopes city status will bring greater prosperity to Colchester ""I think it is great - it was a city under the Romans so it will continue the tradition really,"" says Andrew Bagley. ""I think when somewhere gets city status it brings more prosperity to the area and I think everybody could do with a bit of that at the moment. ""I hope they promote the city as much as possible to bring in investment for the people."" Leana Schuck, 25, was delighted by the city status news ""It is wonderful,"" says nurse Leana Schuck, 25, who is originally from the Philippines. ""It is very good news for everyone in the town. ""Even though I am not a British national I am very happy for this town."" ""I know we've been going for it for quite a while so I didn't think it would actually happen,"" says Jack Singleton ""I'm surprised,"" says Jack Singleton, 22, who did not know about the city status news until the BBC told him. ""I know we've been going for it for quite a while, so I didn't think it would actually happen. ""So I am quite surprised to see it actually. I like it - that is good news."" Businesswoman Victoria Johnson says she is ""euphoric"" at the news Victoria Johnson is owner of the interior design firm Dear Grace. She says she is ""euphoric"" at the news. ""I am beyond happy as it is so well deserved for the town, everyone who works and lives here, it is amazing,"" she says. ""It opens up a lot of opportunities. It attracts more tourism and there are businesses that, when they are looking for headquarters, will only look at cities. ""It will transform Colchester."" ""The campaign for city status has been on and off over many years,"" says Irene Kettle, former editor of the Colchester Gazette and Essex County Standard. ""This is about civic pride - there are so many reasons to be proud of Colchester and that Her Majesty has chosen this very, very special moment to recognise the wonderful city of Colchester is very special for us all. ""I think the time is right and the Queen has chosen to make us part of her Platinum Jubilee. ""I've been walking around with my fingers crossed for about seven months."" Steve Mannix, chief executive at the Colchester Mercury Theatre, says city status is a ""great honour"" Steve Mannix, chief executive at the Colchester Mercury Theatre, says city status is a ""great honour"". ""I think people should be delighted,"" he says. ""All comes to he who waits. ""It puts us on a par with other places in the country, such as Chester and York."" Colchester has various claims to fame, including: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, the well-known nursery rhyme, was written in the attic of a house in the Dutch Quarter by Jane Taylor in 1806 It has the remains of the onlyRoman chariot racing track in the UK The oldest-knownhot cross bun was baked there for Good Friday in 1807 In AD60 Queen Boudicca of the Iceni tribe raised a huge army and burned down the Roman towns of Colchester and London before heading north to St Albans The town gives its name to Colchester native oysters, which, despite the name, are actually harvested from the shallow creeks off nearby Mersea Island The Roman wall can still be found in various parts of Colchester The council's city status bid highlighted Colchester's long and varied history, its growth into an important regional centre, its strong royal and military links and its artistic and cultural offer. Colchester's Conservative MP Will Quince said: ""I am absolutely delighted that the UK's first Roman city has become the UK's newest city as part of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. ""When the Romans arrived in Britain, Colchester was their first destination to create a garrison which became known as the City of the Victorious. ""City status will mean that our dynamic economy, nationally recognised award-winning cultural and heritage assets and internationally renowned university can reach new heights. ""We can all share pride in this honour."" Colchester United Football Club chairman, Robbie Cowling, says it is ""only fitting"" that Colchester should be a city as well as Southend Colchester United Football Club chairman, Robbie Cowling, says he is ""delighted for the city"". ""Colchester is one of the fastest growing towns in the country, so hopefully it is going to attract more business,"" he says. ""As I know from the football side, we've got a really big rivalry with Southend and they'verecently become a city, so I think it's only fitting that Colchester should be one too."" BBC Essex breakfast presenter Sonia Watson was born and bred in Colchester and said the news would come as a ""brilliant surprise"" to people in the town ""I've never lived anywhere else and I am really excited to see what opportunities come from it,"" saysBBC Essex breakfast presenter Sonia Watson. ""I think many people hoped it would happen, but I think it will come as a brilliant surprise because we have missed out on a few previous occasions. ""Quite rightlySouthend has been awarded city statusso I reckon a number of people may have wondered whether Essex would ever get a third city.

"What HS2 trains could look like when they go into service from the end of the decade Wales should get its ""fair share"" of cash from building the HS2 high speed rail project in England, the Conservatives' Senedd leader has said.

Rail boss wants equivalent HS2 funding for Wales Huge challenge for Tories - Welsh deputy chairman While the Scottish Tories are more independent from the rest of the Conservative party, the Welsh part of the organisation is not, and does not have a Welsh figurehead. Andrew RT Davies is one of three senior figures in Wales, with Welsh Secretary Simon Hart, and the party's Welsh chairman Glyn Davies. Andrew RT Davies said his party should develop a distinctive Welsh identity Speaking at the Welsh Conservative conference in Newtown, Powys, Mr Davies said: ""We need to continue to build on the Welsh Conservative brand and build our own identity as a proud Welsh party. ""Proudly British, proudly Conservative, we need to be promoting what we do in Westminster but standing strong and tall in the Welsh wheat field, not bending in the wind."" ""Wales and Welshness don't belong exclusively to Labour."" The speech had intended to also focus on housing, with criticism of Welsh Labour ministers for ""building barely half the number of houses"" needed. A proposal to change planning rules and force builders to complete, rather than just begin, work on land for which they have planning permission was trailed in advance. But Mr Davies, complaining of the pages of his speech being stuck together as he spoke, missed the section out. On HS2, he said his party is ""making the case that Wales should receive its fair share of HS2 spending"". ""We believe that instead of banning roadbuilding like labour, we need to push on and build a modern and sustainable transport network of road and rail."" He also repeated his call forSt David's Day to be made a bank holiday in Wales- which the UK government has so far not supported. In his speech at the same event, Mr Johnson made light of the request. ""I salute your campaign for St David's Day - I don't know what to do with it but I will definitely salute it,"" he said. Boris Johnson - pictured on a visit to a honey factory - said his government was seeing record unemployment Mr Johnson said his government is ""delivering record low unemployment and growth"", and used the speech to announce that his government was looking to builda small modular reactor in Trawsfynydd. ""Wales will be at the heart of our mission now to fix the underlying issues in our energy market,"" he said. In an interview withNewyddion S4C,externalMr Johnson was asked five times if he would back Mr Davies call, but he refused to be drawn on whether he would support it. He said: ""It's his job as leader in Wales to lobby for funding for Wales. I used to be mayor of London - that's what you do."" Asked if he was comfortable with efforts for the party in Wales to distance itself from the rest of the UK Conservatives, he said: ""What we want to do is work together and deliver for the people of Wales."" Mr Davies's comments on HS2, amulti-billion pound schemeto create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and north of England, refer to the fact that Wales is not getting extra funding as a consequence of the building taking place in England. That is despite the fact Scotland and Northern Ireland will both receive proportional additional payments. This is because the UK government has classified HS2 as an England and Wales project, despite calls froma committee of Welsh MPsfor the project to reclassified as England only, which would enable Wales to get that extra money. Mr Davies, however,told WalesOnline,externalthat he would prefer the cash to go straight to Network Rail - which is not devolved - rather than the Welsh government. Andrew RT Davies has challenged the UK Conservative leadership over policy issues before - over his support for Brexit, his criticism of the cost of HS2 and the call for a St David's Day bank holiday. But it's clear that he and his Senedd team want to go further - especially after the recent local election drubbing - and while their initial steps at this conference are notable, they're also relatively cautious. After all, Mr Davies has already ventured into dissident territory on HS2 so another step on that particular issue is perhaps something the UK party is relaxed about. The challenge facing those trying to steer the new ""distinctive Welsh voice"" policy is in deciding when and how to push forward into new areas of divergence, perhaps even conflict, with their UK government colleagues.

"Rory McIlroy last won a major at the 2014 US PGA Championship US PGA Championship first-round leaderboard -5R McIlroy (NI);-4T Hoge (US), W Zalatoris (US);-3M Kuchar (US), A Ancer (Mex), J Thomas (US);-2M Fitzpatrick (Eng) Selected others: LevelS Lowry (Ire), R MacIntyre (Sco), T Hatton (Eng);+1S Scheffler (US), C Morikawa (US), J Rose (Eng), T Fleetwood (Eng);+3J Rahm (Spa);+4T Woods (US) Rory McIlroy got his bid to end an eight-year major drought off to a solid start as he finished day one of the US PGA Championship with a one-shot lead. Northern Ireland's four-time major champion closed with a birdie to card a five-under 65, and then watched as late starters toiled in windier conditions. Americans Tom Hoge and Will Zalatoris are McIlroy's nearest challengers on four under at Southern Hills, Oklahoma. England's Matt Fitzpatrick is also in contention after a two-under-par 68. ""Overall, it was a great day,"" said McIlroy, who is chasing a third US PGA title. ""Great to get off to a great start at a major championship for a change. ""I came in here knowing my game is in good shape so it is a matter of executing the shots you know you can - I need to replicate that and not get ahead of myself."" McIlroy was in a marquee group alongside Americans Tiger Woods, who signed for a four-over 74, and Jordan Spieth, who finished with a two-over 72. 'Staying aggressive' helped after fast start - McIlroy World number 40 Hoge, who won his first PGA Tour event at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am earlier this year, and Zalatoris also enjoyed the best of the early conditions. The wind made the course play about a shot harder in the afternoon but world number nine Justin Thomas bucked the trend, birdieing the last for a three-under 67. He sits level with Matt Kuchar and Abraham Ancer, who both completed their rounds in lighter winds. The world's three top-ranked players - Masters winner Scottie Scheffler, US Open victor Jon Rahm and Open champion Collin Morikawa - were among those who struggled in the afternoon and all finished over par. Starting from the 10th tee, McIlroy's putter was as fiery as the sweltering Tulsa heat and his nerve as cold as the staggeringly priced on-site refreshments as he made four successive birdies to wrangle the lead after six holes. The 33-year-old is looking to record a third PGA Championship win, with the second of his Wanamaker Trophy successes coming in August 2014 at Valhalla, just a few weeks after he had won his first Claret Jug at The Open. It was McIlroy's fourth major title and the great Jack Nicklaus proclaimed afterwards that the fresh-faced prospect could go on to ""win 15 or 20"" of golf's elite prizes. Eight years later and McIlroy is yet to add to that tally - instead he has 14 top-10 finishes and a runner-up place at last month's Masters. He would couch that by pointing out, as he did toBBC Radio 5 Live's All About: The Open podcast, that he has won pretty much everything else in that time, but his recent major form has been characterised by sluggish starts that have shot him out of contention. Heading into this event, McIlroy was a cumulative 35 over par in the first rounds of major championships since his last title in 2014, having been 19 under for his opening rounds in the four years before that. On Thursday - in the absence of defending champion Phil Mickelson, the man McIlroy edged out for his last major victory - he maintained his early charge by nudging in another birdie at the 500-yard par-four second, his 11th, to move two strokes clear of the field and then salvaged par on the next hole. Showing his daughter Poppy an old picture of himself on the media centre wall earlier this week, McIlroy isreportedly said to have joked to her,externalthat ""that was when daddy was good"". A fifth major title would certainly reinforce that he still is and, despite missing a birdie chance on his 13th, McIlroy clipped out of the greenside bunker on the par-five fifth and rolled in the putt to extend his advantage to three strokes. But his momentum was stunted with the first blemish on his card at the par-three sixth moments later, squirrelling a par putt narrowly wide, and a wayward drive followed as McIlroy's stellar opening round threatened to unravel down the stretch. He scrambled for par before a second bogey of the day allowed Hoge and Zalatoris to take a share of top spot, only to then roll in his seventh birdie from 20 feet on the final hole to sign for his joint second-lowest opening round in a major - only going lower with a 63 at the Open in 2010, when he finished joint third. World number one Scheffler looked set to repeat some of the magic that saw him slip on the Green Jacket at Augusta National last month when he eagled the par-five fifth to get to two under, but he was unable to build any momentum on a blustery afternoon. The 25-year-old cancelled out a bogey at nine with a birdie at 10, only to drop a stroke after a remarkable series of shots on the 12th - the American found a route between two trees following a miscued drive and then flopped out of a bunker, but missed his par putt. Four bogeys either side of another birdie followed for Scheffler, who then drove his tee shot into a stream on the 18th but managed to salvage par and finish at one over. ""That's what happens when you play late in the day,"" said Scheffler. ""Today was windy so the course was challenging, and I didn't keep myself in position on the back nine and paid the price for it."" Playing partners Morikawa and Rahm also failed to reach their usually impeccable standards, with Morikawa ending the day two over and Spain's Rahm finishing at three over. Fitzpatrick fared better, opening his round with successive birdies and seeing two more wiped out by a couple of dropped shots as he stayed within touching distance of the lead. Compatriot Tyrrell Hatton finished level, alongside Scotland's Robert MacIntyre and Irishman Shane Lowry, while English duo Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood were both one over. Tiger Woods has won the US PGA Championship on four occassions Woods made a remarkable comeback at the Masters in April, 14 months after a career-threatening car crash that left him unable to walk for three months. The world number 818 said that felt like ""Everest"" and, after more time on the golf course, insisted that he was now ready to contend. He started brightly with birdies on his first and fifth holes. But the 15-time major champion appeared to be struggling the deeper into his round he got, wincing after tee shots, and he closed with successive bogeys to finish four over. ""It has felt better before. It's a little sore right now,"" said Woods about his leg. ""Lots of treatment, lots of ice baths, and try and get the inflammation out and try and get ready for tomorrow."" Spieth, who needs to win this major to complete a career grand slam, had a mixed round in which he carded two birdies and four bogeys.

"Greek composer Vangelis, who was known for his celebrated film themes for Chariots of Fire and Blade Runner, has died at the age of 79. He won an Oscar for the stirring score to 1981's Chariots of Fire. Paying tribute, the film's producer Lord Puttnam told the BBC Vangelis had created ""a new musical landscape"". Others sharing their memories ranged from French musician Jean-Michel Jarre to Dutch trance DJ Armin van Buuren, who said he was ""a big inspiration"". Vangelis was ""one of my heroes"" and ""just a beautiful person"",Van Buuren wrote on Twitter,external, adding: ""I still listen to his albums a lot."" Jarre wrote,externalin a tribute: ""We will all remember your unique touch and your moving melodies forever. ""You and I have always shared the same passion for synthesizers and electronic music since so long."" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakistweeted,external: ""Vangelis Papathanassiou is no longer with us. The world of music has lost the international (artist) Vangelis."" US composerAustin Wintory wrote on Twitter,externalthat Vangelis ""changed an entire era of music"". Fellow composerBear McCreary wrote,externalthat he was ""a true musical pioneer"", saying: ""Chariots of Fire and Blade Runner were among the most innovative and influential scores in the history of the medium."" Oscar-nominated British musicianDaniel Pemberton said,externalit was ""hard to underestimate the colossal impact of Vangelis on modern film music"". He added: ""It is also hard to understand how groundbreaking Chariots of Fire was. A period British film with a phenomenal synth score."" Allow YouTube content?

Vangelis's Chariots of Fire theme famously accompanied shots of athletes running along the beach in St Andrews, Scotland, at the start of the film, which was set before the 1924 Olympics. It went to number one in the US, and later topped the UK's classical singles chart in 2012 after being performed by Mr Bean at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games. Lord Puttnam, who also won an Oscar for the film, said: ""I think Vangelis created a new landscape, a new musical landscape, that many other composers have taken advantage of."" He said that when he and his wife first heard the score ""every single hair at the back of my neck stood up"". Vangelis was nominated for a Golden Globe and Bafta for his score on Sir Ridley Scott's science fiction thriller, Blade Runner. Charles de Lauzirika, who produced the 1982 film, said: ""His music, not just in Blade Runner, was otherworldly in beautiful and haunting ways I lack the words to describe. ""He created lush dream states I still love getting lost in."" In addition to Blade Runner, the composer was nominated for Baftas for his scores for Missing and Chariots of Fire. The official Bafta account tweeted that he was a ""trailblazing composer"" and that its thoughts were with Vangelis' family and friends. His other film credits included The Bounty, Francesco, Bitter Moon, 1492: Conquest of Paradise and Alexander. Vangelis pictured surrounded by recording equipment in 1976 Vangelis first tasted fame as the keyboardist in the band Aphrodite's Child with singer Demis Roussos in the late 1960s. He went on to be an acclaimed and ground-breaking electronic solo artist beyond his work in film, and also enjoyed chart success with Yes frontman Jon Anderson under the name Jon and Vangelis. The pair reached the UK top 10 with I Hear You Now in 1980, and again with I'll Find My Way Home the following year. The musician released his most recent albums with the Decca record label, whose presidents Tom Lewis and Laura Monks said: ""The world has lost a genius. Vangelis created music of extraordinary originality and power, and provided the soundtrack to so many of our lives. ""We will miss him enormously. His music will live on forever."" The Greek composer once said: ""My interest was not to create a symphony orchestra, which I can very easily, but to go further than that and do things that the symphony orchestra can't do. ""And I think that I succeeded to create something like this.""

"Rory McIlroy last won a major at the 2014 US PGA Championship US PGA Championship first-round leaderboard -5R McIlroy (NI);-4T Hoge (US), W Zalatoris (US);-3M Kuchar (US), A Ancer (Mex), J Thomas (US);-2M Fitzpatrick (Eng) Selected others: LevelS Lowry (Ire), R MacIntyre (Sco), T Hatton (Eng);+1S Scheffler (US), C Morikawa (US), J Rose (Eng), T Fleetwood (Eng);+3J Rahm (Spa);+4T Woods (US) Rory McIlroy got his bid to end an eight-year major drought off to a solid start as he finished day one of the US PGA Championship with a one-shot lead. Northern Ireland's four-time major champion closed with a birdie to card a five-under 65, and then watched as late starters toiled in windier conditions. Americans Tom Hoge and Will Zalatoris are McIlroy's nearest challengers on four under at Southern Hills, Oklahoma. England's Matt Fitzpatrick is also in contention after a two-under-par 68. ""Overall, it was a great day,"" said McIlroy, who is chasing a third US PGA title. ""Great to get off to a great start at a major championship for a change. ""I came in here knowing my game is in good shape so it is a matter of executing the shots you know you can - I need to replicate that and not get ahead of myself."" McIlroy was in a marquee group alongside Americans Tiger Woods, who signed for a four-over 74, and Jordan Spieth, who finished with a two-over 72. 'Staying aggressive' helped after fast start - McIlroy World number 40 Hoge, who won his first PGA Tour event at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am earlier this year, and Zalatoris also enjoyed the best of the early conditions. The wind made the course play about a shot harder in the afternoon but world number nine Justin Thomas bucked the trend, birdieing the last for a three-under 67. He sits level with Matt Kuchar and Abraham Ancer, who both completed their rounds in lighter winds. The world's three top-ranked players - Masters winner Scottie Scheffler, US Open victor Jon Rahm and Open champion Collin Morikawa - were among those who struggled in the afternoon and all finished over par. Starting from the 10th tee, McIlroy's putter was as fiery as the sweltering Tulsa heat and his nerve as cold as the staggeringly priced on-site refreshments as he made four successive birdies to wrangle the lead after six holes. The 33-year-old is looking to record a third PGA Championship win, with the second of his Wanamaker Trophy successes coming in August 2014 at Valhalla, just a few weeks after he had won his first Claret Jug at The Open. It was McIlroy's fourth major title and the great Jack Nicklaus proclaimed afterwards that the fresh-faced prospect could go on to ""win 15 or 20"" of golf's elite prizes. Eight years later and McIlroy is yet to add to that tally - instead he has 14 top-10 finishes and a runner-up place at last month's Masters. He would couch that by pointing out, as he did toBBC Radio 5 Live's All About: The Open podcast, that he has won pretty much everything else in that time, but his recent major form has been characterised by sluggish starts that have shot him out of contention. Heading into this event, McIlroy was a cumulative 35 over par in the first rounds of major championships since his last title in 2014, having been 19 under for his opening rounds in the four years before that. On Thursday - in the absence of defending champion Phil Mickelson, the man McIlroy edged out for his last major victory - he maintained his early charge by nudging in another birdie at the 500-yard par-four second, his 11th, to move two strokes clear of the field and then salvaged par on the next hole. Showing his daughter Poppy an old picture of himself on the media centre wall earlier this week, McIlroy isreportedly said to have joked to her,externalthat ""that was when daddy was good"". A fifth major title would certainly reinforce that he still is and, despite missing a birdie chance on his 13th, McIlroy clipped out of the greenside bunker on the par-five fifth and rolled in the putt to extend his advantage to three strokes. But his momentum was stunted with the first blemish on his card at the par-three sixth moments later, squirrelling a par putt narrowly wide, and a wayward drive followed as McIlroy's stellar opening round threatened to unravel down the stretch. He scrambled for par before a second bogey of the day allowed Hoge and Zalatoris to take a share of top spot, only to then roll in his seventh birdie from 20 feet on the final hole to sign for his joint second-lowest opening round in a major - only going lower with a 63 at the Open in 2010, when he finished joint third. World number one Scheffler looked set to repeat some of the magic that saw him slip on the Green Jacket at Augusta National last month when he eagled the par-five fifth to get to two under, but he was unable to build any momentum on a blustery afternoon. The 25-year-old cancelled out a bogey at nine with a birdie at 10, only to drop a stroke after a remarkable series of shots on the 12th - the American found a route between two trees following a miscued drive and then flopped out of a bunker, but missed his par putt. Four bogeys either side of another birdie followed for Scheffler, who then drove his tee shot into a stream on the 18th but managed to salvage par and finish at one over. ""That's what happens when you play late in the day,"" said Scheffler. ""Today was windy so the course was challenging, and I didn't keep myself in position on the back nine and paid the price for it."" Playing partners Morikawa and Rahm also failed to reach their usually impeccable standards, with Morikawa ending the day two over and Spain's Rahm finishing at three over. Fitzpatrick fared better, opening his round with successive birdies and seeing two more wiped out by a couple of dropped shots as he stayed within touching distance of the lead. Compatriot Tyrrell Hatton finished level, alongside Scotland's Robert MacIntyre and Irishman Shane Lowry, while English duo Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood were both one over. Tiger Woods has won the US PGA Championship on four occassions Woods made a remarkable comeback at the Masters in April, 14 months after a career-threatening car crash that left him unable to walk for three months. The world number 818 said that felt like ""Everest"" and, after more time on the golf course, insisted that he was now ready to contend. He started brightly with birdies on his first and fifth holes. But the 15-time major champion appeared to be struggling the deeper into his round he got, wincing after tee shots, and he closed with successive bogeys to finish four over. ""It has felt better before. It's a little sore right now,"" said Woods about his leg. ""Lots of treatment, lots of ice baths, and try and get the inflammation out and try and get ready for tomorrow."" Spieth, who needs to win this major to complete a career grand slam, had a mixed round in which he carded two birdies and four bogeys.

Russian forces have ""completely destroyed"" the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said,in a late night video address,external. He also accused Moscow of carrying out ""senseless bombardments"" as it intensified its offensive in the region. Russia has shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, after pulling back its forces from near the capital Kyiv. ""In the Donbas, the occupiers are trying to exert even more

Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion. Ukrainian volunteers prepare to deliver food inside a complex set up as a shelter in Zaporizhzhya We've been reporting onthe growing food crisis in Ukraineand accusations thatRussia is using food as a weapon of war, including by blocking ports in Ukraine's Black Sea. Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information.

Russia says more than 1,700 fighters from the plant have been taken to Russian-controlled areas since Monday. You canread about what has been happening to them here. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the US funding package. In a tweet, he called the Senate's approval of the $40m boost ""a significant  contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"" and looked ahead to US President Joe Biden signing off the funds. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the package would help ensure Russia's defeat by Ukraine, adding: ""We are moving towards victory confidently and
strategically. We thank our allies."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate. The package includes: It goes next to President Biden to be signed into law. McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years. In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Vadim Shishimarin, aged 21, has admitted killing 62-year-old civilian Oleksandr Shelipov One court case has been the focus of much of our coverage today - and there's been a near-total blackout in state-controlled Russian media on the war crimes trial of Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin in Kyiv. BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT. Asked about Shishimarin at a news briefing on 18 May, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskovsaid he did not have enough information,externalabout the soldier captured by Ukraine. You can read our correspondent Sarah Rainsford'sstory on the trial here. Returning now to the situation on the ground in Ukraine, 12 people have been killed in Ukrainian-controlled Severodonetsk after Russian shelling, the head of the eastern Luhansk Regional Military Administration has said on Telegram. Serhiy Hayday says more than 40 people who were injured in the attacks are receiving medical treatment - and there has been significant destruction leading to power cuts. Among the victims are two women found dead in a flat hit by a missile, he says in his post. At least eight houses have been damaged and rescuers were unable to reach places on fire for two hours because of the shelling, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.
