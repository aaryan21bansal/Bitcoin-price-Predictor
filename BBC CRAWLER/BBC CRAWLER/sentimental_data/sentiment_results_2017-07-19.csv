"This video can not be played Canada's Governor General lightly touched the Queen on the elbow as she descended a flight of steps Canada's Governor General David Johnston says a ""slippy"" carpet is to blame for an apparent breach of royal etiquette with the Queen. He was pictured lightly touching the Queen's elbow during an event in London to mark Canada's 150th birthday. Mr Johnston said he was simply concerned about the Queen's safety as she navigated a short flight of stairs. ""I was just anxious to be sure there was no stumbling on the steps,""he told the CBC,external. ""It's a little bit awkward, that descent from Canada House to Trafalgar Square, and there was carpet that was a little slippy, and so I thought perhaps it was appropriate to breach protocol just to be sure that there was no stumble.""

"Madonna confirmed two years ago that she had had a relationship with Tupac (R) A US judge has halted an auction of personal items of Madonna, after she said her privacy was violated. New York Justice Gerald Lebovits set a full hearing for 6 September, banning auction house Gotta Have Rock and Roll from holding a sale in the meantime. Madonna's underwear, a chequebook, a hairbrush, photos and a break-up letter from the late rapper Tupac Shakur had been among the scheduled lots. The pop superstar said her possessions had been stolen by a former friend. Tupac's letter, in which the rapper suggests he broke up with Madonna because of her race, was expected to fetch as much as $400,000 (Â£307,000). The letter is dated 15 January 1995 and was penned while Tupac was serving a prison sentence for sexual assault, 18 months before he was shot dead. Both artists were then at the height of their fame. A series of pictures purportedly showing parts of the prison letter written by Tupac to Madonna, released by Gotta Have Rock and Roll Madonna, 58, confirmed two years ago that the pair had had a relationship, though it is unclear how long it lasted. ""For you to be seen with a black man wouldn't in any way jeopardise your career, if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting,"" Tupac, then 23, wrote from New York's Clinton Correctional Facility. ""But for me at least in my previous perception I felt due to my 'image' that I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was. ""Like you said, I haven't been the kind of friend I know I am capable of being,"" he wrote, adding: ""I never meant to hurt you."" In court documents, Madonna said she had only learned from press reports that the letter from her former boyfriend - and many of the other items - were no longer in her possession. Tupac died in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas Many of the lots were presented for sale by New York art dealer Darlene Lutz. Madonna said Ms Lutz had access to them when she helped the singer pack up a house in Miami. ""It seems obvious that Defendant Lutz betrayed my trust in an outrageous effort to obtain my possessions without my knowledge or consent,"" Madonna told the court. A spokesperson for Ms Lutz and the auction house said Madonna and ""her legal army"" had taken a ""completely baseless"" action to temporarily halt the sale, and vowed to challenge the allegations in court. Sharon Stone backs Madonna over insult We fact-checked the Madonna film script WATCH: Madonna opens Malawi children's hospital Objecting to the sale of her hairbrush, Madonna told the judge: ""I understand that my DNA could be extracted from a piece of my hair. It is outrageous and grossly offensive that my DNA could be auctioned for sale to the general public."" The pop singer also sought to block the sale of a frank letter to another former lover, actor John Enos. Writing in the early 1990s, Madonna said she envied the careers of singer Whitney Houston and actress Sharon Stone, saying they were ""horribly mediocre"" and had profited from her own success. ""Maybe this is what black people felt like when Elvis Presley got huge,"" she wrote. Sharon Stone wrote in a Facebook post last week that she is friends with Madonna, adding: ""I love and adore you; won't be pitted against you by any invasion of our personal journeys.""

"This video can not be played Elizabeth Campbell said she was ""deeply sorry"" for the ""grief and trauma"" The newly elected leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council has been booed and heckled amid continuing anger over the Grenfell Tower fire. Protesters shouted ""resign"" and ""shame on you"" as Elizabeth Campbell was made council leader at a public meeting. The councillor said she was ""deeply sorry"" for the ""grief and trauma"" caused by the blaze in west London. The fractious meeting ended early after a female resident fell to the ground and was attended to by medics. About 70 of the 255 people who survived the blaze attended the meeting after condemnation of the council's response. At least 80 people are dead or missing after the tower block fire on 14 June. The council has been accused of being slow to react on the ground and not doing enough to re-house Grenfell Tower residents. Many people in the public gallery at Kensington Town Hall were calling for the Conservative group that runs the council to resign and for new elections. It was the first cabinet meeting since the fire, after the council abandoned an earlier meeting - which had been planned as a closed one - when members of thepress were allowed in after a High Court judgement. Addressing survivors in the chamber, Ms Campbell said: ""I am truly sorry that we did not do more to help you when you needed it the most."" Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? There was heckling from the public gallery Former Grenfell Tower residents sat in the public gallery, while at least 150 community members and volunteers were in an overspill room. One by one, residents and those who lost loved ones gave accounts of their traumatic experiences, voicing their distrust in local services. One survivor, from the 16th floor of Grenfell Tower, who gave his name as Hamid, said he had ""had enough"". ""I need a place to go and start my life,"" he said. ""I'm not asking for something big. ""We need to move on. We want to go to work - kids got to go to school."" Another survivor told the chamber he had been living in a hotel room since the fire, with just one double bed between him, his wife and three children. He said that the residents' main problem was a lack of action. ""I was forgotten about,"" he added. ""You know who has done something for us? The residents of North Kensington. Our community. Our neighbours."" A group of demonstrators gathered outside Kensington Town Hall As the meeting progressed, attention turned to a petition calling for the council's entire elected leadership to resign. It was signed by more than 1,500 people, passing the threshold for a debate by councillors. Labour's newly elected MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, said: ""I agree entirely with the petition's demands."" Ms Campbell, who was heckled again as she responded to the petition, said: ""We will not continue business as usual and we will rebuild trust, as I said, brick by brick."" Earlier, she said 68 new homes for Grenfell Tower survivors would be identified and bought within the next two weeks, and an additional 31 homes would be acquired in the next few weeks. The councillor also promised that 400 new social houses would be built over the next five years. She took over as de facto leader afterNicholas Paget-Brown resigned on 30 June. She later admitted on the Today programme that she had never been in a tower block, but added that she had visited many council houses.

"Six million men and women will have to wait a year longer than they expected to get their state pension, the government has announced. The rise in the pension age to 68 will now be phased in between 2037 and 2039, rather than from 2044 as was originally proposed. Those affected are currently between the ages of 39 and 47. The announcement was made in the Commons by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, David Gauke. He said the government had decided to accept the recommendations of theCridland report,external, which proposed the change. This video can not be played The change was announced by Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, David Gauke ""As life expectancy continues to rise and the number of people in receipt of state pension increases, we need to ensure that we have a fair and sustainable system that is reflective of modern life and protected for future generations,"" he told MPs. State pension age could be raised to 70 A longer life means a longer wait for your pension Anyone younger than 39 will have to wait for future announcements to learn what their precise pension age will be. The change will affect those born between 6 April 1970  and 5 April 1978. The government said the new rules would save the taxpayer Â£74bn by 2045/46. While it had been due to spend 6.5% of GDP on the state pension by 2039/40, this change will reduce that figure to 6.1% of GDP. Labour said the move was ""astonishing"", given recent reports suggesting increases in life expectancy were beginning to stall, and long-standing health inequalities between different income groups and regions in retirement. State pension calculator - check your age and entitlement,external Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams told MPs that many men and women were beginning to suffer ill health in the early 60s, well before they were entitled to their state pension. ""Most pensioners will now spend their retirement battling a toxic cocktail of ill-health,"" she said. ""The government talks about making Britain fairer but their pensions policy, whether it is the injustice that 1950s-born women are facing, or today's proposals, is anything but fair."" This video can not be played Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams says the pension change is ""anything but fair"" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the government risked creating ""second-class citizens"". ""In large parts of the country, the state pension age will be higher than healthy life expectancy,"" she said. ""And low-paid workers at risk of insecurity in their working lives will now face greater insecurity in old age too. ""Rather than hiking the pension age, the government must do more for older workers who want to keep working and paying taxes."" Age UK was also critical of the change. ""In bringing forward a rise in the state pension age by seven years, the government is picking the pockets of everyone in their late forties and younger, despite there being no objective case in Age UK's view to support it at this point in time,"" said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK. ""Indeed, it is astonishing that this is being announced the day afternew authoritative researchsuggested that the long term improvement in life expectancy is stalling."" The government has also committed to regular reviews of the state pension age in the years ahead. That raises the prospect of further rises. Indeed a report by thegovernment's actuary department,externalin March suggested that workers now under the age of 30 may have to wait until 70 before they qualify for a state pension. Tom McPhail, head of policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the government would need to do more to encourage saving, particularly amongst younger people. ""For anyone yet to reach age 47, there is still time to adjust their retirement plans by looking to contribute more,"" he said. ""We feel it is important the government meets them halfway; we need a national savings strategy to help people save and invest for their future. A good starting point would be for the government to look at a savings commission."" The SNP said it remained opposed to raising the pension age beyond 66 and reiterated its call for an independent pensions commission to be set up to look at ""demographic differences across the UK"". In response, Mr Gauke said the Scottish government would have the power to provide extra financial help for those approaching retirement if they so chose. ""This announcement will be a blow to many people. It is absolutely crucial that everyone - no matter what their age - seeks pensions advice from a reputable organisation and really understands their options and how those options fit in with their own retirement expectations. ""I know young people don't think this really impacts them as it is such a long way off, but they are the ones who will be impacted by state pension ages and support in the longer term more than any of us,"" said Carl Robertson, fromSmart Pension,external.

Vine said: ""I just feel very lucky every day, is the answer to that.""

Discussing sport, he joked: ""Is Gary Lineker coming on to do this bit? That means the budget will be gone for the year."" The list has provoked debate, not least because two-thirds of those on it are men and there are seven of them ahead of the highest-paid woman, Claudia Winkleman.

"This video can not be played Justine Damond's family held a silent dawn vigil on Sydney's Freshwater Beach The lawyer for a US police officer whose partner killed an Australian woman says it would be ""reasonable"" for the pair to have feared an ambush. Minneapolis officer Matthew Harrity has reportedly said they were startled by a ""loud sound"" before last Saturday night's shooting of Justine Damond. Police have released the transcript of her call to police, in which the 40-year-old reports a suspected rape. She was fatally shot in the abdomen by one of the officers she had called. Officer Mohamed Noor, who fired the fatal shot in Ms Damond's upmarket neighbourhood, has refused to be interviewed by investigators, as is his legal right. Justine Damond's death: What we know Death raises questions about camera use Fred Bruno, a lawyer for Officer Harrity, said on Wednesday: ""It is reasonable to assume an officer in that situation would be concerned about a possible ambush. This video can not be played Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull: 'We're seeking answers' ""It was only a few weeks ago when a female NYPD cop and mother of twins was executed in her car in a very similar scenario."" He was referring to the 5 July shooting of a 48-year-old police officeras she sat in her patrol car in the Bronx boroughof New York City. The attorney's comments come a day after Officer Harrity spoke to investigators with the state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is leading the investigation. During the interview, he described seeing a young person on a bicycle pass by moments before Ms Damond pounded on the door of the police car, according to KSTP-TV. Detectives have appealed to the cyclist to come forward with any information he may have. This video can not be played ""Justine should be here. This shouldn't have happened"" On Wednesday police released the transcript of her two separate 911 calls, which she made after hearing screams nearby. ""I'm not sure if she's having sex or being raped,"" she told the police operator, before giving her address. ""I think she just yelled out 'help', but it's difficult, the sound has been going on for a while,"" she continued. Ms Damond called back eight minutes later to ensure police had the correct address. Body cameras, which are worn by all Minneapolis police, had not been turned on at the time of the shooting and the squad car dashboard camera also failed to capture the incident. Friends held a vigil at Sydney's Freshwater beach on Wednesday morning Officers Harrity and Noor, who between them have spent three years on the police force, have been placed on paid administrative leave. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is appealing to the US for an explanation. ""It is a shocking killing, and yes, we are demanding answers on behalf of her family,"" he told Australian TV on Wednesday. Hundreds of friends and family of Ms Damond held a vigil on Sydney's Freshwater beach on Wednesday morning. The slain yoga instructor and spiritual healer was engaged to marry an American man. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton told reporters he has been in touch with the Australian embassy, adding the state may need to review rules covering police use of body cameras.

"This video can not be played Trump to senators: Cancel your vacation Thirty-two million Americans would lose health coverage under a Republican plan to repeal Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has forecast. The non-partisan office's analysis found the cost of a medical insurance policy would increase 25% next year and double by 2026. The repeal bill would also cut the federal deficit by $473bn (Â£363bn), predicted the CBO. The Republican-controlled Senate has twice failed to pass a healthcare bill. Its members plan to vote next week on a plan to repeal President Barack Obama's 2010 health law with a two-year delay. But the CBO estimates the number of uninsured would rise by 17 million next year alone if the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, were to be overturned. This video can not be played President Trump has been switching his position what do about the health bill in recent days President Donald Trump earlier called on his party to postpone their summer holiday until they have repealed Obamacare and replaced it with the Republican plan. Mr Trump told 49 Republican senators at the White House: ""We should hammer this out and get it done."" In the past two days he has switched position several times, urging the repeal and replace of Obamacare, just repealing it, allowing it to fail, before reverting to repeal and replace on Wednesday. Mr Trump said: ""For seven years you promised the American people that you would repeal Obamacare. ""People are hurting. Inaction is not an option. And frankly I don't think we should leave town unless we have a health insurance plan."" This video can not be played President Trump won big in Kentucky last year but the state also depends heavily on Obamacare Mr Trump warned a senator who was seated next to him that he could lose his job if he did not toe the party line. A ripple of uncomfortable laughter was heard in the room as the president said of Nevada's Dean Heller: ""And he wants to remain a senator, doesn't he? OK."" Mr Heller, who was one of the earliest senators to oppose the first version of the Republican health bill, is up for re-election next year. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has scheduled a vote early next week on a straight-up repeal of Obamacare. However, it looks likely to fail after the defections on Tuesday of at least three of the party's senators. Mr McConnell pointed out it was the same legislation that all but one Republican senator voted to send to President Barack Obama in 2015, safe in the knowledge he would veto it. But now the party controls the White House and both chambers of Congress, some rank-and-file Republicans seem wary of enacting legislation that would eliminate medical insurance for millions of Americans. ""We thankfully have a president in office who will sign it,"" said Mr McConnell, whose reputation as a master tactician has been dented by the imbroglio. ""So we should send it to him."" This video can not be played Trump's battles with Obamacare - in his own words With Democrats united in opposition, Mr McConnell can only lose two votes from his 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass the bill. Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia are opposed to repeal. Overturning Obamacare was a top campaign pledge for Mr Trump and congressional Republicans, who view the law as a costly intrusion into the healthcare system. The party's proposed alternative includes steep cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled. It would also remove Obamacare's individual mandate, which requires all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. And there would be a six-month ban on obtaining new medical coverage for anyone who lets their previous policy lapse for more than two months.

"Claudia Winkleman and Alex Jones are the BBC's highest paid female stars The BBC has revealed two-thirds of its stars earning more than Â£150,000 are male, with Chris Evans the top-paid on between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m. Claudia Winkleman was the highest-paid female celebrity, earning between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000 last year,its annual report,externalfor 2016/2017 says. The One Show's Alex Jones was second, earning between Â£400,000 and Â£450,000. BBC director general Tony Hall said there was ""more to do"" on the gender pay gap. The top seven earners, in the list of the BBC's 96 best-paid stars, were all male. It is the first time the pay of stars earning more than Â£150,000 has been made public. The BBC has been compelled to reveal the information under the terms of its new Royal Charter. This video can not be played Why the gender pay gap could mean problems for the BBC Speaking on LBC Radio, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We've seen the way the BBC is paying women less for doing the same job... I want women to be paid equally."" When asked if Evans was worth considerably more than her, she said: ""What's important is that the BBC looks at the question of paying men and women the same for doing the same job."" BBC pay: Who earns what? What will the industry make of star pay? Stars on their pay Reality Check : The gender pay gap The total bill for the 96 personalities was Â£28.7m but the figures in the report reveal large disparities betweenwhat men and women are paid,external. ""On gender and diversity, the BBC is more diverse than the broadcasting industry and the civil service,"" Lord Hall said. ""We've made progress, but we recognise there is more to do and we are pushing further and faster than any other broadcaster."" This video can not be played ""We do have further to go"" on the gender pay gap says BBC Director of Radio and Education When asked if female stars working at the BBC would now be asking for pay rises, Lord Hall said: ""We will be working carefully on our relationship with our talent."" He also pledged to close the gender pay gap by 2020. Trade unionEquity said in a statement,external: ""The apparent pay gaps in gender and for those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background are troubling."" Woman's Hour'sJane Garvey tweeted,external: ""I'm looking forward to presenting @BBCWomansHour today. We'll be discussing #GenderPayGap . As we've done since 1946. Going well, isn't it?"" Newsnight presenterEmily Maitlis retweeted Garvey's message,external. Other high profile omissions including the Today programme's Sarah Montague, BBC Breakfast's Louise Minchin and Woman's Hour's Jenni Murray. Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys, acknowledged that his Â£600,000 salary was hard to justify: ""On paper, absolutely nothing that justifies that huge amount of money, if you compare me with lots of other people who do visibly. ""If a doctor saves a child's life, if a nurse comforts a dying person, a fireman rushes into Grenfell Tower, then of course you could argue that compared with that sort of thing I'm not worth tuppence ha'penny.  However, we operate in a market place."" There is also a gap between the pay for white stars and those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background. George Alagiah, Jason Mohammad and Trevor Nelson are the highest paid BAME presenters, each receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. The highest-paid female star with a BAME background is BBC news presenter Mishal Husain, who earned between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. The annual report does not include stars who receive their pay through BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm. The figures quoted only refer to the amount of licence fee money each person receives and do not include their earnings from other broadcasters or commercial activities. They also exclude stars paid through independent production companies. That means some big name stars - such as David Attenborough, Benedict Cumberbatch and Matt LeBlanc - do not appear on the list. The list also does not distinguish between people who are paid for doing multiple jobs within the BBC and those who are just paid for one. Talent pay is considerably higher in the commercial sector. As he left the BBC after his Radio 2 breakfast show on Wednesday, Chris Evans said it was right ""on balance"" that star salaries were being disclosed. ""We are the ultimate public company I think, and therefore it's probably right and proper people know what we get paid,"" he told reporters. During a briefing on the annual report on Wednesday morning, Lord Hall said: ""Chris Evans is presenting the most popular show on the most popular radio network in Europe. ""The BBC does not exist in a market on its own where it can set the market rates. ""If we are to give the public what they want, then we have to pay for those great presenters and stars."" Aside from Strictly, Winkleman's other BBC roles include presenting The Great British Sewing Bee and her Radio 2 Sunday night show. Her agent said she would be making no comment. Casualty stars Derek Thompson and Amanda Mealing are the BBC's best-paid actors Casualty star Derek Thompson was the BBC's highest paid actor, receiving between Â£350,000 and Â£400,000 over the last financial year. Amanda Mealing, who also stars in Casualty as well as Holby City, was the highest paid actress, receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. Clare Balding earned between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 for her work on sports shows including Wimbledon Today and the Rio Olympics.

"Ranjeep says his decision to marry his partner caused a family split Hundreds of gay and lesbian people of South Asian heritage are believed to be under pressure to marry someone of the opposite sex, police say. West Midlands Police said a growing number are now contacting the force after being ordered to have a heterosexual wedding by their families. The UK's forced marriage unit heard from at least 30 LGBT people last year. But they say more people are likely to be affected as being gay is often seen as taboo among south Asian communities. This is supported by data from charities and LGBT organisations that have made referrals to the police. Twenty-two gay and lesbian people of South Asian heritage have told the BBC that at some point they were pressurised to marry somebody of the opposite sex. In most of those cases, the individuals said they were tempted to go ahead with the marriage because they did not want to embarrass their family, or ruin their reputation. My big fake straight wedding Male 'honour' cases 'underreported' This video can not be played When 'Ranjeep' told his family that he was gay, at first his father advised him to marry a woman Ranjeep - not his real name - told his family a couple of years ago that he was gay.  His father's first response was to tell him to marry a woman. ""I'm Sikh, and culturally the older generation don't accept homosexuality,"" he said. ""My father ordered me to marry a woman because he thought that would cure my homosexuality."" Ranjeep, who is in his 30s and from Coventry, said: ""The emotional pressure is really hard and distressing and you don't want to bring shame on the family by saying you're gay.  I ended up marrying my partner but my parents didn't come to wedding."" He said he lives two separate lives and is distraught his father will not accept him for who he is. ""It's heart-breaking to see my father heart-broken because of my sexuality."" A forced marriage is where one or both people do not consent to the marriage and pressure or abuse is used. In the UK,it is illegal and recognised as a form of violence against women and men.,external The pressure put on people to marry against their will can be physical or emotional and psychological. Det Sgt Trudy Gittins, from the West Midlands force, said the people coming forward from the LGBT community in recent months are from all walks of life. ""We've got professional well educated people who still feel that immense pressure because there's a whole expectation that they will not bring shame on their family,"" she said. ""Homophobia is rife in some communities and to be seen as being gay or lesbian or bisexual it can absolutely destroy the dynamic of that community and this person just has that burden every single day and it can cause a great deal of anxiety and distress and in some cases they also feel suicidal."" The Foreign Office and Home Office set up theForced Marriage Unit,externalin 2005. Figures show 30 LGBT people who contacted the unit last year were among the 1,428 people who asked for help. But the government acknowledged the actual number of cases that involving LGBT people could be ""significantly higher"" as it did not explicitly ask people whether their sexuality was the trigger for the forced marriage. The unit is now working with LGBT groups to encourage more victims to come forward and get support. Khakan Qureshi runs a Birmingham-based organisation called Finding a Voice, which gives advice to gay and lesbian people of south Asian origin. He is of Muslim faith, and told his family he was gay more than two decades ago. ""I had one relative who is in his 20s, and he told me that he would kill his son if he told him that he was gay. ""And it's this old fashioned attitude that scares me because attitudes haven't changed since I came out more than 20 years ago.  The younger generation have to be bold and reject this sort of homophobia and ignorance or attitudes will stay the same."" Blackburn-based imam Saleem Sedat said homosexual people should be treated with respect and humanity. ""Islam is categorically against forged marriage,"" he said.  ""What's important is that we're sensitive towards the concerns of young people including when it comes to matters of sexuality and that we provide them with the necessary support and care they require to grow and become healthy members of society.""

"This video can not be played Footage has emerged of Paul Nicholls being rescued British actor Paul Nicholls has been rescued after being trapped at the bottom of a waterfall in Thailand for three days, his agent has said. The ex-EastEnders star had motorcycled to the site in Koh Samui before falling, breaking both legs and shattering a knee. He was unable to use his phone after it broke, but local villagers alerted police to his abandoned motorbike. The 38-year-old Bolton-born actor's agent said he was ""recovering well"". Nicholls will be flown back to the UK next week. The actor, who played Joe Wicks on the BBC soap in the 1990s, was on holiday in Thailand after finishing filming for the Channel 4 series Ackley Bridge. After being alerted, police searched records to find out who had rented the bike and found it had been rented to a British tourist called Paul Greenhalgh - Nicholls' real name. Volunteer rescuers, police, and medics went to search for the actor, and found him several hours after setting off. Mr Nicholls came to prominence in long-running BBC soap EastEnders Nicholls' first TV appearance was aged 10 in Granada Television show Children's Ward. His EastEnders character Joe Wicks lived with schizophrenia, and the popular soap was praised for its portrayal of mental health on-screen. Since EastEnders, Nicholls has appeared in a number of TV shows, including Law and Order UK, Casualty, and Grantchester. His most recent TV appearance is in Channel 4's Ackley Bridge, where he plays a teacher in a school where British Asian and white British communities merge.

""We've made progress, but we recognise there is more to do and we are pushing further and faster than any other broadcaster."" When asked if female talent working at the BBC would now be asking for pay rises, Lord Hall said: ""We will be working carefully on our relationship with our talent."" Woman's Hour'sJane Garvey tweeted,external: ""I'm looking forward to presenting @BBCWomansHour today. We'll be discussing #GenderPayGap . As we've done since 1946. Going well, isn't it?"" Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, who did not appear on the list,retweeted Garvey's message,external. There is also a gap between the pay for white stars and those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background. George Alagiah, Jason Mohammad and Trevor Nelson are the highest paid BAME presenters, each receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. The highest-paid female star with a BAME background is BBC news presenter Mishal Husain, who earned between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. The annual report contains pay information in bands and does not reveal exact amounts. Nor does it include stars who receive their pay through BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm. The figures quoted only refer to the amount of licence fee money each person receives and do not include their earnings from other broadcasters or commercial activities. They also exclude stars paid through independent production companies. That means some big name stars - such as David Attenborough, Benedict Cumberbatch and Matt LeBlanc - do not appear on the list. The list also does not distinguish between people who are paid for doing multiple jobs within the BBC and those who are just paid for one. Two of the judges on Strictly are in a higher pay bracket than the others - but they also work for other BBC shows Strictly Come Dancing head judge Len Goodman - who has now left the show - and fellow judge Bruno Tonioli were both in the Â£200,000-Â£250,000 band. The show's other judges, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell, got between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000. Tess Daly, Winkleman's Strictly Come Dancing co-host, was paid between Â£350,000 and Â£400,000. Graham Norton earned more than Â£850,000 but this does not include payments to his production company, which makes The Graham Norton Show and pays him a separate salary. The BBC is alone amongst the UK's major broadcasters in releasing pay details for its on-air and on-screen talent. Talent pay is considerably higher in the commercial sector. As he left the BBC after his Radio 2 breakfast show on Wednesday, Chris Evans said it was right ""on balance"" that star salaries were being disclosed. ""We are the ultimate public company I think, and therefore it's probably right and proper people know what we get paid,"" he told reporters. During a briefing on the annual report on Wednesday morning, Lord Hall said: ""Chris Evans is presenting the most popular show on the most popular radio network in Europe. ""The BBC does not exist in a market on its own where it can set the market rates. ""If we are to give the public what they want, then we have to pay for those great presenters and stars."" Aside from Strictly, Winkleman's other BBC roles include presenting The Great British Sewing Bee and her Radio 2 Sunday night show. Her agent said she would be making no comment. If you ask experienced people in the world of broadcasting what they think of these salary disclosures, three clear and consistent points are apparent. First, the BBC pays below - and sometimes much below - market rates, both at management level and in terms of top broadcasting talent. Second, this move will prove inflationary. Those on the list will think to themselves: ""Why is that inferior presenter getting paid more than me?"" - and will demand a pay rise. Third, if you thought it was tin hat time for the talent, pity the poor agents they work with. Read more from Amol here. Casualty star Derek Thompson was the BBC's highest paid actor, receiving between Â£350,000 and Â£400,000 over the last financial year. Amanda Mealing, who also stars in Casualty as well as Holby City, was the highest paid actress, receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. Peter Capaldi, the outgoing star of Doctor Who, was paid between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. Clare Balding earned between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 for her work on sports shows including Wimbledon Today and the Rio Olympics. Casualty stars Derek Thompson and Amanda Mealing are the BBC's best-paid actors The overall spend on talent was Â£193.5m - down on the Â£200m spent in 2015/2016. The figures also showed a decrease - from 109 to 96 - in the number of stars paid more than Â£150,000.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Wages are falling, the economy is slowing"" Theresa May has said she recognises the ""sacrifice"" made by public sector workers as Jeremy Corbyn urged her to lift the 1% cap on their wages. In the last PMQs before the summer break, Mr Corbyn said people were held back by low pay and accused ministers of a ""lack of touch with reality"". Mrs May said she, like the Labour leader, valued public services. ""The difference is on this side of the house we know we have to pay for them,"" she added. Recap: How PMQs unfolded MP wears Scotland football top in Commons Mrs May is seeking to restore order to her party following a series of leaks and negative briefings, with Chancellor Philip Hammond reported to have told a private cabinet meeting public service workers were ""overpaid"". Mr Corbyn asked whether, given the ""squabbling"" inside government, Mr Hammond had been talking about Mrs May's ministers. The SNP's Hannah Bardell, seen in the background, sported a Scottish football shirt in the Commons He urged her to lift the cap on wage rises and cited the case of a nurse living with pay restraint for seven years. ""I look along that front bench opposite and I see a cabinet bickering and backbiting while the economy gets weaker and people are pushed further into debt,"" he added. Mrs May said she recognised the sacrifices made by public servants towards reducing the deficit. She said the Tories had a ""record to be proud of"" and accused Labour of unfunded spending pledges. ""The government doesn't seem to have any problem paying for DUP support,"" Mr Corbyn replied, in a reference to the Â£1bn package that secured the Democratic Unionist Party's backing for the Tories' minority administration. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""When did the Labour Party ever introduce the national living wage?' Never!"" Parliament goes into recess on Thursday and returns on 5 September. Mrs May, under pressure since losing her Commons majority last month, has warned ministers and MPs that any ""backbiting"" between party figures could let Mr Corbyn into Downing Street. During PMQs, Labour MP Ian Murray referred to her as the ""interim prime minister"" when he asked his question. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was now ""something of a backlash"" from MPs towards the ""big beasts"" thought to be manoeuvring themselves behind the scenes to replace her. ""I sense there's a real pushback now to keep her in place at least for the short to medium term,"" he added. A senior backbencher, 1922 Committee vice-chairman Charles Walker, said Mrs May would have MPs' backing if she sacked plotting ministers. And Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon called for military discipline from the cabinet ranks to confront the ""dangerous enemy"" of Mr Corbyn. In an interview with LBC Radio, Mrs May urged ministers to ""accept collective responsibility"". Asked whether there would be any punishment for those who'd leaked private conversations, she said there was ""no such thing as an unsackable minister but at the moment the team is together and we're getting on with the job of delivering what we believe that British public want us to do"".

"A man arrested but never charged in connection with an investigation into child sexual grooming has lost a legal battle to keep his identity secret. Tariq Khuja attempted to use privacy laws to stop press and media reports after he was named at the high profile 2013 trial of nine men from Oxford. TheSupreme Court,externalstressed Mr Khuja was an innocent man but ruled he had no ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" under human rights legislation. The judges lifted an anonymity order. Seven men were convicted and jailed at the Old Bailey in May 2013 for serious sexual offences in connection with what became known as the ""Oxford grooming case"". The Supreme Court ruling, by a 5-2 majority, stemmed from an attempt by the Times and the Oxford Mail newspapers to name Mr Khuja. BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman described the court's decision as significant, saying it reaffirmed the powerful principle of open justice. The case examined the rights of the press and public under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights to freedom of expression and the rights of Mr Khuja and his family under Article 8. Described as a ""prominent figure in the Oxford Area"" Mr Khuja had been arrested in March 2012 after one of the complainants told police she had been abused by a man with his first name.  She failed to pick him out at an identity parade and he was released. Orders imposed during the magistrates and crown court proceedings prevented Mr Khuja's name from being published to prevent reports potentially prejudicing a future trial. He was subsequently told he would be released without charge, although his case would be kept under review. The newspapers applied to lift the anonymity order on the basis there were no pending or imminent proceedings. But Mr Khuja applied to the High Court for a privacy injunction to stop publication on the basis it was needed to protect his private and family life.  The court rejected the application and the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal. Giving the Supreme Court's judgment, Lord Sumption said the case related to matters discussed at a public trial and the public interest in allowing press reporting of court proceedings extended to Mr Khuja's identity. ""The impact on his family life was indirect and incidental. Neither he nor his family participated in any capacity at the trial, and nothing that was said at the trial related to his family,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull: 'We're seeking answers' A Minneapolis police officer whose partner shot an Australian woman was ""startled by a loud sound"" just before the incident, investigators say. Justine Damond, originally from Sydney, was gunned down after calling police to report a possible crime. On a police radio recording, an officer mentions fireworks being let off near where the shooting happened. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said he wants answers from the US over the killing. ""It is a shocking killing, and yes, we are demanding answers on behalf of her family,"" he told Australian TV. This video can not be played Justine Damond's family held a silent dawn vigil on Sydney's Freshwater Beach The shooting occurred as 40-year-old Ms Damond, dressed in her pyjamas, approached the driver's side door to talk to the officer at the wheel after police arrived. Officer Mohamed Noor, who was sitting in the passenger seat, fired his weapon across his partner and through the driver's side window, striking Ms Damond, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said. Officer Noor has refused to speak to investigators and US authorities say they cannot compel him to give a statement. But the BCAsaid,externalthat Officer Matthew Harrity, who was driving the car, had told investigators that Ms Damond had come towards the car immediately after he heard a loud sound. Shot woman's fiancÃ© wants answers Death raises questions about camera use After the shooting, the officers are heard on thepolice radio recording,externaltelling dispatchers they are performing CPR and that ""no suspects are at large"". State investigators say the officers failed to activate their body or dashboard cameras and both officers have been placed on administrative leave. Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman have both raised this question. Minneapolis police are required to switch on their body cameras only during certain encounters, unlike in Los Angeles or Washington DC, where cameras must be switched on for any response to a call for service. Instead, there are more than a dozen situations in which cameras should be used, according tothe police manual,external, which adds that failure to use the camera could result in job termination. ""If a BWC [body-worn camera] is not activated prior to a use of force, it shall be activated as soon as it is safe to do so,"" reads the manual. Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau has described Ms Damond's death as ""tragic"" and called for a quick investigation to provide ""transparency"". Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has said he will personally decide whether to charge Officer Mohamed Noor, rather than put the question to a grand jury. Officer Noor, who has been describedby local media,externalas a Somali-American, has been with the police force for two years. A statement from his lawyer said he had arrived in the US ""at a young age"" and described him as ""a caring person with a family he loves and he empathised with the loss others are experiencing"". This video can not be played ""Justine should be here. This shouldn't have happened"" Ms Damond, born Justine Ruszczyk, studied to be a veterinarian before relocating from Sydney to the US, where she is believed to have been for at least the last three years. According to her website, she was a ""qualified yoga instructor, a personal health and life coach and meditation teacher"". Speaking in Sydney, her father John Ruszczyk said: ""Justine was a beacon to all of us, we only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death."" Ms Damond's death comes a year after Officer Jeronimo Yanezshot Philando Castile, a black man, during a traffic stop in St Paul - the twin city of Minneapolis - in an incident live-streamed on Facebook by his girlfriend. Mr Castile had told the officer that he was licensed to carry a concealed weapon and was reaching for his wallet to get his driving licence out when he was shot, his girlfriend said on the video. Officer Yanez was found not guilty of manslaughter last month - a verdict that Mr Castile's mother said showed the system ""continued to fail black people"". The view from Philando Castile's empty seat on the porch On Wednesday morning, hundreds of people gathered for a dawn vigil at a Sydney beach to honour Ms Damond. In silence, attendees including her family and friends lit candles and released pink flowers into the ocean. ""We are here to come together as a community around our beautiful Justine, to honour her life, share our love and mourn her death,"" Ms Damond's family said in a statement ahead of the vigil.

"The outfits worn by the Royal Family have fascinated many - from the Queen's rainbow coats to the Duchess of Cambridge's tiaras. But fans of the royals will have noticed that they have never seen Prince George in a Spiderman T-shirt or Catherine in a tracksuit. There are etiquette rules governing what members of the Royal Family wear to public engagements - from gloves, to military uniforms, and skirts instead of jeans. Here we reveal the dress code the royals aim to follow. The Queen has become known for her bright and bold hats which she is often pictured wearing while performing official engagements. Dress code etiquette states that women wear hats for formal events, says Diana Mather, a senior tutor for The English Manner etiquette consultancy. ""Up until the 1950s ladies were very seldom seen without a hat as it was not considered 'the thing' for ladies to show their hair in public. ""But all that has changed and hats are now reserved for more formal occasions."" One of the Queen's hats became a hot topic on social media when she officially opened Parliament last month. Using the hashtag #QueensSpeech, many userscompared her floral blue hat to the EU flag. Unlike many three-year-olds, Prince George has yet to be seen wearing a T-shirt of his favourite TV character or a even pair of trousers. Experts say this is because it is royal tradition for young princes and princesses to be formally dressed when they are in public. Instead, Prince George is much more likely to wear a pair of smart shorts and a shirt. Etiquette expert Grant Harrold, known as The Royal Butler, says the tradition dates back to the times of breeching in the 16th Century. He said: ""This saw young boys wearing gowns or dresses until the age of eight, if not before. ""Thankfully in late 19th Century and early 20th Century this developed into shorts. This tradition is carried on by the Royal Family to this very day."" Prince George: The traditional clothes royal children are dressed in No self-respecting lady would be seen without gloves, says Mr Harrold, who tweets etiquette tips via@TheRoyalButler,external. Gloves were traditionally considered a fashion item but also had a practical purpose too - helping stop germs being spread from person to person. With the Queen shaking hands with hundreds of people every year, they serve as a fashion statement but also protect her from bacteria. ""Let's not forget she doesn't always wear gloves when meeting people, therefore it depends on what she is wearing, where she is and what she is doing,"" Mr Harrold adds. In private, who knows whether the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge lounge around in matching onesies. But there is still a dress code to adhere to when dressing casually and being seen in public. For ladies, a smart day dress or trousers teamed with a jacket or cardigan is considered acceptable while for gentlemen it is a blazer with a collared shirt and chinos. Prince William and Catherine tend to follow these traditional rules but sometimes let their modern edge slip on a dress-down day - by wearing jeans. ""Many places will not allow jeans as they are still seen as very casual wear, so it is better to play safe for both sexes,"" says Ms Mather. ""But if the duchess is outside walking the dogs for example, then jeans are fine."" Fans of the Royal Family will not have failed to notice that the Queen's wardrobe encompasses all the colours of the rainbow. She is reported to have once said: ""If I wore beige, nobody would know who I am."" Mr Harrold credits the monarch's personal assistant Angela Kelly for the bold colours she often wears while on duty. It is said that the Queen wears bright colours to ensure members of the public stand the chance of seeing her through the crowds. ""She loves colour and knows it will stand out - good for her I say,"" says Ms Mather. Prince William and Prince Harry have both served in the armed forces and have been pictured wearing military uniforms. The royals often wear their uniforms when they represent their regiments at occasions which are military affairs, such as the Trooping the Colour or services to honour British troops. Prince William served in the RAF but also holds the title of Colonel of the Irish Guards - which has a striking red uniform. He chose to represent the regiment by wearing its colours for his 2011 wedding to Catherine. The Duchess of Cambridge is unlikely to have been seen in public wearing a tiara before her wedding. This is because they are reserved for married women or members of the Royal Family. Tiaras are traditionally worn at formal events, especially when the code is evening dress, says Ms Mather. ""The old rule is that hats are never worn indoors after 6pm, because that is when the ladies changed into evening dress, and tiaras and the family jewels would come out. ""Flashy diamonds and tiaras are not worn during the day, and only married ladies wear tiaras."" Mr Harrold adds: ""For married ladies it was a sign of status and would show you were taken and not looking for a husband. ""For the gentleman it was a clear sign not to make advances toward the lady in question.""

"The average age women become mothers is just over 30 in England and Wales The number of foreign-born mothers having babies in England and Wales in 2016 reached 28% - the highest level on record, official statistics show. This figure has increased every year since 1990. Data from the Office for National Statistics,externalalso shows more women in their 40s are giving birth than women aged under 20. This is the second year in a row this has happened - a pattern last recorded in 1947. The fertility rate for women aged 40 and over has now trebled since 1990, to 15.9 babies born per 1,000 women in that age group. The rate at which women in their 30s are having babies has been on the rise since the 1980s. In contrast, among women under 20 and aged 20-24, fertility rates are now at their lowest level since 1938. The proportion of all live births to mothers born outside the UK stood at 11.6% at the start of the 1990s. The ONS says one of the reasons for the increase since then is that fertility levels are generally higher among foreign-born women. The overall number of live births in England and Wales decreased slightly last year, to just under 700,000. The average age of mothers in 2016 increased to 30.4 years, compared with 30.3 years in 2015. Natika Halil, chief executive of the sexual health charity FPA, said the figures were a reminder that fertility does not stop at 40. ""Although it can take longer and be more difficult to get pregnant if you are over 35, many women over 35 have healthy pregnancies and babies. ""However, this also highlights the importance for women who are not planning to have children, or have completed their family, to continue to use contraception until menopause."" She said cuts to public health budgets could have a future impact on teenage pregnancy rates, which had been falling steadily. ""It's worth noting that the UK still has one of the highest teenage birth rates in Western Europe: three times the rate in Italy, and more than four times the rate in Sweden,"" Ms Halil added. There was a small decrease in the number of deaths - 525,048 - registered in England and Wales last year, following a large increase in 2015. But the number of deaths among people aged 65 to 74 increased, possibly due to those born in the baby boom immediately after World War Two moving into old age. The figures for children dying from asthma were lower than last year, though Asthma UK says the level of boys dying from the condition is the highest since 2004. In 2016, the stillbirth rate decreased to 4.4 per 1,000 total births, the lowest rate since 1992.

Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said its crews attended ""multiple flooding-related incidents"" and urged people to avoid the area. Stan Harris had been laying slate in the village when the rain began to fall. ""We started to hear the rumble and then suddenly I was hit with marbles, hitting me in the face. I couldn't get out. I was just stuck in a shed,"" he said. He said he thought his was the last vehicle to make it out of the village. ""By the time we got up past the lady we were working for, she said we were probably one of the last ones to get through because then another van floated through. ""By the time we got home it was chaos. Absolute chaos."" Assistant Chief Fire officer Phil Martin said there was now a ""pile of rubble"" about ""3ft or 4ft high, that goes across about 20ft"". ""You can see rubble on the beach and debris that's been washed down by the water,"" he added. He described the flash flood as ""devastating"", adding ""when I was listening to this incident unfold on the radio I had a real fear that this was going to have a tragic outcome "". At the scene: Jon Kay, BBC News, Coverack So far, the main focus has been Coverack's pretty harbour, which is littered with debris of every kind. I've seen boulders, fence panels, a shed, a mobility scooter and even a kitchen sink, which have all been washed down from the hills above in the torrents of water. The mud and silt are unpleasant - but that damage is mainly cosmetic. The more worrying aspect of all this for local people is the main road into the village. A route which normally brings in thousands of tourists every day during the summer months is a total mess. The Tarmac has been ripped up. There are holes several feet deep, exposing pipes and cables. Repairing this road looks like a major engineering task. ""But we're Cornish,"" said one local lady. ""We'll cope"". The flood water has completely destroyed the main road into the village A school bus driver caught up in the Coverack flood said he was determined to make sure his sole passenger got home safely after they became stranded on the road into the village. ""The boulders from people's gardens were pummelling the bus,"" said Thomas Duffield, 33. ""They were about the size of a wheel and kept whacking the vehicle, making loud bangs, which was obviously quite worrying."" He kept his foot on the brake pedal even though he had the handbrake on while he waited for help. He said: ""I felt a little bit uneasy about taking my foot off the pedal, because it was like we were in the water rapids."" The Maritime and Coastguard Agency sent a helicopter from Newquay which rescued two people from a house. Water tore through the village on Tuesday afternoon Adam Paynter, Cornwall Council leader, said he hoped the authority's reserves would cover the cost of the clean-up. ""It's been absolutely unbelievable to see,"" he added, ""I think it's going to take a little while to get this sorted out and tidied up but obviously the main thing is that nobody's been injured and everybody is OK in the village. This video can not be played Coverack resident Mary Roberts said the water had swept away her things - including a shed and a kitchen sink At a meeting for local residents earlier Cornwall Councillor Geoff Brown said the authority's main concern was the care home in the village, which has lost power on the ground floor. He added that a generator was on the way. His pledge to ensure the damaged road was repaired quickly, and would take ""weeks rather than months"", was met with loud applause. A major incident was declared at 17:20 on Tuesday and the helicopter was deployed to rescue the people trapped on the roof. Ben Johnston from the Environment Agency said the flood had caused some watercourses to become polluted but drinking water was safe. A bus became stuck in the water on the road into Coverack The bus was still stuck on the road after being trapped by water this morning Have you been affected by the flash flood?

"The average age women become mothers is just over 30 in England and Wales The number of foreign-born mothers having babies in England and Wales in 2016 reached 28% - the highest level on record, official statistics show. This figure has increased every year since 1990. Data from the Office for National Statistics,externalalso shows more women in their 40s are giving birth than women aged under 20. This is the second year in a row this has happened - a pattern last recorded in 1947. The fertility rate for women aged 40 and over has now trebled since 1990, to 15.9 babies born per 1,000 women in that age group. The rate at which women in their 30s are having babies has been on the rise since the 1980s. In contrast, among women under 20 and aged 20-24, fertility rates are now at their lowest level since 1938. The proportion of all live births to mothers born outside the UK stood at 11.6% at the start of the 1990s. The ONS says one of the reasons for the increase since then is that fertility levels are generally higher among foreign-born women. The overall number of live births in England and Wales decreased slightly last year, to just under 700,000. The average age of mothers in 2016 increased to 30.4 years, compared with 30.3 years in 2015. Natika Halil, chief executive of the sexual health charity FPA, said the figures were a reminder that fertility does not stop at 40. ""Although it can take longer and be more difficult to get pregnant if you are over 35, many women over 35 have healthy pregnancies and babies. ""However, this also highlights the importance for women who are not planning to have children, or have completed their family, to continue to use contraception until menopause."" She said cuts to public health budgets could have a future impact on teenage pregnancy rates, which had been falling steadily. ""It's worth noting that the UK still has one of the highest teenage birth rates in Western Europe: three times the rate in Italy, and more than four times the rate in Sweden,"" Ms Halil added. There was a small decrease in the number of deaths - 525,048 - registered in England and Wales last year, following a large increase in 2015. But the number of deaths among people aged 65 to 74 increased, possibly due to those born in the baby boom immediately after World War Two moving into old age. The figures for children dying from asthma were lower than last year, though Asthma UK says the level of boys dying from the condition is the highest since 2004. In 2016, the stillbirth rate decreased to 4.4 per 1,000 total births, the lowest rate since 1992.

"The royal couple also met Holocaust survivors in Poland The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have visited Berlin's Holocaust memorial to pay tribute to the millions of Jewish people who died. Prince William and Catherine saw the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, which represents a graveyard. One survivor told them about his time at Auschwitz, where his parents were killed, and recalled the smell of burning bodies. The couple are on a five-day tour of Poland and Germany with their children. After looking around an underground museum at the memorial, the royal couple learned about some of the stories of the six million Jewish people killed during the Holocaust. The duke and duchess then met a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Leon Schwarzbaum, 96, told them what life was like inside the camp. At the age of 21, he worked as a runner for the camp commander. Leon Schwarzbaum says it took him 10 years to talk about his experience Mr Schwarzbaum showed the duke and duchess pictures of his family and told the duchess six people slept in one bunk. He spoke about the smell of bodies while pointing to a chimney, adding: ""You could smell the chimney throughout the whole camp. It was a terrible smell."" The couple also met several children on their first day in Berlin, at a centre for mental health and young people and also at the Strassenkinder charity for disadvantaged children. Catherine was greeted with hugs by some children, rather than traditional handshakes Some children opted for a high five from Prince William While others cheered alongside the royal couple The duke and duchess also met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and attended a private lunch. Prince William and Catherine were expected to discuss European politics, global issues and volunteer work. This video can not be played The royals were given a tour of the chancellery by Angela Merkel The duke and duchess visited Berlin's famous landmark, the Brandenburg Gate The royal couple, accompanied on the tour by Prince George, three, and Princess Charlotte, two, arrived in Germany after spending two days in Poland, where they met its first democratically-elected president, Lech Walesa, and visited a former concentration camp.

"Polly Rowe says she likes to step outside of her comfort zone For some of us, holidays are becoming more than just a chance to relax in the sun but the chance to experience something different - and this growth in out-of-the-way travel is playing a vital role in many countries' economic development. ""I like to to try and tick off the bucket list if I can,"" says Polly Rowe. The 26-year-old is planning to go to Mexico this October to meet up with an old school friend who is house-sitting at a ranch. ""Might try my hand at some farming,"" she laughs. Last year she went to Belize to volunteer for a marine conservation company, and scuba-dived every day for a month. Her bigger holidays so far have included New Zealand and Japan. When she travels she spends most of her money on flights and experiences. Social media is a big influence on where people are choosing to go ""I try to mainly stay in hostels and then save my money for the bigger experiences and things I want to try out there,"" she says. Polly is part of a generation of travellers seeking not just relaxation and leisure when they take a break from work, but also an experience. Holidays for this age group are now all about the ""braggability factor,"" says Tim Fryer, UK country manager at STA Travel. He says bookings to more adventurous destinations have risen significantly in the past few years. While Thailand remains one of its most popular destinations, the firm has seen an increase in bookings to less mainstream places such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Thailand remains a popular long-haul destination - but faces competition from Sri Lanka and the Philippines ""It's driven by social media influence. They want to discover something unique and special and show everyone,"" he says. The travel agency's customers are predominantly 20-somethings, many of whom are taking a gap year, after finishing school or university. Even here, he said people are now seeking out more unusual options. The traditional year out may now be just six months, or even as long as 18 months. ""We've seen less off the shelf round the world trips and more picking and choosing of 'I want this and I want that',"" he says. Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Iceland, Cyprus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Costa Rica, Georgia and Sri Lanka are some of the countries which are seeing the strongest growth globally in travel and tourism, according to global industry bodyThe World Travel and Tourism Council,external. Their widening appeal is outpacing that of some of the more traditional holiday markets such as India, China and Indonesia. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against all but essential travel to Tunisia This kind of jump in tourism can be a massive boost for a country which has few other ways of generating money. But even in developed nations the sector is crucial. Last year, visitor exports - how much international tourists spend - accounted for some 6.6% of total world exports, and just under a third of total services exports.  Overall the sector was responsible for around 10% of global growth last year. Where we go on holiday is of course determined by wider world events. Traditional holiday destination Tunisia has fallen off the map since the 2015 attack in the resort of Sousse in which 30 British tourists and eight others were killed by a gunman with links to Islamic State. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues toadvise against all but essential travel there,external. Spain Greece Turkey USA Cyprus Source: Thomas Cook, based on UK tour operator and flight-only bookings until 2 May Yet Turkey, hit by security fears last year, has seen its popularity bounce back for this summer, according to Thomas Cook. The country is the third most popular destination for its customers this summer after Spain and Greece. Old favourites the US and Cyprus are fourth and fifth, says the travel agency which arranges travel for around 19 million customers a year. The pound's fall, which is still down around 15% against the dollar since last year's EU referendum, has had a clear impact on holidaymakers' choices with trips to Mexico and South Africa boosted by the relative weakness of their currencies. Nonetheless, Thomas Cook too has noticed a growing appetite for adventure, with families with children going to long-haul destinations that you might not expect. Family package holiday bookings for this summer are up 24% year-on-year to Cuba, 39% to Cancun in Mexico and 17% to the Dominican Republic, it says. The Sao Lourenco do Barrocal hotel complex in Portugal used to be a traditional farming village At the more expensive end of the market, luxury travel club Mr and Mrs Smith says Portugal and Sri Lanka are currently in vogue. The biggest trend the firm's co-founder James Lohan has noticed is that people now want all their trips to be memorable, not just ones taken to mark special occasions such as honeymoons and birthdays. He says FOMO - or fear of missing out - means people now want to ""collect the world"". ""The rise of social media has opened people's eyes to the world's possibilities. People now want transformational travel - something to enrich their lives more,"" he says. Their typical client is ""a slightly cliched cash-rich, time-poor person with an average age of 40,"" he says. Their customers are not after extreme adventures such as climbing Kilimanjaro, but want what he describes as ""boutique adventure more in keeping with a holiday"". In some ways, he says, they're simply re-inventing typical holiday pursuits such as museum tours for a new generation, offering instead things such as photography tours and cookery lessons. 'Frazzled urbanites' want to get back to nature says Mr & Mrs Smith co-founder James Lohan Customers might not even realise it, but they're seeking something beyond just a hotel and ""smart hoteliers are responding to that,"" he says. He says a old Portuguese farming village, which has now been renovated and turned into the Sao Lourenco do Barrocal hotel by Jose Antonio Uva, the eighth generation of the same family to have lived there, is a good example. ""People are excited about things like kitchen gardens and provenance and being part of the hotel's working, particularly us frazzled urbanites. We want to get back to nature and be involved with it all,"" he says. Reflecting their customers' demands, the firm which started out as a publisher, producing a guidebook on the top UK boutique hotels, now organises tailor-made travel itineraries for its travel club members. Isn't it all just a bit stressful for a holiday. Shouldn't people just be relaxing on a beach? He laughs, saying there's still plenty of bookings to ""fly and flop"" destinations. Although for Polly it's not the type of holiday she'll be seeking out. ""I think it's really important to experience different cultures and step outside of your comfort zone,"" she says. ""It's also a great opportunity to come back home with a different perspective.""

"Six million men and women will have to wait a year longer than they expected to get their state pension, the government has announced. The rise in the pension age to 68 will now be phased in between 2037 and 2039, rather than from 2044 as was originally proposed. Those affected are currently between the ages of 39 and 47. The announcement was made in the Commons by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, David Gauke. He said the government had decided to accept the recommendations of theCridland report,external, which proposed the change. This video can not be played The change was announced by Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, David Gauke ""As life expectancy continues to rise and the number of people in receipt of state pension increases, we need to ensure that we have a fair and sustainable system that is reflective of modern life and protected for future generations,"" he told MPs. State pension age could be raised to 70 A longer life means a longer wait for your pension Anyone younger than 39 will have to wait for future announcements to learn what their precise pension age will be. The change will affect those born between 6 April 1970  and 5 April 1978. The government said the new rules would save the taxpayer Â£74bn by 2045/46. While it had been due to spend 6.5% of GDP on the state pension by 2039/40, this change will reduce that figure to 6.1% of GDP. Labour said the move was ""astonishing"", given recent reports suggesting increases in life expectancy were beginning to stall, and long-standing health inequalities between different income groups and regions in retirement. State pension calculator - check your age and entitlement,external Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams told MPs that many men and women were beginning to suffer ill health in the early 60s, well before they were entitled to their state pension. ""Most pensioners will now spend their retirement battling a toxic cocktail of ill-health,"" she said. ""The government talks about making Britain fairer but their pensions policy, whether it is the injustice that 1950s-born women are facing, or today's proposals, is anything but fair."" This video can not be played Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams says the pension change is ""anything but fair"" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the government risked creating ""second-class citizens"". ""In large parts of the country, the state pension age will be higher than healthy life expectancy,"" she said. ""And low-paid workers at risk of insecurity in their working lives will now face greater insecurity in old age too. ""Rather than hiking the pension age, the government must do more for older workers who want to keep working and paying taxes."" Age UK was also critical of the change. ""In bringing forward a rise in the state pension age by seven years, the government is picking the pockets of everyone in their late forties and younger, despite there being no objective case in Age UK's view to support it at this point in time,"" said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK. ""Indeed, it is astonishing that this is being announced the day afternew authoritative researchsuggested that the long term improvement in life expectancy is stalling."" The government has also committed to regular reviews of the state pension age in the years ahead. That raises the prospect of further rises. Indeed a report by thegovernment's actuary department,externalin March suggested that workers now under the age of 30 may have to wait until 70 before they qualify for a state pension. Tom McPhail, head of policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the government would need to do more to encourage saving, particularly amongst younger people. ""For anyone yet to reach age 47, there is still time to adjust their retirement plans by looking to contribute more,"" he said. ""We feel it is important the government meets them halfway; we need a national savings strategy to help people save and invest for their future. A good starting point would be for the government to look at a savings commission."" The SNP said it remained opposed to raising the pension age beyond 66 and reiterated its call for an independent pensions commission to be set up to look at ""demographic differences across the UK"". In response, Mr Gauke said the Scottish government would have the power to provide extra financial help for those approaching retirement if they so chose. ""This announcement will be a blow to many people. It is absolutely crucial that everyone - no matter what their age - seeks pensions advice from a reputable organisation and really understands their options and how those options fit in with their own retirement expectations. ""I know young people don't think this really impacts them as it is such a long way off, but they are the ones who will be impacted by state pension ages and support in the longer term more than any of us,"" said Carl Robertson, fromSmart Pension,external.

"Evans and Winkleman are the BBC's highest paid male and female stars Chris Evans has topped the list of the BBC's best-paid stars. He made between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m in 2016/2017, while Claudia Winkleman was the highest-paid female celebrity, earning between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. About two-thirds of stars earning more than Â£150,000 are male, compared to one-third female, according to theBBC annual report,external. Director general Tony Hall said there was ""more to do"" on gender and diversity. BBC pay: Who earns what? What will the industry make of star pay? Stars on their pay Reality Check: The gender pay gap It is the first time the pay of stars earning more than Â£150,000 has been made public. The BBC has been compelled to reveal the information, including the pay of 96 of its top stars, under the terms of its new Royal Charter. The total bill for the 96 personalities was Â£28.7m; but the figures in the report reveal large disparities betweenwhat men and women are paid,external. Overall, 25 men on the talent list receive more than Â£250,000, compared to just nine women. Speaking on LBC Radio, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We've seen the way the BBC is paying women less for doing the same job... I want women to be paid equally."" When asked if Chris Evans was worth 12 of her, Mrs May - who earns about Â£150,000 - said: ""What's important is that the BBC looks at the question of paying men and women the same for doing the same job."" ""On gender and diversity, the BBC is more diverse than the broadcasting industry and the civil service,"" Lord Hall said. ""We've made progress, but we recognise there is more to do and we are pushing further and faster than any other broadcaster."" When asked if female talent working at the BBC would now be asking for pay rises, Lord Hall said: ""We will be working carefully on our relationship with our talent."" Woman's Hour'sJane Garvey tweeted,external: ""I'm looking forward to presenting @BBCWomansHour today. We'll be discussing #GenderPayGap . As we've done since 1946. Going well, isn't it?"" Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, who did not appear on the list,retweeted Garvey's message,external. There is also a gap between the pay for white stars and those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background. George Alagiah, Jason Mohammad and Trevor Nelson are the highest paid BAME presenters, each receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. The highest-paid female star with a BAME background is BBC news presenter Mishal Husain, who earned between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. The annual report contains pay information in bands and does not reveal exact amounts. Nor does it include stars who receive their pay through BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm. The figures quoted only refer to the amount of licence fee money each person receives and do not include their earnings from other broadcasters or commercial activities. They also exclude stars paid through independent production companies. That means some big name stars - such as David Attenborough, Benedict Cumberbatch and Matt LeBlanc - do not appear on the list. The list also does not distinguish between people who are paid for doing multiple jobs within the BBC and those who are just paid for one. Two of the judges on Strictly are in a higher pay bracket than the others - but they also work for other BBC shows Strictly Come Dancing head judge Len Goodman - who has now left the show - and fellow judge Bruno Tonioli were both in the Â£200,000-Â£250,000 band. The show's other judges, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell, got between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000. Tess Daly, Winkleman's Strictly Come Dancing co-host, was paid between Â£350,000 and Â£400,000. Graham Norton earned more than Â£850,000 but this does not include payments to his production company, which makes The Graham Norton Show and pays him a separate salary. The BBC is alone amongst the UK's major broadcasters in releasing pay details for its on-air and on-screen talent. Talent pay is considerably higher in the commercial sector. As he left the BBC after his Radio 2 breakfast show on Wednesday, Chris Evans said it was right ""on balance"" that star salaries were being disclosed. ""We are the ultimate public company I think, and therefore it's probably right and proper people know what we get paid,"" he told reporters. During a briefing on the annual report on Wednesday morning, Lord Hall said: ""Chris Evans is presenting the most popular show on the most popular radio network in Europe. ""The BBC does not exist in a market on its own where it can set the market rates. ""If we are to give the public what they want, then we have to pay for those great presenters and stars."" Aside from Strictly, Winkleman's other BBC roles include presenting The Great British Sewing Bee and her Radio 2 Sunday night show. Her agent said she would be making no comment. If you ask experienced people in the world of broadcasting what they think of these salary disclosures, three clear and consistent points are apparent. First, the BBC pays below - and sometimes much below - market rates, both at management level and in terms of top broadcasting talent. Second, this move will prove inflationary. Those on the list will think to themselves: ""Why is that inferior presenter getting paid more than me?"" - and will demand a pay rise. Third, if you thought it was tin hat time for the talent, pity the poor agents they work with. Read more from Amol here. Casualty star Derek Thompson was the BBC's highest paid actor, receiving between Â£350,000 and Â£400,000 over the last financial year. Amanda Mealing, who also stars in Casualty as well as Holby City, was the highest paid actress, receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. Peter Capaldi, the outgoing star of Doctor Who, was paid between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. Clare Balding earned between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 for her work on sports shows including Wimbledon Today and the Rio Olympics. Casualty stars Derek Thompson and Amanda Mealing are the BBC's best-paid actors The overall spend on talent was Â£193.5m - down on the Â£200m spent in 2015/2016. The figures also showed a decrease - from 109 to 96 - in the number of stars paid more than Â£150,000. The total spend on stars with salaries of more than Â£150,000 was also down Â£5 million on the Â£31.9 million paid in the previous financial year. This video can not be played Ex-BBC chairman Lord Grade describes the corporation's disclosure of talent pay as ""disturbing"" Speaking on the Today programme, Lord Grade - a former BBC One controller - called the government's insistence that talent pay be disclosed ""distasteful and disturbing"". ""The net result of this is inflation,"" he said. ""Talent salaries and wages will round upwards, they won't go down."" Former culture secretary John Whittingdale MP said: ""If somebody is earning the equivalent of 1,000 households' licence fees put togetherâ¦ the licence fee payer deserves to know."" The annual report showed that the BBC continues to reach 95 percent of UK adults every week.

"This video can not be played Trump-Putin dinner talks highly unusual, says Ian Bremmer US President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had another, previously undisclosed conversation at this month's G20, the White House has confirmed. They spoke towards the end of a formal dinner but the White House has not revealed what was discussed. President Trump has condemned media revelations of the talks as ""sick"". The two leaders' relationship is under scrutiny amid allegations of Russian interference in the US election. US intelligence agencies believe Moscow tried to tip the election in Mr Trump's favour, something denied by Russia. Mr Trump has rejected allegations of any collusion. Did Trump-Putin chat break protocol? Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House The extra conversation happened during a private meal of heads of state at the G20 summit in Hamburg earlier in the month. The Kremlin said at the time that the two leaders had had ""an opportunity to continue their discussion during the dinner"", but the extent of the meeting was not known. Mr Trump left his seat and headed to Mr Putin, who had been sitting next to Mr Trump's wife, Melania, US media said. The US president was alone with Mr Putin, apart from the attendance of the Russian president's official interpreter. Mr Trump had been seated next to Japanese PM Shinzo Abe's wife, so the US interpreter at the dinner spoke Japanese, not Russian. No media were in attendance. Jonathan Marcus, BBC News defence and diplomatic correspondent Given the poor state of relations between Washington and Moscow and the controversy surrounding Russia's efforts to interfere with the US presidential campaign, each and every encounter between Mr Putin and Mr Trump is bound to be carefully scrutinised. Thus the apparently impromptu discussion between the two men at the G20 dinner inevitably raises many questions. What was President Trump seeking to do in approaching the Russian president? Were matters of substance discussed? If so, why was no formal note taken? And why did the US president have to rely upon a Russian official for translation? This is all highly unusual, especially at a time when relations between the two countries are laden with so many problems. Mr Trump also appeared unaware of another dimension - the message that his tete-a-tete would send to other leaders in the room, who must have watched the US president's gambit with some unease. Mr Trump's spokesperson Sarah Sanders told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that the dinner was part of the president's publicly released schedule. ""You guys came and took pictures of it,"" she told journalists. ""It wasn't like this was some sort of hidden dinner. To act as if this was some secret is just absolutely absurd."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two leaders had ""exchanged opinions and phrases in the margins of the visit on more than one occasion"". ""There were no covert or secret meetings. It is absolutely absurd to claim this,"" he was quoted as saying by Russia's TASS news agency. Mr Peskov also mocked the notion that the subject of a conversation between the two men could have been kept secret, saying that is a ""manifestation of schizophrenia"". The length of the talks has been disputed. Ian Bremmer, president of the US-based Eurasia Group, who first reported them in a newsletter to clients, said: ""Donald Trump got up from the table and sat down with Putin for about an hour. It was very animated and very friendly."" This video can not be played What Trump said of his first, formal meeting with Putin No-one else was nearby, so the topics of discussion were not known, he said. Mr Bremmer had not been at the dinner but said details were given to him by unnamed attendees who, he said, were ""flummoxed, confused and startled"" by the turn of events. ""At summit meetings you have little 'pull-asides' between heads of state to discuss business all the time - a one-hour pull-aside is highly unusual in any context,"" he told the BBC. ""A one-hour pull-aside between Putin and Trump where only the Kremlin translator is there, where we don't know what's discussed, given the uniqueness of the US-Russia relationship... makes the [US] president, surprisingly and disturbingly, not credible."" In a statement, a senior White House official said there was no ""second meeting"", just a brief conversation after dinner. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The official said: ""The insinuation that the White House has tried to 'hide' a second meeting is false, malicious and absurd. It is not merely perfectly normal, it is part of a president's duties, to interact with world leaders."" National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton said: ""A conversation over dessert should not be characterised as a meeting."" Mr Trumplater said on Twitter:,external""Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is 'sick.' All G20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!"" The dinner and its attendees have always been known. Only the Trump-Putin discussion had not been reported before. Trump and Putin: Comparing the men At the dinner, Mr Trump's wife, Melania, sat next to Mr Putin At the earlier, formal meeting, their first face-to-face encounter,Mr Trump saidhe had repeatedly pressed Mr Putin about the allegations of interference in the US vote. ""I said, 'Did you do it?' He said, 'No, I did not, absolutely not.' I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, 'Absolutely not.'"" There are congressional investigations, and one by a special counsel, into the allegations of Russian interference in the US election and possible collusion with the Trump team. On Tuesday, the Senate intelligence committee said it wanted to interview Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, and other members of the Trump team, over a meeting they had with a Russian lawyer in June last year. Mr Trump Jrsaid he had attended the meetingwith Natalia Veselnitskaya as he was promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton, but it did not materialise. On Wednesday, Ms Veselnitskaya told Russia's RT television channel she would be willing to testify before the Senate on the matter. This video can not be played Commander in tweets: What we can learn from Trump's Twitter Judge me on four things, said Trump. So we did What has Trump said about your country? Trump's promises before and after election Meanwhile, the White House said Mr Trump would nominate former Utah governor Jon Huntsman as ambassador to Russia, a key post for a president who promised to improve relations with Moscow. Mr Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China and Singapore, needs to have his name confirmed by the Senate. The suspicions over Russian interference are likely to play a significant factor in his confirmation process, correspondents say.

"The Marine Stewardship Council said North Sea cod stocks have recovered enough to be considered sustainable North Sea cod is now sustainable and can be eaten with a ""clear conscience"", a fisheries body has said. The fish has been considered under threat for more than a decade after stocks fell to 36,000 tonnes in 2006. But the industry has agreed measures to help regenerate the population, including new nets and closing spawning areas to fishing. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) said it could now be sold with its ""blue tick"" label. The label indicates that North Sea cod caught by Scottish and English boats is ""sustainable and fully traceable"". Cod stocks in the North Sea reached 270,000 tonnes in the 1970s. After the 2006 low, the fishing industry began work with the Scottish government and the EU Fisheries Council to agree a recovery plan. The MSC said the announcement that cod was now sustainable was a ""momentous achievement"" for the industry and was the result of work of a coalition of fishing organisations, supermarkets, seafood brands and the industry body Seafish. However, conservation body WWF has warned that historically, the population of North Sea cod remains at a low level. The stocks have to be independently assessed before they can be given the MSC blue tick. Skipper David Milne aboard MSC-certified Adorn. A range of conservation measures have been put in place to protect the cod stocks Barry Reid, skipper of the Audacious mooring up at Peterhead in north-east Scotland Cod is one of the UK's most popular fish, with almost 70,000 tonnes eaten each year, but the MSC said a recent YouGov survey showed there was confusion about whether it was sustainable or not. Toby Middleton, MSC programme director for the north-east Atlantic said: ""Today's certification marks the end of the cod confusion. ""If you can see the MSC label on your cod, you know that it has come from a sustainable source. By choosing fish with that label, you will be helping to protect stocks long into the future."" He added: ""Thanks to a collaborative, cross-industry effort, one of our most iconic fish has been brought back from the brink. ""Modified fishing gear, catch controls, well-managed fishing practices - all these steps have come together to revive a species that was in severe decline."" This video can not be played Cod is one of the UK's most popular fish As part of the plan to regenerate stocks, boats were allocated a certain number of days fishing which were linked to the conservation measures they signed up to. The fishing industry is also able to close fishing areas at short notice to protect local populations and has developed a system of remote monitoring using CCTV cameras on board boats. Mike Park, chairman of the Scottish Fisheries Sustainable Accreditation Group said: ""This is a massive development for the catching sector and is a testament to the power of collective action. ""The years of commitment to rebuilding North Sea cod has shown that fishermen are responsible and can be trusted to deliver stable and sustainable stocks. The consumer can now eat home-caught cod with a clear conscience."" This video can not be played ""The cod recovery plan was a joint effort,"" MSC spokesperson tells Radio 4's World at One However, the WWF has warned that the population levels of North Sea cod remained low compared with 50 years ago. Lyndsey Dodds, head of UK marine policy at WWF said: ""The recovery of cod in the North Sea reflects what's possible if fishermen work together with fisheries managers, scientists and the wider industry to recover fish stocks. ""However, the amount of North Sea cod at breeding age is well below late 1960s levels and recovery remains fragile. ""If we're to get North Sea cod back on British plates for good, it's vital that we don't lose focus on sustainably managing fish stocks and ensuring the protection of the marine wildlife and habitats as the UK develops its post-Brexit fisheries policy. ""Embracing new technology and installing cameras on the UK fleet would be a highly cost-effective and efficient way to help manage and monitor cod catches, as well as the range of other fish also caught by these boats.""

About 50 properties were damaged and several people had to be rescued in Coverack, on the Lizard Peninsula, as storms hit on Tuesday afternoon.

""You can see rubble on the beach and debris that's been washed down by the water,"" he added. He described the flash flood as ""devastating"", adding ""when I was listening to this incident unfold on the radio I had a real fear that this was going to have a tragic outcome "". At the scene: Jon Kay, BBC News, Coverack So far, the main focus has been Coverack's pretty harbour, which is littered with debris of every kind. I've seen boulders, fence panels, a shed, a mobility scooter and even a kitchen sink, which have all been washed down from the hills above in the torrents of water. The mud and silt are unpleasant - but that damage is mainly cosmetic. The more worrying aspect of all this for local people is the main road into the village. A route which normally brings in thousands of tourists every day during the summer months is a total mess. The Tarmac has been ripped up. There are holes several feet deep, exposing pipes and cables. Repairing this road looks like a major engineering task. ""But we're Cornish,"" said one local lady. ""We'll cope"". The flood water has completely destroyed the main road into the village A school bus driver caught up in the Coverack flood said he was determined to make sure his sole passenger got home safely after they became stranded on the road into the village. ""The boulders from people's gardens were pummelling the bus,"" said Thomas Duffield, 33. ""They were about the size of a wheel and kept whacking the vehicle, making loud bangs, which was obviously quite worrying."" He kept his foot on the brake pedal even though he had the handbrake on while he waited for help. He said: ""I felt a little bit uneasy about taking my foot off the pedal, because it was like we were in the water rapids."" The Maritime and Coastguard Agency sent a helicopter from Newquay which rescued two people from a house. Water tore through the village on Tuesday afternoon Adam Paynter, Cornwall Council leader, said he hoped the authority's reserves would cover the cost of the clean-up. ""It's been absolutely unbelievable to see,"" he added, ""I think it's going to take a little while to get this sorted out and tidied up but obviously the main thing is that nobody's been injured and everybody is OK in the village. This video can not be played Coverack resident Mary Roberts said the water had swept away her things - including a shed and a kitchen sink At a meeting for local residents earlier Cornwall Councillor Geoff Brown said the authority's main concern was the care home in the village, which has lost power on the ground floor. He added that a generator was on the way. His pledge to ensure the damaged road was repaired quickly, and would take ""weeks rather than months"", was met with loud applause. A major incident was declared at 17:20 on Tuesday and the helicopter was deployed to rescue the people trapped on the roof. Ben Johnston from the Environment Agency said the flood had caused some watercourses to become polluted but drinking water was safe. A bus became stuck in the water on the road into Coverack The bus was still stuck on the road after being trapped by water this morning Have you been affected by the flash flood?

"This video can not be played How do you avoid holiday traffic jams? Motorists are being warned of heavy traffic as about nine million vehicles take to the roads over the weekend ahead of a summer getaway. The RAC predicts 36.5 million ""leisure"" journeys in the first fortnight of the English and Welsh school holidays. It said drivers would experience ""customary chaos"" and warned of traffic hotspots on motorways to popular destinations. The busiest period is likely to be Saturday between 11:00 and 16:00 BST. RAC traffic spokesman Rod Dennis said: ""This weekend will bring unwelcome customary chaos to Britain's major roads as people flock to take advantage of the first week or two of the summer holidays on home soil. ""While not as busy as Easter, which is typically the pinnacle of leisure traffic due to it being the first break for several months, the Great British summer holiday getaway begins with an initial rush for the roads this weekend as that's when the majority of schools break up. ""Sadly, for many the very much-needed family summer holiday might begin stressfully as long tailbacks are inevitable, particularly in the South West on the M5 which is the main conduit to the beaches of Devon and Cornwall.""

"Burning cladding on Grenfell Tower would have released 14 times more heat than a key government test allows, the Victoria Derbyshire show has learned. Energy emitted from the cladding and insulation would have been equivalent to burning 51 tonnes of pinewood, University of Leeds research suggests. The cladding's plastic core would have burned ""as quickly as petrol"", it said. The contractors who fitted the cladding and insulation said they both passed all regulations. According to data released by French authorities, and seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, the cladding would have released 43.2 MJ/kg of heat. The European A2 standard for ""limited combustibility"" is 3 MJ/kg. The foam insulation underneath the cladding was, separately, thought to emit around 26 MJ/kg of heat. Figures from UK government tests have not yet been made publicly available. The work to fit Grenfell Tower's cladding was completed in 2016 An estimated 18 tonnes of insulation foam and eight tonnes of cladding panels were attached to the tower, analysis of planning documents by the University of Leeds suggests. The energy released when all these combustible materials burned would have been equivalent to around 51 tonnes of pinewood wrapped around the building in two thin 12mm sheets, separated by a 50mm gap with holes cut out for windows, it says. ""If you set that on fire near the bottom you can imagine what would happen and how fast the fire will grow,"" Dr Roth Phylaktou, a senior lecturer specialising in fire and explosion engineering at the university, told the BBC. ""This is not dissimilar to the wood cribs that we use in fire science to create fast-growing fires that reach a large size very quickly."" Dr Phylaktou believes the configuration of the cladding and the foam - known as polyisocyanurate (PIR) - was ""optimum for vertical fire spread"". ""This explains the speed of the fire propagation. The polyethylene in the cladding would have burnt as quickly as petrol,"" he added. He believes the air gap between the insulation and the external cladding panels on Grenfell Tower may have created a so-called ""chimney effect"", increasing the speed of the fire spreading. ""The insulation formed another combustible layer underneath which would also give off toxic fumes,"" he added. The type of PIR foam used, Celotex RS5000, and the brand of cladding, Reynobond PE, have now been withdrawn from sale for use in buildings over 18m high. Even if cladding or insulation do not meet the European A2 standard for limited combustibility, they can theoretically still be allowed on the outside of a tall building if combined with other components in a whole system which passes a different type of test, known as BR135. An independent company, BRE, is now conducting tests for the government to see how different combinations of insulation and cladding perform in the event of a serious fire. BRE also conducts fire tests for the private sector anda local government leader has called for the release of test data which is considered commercially confidential. In its marketing Arconic, which manufactures Reynobond PE panels, has never claimed the product met the ""limited combustibility"" standard. It said it was only ""one component"" in the overall cladding system. Saint-Gobain, which manufacturers the Celotex RS5000 PIR, said it could not comment while there was an investigation into the circumstances around the Grenfell Tower fire.

"The pay received by the BBC's biggest stars is to be revealed in the corporation's annual report later. It is the first time this information will be made public. The review, to be published at 11:00 BST, will list the 96 stars who earn more than Â£150,000 a year. Altogether, their earnings total almost Â£30m. Only one third of the names on the list are women. BBC director general Lord Hall said it highlighted a need to ""go further and faster"" on gender issues. However, he stressed the corporation was ""pushing faster than any other major broadcaster"". Lord Hall said he wanted to close the gender pay gap and have equality on screen and radio by 2020, saying that over the last three years nearly two-thirds of new people and those promoted on TV and radio were women. ""Is this progress enough? It's absolutely not,"" he said. The BBC said that its overall talent bill has been reduced by more than Â£4m over the last financial year, to Â£194m. ""I completely understand that to lots and lots of people these are very large sums but we are a global broadcaster, in a very competitive market,"" Lord Hall told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""And we have to be competitive but not foolishly. ""No-one would want us to be paying sums where it's not at a discount to the market. People expect us to have great broadcasters, great presenters, great stars but pay them less than they would get in the market."" This video can not be played Tony Hall, BBC director general, says publishing stars' pay details will be 'inflationary' He said he was ""satisfied"" that every one of the 96 top earners were worth the money. The BBC's annual report looks back over the previous year's performance and publishes details about the corporation's finances and spending. It will also look at TV and radio viewing figures, and online engagement. It may also examine the BBC's competition, such as Netflix. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said publishing the salaries of stars earning more than Â£150,000 would bring the BBC ""in line with the civil service"" on transparency. She told the Commons last September that it would help ensure the BBC ""produces value for money for the licence fee"" and that more transparency could lead to savings that could be ""invested in even more great programmes"". Lord Hall said the publication of top salaries, which he had fought, was a ""bad idea"" because it could tempt other broadcasters with deep pockets to poach stars creating an inflationary effect on pay. He also urged caution when comparing rates paid to different individuals, saying their responsibilities may vary widely even if their on-air roles appeared similar. ITV's programmes chief Kevin Lygo called the proposal a ""mean-spirited, nosey way of looking at things"" during last year's Edinburgh Television Festival. The corporation already publishes data on how much it spends on talent including information about how many people earn above certain pay bands without naming them. Former Conservative culture secretary John Whittingdale, who proposed the BBC should go further by revealing stars' pay, told the Today programme: ""If somebody is earning the equivalent of 1,000 households' licence fees put together, going to one single person, then the licence fee payer deserves to know."" Presenters such as Graham Norton, Claudia Winkleman, Gary Lineker and Chris Evans are expected to be there. Leading journalists Fiona Bruce, Andrew Marr, John Humphrys and political editor Laura Kuenssberg are also expected to be included. The revelations are required under the BBC's new Royal Charter. On the list, the stars' names will appear within Â£50,000 pay bands. The sums will only include pay for work carried out directly for the BBC, not other production companies. For example, Norton's will cover pay for his Radio 2 radio show and Eurovision, but not his chatshow which is produced by independent company, So Television. According to last year's annual report, 109 TV and radio presenters earned more than Â£150,000 in the financial year 2015-16. But they were not named at the time. From next year, any stars employed by the newly-formed BBC Studios, which produces Antiques Roadshow and Doctor Who, will not be included on the list. This is because it will become a commercial operation and will operate and be treated in the same way as an independent production company. Some have. Match of the Day presenter Gary Linekertweeted:,external""Happy BBC salary day. I blame my agent and the other TV channels that pay more. Now where did I put my tin helmet?"" In a Twitter exchange, he admitted that he has turned down a bigger salary from a privately-owned broadcaster in the past. Asked why, he replied: ""Because I love and value my job and BBC Sport."" Andrew Marr said it's ""uncomfortable for all of us"". ""I'm well paid but I'm much less overpaid, perhaps, than people working for rival organisations who won't go through this process,"" he said, according toreported the Telegraph last month.,external ButStrictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman said,externallast year: ""I'm all for it. We get paid an awful lot of money and it's a marketplace. It's bonkers. ""I love working for the BBC. I know that commercial stations pay a whole lot more - double, three times, four times. But I totally understand why people would want to know."" We should also find out how the BBC's television and radio channels and stations have performed over the last year. And it's also a chance to discover more about the BBC's audiences - who is tuning in to TV, radio and the websites, for instance.

"This video can not be played Reinwood Junior School is one of several in West Yorkshire which carries out lockdown drills Schools need a coherent strategy for lockdown procedures in case of a dangerous event taking place on their premises, a teaching union said. The NASUWT said schools currently had ad hoc drills to deal with various threats and called on the government to put together a comprehensive plan. More than 200 head teachers in West Yorkshire have attended council-run seminars providing advice on lockdowns. The government said it ""constantly reviewed"" security guidance it issues. The seminars, run in collaboration with police, the fire service and the North East Counter Terrorism Unit, give advice on managing a potentially violent or dangerous event in or around a school. Five have been held since the beginning of 2016, with organisers aiming to have covered every school in West Yorkshire by Easter 2018. Scenarios covered include noxious fumes from a fire or chemical incident, weapons in school, animals in school grounds, aggressive pupils or parents and bomb threats. Many schools across the UK practise lockdown drills Huddersfield's Reinwood Junior School is one of several in West Yorkshire which carries out lockdown drills, with pupils and staff practising twice a year. After a pre-recorded alarm and message is played from the tannoy, pupils get under tables, teachers lock classroom doors, lights are turned off and window shutters pulled down. Ian Darlington, Year Six teacher at the school, said it was better to practise so that it ""almost becomes second nature"" to the pupils. ""Initially it might appear that we are raising concerns, raising children's fears, but in actual fact they're quite calm doing it now,"" he said. ""They understand the importance of doing it and it doesn't worry them."" Reinwood Junior School carries out a lockdown drill twice a year Chris Keates, NASUWT General Secretary, said: ""Responsibility for ensuring security and terrorism preparedness should be the responsibility of the whole governing body. ""It would not be appropriate for the government simply to require schools to have preparedness plans in place and assume that they are able to do this. ""Schools will already have plans in place to respond to a range of emergency scenarios, but it's important that they are given specific advice and support on what additional provisions are considered necessary and the support and advice to implement them."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Schools have a legal responsibility to ensure staff and pupils are safe.

"The BBC's admission that two-thirds of its highest-paid stars are men - ahead of the disclosure of the salaries of all top-earning presenters - makes the lead for the Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail and the i. The Telegraph says the corporation is braced for a staff revolt,externalas employees discover that colleagues in the same job are paid vastly more. In some cases, the paper continues, female presenters who sit alongside male colleagues on the same shows will be revealed to earn less. It quotes one well-known female presenter as saying the corporation is stuffed with ""male 'intellectual titans' with egos the size of planets"" who demand huge salaries and get them. The Mail runs the story under the headline,external: ""Pay panic at the BBC."" It says the stars have been warned to expect public anger over the huge salaries - and a backlash from staff on lower salaries. The story is reported in most of the other papers, too. TheSun,externalheadlines its newspaper coverage: ""British Blokes Corp."" The Guardian says the BBC will allow its stars to engage with critics,externaland defend themselves on social media after their pay is revealed. It has offered support and advice on dealing with the fallout, the paper adds. The Guardian's lead is a call by Conservative backbenchers for Theresa May,externalto sack any disloyal ministers found to have leaked details of cabinet meetings or plotted against her leadership. According to the paper, three senior members of the backbench 1922 Committee have said the prime minister has their full support to re-establish discipline in her team and rejected the idea of a leadership election. A number of papers publish the first official picture of the cabinet at Downing Street since the post-election reshuffle - alongside reports of Mrs May's plea to ministers to unite and not to brief the media about cabinet discussions. The Times has the headline,external: ""Ministers keep a lid on their squabbles for official photo."" The Daily Mirror describes it as a ""jolly"" photo,externalbut says potential leadership contenders were uncomfortably lined up together - and two bitter rivals - Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - sat awkwardly next to each other on the front row. The Times leads on the announcement that surcharges for using credit and debit cards,externalare to be outlawed from next year - a move it believes that could save shoppers Â£500m a year. It says the ban follows an investigation by the paper that exposed widespread abuse of laws designed to stop companies using card charges to pad out profits. Airlines, travel agents, ticket booking websites, universities and councils were among those found to be levying fees of up to 3.5%, it adds. Finally, news that North Sea cod has been certified as sustainable, a decade after stocks were facing collapse, is welcomed. TheFinancial Times,externalsays cod has been consumed in Britain at least since the arrival of the Norsemen in the 9th Century - and its return caps a remarkable recovery for a popular fish.

"This video can not be played Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull: 'We're seeking answers' A Minneapolis police officer whose partner shot an Australian woman was ""startled by a loud sound"" just before the incident, investigators say. Justine Damond, originally from Sydney, was gunned down after calling police to report a possible crime. On a police radio recording, an officer mentions fireworks being let off near where the shooting happened. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said he wants answers from the US over the killing. ""It is a shocking killing, and yes, we are demanding answers on behalf of her family,"" he told Australian TV. This video can not be played Justine Damond's family held a silent dawn vigil on Sydney's Freshwater Beach The shooting occurred as 40-year-old Ms Damond, dressed in her pyjamas, approached the driver's side door to talk to the officer at the wheel after police arrived. Officer Mohamed Noor, who was sitting in the passenger seat, fired his weapon across his partner and through the driver's side window, striking Ms Damond, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said. Officer Noor has refused to speak to investigators and US authorities say they cannot compel him to give a statement. But the BCAsaid,externalthat Officer Matthew Harrity, who was driving the car, had told investigators that Ms Damond had come towards the car immediately after he heard a loud sound. Shot woman's fiancÃ© wants answers Death raises questions about camera use After the shooting, the officers are heard on thepolice radio recording,externaltelling dispatchers they are performing CPR and that ""no suspects are at large"". State investigators say the officers failed to activate their body or dashboard cameras and both officers have been placed on administrative leave. Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman have both raised this question. Minneapolis police are required to switch on their body cameras only during certain encounters, unlike in Los Angeles or Washington DC, where cameras must be switched on for any response to a call for service. Instead, there are more than a dozen situations in which cameras should be used, according tothe police manual,external, which adds that failure to use the camera could result in job termination. ""If a BWC [body-worn camera] is not activated prior to a use of force, it shall be activated as soon as it is safe to do so,"" reads the manual. Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau has described Ms Damond's death as ""tragic"" and called for a quick investigation to provide ""transparency"". Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has said he will personally decide whether to charge Officer Mohamed Noor, rather than put the question to a grand jury. Officer Noor, who has been describedby local media,externalas a Somali-American, has been with the police force for two years. A statement from his lawyer said he had arrived in the US ""at a young age"" and described him as ""a caring person with a family he loves and he empathised with the loss others are experiencing"". This video can not be played ""Justine should be here. This shouldn't have happened"" Ms Damond, born Justine Ruszczyk, studied to be a veterinarian before relocating from Sydney to the US, where she is believed to have been for at least the last three years. According to her website, she was a ""qualified yoga instructor, a personal health and life coach and meditation teacher"". Speaking in Sydney, her father John Ruszczyk said: ""Justine was a beacon to all of us, we only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death."" Ms Damond's death comes a year after Officer Jeronimo Yanezshot Philando Castile, a black man, during a traffic stop in St Paul - the twin city of Minneapolis - in an incident live-streamed on Facebook by his girlfriend. Mr Castile had told the officer that he was licensed to carry a concealed weapon and was reaching for his wallet to get his driving licence out when he was shot, his girlfriend said on the video. Officer Yanez was found not guilty of manslaughter last month - a verdict that Mr Castile's mother said showed the system ""continued to fail black people"". The view from Philando Castile's empty seat on the porch On Wednesday morning, hundreds of people gathered for a dawn vigil at a Sydney beach to honour Ms Damond. In silence, attendees including her family and friends lit candles and released pink flowers into the ocean. ""We are here to come together as a community around our beautiful Justine, to honour her life, share our love and mourn her death,"" Ms Damond's family said in a statement ahead of the vigil.

"This video can not be played Reinwood Junior School is one of several in West Yorkshire which carries out lockdown drills Schools need a coherent strategy for lockdown procedures in case of a dangerous event taking place on their premises, a teaching union said.

More than 200 head teachers in West Yorkshire have attended council-run seminars providing advice on lockdowns. The government said it ""constantly reviewed"" security guidance it issues. The seminars, run in collaboration with police, the fire service and the North East Counter Terrorism Unit, give advice on managing a potentially violent or dangerous event in or around a school.

"The pay received by the BBC's biggest stars is to be revealed in the corporation's annual report later. It is the first time this information will be made public. The review, to be published at 11:00 BST, will list the 96 stars who earn more than Â£150,000 a year. Altogether, their earnings total almost Â£30m. Only one third of the names on the list are women. BBC director general Lord Hall said it highlighted a need to ""go further and faster"" on gender issues. However, he stressed the corporation was ""pushing faster than any other major broadcaster"". Lord Hall said he wanted to close the gender pay gap and have equality on screen and radio by 2020, saying that over the last three years nearly two-thirds of new people and those promoted on TV and radio were women. ""Is this progress enough? It's absolutely not,"" he said. The BBC said that its overall talent bill has been reduced by more than Â£4m over the last financial year, to Â£194m. ""I completely understand that to lots and lots of people these are very large sums but we are a global broadcaster, in a very competitive market,"" Lord Hall told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""And we have to be competitive but not foolishly. ""No-one would want us to be paying sums where it's not at a discount to the market. People expect us to have great broadcasters, great presenters, great stars but pay them less than they would get in the market."" This video can not be played Tony Hall, BBC director general, says publishing stars' pay details will be 'inflationary' He said he was ""satisfied"" that every one of the 96 top earners were worth the money. The BBC's annual report looks back over the previous year's performance and publishes details about the corporation's finances and spending. It will also look at TV and radio viewing figures, and online engagement. It may also examine the BBC's competition, such as Netflix. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said publishing the salaries of stars earning more than Â£150,000 would bring the BBC ""in line with the civil service"" on transparency. She told the Commons last September that it would help ensure the BBC ""produces value for money for the licence fee"" and that more transparency could lead to savings that could be ""invested in even more great programmes"". Lord Hall said the publication of top salaries, which he had fought, was a ""bad idea"" because it could tempt other broadcasters with deep pockets to poach stars creating an inflationary effect on pay. He also urged caution when comparing rates paid to different individuals, saying their responsibilities may vary widely even if their on-air roles appeared similar. ITV's programmes chief Kevin Lygo called the proposal a ""mean-spirited, nosey way of looking at things"" during last year's Edinburgh Television Festival. The corporation already publishes data on how much it spends on talent including information about how many people earn above certain pay bands without naming them. Former Conservative culture secretary John Whittingdale, who proposed the BBC should go further by revealing stars' pay, told the Today programme: ""If somebody is earning the equivalent of 1,000 households' licence fees put together, going to one single person, then the licence fee payer deserves to know."" Presenters such as Graham Norton, Claudia Winkleman, Gary Lineker and Chris Evans are expected to be there. Leading journalists Fiona Bruce, Andrew Marr, John Humphrys and political editor Laura Kuenssberg are also expected to be included. The revelations are required under the BBC's new Royal Charter. On the list, the stars' names will appear within Â£50,000 pay bands. The sums will only include pay for work carried out directly for the BBC, not other production companies. For example, Norton's will cover pay for his Radio 2 radio show and Eurovision, but not his chatshow which is produced by independent company, So Television. According to last year's annual report, 109 TV and radio presenters earned more than Â£150,000 in the financial year 2015-16. But they were not named at the time. From next year, any stars employed by the newly-formed BBC Studios, which produces Antiques Roadshow and Doctor Who, will not be included on the list. This is because it will become a commercial operation and will operate and be treated in the same way as an independent production company. Some have. Match of the Day presenter Gary Linekertweeted:,external""Happy BBC salary day. I blame my agent and the other TV channels that pay more. Now where did I put my tin helmet?"" In a Twitter exchange, he admitted that he has turned down a bigger salary from a privately-owned broadcaster in the past. Asked why, he replied: ""Because I love and value my job and BBC Sport."" Andrew Marr said it's ""uncomfortable for all of us"". ""I'm well paid but I'm much less overpaid, perhaps, than people working for rival organisations who won't go through this process,"" he said, according toreported the Telegraph last month.,external ButStrictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman said,externallast year: ""I'm all for it. We get paid an awful lot of money and it's a marketplace. It's bonkers. ""I love working for the BBC. I know that commercial stations pay a whole lot more - double, three times, four times. But I totally understand why people would want to know."" We should also find out how the BBC's television and radio channels and stations have performed over the last year. And it's also a chance to discover more about the BBC's audiences - who is tuning in to TV, radio and the websites, for instance.

"Burning cladding on Grenfell Tower would have released 14 times more heat than a key government test allows, the Victoria Derbyshire show has learned. Energy emitted from the cladding and insulation would have been equivalent to burning 51 tonnes of pinewood, University of Leeds research suggests. The cladding's plastic core would have burned ""as quickly as petrol"", it said. The contractors who fitted the cladding and insulation said they both passed all regulations. According to data released by French authorities, and seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, the cladding would have released 43.2 MJ/kg of heat. The European A2 standard for ""limited combustibility"" is 3 MJ/kg. The foam insulation underneath the cladding was, separately, thought to emit around 26 MJ/kg of heat. Figures from UK government tests have not yet been made publicly available. The work to fit Grenfell Tower's cladding was completed in 2016 An estimated 18 tonnes of insulation foam and eight tonnes of cladding panels were attached to the tower, analysis of planning documents by the University of Leeds suggests. The energy released when all these combustible materials burned would have been equivalent to around 51 tonnes of pinewood wrapped around the building in two thin 12mm sheets, separated by a 50mm gap with holes cut out for windows, it says. ""If you set that on fire near the bottom you can imagine what would happen and how fast the fire will grow,"" Dr Roth Phylaktou, a senior lecturer specialising in fire and explosion engineering at the university, told the BBC. ""This is not dissimilar to the wood cribs that we use in fire science to create fast-growing fires that reach a large size very quickly."" Dr Phylaktou believes the configuration of the cladding and the foam - known as polyisocyanurate (PIR) - was ""optimum for vertical fire spread"". ""This explains the speed of the fire propagation. The polyethylene in the cladding would have burnt as quickly as petrol,"" he added. He believes the air gap between the insulation and the external cladding panels on Grenfell Tower may have created a so-called ""chimney effect"", increasing the speed of the fire spreading. ""The insulation formed another combustible layer underneath which would also give off toxic fumes,"" he added. The type of PIR foam used, Celotex RS5000, and the brand of cladding, Reynobond PE, have now been withdrawn from sale for use in buildings over 18m high. Even if cladding or insulation do not meet the European A2 standard for limited combustibility, they can theoretically still be allowed on the outside of a tall building if combined with other components in a whole system which passes a different type of test, known as BR135. An independent company, BRE, is now conducting tests for the government to see how different combinations of insulation and cladding perform in the event of a serious fire. BRE also conducts fire tests for the private sector anda local government leader has called for the release of test data which is considered commercially confidential. In its marketing Arconic, which manufactures Reynobond PE panels, has never claimed the product met the ""limited combustibility"" standard. It said it was only ""one component"" in the overall cladding system. Saint-Gobain, which manufacturers the Celotex RS5000 PIR, said it could not comment while there was an investigation into the circumstances around the Grenfell Tower fire.
