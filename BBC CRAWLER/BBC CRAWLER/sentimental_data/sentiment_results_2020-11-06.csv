"An artist's impression of Highview's planned energy storage facility Work is beginning on what is thought to be the world's first major plant to store energy in the form of liquid air. It will use surplus electricity from wind farms at night to compress air so hard that it becomes a liquid at -196 Celsius. Then when there is a peak in demand in a day or a month, the liquid air will be warmed so it expands. The resulting rush of air will drive a turbine to make electricity, which can be sold back to the grid. The 50MW facility near Manchester will store enough power for roughly 50,000 homes for five hours. The system was devised by Peter Dearman, a self-taught backyard inventor from Hertfordshire, and it has been taken to commercial scale with a Â£10m grant from the UK government. ""It's very exciting,"" he told BBC News. ""We need many different forms of energy storage - and I'm confident liquid air will be one of them."" The energy plant will use surplus electricity from wind farms at night Mr Dearman said his invention was 60-70% efficient, depending how it is used. That is less efficient than batteries, but he said the advantage of liquid air is the low cost of the storage tanks - so it can easily be scaled up. Also, unlike batteries, liquid air storage does not create a demand for minerals which may become increasingly scarce as the world moves towards power systems based on variable renewable electricity. ""Batteries are really great for short-term storage,"" Mr Dearman said. ""But they are too expensive to do long-term energy storage. That's where liquid air comes in."" Mr Dearman had been developing a car run on similar principles with liquid hydrogen when he saw the potential for applying the technology to electricity storage. He is now a passive shareholder in Highview, one of the firms building the 50MW plant. Prof John Loughhead, from the government's business and energy department, has previously praised the technology. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin You've got cheap data, how about cheap power too?

"Half a million borrowers mis-sold payday loans by collapsed lender Sunny are likely to receive no more than 1% of their compensation entitlement. Administrators KPMG are emailing all those who have a right to a payout, inviting them to make a claim. But they are warning that the funds available mean they may not receive a penny, or 1% at most. However, victims of mis-selling will automatically have negative entries on their credit records cleared. This will be done automatically by the end of November, with any notes of defaults on their first five Sunny loans cleared, and notices of any subsequent loans deleted entirely. That should help those struggling to access credit, as a result of their history with Sunny, having more success in the future. Wonga collapses into administration Payday lender's collapse to hit borrowers Sunny was one of a series of high-profile payday lenders to have collapsed, mostly in response to a wave of complaints over the mis-selling of short-term, high-cost loans. Many of these loans were found to have been unaffordable to repay, and should never have been granted. Wonga was the most high-profile collapse in August 2018, followed by other big names in the sector such as WageDay Advance and QuickQuid. Many of Sunny's payday loans were found to have been unaffordable to repay Sunny, the brand name of Elevate Credit International Limited, fell into administration in June. In October, some of the existing loan book was sold to Perch Capital, and others were written off. Administrators then assessed how many of Sunny's 700,000 customers had been mis-sold loans, and concluded that 500,000 had been affected and could make a claim. It is emailing all of them in the coming weeks. Others whose cases have already been dealt with by the Financial Ombudsman, but have not received any payout, can also put in a claim for compensation. All claims must be submitted by the end of January. ""Whilst the dividend will depend on the volume of claims and queries received, we estimate that any dividend payable could be less that 1p in the pound and that any payment would likely be made in spring 2021,"" the administrators said. Debt adviser Sara Williams, who runs theDebt Camel blog,external, said: ""Since Wonga went under, the figures have been emerging about the massive scale of payday loanÂ mis-selling. ""These show how ineffective regulation was at preventing so many people being trapped in unaffordable debt for so long.""

"Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home have been placed into administration, putting thousands of jobs at risk. The clothing retailer had 328 sites and 2,571 staff across the UK, while homeware store Ponden had 329 staff. Today 866 jobs were lost across the two chains adding to the hundreds that went after 64 stores across the two brands were permanently closed. EWM Group owns both chains but is still trying to strike a rescue deal to save remaining brands, Peacocks and Jaeger. A spokesperson for EWM Group said: ""Over the past month we explored all possible options to save Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home from going into administration, but unfortunately the ongoing trading conditions caused by the pandemic and lockdowns proved too much. ""It is with a heavy heart we acknowledge there is no alternative but to place the businesses into administration."" Tony Wright, the joint administrator from business advisory firm FRP, said both Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden were trading well before the coronavirus pandemic and FRP would continue to search for buyers for the businesses so they do not disappear completely. He added: ""Regrettably, the impact of Covid-19 on the brands' core customer base and tighter restrictions on trading mean that the current structure of the businesses is unsustainable and has resulted in redundancies.

"Paul Dunleavy was jailed for five years and six months, after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court A teenager who was part of a banned neo-Nazi group has been jailed for preparing acts of terrorism. A judge ruled 17-year-old Paul Dunleavy can be named but described his efforts to commit the act as ""inept"". Dunleavy had admitted nine counts of possessing terror manuals and also hadvideos of the New Zealand terror attack in 2019, in which 51 people died. At Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Paul Farrer QC jailed the defendant for five years and six months. Dunleavy, who had denied preparing an attack, had joined a neo-Nazi group called Feuerkrieg Division (FKD) in July last year, the court was told. The group was created by a 13-year-old Estonian andwas outlawed in the UK this summer after being linked to terrorism cases around the world. Notepads made by the teenager and a gun were recovered from his room Judge Farrer said Dunleavy had offered practical advice on firearms to other FKD members, some of whom have gone on themselves to be convicted of terrorism offences in other countries. The judge told the defendant he harboured an intention to commit an act of terrorism, but added it was unlikely the he would have followed through, describing his preparations as ""inept"". He added: ""Your autism impacts on your maturity and understanding."" Latest news from the West Midlands Prosecutors said FKD's aim was to overthrow the liberal democratic system by bringing about a race war through individuals carrying out acts of mass murder. After joining FKD's online chat group, Dunleavy unwittingly began communicating with an undercover police officer, telling him: ""I'm getting armed and getting in shape."" The court was told Dunleavy had researched how to convert a blank-firing gun and asked an adult friend for advice on where to buy one. Dunleavy had an ""unhealthy interest in other attacks across the world"", police said Following his arrest at his home in September 2019, West Midlands Police said detectives seized his phone, finding over 90 documents on firearms, explosives and military tactics, right wing material and online chat conversations. They also found several knives, air rifles, face coverings, camouflage face paint, shotgun cartridges and bullet casings. ""This boy had an unhealthy interest in other attacks across the world and he knew exactly what online platforms to join to share his extreme views,"" said Det Ch Supt Kenny Bell, head of West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. ""He believed he had the skills to convert a blank firing weapon into a viable firearm and was willing to help others with his abilities.""

"People queued for Covid tests in Liverpool as the first trial of city-wide testing in England got under way. The city's Mayor Joe Anderson said the pilot could save lives, stop hospitals being overwhelmed and ""get the city out of tier three restrictions"". Everyone living or working in the city will be offered regular and repeat tests, whether or not they have symptoms. The pilot will last for approximately two weeks, the government said. But Liverpool's director of public health Matthew Ashton told BBC Breakfast it could last longer, saying he wants ""to make sure [the pilot is] long enough for us to be able to see the impact"". As of Friday a further 23,287 people tested positive for coronavirus across the UK and a further 355 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported,according to government figures,external. It takes the total deaths by that measure to 48,475. How will Liverpool's mass testing pilot work? Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? People will be offered a mix of existing swab tests and new lateral flow tests, which could provide a result in 20 minutes without the need to use a lab. New test sites have been set up across the city, in schools, universities, work places and care homes. Six new test centres,externalfor people who do not have symptoms, at the Exhibition Centre Liverpool and at council-run sports centres, are open between 12:00 GMT and 19:00, with more sites planned. Anyone who does have symptoms can get a swab test at one of the existing mobile testing centres in the city, which can also be accessed by those without symptoms. About 2,000 military personnel are helping deliver the tests. Liverpool City Council has said it is particularly keen to test health and care workers, teachers, school pupils and university staff and students, although everyone is being asked to come forward. People without symptoms are being asked to get a test at one of six new sites across the city Mr Ashton said there was capacity for up to 85 testing centres to be set up by the end of the pilot, which he said was open for ""an initial 10 days"" and could be extended. On the aim of the pilot, he said: ""Success is lowering the levels of the virus in the city and exiting out of the national lockdown in a much stronger position."" ByPhil McCann, BBC Cheshire political reporter The queue here at Liverpool Tennis Centre is snaking past the tennis courts. One woman says she has come along because she understands how important it is. This is one of the testing centres where people are coming without symptoms, but they still stick swabs up your nose and down your throat. The big difference is what happens after. Inside the centre is like a hospital ward - apart from the army is in town because this is too big an operation for the council to carry out on its own. There are booths so you have a little privacy. These have a little window, and out the back of the window there are trestle tables - where the army can take the swab and put them through these rapid tests. It certainly looks like a smooth operation at the moment. It will have to be as the queue is only getting longer. The new lateral flow tests will detect people with the ""highest viral loads"" - assumed to be the most infectious people, according to Dr Emily Adams, a senior lecturer at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The scientist told BBC News that as this would detect about ""three-in-four or four-in-five"" cases, it was important people still follow guidelines to self-isolate if they show symptoms - and get a regular swab test. But she said the lateral flow tests ""work very well in an asymptomatic population"", and that she was ""optimistic"" they would have a big impact in Liverpool. Mass testing is similar to cancer screening - testing healthy people and acting early if there are any problems. The hope is this can be used to stamp out an outbreak, by getting everyone who tests positive to isolate, without turning to strict restrictions. China has done this on multiple occasions by mass testingeveryone in a cityafter a cluster of cases was detected. But a group of health experts has written to Liverpool MPs arguing that testing asymptomatic people in the city was ""like searching for needles that appear transiently in haystacks"". Signatories include Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, and Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health based in Bristol. Soldiers have been deployed to help with planning, administering the tests, and offering logistical support - such as in distribution, clerical roles and as drivers Among those getting tested on Friday was former nurse Cathleen Hodson, who said she thought it was imperative she took part in the pilot. ""I'm over 80. I know how important this is. I've got ten grown-up grandchildren and ten great grandchildren. I know how important it is, not just for me but for them,"" she said. Liverpool Football Club manager Jurgen Klopp hasshared a video message,externalasking people to get tested, saying ""do it for Liverpool"", and pointing out that regular testing has helped the Premier League to continue amidst the pandemic.

"This video can not be played David Sillito looks back on the career of Geoffrey Palmer Actor Geoffrey Palmer, known for his roles in such sitcoms as Butterflies, As Time Goes By and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, has died aged 93. He died peacefully at home, his agent said. Versatile and prolific, he was known and loved for his hangdog expression, lugubrious delivery and the often testy demeanour he gave to his characters. As Time Goes By saw him star with Dame Judi Dench, a partnership they revived in Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. He also acted in Mrs Brown, again with Dench, and The Madness of King George. Obituary: Geoffrey Palmer Dame Judi, who starred in nine series of As Time Goes By with Palmer, told BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme: ""Geoffrey was master of comedy, an absolute master."" Paying tribute to his ""wonderful deadpan expression"", she added: ""I've admired him all my life. How lucky to have been in something with him for so long."" His co-star in Butterflies from 1978 to 1983, Wendy Craig, told the programme: ""He was just a delight to work with, his timing was perfect."" Despite his ""rather serious face"", she said he was ""full of fun"" in person. ""When he laughed and when he smiled his whole face lit up, his eyes twinkled. He was always up for a laugh and not a heavy-going serious person at all,"" she said. His early television roles included appearances in The Army Game, The Saint and The Avengers and he went on to appear in Doctor Who and the Kipper and the Corpse episode of Fawlty Towers. The Doctor Who programme listed the shows he had appeared in with a tribute on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Palmer appeared in four series of the Carla Lane sitcom, in which he played the stuffy husband of Wendy Craig's Ria. Yet it was his partnership with Dench in As Time Goes By for which he will perhaps be best remembered. Palmer worked with Judi Dench in As Time Goes By The BBC sitcom, about two former lovers who meet unexpectedly and later marry, ran from 1992 to 2005. In 2018 Dame Judi described her co-star as ""the naughtiest man I ever had the pleasure to work with"" as she gave him a prize at that year's Oldie Awards. In Tomorrow Never Dies, released in 1997, Palmer's combative Admiral Roebuck sparred with Dame Judi's M, the head of the secret service. Producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli,externalremembered the actor as ""a much beloved star of TV and film and a treasured member of the Bond family"". Palmer's distinctive voice made him a popular choice for narration, audiobooks and adverts. He narrated the Grumpy Old Men series and introduced British viewers to ""Vorsprung durch Technik"" in adverts for Audi cars. Actress Frances Barber remembered an occasion when he had queried a residuals payment he had received for the ubiquitous commercial. ""I just called my agent and said they've put too many 0's on the cheque,""she recalled him saying,external. ""After lunch he said 'Apparently they haven't'. His face didn't change."" In his later years Palmer was seen in Paddington, Parade's End and W.E, in which he was directed by pop star Madonna. He was made an OBE in 2004 for services to drama. This video can not be played Actor Geoffrey Palmer on high speed rail plan Palmer, a keen fly fisherman, campaigned against the HS2 railway line, the proposed route of which ran close to his home in the Chilterns.

"The increase in coronavirus infections appears to be slowing around the UK, the Office for National Statistics says In the week to 30 October, figures suggest new daily infections in England stabilised at around 50,000 The UK's R number remains between 1.1 and 1.3, meaning on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 others Meanwhile, a mass-testing pilot has started in Liverpool, with all those living and working there offered tests, whether or not they have symptoms Mayor Joe Anderson said the two-week testing pilot could save lives and stop hospitals being overwhelmed Denmark has been taken off the UK's travel corridor list, with those arriving from the country now having to self-isolate for 14 days It comes as Danish authorities say a lockdown will be introduced in some areas over a coronavirus mutation found in mink that can spread to humans Students at the University of Manchester have torn down ""prison-like"" fencing erected around their campus A further 355 deaths were reported in the UK on Thursday and 23,287 more have tested positive for coronavirus Edited by Holly Wallis Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, we'll be back on Monday morning. Today's reporters were Lauren Turner, Cherry Wilson and Hamish Mackay. The editor was Holly Wallis. Here's a recap of the day's top stories:  We heard today that the UK's R rate - the number of people each Covid-positive person goes on to infect - is between 1.1 and 1.3, but that varies across the nations and regions. Hospital admissions also vary across the UK. Just as Northern Ireland is the only place where the R number is below 1, it is also seeing the lowest number of hospital admissions. And finally, following a further 355 deaths within 28 days of a postive test, the official death toll for the UK has reached 48,475. The prime minister  has defended data used by the government to justify the lockdown in England, saying the ""data is really irrefutable about what is happening now in the country."" A chart presented at Saturday's No 10 briefing suggested a worse-case figure of up to 1,500 deaths a day by 8 December, but that has been adjusted down to 1,010 a day, after an error was found. Downing Street said it accepted a mistake had been made but the ""underlying analysis"" of the threat to the NHS was correct. Asked about it on a visit to Leicestershire, Boris Johnson said: ""The thing is the data is really irrefutable about what is happening in the country - that's why we've had to take the action we have and I very much regret it. ""But if you look at the admissions to hospitals, they are 25% up on last week, the overall number of Covid patients in hospitals is now more than 10,000... and climbing quite fast, and the number of deaths alas is on an upward curve."" We've been asking for your views about the pilot testing programme in Liverpool, where anyone who lives or works in the city is being offered regular and repeated tests, whether or not they have symptoms. Here are some of the comments that have been made.     James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Scientists at the Francis Crick Institute have discovered that some children had antibodies in their blood that could attack the new coronavirus before the pandemic started. They argue this may help to explain why children are less likely to become severely ill with Covid-19. It is thought these antibodies come from being infected with other types of coronavirus. There are four coronaviruses that spread each winter and cause common cold symptoms in people. But they âlookâ similar enough to the Covid virus that some antibodies work against both the old viruses and the new one. These âcross-reactiveâ antibodies were found in 21 out of 48 blood samples collected from children between 2011 and 2018. However, it is still not clear how much protection these antibodies give, if any, or why the same pattern is not seen in adults.

The BBC was invited into the University Hospital Coventry and all filming was done in accordance with coronavirus safety rules. The organiser of a birthday party attended by as many as 60 people has been handed a Â£10,000 fine for flouting lockdown rules. West Midlands Police released body-worn video footage from officers in Wolverhampton, showing dozens of revellers exiting a venue. Inside were balloon arches, food and drinks scattered on tables, and a kitchen piled high with soft drinks and alcohol, despite the premises having no alcohol licence. West Midlands Police said: ""This was a blatant breach of coronavirus law."" It added the fine was ""necessary"" given it was a ""critical time for the health of the city"". There are 289 cases per 100,000 people in Wolverhampton. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This video can not be played Patients suspected to have Covid-19 are kept separate from others. A doctor at Bradford Royal Infirmary has explained the challenges of facing Covid-19 in the accident and emergency department. The main hospital currently has more Covid-19 patients than it did during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. Dr Alexander Wibberley said: ""Every day we get people that need to be put on breathing machines. ""It's hectic, it's busy, everybody's working flat out."" This video can not be played Covid-19: How have case rates changed in the firebreak? The case rates - the number of positive tests per 100,000 people over seven days - helps us look at where infections are spreading and how fast. There have been worries over how the number of cases have risen in the Heads of the Valleys, with Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent seeing cases start to spike and become among the worst in the UK. Wrexham and around Swansea and Neath Port Talbot have also seen rises during the firebreak period. But there are signs of improvement in the most recent sets of figures. The number of Covid-19 patients needing hospital care in Northern Ireland's north west is slowing down, health chiefs have said. It's a region that for a time in October hadthe UK's highest coronavirus infection rate. The Western Trust's director of acute hospitals, Geraldine McKay, said there is now a plateau in admissions to Londonderry's Altnagelvin Hospital. But the number of patients needing intensive care remains high, she said. ""Critical care is still moving up and is under pressure at this moment in time so that is where we find ourselves, but patients coming into hospital with Covid seems to have plateaued,"" Ms McKay said. Sixty-three coronavirus patients are currently being treated at the hospital, 11 of them in the intensive care unit. A further 355 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19 within the previous 28 days have been reported in the UK. This brings the UK total to 48,475. The government added that, as of 09:00 GMT on Friday, there had been a further 23,287 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 1,146,484. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 64,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK.  The US economy added 638,000 jobs in October, which was the slowest growth in five months but still helped to push the unemployment rate below 7%. Jobs were added in leisure and hospitality as US lockdown measures were eased, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate fell to 6.9% from 7.9%, with 11.1 million Americans out of work. September's data was revised up to show that 672,000 jobs were created. The results were better than expected. Economists polled by the Reuters newswire had expected growth of 600,000 jobs in October. Read more on this storyhere.

Vicarage Court care home in Featherstone created the pod for less than Â£1,000. Glynis Millington, who has used the pod to visit her mother, said: ""At the beginning of the lockdown, it was months before I could see my mum. ""So, to be able to come and see her and talk to her, see what she's like, is brilliant."" Earlier, we reported that Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital was postponing all non-emergency procedures due to Covid - and roughly 300,000 people waiting for operations in Greater Manchester could now face a similar situation. The Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust says that it is cancelling some non-urgent operations in the area so it can treat emergency cases - including patients with Covid-19. A statement from the trust read: âWe have had to take the difficult decision to pause some of our planned procedures including some surgery and outpatient appointments. ""This decision will be kept under review and has been taken for the safety of all our patients as currently we must treat more patients who are attending our hospitals with Covid-19 who require specialist and critical care support."" It added: âWe have written to those people who are affected by this decision and local GPs and will be contacting them directly with revised dates for their appointments and procedures."" The number of Covid-19 related deaths registered in Northern Ireland has passed 1000. According to thelatest bulletin from the government statistics agency Nisra,external, 51 deaths were registered in the week to Friday 30 October. That is nine more than the previous week, and takes the total to 1,023. Nisra also said the week to the 30 October saw Covid-19 related deaths in hospitals and care homes at levels last seen in April and May. Read the full storyhere. A leading retail lobby group has questioned the government lockdown rules which state which shops are essential and what they can sell. The British Retail Consortium, which represents the industry, said the new guidance creates ""arbitrary"" lines over what is or is not essential. A supermarket can, for example, sell ""non-essential"" homeware if it is stocked on its aisles. But if the goods are situated on a separate floor, it must close the area. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulations at the BRC, said: ""Unfortunately for many people, this means they cannot visit shops to get the items that are essential to them, from the home office equipment and electronics they need for work, or the pots, pans, fridges and freezers they need during lockdown.""

"Mr Johnson believes there is 'a deal to be done' ""Significant differences"" between the UK and the EU remain, as negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal continue, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday, the PM said progress had been made but there were still issues around the ""level playing field"" and fishing. Both parties agreed negotiating teams would resume talks in London on Monday. They also agreed to remain ""in close contact"" over the coming days. A statement from Downing Street on Saturday said: ""Prime Minister Boris Johnson today spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a stock take on the progress in the negotiations between the UK and the EU. ""The prime minister set out that, while some progress had been made in recent discussions, significant differences remain in a number of areas, including the so-called level playing field and fish. ""The prime minister and president agreed that their negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, in order to redouble efforts to reach a deal. ""They agreed to remain in personal contact about the negotiations,"" the statement said. Echoing Mr Johnson, Ms von der Leyen acknowledged ""some progress had been made, but large differences remain"". ""Our teams will continue working hard next week,"" she wrote on Twitter.

The prime minister has said he believes there is ""a deal to be done"" and ""very much hopes"" to come to an agreement, but he has insisted the country was ""very well prepared"" to move on should the two parties not be able to agree a deal. Meanwhile, the National Audit Office has warned of ""significant disruption"" when the Brexit transition period ends. 'Differences remain' after Brexit trade talks Trade talks are back on - but what's changed? Brexit: What is a level playing field? The UK left the EU on 31 January and entered the transition period - continuing to follow many EU rules - while a trade deal was negotiated. But while both sides said a deal needed to be done in October, they have yet to come to an agreement, and talks between the negotiating teams have intensified. The transition period is due to come to an end on 31 December, meaning the UK would trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules - meaning tariffs are imposed - if a deal is not in place. Critics say this could cause damage to the UK economy, but the government insists the country will prosper with or without a deal. Earlier this week, both the UK and EU's chief trade negotiatorswarned of ""wide"" and ""serious divergences"" between the two sides. Sticking points include fishing rights, competition rules and how a deal would be enforced. Asked on Friday if the UK could get a deal in the next 10 days, Mr Johnson said: ""I very much hope that we will, but obviously that depends on our friends and partners across the Channel. ""I think there is a deal to be done, if they want to do it. ""If not, the country is, of course, very well prepared. As I have said before, we can do very well with on Australian terms [without a deal], if that is what we have to go for."" Thomas Byrne, Ireland's minister for European affairs, said the talks up to this point between the EU and UK's negotiators, Michel Barnier and David Frost, had been ""difficult"", with ""big issues"" still remaining. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I personally don't expect that there would me major progress today, but at the same time I think it's very good that they are talking - I think that's really positive. But I'm not sure that we would expect a moment at this point."" Has US election slowed down Brexit negotiations? Mr Byrne was also asked if there could be a ""new dynamic"" to discussions between the UK and EU if Joe Biden was elected the US president, saying it was ""certainly possible"". Mr Biden, who has Irish roots, said in September that he wouldnot allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit""if he was elected president. Mr Byrne said: ""He was very clear in his suggestion and statement on the 16th of September that any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent on respect for the Good Friday Agreement and preventing the return of the hard border.""

"Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home have been placed into administration, putting thousands of jobs at risk. The clothing retailer had 328 sites and 2,571 staff across the UK, while homeware store Ponden had 329 staff. Today 866 jobs were lost across the two chains adding to the hundreds that went after 64 stores across the two brands were permanently closed. EWM Group owns both chains but is still trying to strike a rescue deal to save remaining brands, Peacocks and Jaeger. A spokesperson for EWM Group said: ""Over the past month we explored all possible options to save Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home from going into administration, but unfortunately the ongoing trading conditions caused by the pandemic and lockdowns proved too much. ""It is with a heavy heart we acknowledge there is no alternative but to place the businesses into administration."" Tony Wright, the joint administrator from business advisory firm FRP, said both Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden were trading well before the coronavirus pandemic and FRP would continue to search for buyers for the businesses so they do not disappear completely. He added: ""Regrettably, the impact of Covid-19 on the brands' core customer base and tighter restrictions on trading mean that the current structure of the businesses is unsustainable and has resulted in redundancies.

"Bryce Hall accused Ariana Grande of chasing clout with her comments A minor war of words has broken out after Ariana Grande criticised social media influencers for partying during the coronavirus pandemic. The pop star condemned people who were gathering at the cowboy-themed Saddle Ranch restaurant in LA, which has become a hangout for Tik Tok stars. ""Couldn't we have stayed at home just a few more weeks?"" she asked on The Zach Sang Show last week. Tik Tok creator Bryce Hall dismissed her comments as a ""marketing move"". ""Because she knew that Tik Tokers have a high audience, she knew a lot of people would agree,""he said on the Hollywood Raw podcast,external, ""because there's a lot of people that hate TikTokers especially"". ""I mean, it was obviously like a marketing move and good for her,"" he added. ""But like, she's not wrong."" Grande's comments came during an hour-long interview to promote her new album, Positions, which is on course to top the UK charts this week. ""Did we all need to go to [expletive] Saddle Ranch that badly that we couldn't wait for the deathly pandemic to pass?"" she said.

"Nick Rewcastle says the government should be helping people who are starting their own businesses in the pandemic Chancellor Rishi Sunak has dramatically changed course by extending the furlough scheme until the end of March and pledging more generous help for self-employed people. Support through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) will be increased, with the third grant covering November to January calculated at 80% of average trading profits, up to a maximum of Â£7,500. But not everyone has welcomed the new measures. While some see them as a lifeline, others are dismayed that they fail to qualify for much-needed assistance. Nick Rewcastle, of Peacehaven in Sussex, is one of the latter. Before the pandemic struck, he was head of the communications team at Harlequins Rugby Club. He spent three months on furlough before being made redundant, then decided to strike out on his own by founding his own sports PR consultancy, NRPR. Sunak to extend furlough scheme to end of March Was it right to extend the furlough scheme? The 'anger, hope, despair' of the self-employed ""The fact that I'm newly self-employed means I don't qualify for any support,"" he told the BBC. ""I've managed to find a few clients and that's keeping me busy until mid-December, but then in January it's looking pretty scary. ""I'm doing my own thing and it's brilliant, but as far as the government is concerned, they don't care. ""It's disappointing. It doesn't make sense that people like me are being left in the dark."" Mr Rewcastle is unimpressed by Mr Sunak's assurance that anyone made redundant after 23 September can be rehired and put back on furlough. ""Harlequins aren't in a position to take anyone back,"" he says. ""He's saying all these people can go back into work, but businesses are so unstable at the moment, people who've been made redundant are going to stay redundant."" Greg Wilson runs a one-man company and has furloughed himself Greg Wilson, 35, of Wells in Somerset, has managed to qualify for some support, although his income has taken a hit from the pandemic. He is the owner and director of a ""one-man band"" company, Chew Valley Generators, which supplies electricity to weddings and other events. He would normally service about 120 events a year, but that fell to just six this year. As a result, he took the decision to furlough himself. ""Furlough has been a lifesaver for myself and my small company, as we missed every other grant,"" he told the BBC. However, like many other company directors, he normally pays himself a salary of Â£1,000 a month and takes the rest of his income in dividends, which are not included in his furlough. That means the government is paying him 80% of his salary - that is, Â£800 a month. Mr Wilson objects to what he sees as the government's ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to company directors. ""They class me as the same sort of director as Richard Branson,"" he says. ""But as well as being director, I'm also the tea-boy, the delivery driver and the service engineer."" He describes the furlough extension as ""amazing news"". With the scheme now ending in March and the events season running from April to October, he hopes it will tide him over. ""We get to wait until April to see what happens,"" he says. ""Fingers crossed, we will be back."" Jewellery designer Sarah Herriot, 58, also runs her one-woman set-up as a limited company, but decided that furloughing herself would be bad for her business in the long term. Sarah Herriot is striving to save her business ""I've been working six days a week trying to keep my business afloat,"" she told the BBC. ""I've worked very hard at it and to be fair, I've managed to keep my head above water."" Before the onset of coronavirus, she mainly sold her jewellery at shows and fairs, but these have all been cancelled, so she is now left with her website. ""That's not really working, so I've been surviving on commissions and bits and pieces of work,"" she says. The only support she has received is a local discretionary business grant from Camden council in London, because she was able to demonstrate that she had lost 70% of her income during the pandemic. Ironically, she says, she would have been able to make a claim under the Job Support Scheme, which had originally been set to replace the furlough scheme this month, but that has now been postponed. ""I would have had to go down to one day a week to get that. That's the first thing that I could have applied for,"" she says. ""But now we're back to furlough, so I'm out in the cold again. ""It makes me angry. It's so depressing, it beggars belief. All these businesses going to the wall and you wonder whether you're going to be next.""

"The actress said she ""did not connect limb difference"" with her Grand High Witch character The Witches star Anne Hathaway has promised to ""do better"" following the criticism the film has received for its portrayal of limb difference. The actress acknowledged that many people ""are in pain"" over the way her Grand High Witch character is depicted. ""I owe you all an apology,""she wrote on Instagram,external. In the new adaptation of Roald Dahl's 1983 book, the witches are revealed to have three elongated fingers on each hand and toe-less feet. Comedian Alex Brooker and others with hand and arm impairments have accused the film of being insensitive towards disabled people. ""To me It sends out a message that we should be scared of people with missing fingers,"" Brooker told the BBC earlier this week. The Witches film faces backlash over disability Why are Paralympic stars using #NotAWitch? But he added he does not blame Hathaway for this situation, and feels that more awareness and education is needed. Hathaway said she ""did not connect limb difference with the GHW [Grand High Witch] when the look of the character was brought"" to her. ""If I had, I assure you this never would have happened,"" continued the star, who won an Oscar for her role in Les Miserables. ""I particularly want to say I'm sorry to kids with limb differences,"" she went on. ""Now that I know better I promise I'll do better. ""And I owe a special apology to everyone who loves you as fiercely as I love my own kids: I'm sorry I let your family down."" This video can not be played Alex Brooker says the way the film depicts limb difference is ""heartbreaking"" The actress described herself as ""someone who really believes in inclusivity and really, really detests cruelty"". She also shared a video from theLucky Fin Project,external, an organisation supporting those with limb differences. Hathaway's message followed the apology Warner Bros issued earlier this week over the portrayal of the witches in the film, which varies from the one in Dahl's original. The studio said it was ""deeply saddened"" to learn Robert Zemeckis's film ""could upset people with disabilities"". ""In adapting the original story, we worked with designers and artists to come up with a new interpretation of the cat-like claws that are described in the book,"" its statement continued. ""It was never the intention for viewers to feel that the fantastical, non-human creatures were meant to represent them.""

"The actress said she ""did not connect limb difference"" with her Grand High Witch character The Witches star Anne Hathaway has promised to ""do better"" following the criticism the film has received for its portrayal of limb difference. The actress acknowledged that many people ""are in pain"" over the way her Grand High Witch character is depicted. ""I owe you all an apology,""she wrote on Instagram,external. In the new adaptation of Roald Dahl's 1983 book, the witches are revealed to have three elongated fingers on each hand and toe-less feet. Comedian Alex Brooker and others with hand and arm impairments have accused the film of being insensitive towards disabled people. ""To me It sends out a message that we should be scared of people with missing fingers,"" Brooker told the BBC earlier this week. The Witches film faces backlash over disability Why are Paralympic stars using #NotAWitch? But he added he does not blame Hathaway for this situation, and feels that more awareness and education is needed. Hathaway said she ""did not connect limb difference with the GHW [Grand High Witch] when the look of the character was brought"" to her. ""If I had, I assure you this never would have happened,"" continued the star, who won an Oscar for her role in Les Miserables. ""I particularly want to say I'm sorry to kids with limb differences,"" she went on. ""Now that I know better I promise I'll do better. ""And I owe a special apology to everyone who loves you as fiercely as I love my own kids: I'm sorry I let your family down."" This video can not be played Alex Brooker says the way the film depicts limb difference is ""heartbreaking"" The actress described herself as ""someone who really believes in inclusivity and really, really detests cruelty"". She also shared a video from theLucky Fin Project,external, an organisation supporting those with limb differences. Hathaway's message followed the apology Warner Bros issued earlier this week over the portrayal of the witches in the film, which varies from the one in Dahl's original. The studio said it was ""deeply saddened"" to learn Robert Zemeckis's film ""could upset people with disabilities"". ""In adapting the original story, we worked with designers and artists to come up with a new interpretation of the cat-like claws that are described in the book,"" its statement continued. ""It was never the intention for viewers to feel that the fantastical, non-human creatures were meant to represent them."" The Witches had originally been set for a cinema release but was instead distributed on digital platforms last month following the Covid-19 pandemic.

"This video can not be played David Sillito looks back on the career of Geoffrey Palmer Actor Geoffrey Palmer, known for his roles in such sitcoms as Butterflies, As Time Goes By and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, has died aged 93. He died peacefully at home, his agent said. Versatile and prolific, he was known and loved for his hangdog expression, lugubrious delivery and the often testy demeanour he gave to his characters. As Time Goes By saw him star with Dame Judi Dench, a partnership they revived in Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. He also acted in Mrs Brown, again with Dench, and The Madness of King George. Obituary: Geoffrey Palmer Dame Judi, who starred in nine series of As Time Goes By with Palmer, told BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme: ""Geoffrey was master of comedy, an absolute master."" Paying tribute to his ""wonderful deadpan expression"", she added: ""I've admired him all my life. How lucky to have been in something with him for so long."" His co-star in Butterflies from 1978 to 1983, Wendy Craig, told the programme: ""He was just a delight to work with, his timing was perfect."" Despite his ""rather serious face"", she said he was ""full of fun"" in person. ""When he laughed and when he smiled his whole face lit up, his eyes twinkled. He was always up for a laugh and not a heavy-going serious person at all,"" she said. His early television roles included appearances in The Army Game, The Saint and The Avengers and he went on to appear in Doctor Who and the Kipper and the Corpse episode of Fawlty Towers. The Doctor Who programme listed the shows he had appeared in with a tribute on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Palmer appeared in four series of the Carla Lane sitcom, in which he played the stuffy husband of Wendy Craig's Ria. Yet it was his partnership with Dench in As Time Goes By for which he will perhaps be best remembered. Palmer worked with Judi Dench in As Time Goes By The BBC sitcom, about two former lovers who meet unexpectedly and later marry, ran from 1992 to 2005. In 2018 Dame Judi described her co-star as ""the naughtiest man I ever had the pleasure to work with"" as she gave him a prize at that year's Oldie Awards. In Tomorrow Never Dies, released in 1997, Palmer's combative Admiral Roebuck sparred with Dame Judi's M, the head of the secret service. Producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli,externalremembered the actor as ""a much beloved star of TV and film and a treasured member of the Bond family"". Palmer's distinctive voice made him a popular choice for narration, audiobooks and adverts. He narrated the Grumpy Old Men series and introduced British viewers to ""Vorsprung durch Technik"" in adverts for Audi cars. Actress Frances Barber remembered an occasion when he had queried a residuals payment he had received for the ubiquitous commercial. ""I just called my agent and said they've put too many 0's on the cheque,""she recalled him saying,external. ""After lunch he said 'Apparently they haven't'. His face didn't change."" In his later years Palmer was seen in Paddington, Parade's End and W.E, in which he was directed by pop star Madonna. He was made an OBE in 2004 for services to drama. This video can not be played Actor Geoffrey Palmer on high speed rail plan Palmer, a keen fly fisherman, campaigned against the HS2 railway line, the proposed route of which ran close to his home in the Chilterns. ""Stop this vanity project and leave our countryside alone,"" he told then-PM David Cameron in a 2013 video filmed for the Daily Politics show. ""I am not grumpy,"" he once said of his distinctively jowly features. ""I just look this way."" He is survived by his wife Sally Green, with whom he had a daughter and a son.

"There was an alarming 20% rise in babies being killed or harmed during the first lockdown, Ofsted's chief inspector Amanda Spielman has revealed. Sixty four babies were deliberately harmed in England - eight of whom died. Some 40% of the 300 incidents reported involved infants, up a fifth on 2019. Ms Spielman believes a ""toxic mix"" of isolation, poverty and mental illness caused the March to October spike. Health staff and social workers were hampered by Covid restrictions. And many regular visits could not take place, while others were carried out remotely, using the telephone or video links. When schools were closed in March, children's charities and teachers expressed fears that children at risk would be left even more vulnerable under lockdown. This was part of the reason schools stayed open to vulnerable children. Ms Spielman told a conference of local authority leaders on Friday: ""Of course, babies can't tell an adult if there's a problem. ""Often, abuse is only uncovered when there's a critical injury, or it's too late. ""Another young life damaged, and in the worst cases, lost, before it's really had the chance to beginâ¦ It doesn't bear thinking about. ""But we must all be alive to this hidden danger."" Every week, Ofsted is seeing more serious incident notifications about harm to under-ones - the youngest and most vulnerable of all children, she said. She added: ""The pandemic has brought difficult and stressful times. Financial hardship, loss of employment, isolation, and close family proximity have put extra pressure on families that were already struggling. ""Poverty, inadequate housing, substance misuse and poor mental health all add to this toxic mix. ""You'll be well aware of the increase in domestic violence incidents over the summer - just one symptom of the Covid pressure cooker."" Violence towards babies was already a worry before the Covid-19 pandemic, Ofsted says. Over a quarter of all incidents reported to the child safeguarding practice review panel last year involved non-accidental injuries to babies. This often involves children being abused by young parents, or other family or household members, who have very little social support, Ofsted says. President of the Association of Directors of Children's Services Jenny Coles said Covid-19 was exacerbating many of the difficulties that families face and putting more vulnerable babies at even more risk. ""The pandemic has seriously disrupted a key line of sight into the lives and homes of many families."" She welcomed the government's move to ensure health visitors were not drawn away from their work with young children, but called for more investment to in services supporting parents. As well as babies being intentionally harmed, Ofsted has seen a high number of unexpected infant deaths. This includes preventable tragedies: babies not being put down to sleep safely, for example, sharing a bed or sofa with a parent who has been drinking. Ms Spielman will acknowledge that there has been good work to identify high risk babies during lockdown, such as the children of parents misusing substances, or with serious mental health problems. In these cases, professionals who understand the risk factors acted decisively to give families the help they need, she said. But she is urging all those working with children to be on the alert as England heads into the next lockdown. ""Everyone needs to play their role. That includes professionals across whole communities. ""Midwives, health visitors, GPs and other health workers who have good relationships with families and can build on that trust. Staff working in schools and nurseries who may have information about a vulnerable infant because an older sibling attends the setting. ""And help for younger parents is important, but without labelling or patronising them. Building their trust so that they accept advice and learn how to look after their children safely. ""Continuing restrictions may be hampering face-to-face visits but while these children are out of sight, they should never be out of mind,"" she adds. Children's minister Vicky Ford said: ""Every death or harm is tragic but harms to young babies are deeply heart wrenching. ""New parents have faced unprecedented challenges so we have asked children's services to prioritise support for families with new babies and especially those families who had already faced difficulties before Covid."" A spokesman added the government had invested Â£4.3bn  in councils to meet the additional demands being made of them. Councillor Judith Blake, chairwoman of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said the pandemic had led to an increasing number of families facing exceptionally difficult circumstances. ""Councils have worked tirelessly to try and keep children and their families safe and well, through online and virtual contact and resources, as well as high priority home visits. ""It is absolutely critical that professionals are able to keep engaging with families throughout any restrictions, whether local or national. ""As we experience a second wave of the virus and learn lessons from the first, it is vital that health visitors and other community health practitioners are not diverted to acute care.""

"UK trade with the EU faces ""significant disruption"" when the Brexit transition period ends in January, a government spending watchdog has said. The National Audit Office (NAO) said it was ""very unlikely"" traders would be ready for checks the EU is due to impose at its borders. It also warned ""limited"" time remained for UK ports to test new IT systems. The government said ""significant"" efforts had been made to avoid disruption to businesses. The UK formally left the EU earlier this year but is following EU trading rules until the end of December. Preparations are under way to prepare the border for the change, amid warnings the new systemsmight not be readyin time to avoid disruption. Criminals 'could exploit' no-deal Brexit gaps UK firms 'under-prepared' for new EU trade rules GB-NI trade 'will involve 30 million declarations' In a report, the NAO said the end of the transition period would bring ""significant change,"" even if the UK agrees a trade deal with the EU. Even with a deal, traders will face new hurdles to clear - including the need to fill in customs declarations on goods being traded. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) estimates it may need to process 270 million customs declarations from 2021, compared with 55 million currently. In June, the government announced that - regardless of whether it reaches a post-Brexit trade deal - new checks on EU goods entering Great Britain would bephased inover six months from January 2021 to give firms ""time to adjust"". However, the NAO said there was still ""uncertainty"" over where new border infrastructure would be located and whether it would be ready. It also expressed concern traders would not be ready for the full checks on UK exports the EU is planning to implement from the start of 2021. It cited the government's latest ""worse case scenario"" planning figures, which estimate 40% to 70% of lorries crossing the English Channel will not be ready. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Under the UK's withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland is due to enforce EU customs rules at its ports, requiring declarations for goods coming from GB. The NAO said Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA), which is responsible for planning checks on food and live animal imports, had been ""severely hampered"" by the continuing UK-EU trade talks. The watchdog added that DAERA lacked ""clarity"" about the checks required, and now considers it will not be possible to finish work on its border infrastructure in time for January 2021 and is ""exploring contingency options"". It added that the UK government's controversialInternal Market Bill, giving ministers powers to override sections of the Brexit divorce deal, had ""further increased this uncertainty"". The government has warned of 7,000-long truck queues to cross the Channel in its worst-case scenario planning. In addition, it added there were still ""various operational issues to be resolved"" for goods crossing the English Channel. This included making sure hauliers are able to use a planned online service allowing them to declare they have the correct documents for the EU border and thusobtain a permitto drive on certain roads in Kent. The NAO also said border preparations had been hampered by the Covid-19 pandemic, with senior officials being diverted to the emergency response and communication efforts being temporarily paused. Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, said ministers had not given businesses ""enough time to prepare"". ""It's incredibly worrying that, with two months to go, critical computer systems haven't been properly tested,"" she added. ""The government can only hope that everything comes together on the day, but this is not certain."" On Thursday, Rod McKenzie, policy director for the Road Haulage Association, told a Scottish Parliament committee his industry had been ""been badly let down by the UK government from beginning to end."" He added that the information given to hauliers to help them implement the international permits they will require in the event of no trade deal being reached had been ""quite often totally incomprehensible"". In response to the NAO's report, a UK government spokesperson said it had invested Â£705m to ensure the ""right border infrastructure, staffing and technology is in place"". ""With fewer than two months to go, it's vital that businesses and citizens prepare too,"" they added. ""That's why we're intensifying our engagement with businesses and running a major public information campaign so they know exactly what they need to do to grasp the new opportunities available as the transition period ends.""

"UK insurance group RSA, which is best known for its More Than brand, is in talks with a consortium of Canadian insurer Intact Financial and Danish insurer Tryg about a possible takeover. The deal, which could see the British insurer broken up, values the company at about Â£7.2bn ($9.5bn). RSA has large operations in Canada, Ireland and Scandinavia. The news saw the shares surge 46% to 670p on Thursday. In early trade on Friday they dipped 1% to 662p. If the deal goes ahead it will be the biggest takeover of a UK-listed company so far this year. Small firms thrown lifeline in insurance case ruling 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Insurance companies pause dividend payments The offer from Intact Financial and Tryg would pay 685p in cash per RSA share. It also includes a previously-announced 8p per share interim dividend. This represented about a 50% premium to RSA's closing price on 1 October. Analysts at Jefferies said the offer price represented ""more than fair value"". In a statement, the UK insurer said: ""The board of RSA has indicated to the consortium that it would be minded to recommend the proposal, subject to satisfactory resolution of the other terms of the possible offer, including a period of due diligence."" RSA was formed by the merger of Sun Alliance and Royal Insurance in 1996 and provides home, motor and commercial insurance. Under the terms of the deal, Intact and Tryg would split up RSA's businesses with the Canadian firm keeping its Canada and UK operations. Denmark-based Tryg would take control of RSA's Sweden and Norway operations, while the pair would also co-own RSA's Danish unit. Tryg would take on the highest bill paying RSA about Â£4.2bn, while Intact would contribute Â£3bn. The two insurers have until 3 December to make a formal offer. RSA has a history going back more than 300 years. Sun Alliance had its origins in Sun Fire Office, the oldest documented insurance company in the world founded in London in 1710. Royal Insurance was established in Liverpool in 1845. RSA has long been seen as a takeover target and came close to a sale to Switzerland's Zurich Insurance in 2015. The company employs 13,500 people across more than 100 countries. California's fire death toll doubles as chaos grips LA What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"People queued for Covid tests in Liverpool as the first trial of city-wide testing in England got under way. The city's Mayor Joe Anderson said the pilot could save lives, stop hospitals being overwhelmed and ""get the city out of tier three restrictions"". Everyone living or working in the city will be offered regular and repeat tests, whether or not they have symptoms. The pilot will last for approximately two weeks, the government said.

People will be offered a mix of existing swab tests and new lateral flow tests, which could provide a result in 20 minutes without the need to use a lab. New test sites have been set up across the city, in schools, universities, work places and care homes. Six new test centres,externalfor people who do not have symptoms, at the Exhibition Centre Liverpool and at council-run sports centres, are open between 12:00 GMT and 19:00, with more sites planned. Anyone who does have symptoms can get a swab test at one of the existing mobile testing centres in the city, which can also be accessed by those without symptoms. About 2,000 military personnel are helping deliver the tests. Liverpool City Council has said it is particularly keen to test health and care workers, teachers, school pupils and university staff and students, although everyone is being asked to come forward. People without symptoms are being asked to get a test at one of six new sites across the city Mr Ashton said there was capacity for up to 85 testing centres to be set up by the end of the pilot, which he said was open for ""an initial 10 days"" and could be extended. On the aim of the pilot, he said: ""Success is lowering the levels of the virus in the city and exiting out of the national lockdown in a much stronger position."" ByPhil McCann, BBC Cheshire political reporter The queue here at Liverpool Tennis Centre is snaking past the tennis courts. One woman says she has come along because she understands how important it is. This is one of the testing centres where people are coming without symptoms, but they still stick swabs up your nose and down your throat. The big difference is what happens after. Inside the centre is like a hospital ward - apart from the army is in town because this is too big an operation for the council to carry out on its own. There are booths so you have a little privacy. These have a little window, and out the back of the window there are trestle tables - where the army can take the swab and put them through these rapid tests. It certainly looks like a smooth operation at the moment. It will have to be as the queue is only getting longer. The new lateral flow tests will detect people with the ""highest viral loads"" - assumed to be the most infectious people, according to Dr Emily Adams, a senior lecturer at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The scientist told BBC News that as this would detect about ""three-in-four or four-in-five"" cases, it was important people still follow guidelines to self-isolate if they show symptoms - and get a regular swab test. But she said the lateral flow tests ""work very well in an asymptomatic population"", and that she was ""optimistic"" they would have a big impact in Liverpool. Mass testing is similar to cancer screening - testing healthy people and acting early if there are any problems. The hope is this can be used to stamp out an outbreak, by getting everyone who tests positive to isolate, without turning to strict restrictions. China has done this on multiple occasions by mass testingeveryone in a cityafter a cluster of cases was detected. But a group of health experts has written to Liverpool MPs arguing that testing asymptomatic people in the city was ""like searching for needles that appear transiently in haystacks"". Signatories include Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, and Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health based in Bristol. Soldiers have been deployed to help with planning, administering the tests, and offering logistical support - such as in distribution, clerical roles and as drivers Among those getting tested on Friday was former nurse Cathleen Hodson, who said she thought it was imperative she took part in the pilot.

"Uber's food delivery business is booming Uber's food delivery business has more than doubled, as the pandemic increases appetite for online grocery orders and restaurant takeaway. The firm said revenue from its Uber Eats service hit $1.4bn (Â£1bn) in the three months to 30 September, jumping 124% from the same period in 2019. The growth helped offset steep declines in the firm's core rides business. But Uber still recorded a loss of about $1.1bn in the quarter, roughly the same as last year. Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi said demand for food delivery has stayed strong even as countries lift restrictions, a promising sign for growth in the Uber Eats business. ""We've got more eaters, they're staying longer, they're eating more,"" he told investors on a conference call to discuss the firm's quarterly results. ""There's no question in my mind that ... there's a fundamental behavioural shift that has gone on,"" he added later. ""People aren't going to stop using Amazon. People aren't going to stop using Eats."" The growth in delivery marked a stark contrast to the firm's ride-hailing business. There, Uber said bookings and revenue for its taxi service remained roughly half of last year's levels, despite improvement since the spring. Demand has recovered most in Europe, while lagging in the US and Canada, its most important market, executives said. They warned that the resurgence in Covid cases in Europe and new restrictions in countries like the UK and France would likely hit demand in coming months.
