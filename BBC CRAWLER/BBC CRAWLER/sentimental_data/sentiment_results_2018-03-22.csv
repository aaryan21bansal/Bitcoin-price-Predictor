"This video can not be played Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko: Johnson's comments ""totally irresponsible"" UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's likening of Russia's World Cup to Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics has been branded ""totally irresponsible"" by the Russian ambassador in London. Alexander Yakovenko said ""nobody had the right"" to compare Russia - which lost 25 million lives in World War Two - with Nazi Germany. He said it was an insult to British war veterans from the Arctic convoys. Mr Johnson told the BBC: ""I stick by, completely, what I said."" Prime Minister Theresa May has said the material used in the attack had been identified as being part of a group of nerve agents developed by Russia, known as Novichok. She will later tell an EU summit the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia shows Moscow has no respect for international law. Putin 'will use Cup like Hitler's Olympics' May warns EU of 'Russian aggression' Russian spy: What we know so far The pair remain in a critical condition in hospital after they were found unconscious on a bench on 4 March. Russia says the UK had ""no proof"" it carried out the attack. Mr Johnson made his initial comment at a Foreign Affairs Select Committee meeting on Wednesday. The foreign secretary agreed with the comparison made by Labour MP Ian Austin, adding: ""Your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow in the World Cup, in all the venues, yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right. ""I think it is an emetic prospect frankly to think of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin glorying in this sporting event."" Speaking at the Russian Embassy in London on Thursday Mr Yakovenko said Moscow considered the foreign secretary's comments ""unacceptable and totally irresponsible"". ""The British government is free to make a decision about its participation in the World Cup,"" he said. ""But nobody has the right to insult the Russian people - who defeated Nazism and lost most than 25 million people - by comparing our country to Nazi Germany. ""That goes beyond common sense. And we do not think British war veterans - including those of the Arctic convoys [which shipped four million tonnes of armaments and essential supplies to the Soviet Union during World War Two] - would share this opinion."" The Soviet Union's war dead included Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs and citizens of other non-Russian Federation countries. Mr Johnson has stuck by his comments made at the select committee on Wednesday Speaking later, on a visit to Derby, Mr Johnson said he stuck by what he said ""completely"". He said: ""We don't want to escalate this any further. What we want is some way in which they will at least accept that the Russian state must have had some role in this. ""We want to see the safety of UK people going to the World Cup, that's the most important thing, [but] I think that the idea of Vladimir Putin glorying in a great sporting occasion and receiving the adulation of international figures is, as I said, emetic. ""So I stick by completely what I said."" Mr Yakovenko's response came as he gave a statement on Russia's latest position regarding the Salisbury attack. He criticised the British government for refusing to share information and provide the Russian government with a sample of the nerve agent. He said Mrs May had ""built the official position on assumptions"", adding: ""Britain has, without any evidence, blamed Russia of poisoning of three people [the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey who was part of the initial response to the incident] and continues to refuse to cooperate. ""We cannot accept that."" But Mrs May will stick with her conclusion and tell EU heads of state that although the attempted assassination of the Skripals took place on UK soil, the Russian threat does not respect borders and places all European nations at risk.

"Theresa May greets European Council president Donald Tusk at the EU summit in Brussels It might not sound much, but a few small words can make a big difference. In the last few minutes, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has used the prime minister's language about the Salisbury attack, accepting andagreeing with the British verdict that there is no other ""plausible"" explanation for what happened. That is a small, but significantly different, tone to a statement a few days ago. EU ministers would only say: ""The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible."" The sentiment then was, okay, it might have been them - but you haven't convinced us yet. Now, although plenty of EU leaders - as well as Labour at home - have made clear they would like to see more evidence, today the council as a group has been ready to give firmer backing to Theresa May's claims. This video can not be played Theresa May said, after talks, that it was ""right that we stand together"" It doesn't, however, seem likely that tonight or tomorrow the prime minister will have persuaded any other leader to take precisely the same kind of actions she has at home - although the possibility of expelling diplomats was not completely thrown out of hand by some of them. Different EU states have very different relationships with Russia. Greek leader Prokopis Pavlopoulos even had a chat with President Vladimir Putin on the phone this morning before the summit. But for those in No 10 who want to see this moment to crank up a new tougher line internationally towards the Kremlin, the tweak of a few crucial words is a start.

"John Bolton is to be Mr Trump's third national security adviser President Donald Trump is replacing US National Security Adviser HR McMaster with Bush-era defence hawk and former United Nations ambassador John Bolton. Mr Trump tweeted to thank Gen McMaster, saying he had done an ""outstanding job & will always remain my friend"". Mr Bolton, who has backed attacking North Korea and Iran, told Fox News his job would be to ensure the president has ""the full range of options"". He becomes Mr Trump's third national security chief in 14 months. Gen McMaster is the latest high-profile departure from the White House. Last week, Mr Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by a tweet, replacing him with former CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Why did Trump dump his security adviser? The White House revolving door Five things Bolton believes Mr Bolton's appointment does not require US Senate confirmation. He will take the job on 9 April. The National Security Adviser is the key counsellor to the president on national security and foreign policy issues, and acts as a conduit for policy proposals coming from various government departments, including defence and state.

Mr Bolton, 69, has been a foreign policy hawk in Republican circles for decades, having served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and George W Bush. The second Bush appointed him as US envoy to the UN, during which time diplomats privately criticised Mr Bolton's style as abrasive. A strident neo-conservative, Mr Bolton helped build the case that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be wrong. Known for his walrus moustache, Mr Bolton does not appear to have greatly moderated his views since his last spell in government. He stands by the invasion of Iraq and has advocated in newspaper op-eds using military force against North Korea and Iran. This video can not be played US National Security Adviser HR McMaster is the latest victim of the President's line up changes. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Earlier this month, Donald Trump tweeted: ""I still have some people that I want to change"". He wasn't kidding. Since then chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, personal lawyer John Dowd and now National Security Adviser HR McMaster have headed to (or been shown) the exits. One explanation is that the president feels more comfortable in his job - and more willing to challenge the advice given him by his closest aides. He has chafed at the perception that he is being ""handled"" by those around him, and is installing men who agree to action, instead of preaching caution. When it comes to Iran, Mr Bolton and the president are on the same page. Coupled with Mr Tillerson's exit, the US is heading toward a much more confrontational relationship with the Islamic Republic. In other ways, however, the former UN ambassador is an unusual choice. Mr Trump frequently has called the Iraq war a colossal mistake - the same war that Mr Bolton enthusiastically promoted during his time in the George W Bush administration. Candidate Trump regularly espoused non-interventionism. Mr Bolton is a hawk's hawk. Now that hawk has a perch in the Oval Office. Bush-era war hawk makes comeback This video can not be played Trump's unprecedented staff turnover rate In the US Republican Senator Lindsay Graham described the appointment as ""good news for America's allies and bad news for America's enemies"" Democrat Senator Chris Coons said Mr Bolton's stance on Iran and North Korea was ""overly aggressive at best and downright dangerous at worst"". Abraham Denmark, a senior defence official in the Obama administration, said: ""Bolton has long been an advocate for pre-emptive military action against North Korea, and his appointment as national security adviser is a strong signal that President Trump remains open to these options"" Globally Iran's Guardian Council called Mr Bolton a ""supporter of terrorists"", focusing on past statements of support forthe Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), an exiled opposition group that backs the overthrow of the Islamic Republic North Korea has yet to react but the government there once called John Bolton ""human scum"" ""This is worrisome news,"" the head of the national defence committee of South Korea's parliament told Reuters news agency, expressing fears that US-North Korea talks could be scuppered In a brief statement on Thursday, Gen McMaster thanked President Trump for appointing him and said he was applying to retire from the US Army later this year. The 55-year-old three-star general is leaving after just over a year as national security adviser. The president had reportedly found Gen McMaster's briefings to be grating. He was also described as aggressive and prone to lecture. The White House said Mr Trump and Gen McMaster had ""mutually agreed"" that he would leave. He had been rumoured for weeks to be on his way out. HR McMaster's briefings reportedly grated on the president Gen McMaster's departure came a day after it was leaked that Mr Trump was advised this week in briefing documents not to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin on his recent re-election, but did it anyway. Gen McMaster replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after less than a month in the job for misleading the White House about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.

"Lazarus pictured with Geoffrey the Giraffe, the company mascot The man who founded Toys R Us - the children's toy retailer - has died aged 94, one week after his company announced it was closing its doors. Charles Lazarus began selling toys in 1957 in large supermarket-style shops after he returned from World War II military service. His death comes after the company announced it would close all US and UK shops and seek bankruptcy protection. The ""heartbreaking"" news of his death was tweeted on Thursday by the firm. ""There have been many sad moments for Toys R Us in recent weeks, and none more heartbreaking than today's news about the passing of our beloved founder, Charles Lazarus,"" the company wrote online.

In a press release,external,  Toys R Us said he had been in ""declining health"" and that ""we will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere"". Earlier on Thursday, the company announced it would suspend the liquidation sales of hundreds of its stores due to ""unforeseen circumstances"". In a 2008 interview with Entrepreneur magazine, Lazarus explained that he opened the business because all of his military friends were telling him the same thing as they returned to the US following the war. They were all saying they were going back to get married and raise children, which gave him the idea to first begin by selling children's furniture. After returning to his family's home in the Washington DC suburbs in 1948, he converted his father's bicycle shop into a furniture business called Children's Supermart, with the letter 'R' spelled backwards. He later explained that the R was made to make the title of the business look as though a child had written it. The backwards R was also famously used in the name of Toys R Us. Toys R Us to close all US stores Lazarus later moved on to toys and games, saying that ""toys are a great kind of thing to sell, because they don't last that long"". Before the founding of Toys R Us, the market for children's toys was mostly considered to be a seasonal industry. A 1986 profile in the Atlantic Monthly magazine called Lazarus ""the person most responsible for loosening Santa's grip on the toy business"". Toys R Us sold nappies at steep discounts, hoping parents would pass the savings along to their children, according to Bloomberg. The company has struggled since Lazarus left in 1994, as the rise of online shopping kept more and more families from visiting the shops. Last week the company announced it would close all of its remaining locations in the US, just a week after announcing it would do the same for its businesses in the UK.

"The genome study uncovers possible reasons for the skeleton's unusual features Tests on a six-inch-long mummified skeleton from Chile confirm that it represents the remains of a newborn with multiple mutations in key genes. Despite being the size of a foetus, initial tests had suggested the bones were of a child aged six to eight. These highly unusual features prompted wild speculation about its origin. Now, DNA testing indicates that the estimated age of the bones and other anomalies may have been a result of the genetic mutations. Details of the work have been published in the journal Genome Research. In addition to its exceptionally small height, the skeleton had several unusual physical features, such as fewer than expected ribs and a cone-shaped head. The remains were initially discovered in a pouch in the abandoned nitrate mining town of La Noria. From there, they found their way into a private collection in Spain. Some wondered whether the remains, dubbed Ata after the Atacama region where they were discovered, could in fact be the remains of a non-human primate. A documentary, called Sirius, even suggested it could be evidence of alien visitations. The new research puts those ideas to rest. A scientific team analysed the individual's genome - the genetic blueprint for a human, contained in the nucleus of cells. They had already used this to confirm that the individual was human. Now, the team has presented evidence that Ata was a female newborn with multiple mutations in genes associated with dwarfism, scoliosis and abnormalities in the muscles and skeleton. ""What was striking and caused us to speculate early on that there was something strange about the bones was the apparent maturity of the bones (density and shape),"" said Garry Nolan, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. He told BBC News: ""There was proportionate maturation of the bones, making the body look more mature despite the fact that the specimen was itself small. This discrepancy drove much of the research. So, we believe that one or more of the mutated genes was responsible for this."" The results revealed four new single nucleotide variants (SNVs) - a type of genetic mutation - in genes that were known to cause bone diseases, like scoliosis or dislocations, as well as two more SNVs in genes involved in producing collagen. Ata also had 10 pairs of ribs, rather than 12 - a feature that has never been seen in humans before. ""We actually believe the girl was stillborn or died immediately after birth,"" said Prof Nolan. ""She was so badly malformed as to be unable to feed. In her condition, she would have ended up in the neonatal ICU."" However, access to advanced medical care was probably unavailable in the remote Chilean region where she was found. The skeleton's intact condition suggests it may be no more than 40 years old. Prof Nolan began the scientific investigation of Ata in 2012, when a friend called saying he might have found an ""alien"". He explained: ""While this started as a story about aliens, and went international - it's really a story of a human tragedy. A woman had a malformed baby, it was preserved in a manner and then ""hocked"", or sold."" The scientists said that future studies of Ata had the potential to improve our understanding of the underlying basis of genetic skeletal disorders - with the potential to help others. ""Analysing a puzzling sample like the Ata genome can teach us how to handle current medical samples, which may be driven by multiple mutations,"" said Atul Butte, director of the Institute for Computational Health Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. ""When we study the genomes of patients with unusual syndromes, there may be more than one gene or pathway involved genetically, which is not always considered."" Prof Nolan says further research into Ata's precocious bone aging could one day benefit patients. ""Maybe there's a way to accelerate bone growth in people who need it, people who have bad breaks,"" he said. ""Nothing like this had been seen before. Certainly, nobody had looked into the genetics of it."" He added: ""I think it should be returned to the country of origin and buried according to the customs of the local people.""

"Mr Nix gave evidence to MPs last month The suspended chief of Cambridge Analytica has been asked to appear before MPs again amid claims about the company's use of Facebook user data. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee said evidence Alexander Nix gave to itsfake news inquiry,externallast month contained ""inconsistencies"". It said this includes his denial the company was supplied data by a firm behind an app that harvested personal details, or worked with Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing. Mr Nix was suspended by the London-based political consultancy on Tuesday after footage broadcast on Channel 4 appeared to show him suggesting tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. In aletter,external, the committee chairman, Damian Collins, requested Mr Nix supply further evidence following material published in the media this week. He said MPs were interested in asking him about his ""denial that your company received data from the Global Science Research company"" and ""your claim that you 'do not work with Facebook data, and... do not have Facebook data'."" Theparliamentary committee has also called for Facebook boss Mark Zuckerbergto give evidence about its use of personal data. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, claimed it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life that was created by an academic for Global Science Research. Earlier, a High Court hearing on an attempt by the UK's information commissioner to search the office of Cambridge Analytica was adjourned until Friday. Elizabeth Denham is seeking a warrant to access to the databases and servers of the company amid claims it improperly used data from Facebook users on behalf of political clients. The move is part of her wider investigation into political campaigning. The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Facebook's biggest challenge yet Ad firms warn Facebook 'enough is enough' Zuckerberg speaks out on data breaches The Information Commissioner's Office said it was seeking a warrant because Cambridge Analytica did not respond to its 7 March request to access records and data it held. Ms Denham has said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in ""an unauthorised way"", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when they found out about the loss of the data. Cambridge Analytica offices are in London's West End She said Facebook had been told to withdraw from its own search of Cambridge Analytica's offices, saying there were concerns it might damage the integrity of her investigation. Cambridge Analytica says it has been ""fully compliant and proactive"" with the ICO since 2017. In astatement,external, the company said: ""We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection. ""We remain committed to helping the ICO and all other concerned organisations in their investigations and audits."" Speaking in the Commons, Culture Secretary Matt Hancocksaid this week's revelations represented a ""turning point"" in the debate on the use of personal information stored online. In response to a question from Labour MP Chi Onwurah, who called for the introduction of a ""digital bill of rights"", Mr Hancock said: ""It is increasingly clear that we need a new settlement with these big tech companies."" ""This Wild West free-for-all of the internet companies has got to come to an end,"" he added. Shadow digital minister Liam Byrne said it was ""ludicrous"" that a search warrant had still not been obtained by the ICO and suggested it did not have sufficient power to conduct investigations properly. But Mr Hancock said: ""The truth is the data protection bill currently before Parliament is all about strengthening this enforcement and strengthening people's consent."" Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said while the case raised a ""serious issue"" and data harvesting had to be ""dealt with,""  the party would still maintain its Facebook account. It has also emerged that ISBA, atrade body which represents major UK advertisers, will meet Facebook this week. The Times reports,externalif Facebook fails to provide assurances about the security of users' data, advertisers may decide to spend money elsewhere. Hancock: Data breach is 'creepy' In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but Whistleblower Christopher Wylie says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far He claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica - which has no connection with Cambridge University - which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Donald Trump material to them. Dr Kogan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was ""perfectly legal and within the terms of service"" and he was being used as a ""scapegoat"". US senators have called on Mr Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how his company will protect users, while consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission hasalso reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook. The head of the European Parliament also said it would investigate to see if the data was misused. This video can not be played Information Commissioner: We need to get in to Cambridge Analytica offices On Tuesday a Cambridge University spokesperson said they had ""sought and received assurances"" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that, but were writing to Facebook to ""request all relevant evidence in their possession"". There have also beencalls for an investigationinto the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya. On Wednesday,Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg broke coverfor the first time since the revelations emerged to say that a ""breach of trust"" had occurred and he was ""really sorry"". Earlier Facebook said users' data was obtained legitimately but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when told to do so. A Facebook spokesperson said Dr Kogan was not allowed to transfer data to Cambridge Analytica, a third-party who would use the set for commercial purposes. They added that sharing users' friends data outside the app was also against Facebook's rules. This video can not be played Tuesday's broadcast showed Mr Nix saying he met Donald Trump 'many times' For its part, Cambridge Analytica says in 2014 it had engaged Global Science Research ""in good faith to legally supply data"". Cambridge Analytica says it did delete the data when told to by Facebook. It says it did not use the data as part of the services provided to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Although Cambridge Analytica suspended chief executive Alexander Nix following hiscomments to Channel 4 News,external, the firm said reports on the story had ""grossly misrepresented"" his comments. Before Channel 4 News had broadcast any of the secret filming, Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been ""deliberately entrapped"".

"Ellie Butler was killed by her father at their south London home in 2013 A man whose six-year-old granddaughter was battered to death has told an inquest her killer father was a ""brutal maniac"" and her murder was ""avoidable"". Ellie Butler was placed in the care of her grandparents, Linda and Neal Gray, after her father Ben Butler was accused of shaking her as a baby. But she was returned to her parents' south London home when his conviction was quashed. She died 11 months later. Social workers agreed with Mr Gray's claim that they ""failed"" Ellie. Butler wasjailed for a minimum of 23 yearsfor inflicting catastrophic head injuries on Ellie while looking after her at their home in Sutton. Mr Gray told South London Coroner's Court on Thursday that his ""whole world caved in"" when Ellie was killed. In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Gray said Ellie had told him and his wife - who died on the first day of Butler's trial - she wanted to stay with them for ""100 million years"" rather than live with her parents. He added that his daughter, Ellie's mother Jennie Gray, was ""just as culpable"" as Butler for what happened. Neal Gray gave evidence at Ellie's inquest at South London Coroner's Court on Thursday ""She stood by and watched that brutal maniac inflict unimaginable injuries, and she defended him without question or remorse,"" he said. ""[Ellie] was placed at fatal risk by being returned to her parents. Her death had been avoidable. ""The circumstances surrounding it must be avoided so that lessons may be learned and other children protected in the future. Her death cannot have been in vain."" Killed girl's granddad disowns daughter The exonerated father who went on to kill The inquest is examining whether there were failures on the part of the authorities in the lead up to Ellie's murder. The judgement is due on 10 April. Mr Gray said staff at Services for Children (S4C) had ""failed in their duty"" to Ellie. Social worker Steven Atherton admitted S4C was ""part of a system that failed this little girl"". Earlier on Thursday, Butler gave evidence to the inquest via video link from prison and repeatedly denied killing Ellie, or abusing her in any way. He said: ""I don't accept I caused harm to Ellie and will fight in a different court to prove it. ""I didn't cause Ellie to die, I didn't cause any injury to Ellie at all."" Ben Butler had a conviction for shaking Ellie when she was a baby quashed He said he will appeal against his conviction. He did admit being verbally abusive to Ellie's mother after texts were read to the inquest. ""I realise the texts were horrendous, the things I had said. For me it was saying bad things in the heat of the moment but I'm pretty ashamed of myself,"" he said. ""But to say [if] you're being abusive to your partner [then] you must be abusive to your children, that's two different things."" Gray told Ellie's inquest via video link thatButler's ""bark was worse than his bite"". She is serving a 42-month jail sentence for child cruelty and perverting the course of justice.

"This video can not be played De la Rue boss Martin Sutherland claimed: ""It is surprising the British government does not support British industry."" The new UK passport to be issued after Brexit will be made in France, the current British manufacturer has said. The burgundy passport, in use since 1988, will revert to its original blue and gold colour from October 2019. The boss of UK supplier De La Rue said it would appeal against the decision to award the Â£490m contract to Franco-Dutch firm Gemalto. The Home Office said a winning bid had been chosen but it was up to the supplier to announce the news. De la Rue's shares closed nearly 6% lower on Thursday. Pro-Brexit former cabinet minister Priti Patel said the decision to hand the new contract to a foreign firm was ""disgraceful"" and ""perverse"". The Liberal Democrats' Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said the ""blue passport saga"" was becoming a farce. ""First it was established that we did not have to leave the EU to have blue passports. Now we learn that the passports will be printed by a foreign company."" Under EU procurement rules, the Home Office had been required to throw open the bidding process to European firms. However, it added that passports did not have to be made in the UK and 20% of blank passport books are currently produced in Europe. This video can not be played Why British passports are changing colours after Brexit â and do Brits welcome the switch? It also said the new deal could save the taxpayer Â£100m-Â£120m and that 70 new jobs would be created in the UK, at sites in Fareham and Heywood in Lancashire. Gemalto, which has its headquarters in Paris and has a factory in Fareham, said it was aware of the reports regarding the contract to produce the new UK passport. But it added: ""As the process is still ongoing and the terms of engagement are confidential, we cannot make any further comment on it at this stage."" A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: ""The chosen company demonstrated that they will be best able to meet the needs of our passport service with a high quality and secure product at the best value for money for our customers and the taxpayer."" Earlier, De La Rue boss Martin Sutherland toldthe BBC's Today programme:""Over the last few months we have heard ministers happy to come on the media and talk about the new blue passport and the fact that it is an icon of British identity. ""But now this icon of British identity is going to be manufactured in France."" He added: ""I'd like to ask Theresa May or Amber Rudd to come to my factory and explain to our dedicated workforce why this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon."" De La Rue, which has held the contract to manufacture British passports since 2009, said it had been ""undercut on price"" by Gemalto. Brexit: All you need to know Growth 'more important than Brexit' Brexit boost for consumers short-lived, says IFS This video can not be played Culture Secretary says procurement process for passports would be different post-Brexit Mr Sutherland said it was unclear whether jobs at the firm's Gateshead factory would be affected.

"The owner of Xdolls says his sex dolls are like sex toys and do not degrade women (file picture) Paris councillors have rejected a motion targeting a business where clients are charged â¬89 ($109; Â£78) to spend an hour with a silicone sex doll. Communist councillors and feminist groups had called on the Council of Paris - the body responsible for governing the city - to study the possibilities of closing Xdolls. They argued it was demeaning to women - and effectively a brothel. Owning or operating a brothel is illegal in France. But police visited the establishment before the council meeting and declared no laws were being broken. In a joint statement, Communist councillors Nicolas Bonnet Oulaldj and HervÃ© BÃ©guÃ© said they deeply regretted the council's decision. ""This establishment, with hyper-realistic humanoid dolls, is the latest invention to bring brothels back into the landscape,"" they said. They went on to describe Xdolls as ""the pinnacle of the dehumanisation of the relationship between women and men"" and accused it of trivialising the exploitation of women by prostitution networks, and the related crime of human trafficking. Xdolls is located in an anonymous-looking flat in the French capital and opened earlier this year, describing itself as a ""games centre"". Clients are mainly men, though some couples also visit,external, owner Joachim Lousquy, who formerly managed e-cigarette shops, told Le Parisien newspaper. It has three rooms, each containing a silicone sex doll measuring about 1m 45cm (4ft 7in) and worth several thousand euros. Customers make their booking and payment online, and the exact address is kept secret. Not even the neighbours are aware of the nature of the business, Mr Lousquy says.

"Det Sgt Nick Bailey said he had been ""overwhelmed"" by support from the public A police officer who fell ill after being exposed to the nerve agent used on a Russian ex-spy and his daughter has been discharged from hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey was left seriously ill after responding to the attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and Yulia Skripal, 33, in Salisbury earlier this month. The pair remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Det Sgt Bailey said that ""normal life for me will probably never be the same"" as he also thanked hospital staff. He said in a statement that there were ""no words"" to explain how he felt, adding: ""It really has been completely surreal"". He added: ""I have been so very overwhelmed by the support, cards and messages I have received - everyone has been so incredible."" His wife, Sarah, said: ""This has quite simply been the most traumatic event of our lives and it feels like our world has been turned upside down in a really short space of time."" Russian spy: What we know so far Conspiracy theories and denial in Russia World Cup Nazi comments 'irresponsible' Another police officer who responded to the attack on 4 March is being treated as an outpatient by Salisbury District Hospital, the BBC understands. Since the incident, nearly 50 other people had sought medical advice from the hospital. Cara Charles-Barks, chief executive of Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, said medical staff were ""working around the clock"" to care for the Skripals. A judge has said it is unclear if the pair, who were found slumped on a shopping centre bench in Salisbury, would fully recover from the nerve agent attack. Judge David Williams, of the Court of Protection, said their mental capacity may have been compromised to an ""unknown"" degree. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found slumped on a shopping centre bench on 4 March The court, which hears issues affecting the welfare of sick or vulnerable people, has given doctors permission to take blood samples from the Skripals to send to chemical weapons experts. A team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which arrived in the UK earlier this week, will conduct the tests. Delivering the ruling, Judge Williams said: ""Medical tests indicate that their mental capacity might be compromised to an unknown and so far unascertained degree."" He said no-one known to Mr and Ms Skripal had approached the hospital where they were being cared for to ""inquire of their welfare"". This video can not be played May: Russian threat does not respect borders Meanwhile, EU leaders have agreed it is""highly likely"" Russia was behind the attack, after Prime Minister Theresa May appealed to fellow heads of state for unity. European Council president Donald Tusk said there was ""no other plausible explanation"" for the incident.

The European Council of EU leaders said there was ""no plausible alternative"". Moscow denies responsibility for the attack on an ex-spy and his daughter and said the EU was following an ""anti-Russian campaign launched by London"". Meanwhile, British diplomats expelled from Russia have left the embassy in Moscow ahead of Russia's deadline. Russia decided to expel the British diplomatsin a tit-for-tat response to the UK's expulsion of 23 of its diplomats. Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical but stable condition after the attack on 4 March. Laura Kuenssberg: Small words, big difference Russian spy: What we know so far EU summit moves from Russia to Brexit UK Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the EU support, saying that it was right ""we are standing together"" as the threat posed by Russia ""respects no borders and it is a threat to our values"". The EU said its ambassador to Russia, German Markus Ederer, was recalled ""for consultations"" and was expected in Brussels over the weekend. The European Council statement added: ""We stand in unqualified solidarity with the United Kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to our shared security."" A convoy of vehicles leaves the British Embassy in Moscow ahead of Russia's deadline for 23 UK diplomats to leave the country In response, Russia's foreign ministry said: ""We regret that the EU chose to follow another anti-Russian campaign launched by London and its allies from across the ocean, with the obvious purpose of creating yet another obstacle to normalising the situation on the European continent."" Mrs May briefed her counterparts on Thursday on the poisoning of the Skripals, who were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury. The prime minister set out the evidence the UK has against Russia - including the positive identification of the chemical used as a type of Novichok nerve agent and the knowledge that Russia has produced this agent within the last 10 years. Asked if she had relied on UK intelligence information to convince EU allies, Mrs May said the UK had been sharing ""throughout"" the investigation ""what intelligence we can share with our colleagues"". She said: ""What is crucial is that there was recognition around the table about the threat that Russia poses."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor It might not sound much, but a few small words can make a big difference. The president of the European Council has used the prime minister's language about the Salisbury attack, accepting and agreeing with the British verdict that there is no other ""plausible"" explanation for what happened. That is a small, but significantly different, tone to the statement a few days ago. EU ministers would only say: ""The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible."" The sentiment then was, OK, it might have been them - but you haven't convinced us yet. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Theresa May said, after talks, that it was ""right that we stand together"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he supported the EU's position ""very strongly"" and Ireland could expel Russian officials if they were shown to be acting as intelligence agents. He said there would be a security assessment in the coming days with a decision as early as next week. Lithuania, Czech Republic and Latvia have also said they were considering expelling suspected Russian spies from their countries. But Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said that while he wanted to ""express solidarity"" with Britain, ""we also need to be responsible on that issue"". The European Union has a network of 140 delegations around the world which represent the EU abroad. The EU nominates ambassadors to those embassies. They play a key role in presenting, explaining and implementing the EU's foreign policies to their host country.

Laura Kuenssberg: Small words, big difference Russian spy: What we know so far EU summit moves from Russia to Brexit UK Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the EU support, saying that it was right ""we are standing together"" as the threat posed by Russia ""respects no borders and it is a threat to our values"". The EU said its ambassador to Russia, German Markus Ederer, was recalled ""for consultations"" and was expected in Brussels over the weekend. The European Council statement added: ""We stand in unqualified solidarity with the United Kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to our shared security."" A convoy of vehicles leaves the British Embassy in Moscow ahead of Russia's deadline for 23 UK diplomats to leave the country In response, Russia's foreign ministry said: ""We regret that the EU chose to follow another anti-Russian campaign launched by London and its allies from across the ocean, with the obvious purpose of creating yet another obstacle to normalising the situation on the European continent."" Mrs May briefed her counterparts on Thursday on the poisoning of the Skripals, who were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury. The prime minister set out the evidence the UK has against Russia - including the positive identification of the chemical used as a type of Novichok nerve agent and the knowledge that Russia has produced this agent within the last 10 years. Asked if she had relied on UK intelligence information to convince EU allies, Mrs May said the UK had been sharing ""throughout"" the investigation ""what intelligence we can share with our colleagues"". She said: ""What is crucial is that there was recognition around the table about the threat that Russia poses."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor It might not sound much, but a few small words can make a big difference. The president of the European Council has used the prime minister's language about the Salisbury attack, accepting and agreeing with the British verdict that there is no other ""plausible"" explanation for what happened. That is a small, but significantly different, tone to the statement a few days ago. EU ministers would only say: ""The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible."" The sentiment then was, OK, it might have been them - but you haven't convinced us yet. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Theresa May said, after talks, that it was ""right that we stand together"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he supported the EU's position ""very strongly"" and Ireland could expel Russian officials if they were shown to be acting as intelligence agents. He said there would be a security assessment in the coming days with a decision as early as next week. Lithuania, Czech Republic and Latvia have also said they were considering expelling suspected Russian spies from their countries. But Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said that while he wanted to ""express solidarity"" with Britain, ""we also need to be responsible on that issue"". The European Union has a network of 140 delegations around the world which represent the EU abroad. The EU nominates ambassadors to those embassies. They play a key role in presenting, explaining and implementing the EU's foreign policies to their host country. The current EU ambassador to Russia is German diplomat Markus Ederer, who has previously been responsible for China and Mongolia.

"Mr Nix gave evidence to MPs last month The suspended chief of Cambridge Analytica has been asked to appear before MPs again amid claims about the company's use of Facebook user data. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee said evidence Alexander Nix gave to itsfake news inquiry,externallast month contained ""inconsistencies"". It said this includes his denial the company was supplied data by a firm behind an app that harvested personal details, or worked with Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing. Mr Nix was suspended by the London-based political consultancy on Tuesday after footage broadcast on Channel 4 appeared to show him suggesting tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. In aletter,external, the committee chairman, Damian Collins, requested Mr Nix supply further evidence following material published in the media this week. He said MPs were interested in asking him about his ""denial that your company received data from the Global Science Research company"" and ""your claim that you 'do not work with Facebook data, and... do not have Facebook data'."" Theparliamentary committee has also called for Facebook boss Mark Zuckerbergto give evidence about its use of personal data. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, claimed it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life that was created by an academic for Global Science Research. Earlier, a High Court hearing on an attempt by the UK's information commissioner to search the office of Cambridge Analytica was adjourned until Friday. Elizabeth Denham is seeking a warrant to access to the databases and servers of the company amid claims it improperly used data from Facebook users on behalf of political clients. The move is part of her wider investigation into political campaigning. The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Facebook's biggest challenge yet Ad firms warn Facebook 'enough is enough' Zuckerberg speaks out on data breaches The Information Commissioner's Office said it was seeking a warrant because Cambridge Analytica did not respond to its 7 March request to access records and data it held. Ms Denham has said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in ""an unauthorised way"", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when they found out about the loss of the data. Cambridge Analytica offices are in London's West End She said Facebook had been told to withdraw from its own search of Cambridge Analytica's offices, saying there were concerns it might damage the integrity of her investigation. Cambridge Analytica says it has been ""fully compliant and proactive"" with the ICO since 2017. In astatement,external, the company said: ""We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection. ""We remain committed to helping the ICO and all other concerned organisations in their investigations and audits."" Speaking in the Commons, Culture Secretary Matt Hancocksaid this week's revelations represented a ""turning point"" in the debate on the use of personal information stored online. In response to a question from Labour MP Chi Onwurah, who called for the introduction of a ""digital bill of rights"", Mr Hancock said: ""It is increasingly clear that we need a new settlement with these big tech companies."" ""This Wild West free-for-all of the internet companies has got to come to an end,"" he added. Shadow digital minister Liam Byrne said it was ""ludicrous"" that a search warrant had still not been obtained by the ICO and suggested it did not have sufficient power to conduct investigations properly. But Mr Hancock said: ""The truth is the data protection bill currently before Parliament is all about strengthening this enforcement and strengthening people's consent."" Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said while the case raised a ""serious issue"" and data harvesting had to be ""dealt with,""  the party would still maintain its Facebook account. It has also emerged that ISBA, atrade body which represents major UK advertisers, will meet Facebook this week. The Times reports,externalif Facebook fails to provide assurances about the security of users' data, advertisers may decide to spend money elsewhere. Hancock: Data breach is 'creepy' In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but Whistleblower Christopher Wylie says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far He claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica - which has no connection with Cambridge University - which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Donald Trump material to them. Dr Kogan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was ""perfectly legal and within the terms of service"" and he was being used as a ""scapegoat"". US senators have called on Mr Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how his company will protect users, while consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission hasalso reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook. The head of the European Parliament also said it would investigate to see if the data was misused. This video can not be played Information Commissioner: We need to get in to Cambridge Analytica offices On Tuesday a Cambridge University spokesperson said they had ""sought and received assurances"" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that, but were writing to Facebook to ""request all relevant evidence in their possession"". There have also beencalls for an investigationinto the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya. On Wednesday,Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg broke coverfor the first time since the revelations emerged to say that a ""breach of trust"" had occurred and he was ""really sorry"". Earlier Facebook said users' data was obtained legitimately but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when told to do so. A Facebook spokesperson said Dr Kogan was not allowed to transfer data to Cambridge Analytica, a third-party who would use the set for commercial purposes. They added that sharing users' friends data outside the app was also against Facebook's rules. This video can not be played Tuesday's broadcast showed Mr Nix saying he met Donald Trump 'many times' For its part, Cambridge Analytica says in 2014 it had engaged Global Science Research ""in good faith to legally supply data"". Cambridge Analytica says it did delete the data when told to by Facebook. It says it did not use the data as part of the services provided to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Although Cambridge Analytica suspended chief executive Alexander Nix following hiscomments to Channel 4 News,external, the firm said reports on the story had ""grossly misrepresented"" his comments. Before Channel 4 News had broadcast any of the secret filming, Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been ""deliberately entrapped"".

"Discarded fishing nets were part of the haul A collection of plastic afloat in the Pacific Ocean is growing rapidly, according to a new scientific estimate. Predictions suggest a build-up of about 80,000 tonnes of plastic in the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" between California and Hawaii. This figure is up to sixteen times higher than previously reported, say international researchers. One trawl in the centre of the patch had the highest concentration of plastic ever recorded. ""Plastic concentration is increasing - I think the situation is getting worse,"" said Laurent Lebreton ofThe Ocean Cleanup,externalFoundation in Delft, Netherlands, which led the study. ""This really highlights the urgency to take action in stopping the in-flow of plastic into the ocean and also taking measures to clean up the existing mess."" Waste accumulates in five ocean areas, the largest being the patch located between Hawaii and California. Plastic particles found in bottled water 'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution Earth is becoming 'Planet Plastic' Some of the plastic collected The researchers used boats and planes to map this area of the North Pacific, where rotating currents and winds cause marine debris, including plastic, seaweed and plankton, to converge. The three-year mapping effort showed that plastic pollution is ""increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in the surrounding water"", said the international team. Microplastics accounted for 8% of the total mass of plastic afloat within an area of 1.6 million square km. Of the estimated 1.8 trillions bits of plastic, some were larger than microplastics, including fishing nets, toys, and even a toilet seat. Erik van Sebille of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who is not connected with the study, said the amount of plastic discovered was ""staggering"". ""While their estimates come with large uncertainty ranges, they do report a staggering amount of plastic,"" he said. ""And they also discovered that the Garbage Patch is moving around much more than anyone expected."" Modelled mass concentration of plastic in the area The use of aerial surveys as well as boats could partly explain why the new estimates are higher than in the past. However, the differences could also be down to increasing levels of plastic pollution in the time since the previous studies were carried out. Plastic washed out to sea following the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami could account for as much as 20% of plastic accumulating in recent years, the research, published inScientific Reports,external, suggests. Plastics made up 99.9% of all debris in this part of the ocean At least 46% of plastic consisted of fishing nets, and over three quarters of the plastic was debris larger than 5cm, including hard plastics, plastic sheets and film Although most large items had broken down into fragments, the researchers were able to identify a small number of objects, including containers, bottles, lids, packaging straps, ropes, and fishing nets Fifty items in the sample had a readable production date: one from 1977, seven from the 1980s, 17 from the 1990s, 24 from the 2000s and one from 2010 Only certain types of debris that were thick enough to float stayed and accumulated in this zone, such as the common plastics polyethylene and polypropylene, which are used in packaging. Source:Scientific Reports,external Every year, millions of tonnes of plastic enter the ocean.  Some drifts into large systems of circulating ocean currents, known as gyres. Once trapped in a gyre, the plastic will break down into microplastics, which may be ingested by sea life. The message of the study is clear, said Laurent Lebreton. ""It goes back to how we use plastic,"" he said. ""We're not going to get away from plastic - in my opinion it's very useful, in medicine, transportation and construction, but I think we must divert the way we use plastic, particularly in terms of single-use plastic and those objects that have a very short service lifespan.""

"This video can not be played Kevin Boyle, 60, was jailed for 21 years A man who cut a teenager's throat in a case of mistaken identity has been jailed for 21 years. Kevin Boyle, 60, attacked Glen Morrant in Old Christchurch Road, Bournemouth, because he wrongly believed the 18-year-old had confronted him earlier in the night, a court heard. The teenager suffered a 23cm (9in) gash in the attack in August 2017. Boyle, of Wootton Gardens, was found guilty of attempted murder by a jury at Winchester Crown Court. The trial heard he ambushed his victim after waiting outside the Camel Bar where Mr Morrant had been celebrating his A-level results. Boyle mistakenly thought the teenager was one of two men who had confronted him outside the nightclub two hours earlier, the court heard. Kevin Boyle's ""cold and cowardly"" attack nearly killed his victim, police said Mr Morrant was helped by two bystanders who pressed on his neck and face wounds to stop the loss of blood. One of his helpers, Serita Savolainen, said: ""It looked so bad. You could see the neck wound - where it was so long, it was opening up a little bit more. ""He was going into shock. Some people were standing around not knowing what to do."" Bystander Serita Savolainen treated Glen Morrant's wounds The judge ordered Boyle serve two-thirds of the 21-year term and spend an additional five years on licence. Following sentencing, Mr Morrant said: ""The paramedics said Boyle missed my jugular by millimetres and had the wound been any deeper they would not have been able to do anything for me. ""I am pleased that someone like that is off the streets and it is a relief that I will not have to think about him for at least 14 years."" Det Con Chris Griffin said: ""Boyle displayed a terrifying level of violence, slashing the throat of a young man who had simply been out celebrating his A-level results. ""This was a cold and cowardly attack on an innocent young man and could so easily have resulted in his tragic death."" Throat-cut attack captured on CCTV.

"More pupils in England were taken out of school to go on holiday in the last academic year, government figures show. Around one in six youngsters (16.9%) missed at least a half day of lessons during 2016-17, compared with 14.7% in the previous 12 months. The figures also show that the proportion of parents being fined for taking their children out of lessons without permission has fallen. The data covers the time of a father's court case over a term-time break. Jon Platt, from the Isle of Wight, won a high-profile High Court case in May 2016 over taking his daughter out of school for a holiday to Disney World, Florida, without the school's permission. The latest Department for Education (DfE) figures suggest that after this ruling, many mothers and fathers took decisions to take term-time breaks, thinking it was unlikely that they would face action as a result. But Mr Platt's case was later referred to the Supreme Court, where he lost in April 2017. He was also given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay Â£2,000. Term-time holiday dad loses court battle Term-time holiday: What are the rules? Views from the term-time holiday parents A spokesman for the DfE said: ""Children only get one chance at an education and evidence shows that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chances of achieving good GCSEs. ""Therefore we believe that no child should be taken out of school without good reason - and the Supreme Court agrees with us. ""The rules on term-time absences are clear and we have put schools back in control by supporting them - and local authorities - to use their powers to deal with unauthorised absence."" This video can not be played Jon Platt expressed his anger outside the Supreme Court in April last year The overall unauthorised absence rate - pupils missing lessons for any reason without permission - rose from 1.1% to 1.3% between 2015-16 and 2016-17. According to the statistics, the rate is at its highest level since records, covering state schools in England, began. ""This increase in unauthorised absence is due to an increase in absence due to family holidays that were not agreed by the school,"" government statisticians said. Separate data published by the DfE shows the number of penalty notices issued to parents for their child's unauthorised absence dropped by 5.4% between 2015-16 and 2016-17. The majority of fines issued - more than three-quarters (77.5%) - were for unauthorised holidays, the statistics show. Separate figures on penalty notices show there were 149,321 fines handed out in 2016-17, compared with 157,879 the previous year.

"Washington DC has been the scene of many conflicts between political rivals. However, after astorm blanketedtwo senators found a new battleground. Cory Booker, the Democratic senator of New Jersey, threw down the gauntlet on Twitter, challenging Republican senator for Arizona, Jeff Flake, to a snowball fight. Senator Booker referenced the 1804 duel between Alexander Hamilton and his political rival Aaron Burr in his announcement of the showdown. While Mr Hamilton died as a result of losing that duel, in this case Senator Booker simply wagered buying pizza for the winner's staff. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played De la Rue boss Martin Sutherland claimed: ""It is surprising the British government does not support British industry."" The new UK passport to be issued after Brexit will be made in France, the current British manufacturer has said. The burgundy passport, in use since 1988, will revert to its original blue and gold colour from October 2019. The boss of UK supplier De La Rue said it would appeal against the decision to award the Â£490m contract to Franco-Dutch firm Gemalto. The Home Office said a winning bid had been chosen but it was up to the supplier to announce the news. De la Rue's shares closed nearly 6% lower on Thursday. Pro-Brexit former cabinet minister Priti Patel said the decision to hand the new contract to a foreign firm was ""disgraceful"" and ""perverse"". The Liberal Democrats' Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said the ""blue passport saga"" was becoming a farce. ""First it was established that we did not have to leave the EU to have blue passports. Now we learn that the passports will be printed by a foreign company."" Under EU procurement rules, the Home Office had been required to throw open the bidding process to European firms. However, it added that passports did not have to be made in the UK and 20% of blank passport books are currently produced in Europe. This video can not be played Why British passports are changing colours after Brexit â and do Brits welcome the switch? It also said the new deal could save the taxpayer Â£100m-Â£120m and that 70 new jobs would be created in the UK, at sites in Fareham and Heywood in Lancashire. Gemalto, which has its headquarters in Paris and has a factory in Fareham, said it was aware of the reports regarding the contract to produce the new UK passport. But it added: ""As the process is still ongoing and the terms of engagement are confidential, we cannot make any further comment on it at this stage."" A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: ""The chosen company demonstrated that they will be best able to meet the needs of our passport service with a high quality and secure product at the best value for money for our customers and the taxpayer."" Earlier, De La Rue boss Martin Sutherland toldthe BBC's Today programme:""Over the last few months we have heard ministers happy to come on the media and talk about the new blue passport and the fact that it is an icon of British identity. ""But now this icon of British identity is going to be manufactured in France."" He added: ""I'd like to ask Theresa May or Amber Rudd to come to my factory and explain to our dedicated workforce why this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon."" De La Rue, which has held the contract to manufacture British passports since 2009, said it had been ""undercut on price"" by Gemalto. Brexit: All you need to know Growth 'more important than Brexit' Brexit boost for consumers short-lived, says IFS This video can not be played Culture Secretary says procurement process for passports would be different post-Brexit Mr Sutherland said it was unclear whether jobs at the firm's Gateshead factory would be affected. De la Rue employed more than 600 staff at the site last year. The company issued a profit warning on Tuesday, which triggered a sharp fall in its share price. Allow Twitter content?

"Ellie Butler was killed by her father at their south London home in 2013 A man whose six-year-old granddaughter was battered to death has told an inquest her killer father was a ""brutal maniac"" and her murder was ""avoidable"". Ellie Butler was placed in the care of her grandparents, Linda and Neal Gray, after her father Ben Butler was accused of shaking her as a baby. But she was returned to her parents' south London home when his conviction was quashed. She died 11 months later. Social workers agreed with Mr Gray's claim that they ""failed"" Ellie. Butler wasjailed for a minimum of 23 yearsfor inflicting catastrophic head injuries on Ellie while looking after her at their home in Sutton. Mr Gray told South London Coroner's Court on Thursday that his ""whole world caved in"" when Ellie was killed. In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Gray said Ellie had told him and his wife - who died on the first day of Butler's trial - she wanted to stay with them for ""100 million years"" rather than live with her parents. He added that his daughter, Ellie's mother Jennie Gray, was ""just as culpable"" as Butler for what happened. Neal Gray gave evidence at Ellie's inquest at South London Coroner's Court on Thursday ""She stood by and watched that brutal maniac inflict unimaginable injuries, and she defended him without question or remorse,"" he said. ""[Ellie] was placed at fatal risk by being returned to her parents. Her death had been avoidable. ""The circumstances surrounding it must be avoided so that lessons may be learned and other children protected in the future. Her death cannot have been in vain."" Killed girl's granddad disowns daughter The exonerated father who went on to kill The inquest is examining whether there were failures on the part of the authorities in the lead up to Ellie's murder. The judgement is due on 10 April. Mr Gray said staff at Services for Children (S4C) had ""failed in their duty"" to Ellie. Social worker Steven Atherton admitted S4C was ""part of a system that failed this little girl"". Earlier on Thursday, Butler gave evidence to the inquest via video link from prison and repeatedly denied killing Ellie, or abusing her in any way. He said: ""I don't accept I caused harm to Ellie and will fight in a different court to prove it. ""I didn't cause Ellie to die, I didn't cause any injury to Ellie at all."" Ben Butler had a conviction for shaking Ellie when she was a baby quashed He said he will appeal against his conviction. He did admit being verbally abusive to Ellie's mother after texts were read to the inquest. ""I realise the texts were horrendous, the things I had said. For me it was saying bad things in the heat of the moment but I'm pretty ashamed of myself,"" he said. ""But to say [if] you're being abusive to your partner [then] you must be abusive to your children, that's two different things."" Gray told Ellie's inquest via video link thatButler's ""bark was worse than his bite"". She is serving a 42-month jail sentence for child cruelty and perverting the course of justice.

"The former diplomatic staff and their families flew out from Stansted Airport Russian diplomats and their families have left the UK in an expulsion following the Salisbury spy attack. Diplomatic vehicles drove them from the embassy in London to Stansted Airport, where they boarded a plane to Moscow. The UK expelled 23 diplomats after Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was ""culpable"" for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter. The government decided on Tuesday not to impose further sanctions on Russia for now. However, at a meeting of the National Security Council, Mrs May said: ""There are other measures that government and security officials are actively considering and stand ready to deploy at any time."" Strict checks by border officials on private flights have been introduced as the UK increases efforts to monitor and track those entering the country, Mrs May's spokesman added. What happens when you expel a diplomat? Russia stockpiling nerve agent - Johnson Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Spy poisoning: What we know so far Moscow has denied all involvement, and is expelling 23 British diplomats in response. The UK diplomats have until Saturday to leave Russia. The Kremlin is also closing down both the British Council in Russia, which promotes cultural ties between the nations, and the consulate in St Petersburg. The Russian foreign ministry, meanwhile, has invited all foreign ambassadors in Moscow to a meeting on Wednesday to clarify the Russian position on the Skripal affair, the Russian news agency Interfax has reported. The Russian Embassy in London said around 80 people - including the Russian intelligence officers and their families - were due to leave the UK on Tuesday, the deadline given by Mrs May. A small crowd gathered outside the embassy and waved goodbye to people carrying suitcases, children and pets as they boarded vehicles. Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenkotweeted:,external""Today we bid farewell to our colleagues heading home after the hostile move of the UK Government, and wish them all the best in their careers."" Around Russian 80 nationals were aboard the plane heading for Moscow The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said launching further measures ""risks an endless tit for tat with the Kremlin"". But ""not to do so risks accusations of weakness from some quarters,"" he added. Meanwhile, drivers or cyclists who captured video footage near the home of a murdered Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov on 11 March or 12 March arebeing asked to contact police.,external Mr Glushkov wasfound dead from apparent ""compression to his neck""at his home in New Malden, south-west London last week. Russianformer military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal,66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench and unconscious on 4 March. They had been exposed to a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, the UK government claims. More than two weeks on from the attack, the head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, said the focus of the Salisbury investigation is ""on the movements of the Skripals"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Officers are trawling through 4,000 hours of CCTV footage and have already taken 400 statements with more to come. ""It is going to take weeks, possibly months,"" Mr Basu told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: ""This is going to be frustrating for people."" Meanwhile, following a phone call between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mrs May, Downing Street said Japan condemned the Salisbury attack and ""shared our outrage"". The leaders of France, Germany and the US have already pledged support for the UK in a joint statement and the EU offered its ""unqualified solidarity"". EU leaders will meet at a summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss any potential response to Russia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbynsaid the UK must still deal with Russia despite ""all fingers"" pointing to itover the Salisbury spy attack. He said he would ""do business"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin but assertively and on the basis of the UK's values. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsonpreviously said it is ""overwhelmingly likely"" that President Putin ordered the nerve agent attack.Russia said the accusations were ""shocking and unforgivable"". Mr Skripal, a retired military intelligence colonel, came to the UK in 2010 after being released from prison in Russia. He had been jailed in Moscow in 2006 for spying for Britain and passing the identities of Russian secret agents in Europe to MI6, the UK's Secret Intelligence Service.

In footage released on Wednesday by the Tempe police department, the human Uber operator sitting inside the Volvo appears to be looking down at something while the vehicle is travelling in autonomous mode. Moments later, the woman appears visibly shocked as she looks up to see Ms Herzberg crossing the highway in their path seconds before impact. Uber has been testing autonomous Volvo vehicles ""The video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with Elaine's loved ones,"" Uber said in a statement. ""Our cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state and federal authorities in any way we can,"" the statement added. Police said the accident happened on Sunday night, adding that Ms Herzberg had not been using a pedestrian crossing. Ms Herzberg was taken to a local hospital following the collision but died of her injuries. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board earlier said they would be investigating the incident in Tempe. While self-driving cars have been involved in multiple accidents, it is thought to be the first time an autonomous car has been involved in a fatal collision with a pedestrian.

"This video can not be played Andreea Cristea's sister Magda Toi says life ""is just not the same"" without her The sister of a Romanian tourist who fell into the Thames during the Westminster terror attack has said she refuses to dwell on the killer. Andreea Cristea, 31, and boyfriend Andrei Burnaz, were driven at by Khalid Masood on London's Westminster Bridge. A year after the attack, Magda Toi said thinking of her sister's killer only made her angry. ""I'm not interested in it because my sister is dead and no-one and nothing will bring her back,"" she said. Ms Cristea, on her first trip to the UK, was hurled into the Thames as Masoodsped at a crowd on Westminster Bridge on 22 March 2017. She survived the 20ft (6m) fall from the bridge, despite being seriously injured. She died in hospital two weeks later. Victims of the Westminster terror attack The good people win, says terror attack MP How the Westminster attack unfolded Three months after her death she was buried in her home town of ConstanÈa, Romania. Ms Cristea,was one of five people killed by Masood, who was shot dead by armed officers. Magda Toi said she had desperately hoped her sister would survive Commemorations have been held across London to mark the anniversary of the Westminster terror attack, including: MPs observed a minute's silence in the Commons to remember the dead, while faith groups held a vigil in Trafalgar Square Prime Minister Theresa May has laid a floral tribute outside Parliament The Mayor of London has organised a digital book of condolence, as part of a 3D installation in City Hall that will be open to the public until 19 June - the anniversary of the Finsbury Park attack Khalid Masood was shot dead by armed officers Ms Cristea had been posing for a photograph just minutes before she was hit, her family said. Ms Toi recalled the moment Mr Burnaz called to say there had been an attack. ""You don't expect to hear on the phone that something tragic has happened,"" she said. Describing her sister, who she helped to raise, Ms Toi said: ""She was very joyful, she was always smiling and loving life. She loved to travel. ""We desperately hoped that she wouldn't die. We thought - if she was found alive in the river - there would be a small chance of survival. Andreea posed for a photograph moments before the attack on Westminster Bridge ""She survived the brain operation and we thought - she has a chance. But she didn't."" Ms Toi added: ""It's very hard to express in words how you feel about someone you miss. ""We still don't believe that this is happening. It's like a nightmare that we wait to finish. ""We wait for her to come to the door or to ring on the phone and suddenly you wake up and know that this won't happen."" She said the family would mark the first anniversary of the attack by taking donations and food to a children's centre.

"The Bank of England has left the door open to raise UK interest rates in May after making no change this month, holding them steady at 0.5%. Two members of the Bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee -  Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders - backed an increase in rates to 0.75%. That was a departure from the unanimous vote at the last MPC meeting in February. In November, theBank raised rates to 0.5%, the first increase for a decade. The MPC said ""ongoing tightening"" was likely to be needed to return inflation back to the Bank's 2% target. On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics saidconsumer price inflation was 2.7% in February, down from 3% the previous month and the lowest figure since July 2017. Kallum Pickering at Berenberg said the March minutes ""give the nod to market pricing for a May hike"". What would a rate rise mean for you? US Federal Reserve raises rates Alan Clarke at Scotiabank said he was ""more and more confident"" that the MPC would raise rates in May. ""Thereafter we expect a rate hike in November, but it's not going to be plain sailing getting there,"" he added. However, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics argued that the committee members would wait until August to raise interest rates again. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) reaffirmed its call for a 0.25 percentage point rise every six months to bring the rate to 2% in 2020-21. The MPC is treading a familiar path. First: signal an interest rate rise is coming by toughening up the language. Bank governor Mark Carney said at the last MPC meeting in February that everyone should start preparing for more rapid interest rate increases than previously signalled. Second: notice that the two hawks on the MPC have split from the more doveish tendency. Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders voted for a rate rise today, just as they did last year for three successive MPC meetings before they were joined by other members of the committee. Rates were finally raised in November to 0.5%. Third: watch the market predict a ""nailed on"" rate rise for the next MPC meeting. Most now believe that a rate rise at the next meeting in May is all but certain. Just two points of caution. Inflation fell more rapidly than expected earlier this week, undermining claims that price rise pressure is a present risk. Growth is fairly weak, and too sharp a yank on the interest rate lever could apply dampeners just when they are not needed. Official figures released on Wednesday showed that average earnings rose by 2.6% in the three months to January - the fastest pace since 2015. On Wednesday, the government announced a 6.5% pay rise for many NHS workers over the next three years. Higher wages could make it harder for the Bank to see inflation fall closer to its 2% target. Muted economic growth is another complication. Last month, the Bank forecast growth of 1.8% for this year and 2019 - well below the UK's historic average. Thursday's MPC minutes said the UK economy would suffer a ""temporary"" hit from the recent cold weather, suggesting growth may slow to 0.3% in the first quarter, down from 0.4% for the last three months of 2017.

"Critics may carp that Donald Trump skipped economics class, like a certain 1980s movie truant. But as the 45th president himself notes, Abraham Lincoln and other historic Republican leaders loved tariffs. ""This bill is an American bill. It is made for the American people and for American interests."" That sounds like President Trump. But it's William McKinley - another ""America First"" Republican president - on his Tariff Act of 1890. When McKinley slapped high duties on US imports, some fellow conservatives thought the powerful Ohio congressman dubbed the ""Napoleon of Protection"" had gone too far. ""It is the most shameful measure ever proposed to a civilised people,"" fumed Secretary of State James Blaine. ""Go on with it and it will carry our nation to perdition."" White House economic adviser Gary Cohn might well echo that view in regard to current policy. Cohn, a Democrat, is to quit after losing a battle against Trump's tariff. Congressional Republicans are also imploring the president to drop the plan. This video can not be played Trump takes a parting shot at 'Globalist Gary' But despite the outcry, Trump has pointed out that raising the economic drawbridge is thoroughly in keeping with his party's historical roots. It wasn't just McKinley who believed protectionism key to American greatness. Tariffs were the Republican creed from the Civil War to the Great Depression, and a fundamental doctrine of its preceding party, the Whigs. Going even further back, the first US Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, now a Broadway musical hero, pioneered tariffs to protect infant American industries from foreign competition. So did fellow Founding Father James Madison. Republicans from the mid-19th Century onwards continued to champion this fiscal firewall so northern manufacturers could compete with European imports, according to Charles Hankla, professor of political science at Georgia State University. Trump's impact on trade with Asia US to loosen crisis-era banking rules Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Democrats, he says, espoused free trade as they were aligned with southern slave-owning plantations that exported cotton to British mills. It was Abraham Lincoln who inaugurated the Republican party's economic nationalism. Yes, the Great Emancipator was also the Great Protectionist. ""Give us a protective tariff and we will have the greatest nation on earth,"" he said in 1844. While Trump is sometimes accused of economic illiteracy, Abe himself once apparently exhibited a flimsy grasp of his pet policy while campaigning for Congress in Illinois. Tariffs would only be collected from ""those whose pride, whose abundance of means, prompt them to spurn the manufacturers of our own country and strut in British cloaks and coats and pantaloons"", he insisted, according to a biography of him by David Herbert Donald. Lincoln didn't have a quick answer for why import tariffs would make things cheaper A journalist challenged Lincoln on the stump to explain why he thought these duties would make everything cheaper for farmers. The candidate is said to have replied that he ""could not tell the reason, but it was so"". Theodore Roosevelt was another Republican president who extolled tariffs as a buttress to American power, according to a biography of him by Edmund Morris. In 1895, the Rough Rider wrote: ""In this country pernicious indulgence in the doctrine of free trade seems inevitably to produce fatty degeneration of the moral fibre."" Despite protectionism's naysayers, the Gilded Age was one of fabulous prosperity. Political scientists still debate whether the boom was helped or hindered by all those import taxes. It took two world wars and an international economic cataclysm in the first half of the 20th Century to convert conservatives to free trade. Heather Cox Richardson, author of To Make Men Free: a History of the Republican Party, says: ""All of the people coming out of the [Great] Depression and World War Two are terrified of starting that again. ""So Republicans and Democrats actually begin to look very much alike in terms of their economic policies."" Trump announces steel tariffs on Thursday - with a portrait of Theodore Roosevelt behind him In the 1950s, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower unabashedly touted free trade as a means to bind the West together in a bulwark against communism. By doing so, he ushered in the modern era of globalisation. Every Republican leader since has been a pragmatic free trader, even if the siren song of populism has at times proved too potent to resist. Richard Nixon experimented with duties on imports. Ronald Reagan slapped a tariff on Japanese motorcycles. George W Bush targeted steel imports, only to back down after the World Trade Organization threatened sanctions. Bush's trade debacle confirmed the worst fears of many grassroots conservatives. Some Republicans have been deeply suspicious of multilateral agreements since the aftermath of World War One, says Richardson, a history professor at Boston College. They fretted that these pacts would establish ""One World Order, that free traders were going to destroy America by letting foreigners come in and call the shots"". ""There was also resentment among people who believed they were being left behind in the post-World War Two order,"" she adds. ""And that is the concept Donald Trump capitalised on."" US olive farmers pitted against Spaniards Is the US solar industry about to tear itself apart? One result of Trump's recent policy is that a notorious 1930 trade law - remembered in popular culture for its amusing cameo in a cinema classic - is back in the spotlight. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, a Republican measure that imposed hundreds of import duties, is generally agreed to have worsened the Great Depression. In the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, this bill is the subject of a lecture to catatonically bored high school students. This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? The film's hero - an affluent child of Reagan's Morning in America - had skipped class. Trump's critics argue that he has not learned the lesson of Smoot-Hawley either. They warn he risks reigniting the beggar-thy-neighbour trade wars waged amid the ruination of the global economy nine decades ago. The multi-billion dollar question is, when and where will Trump's tariff end? It's anyone's guess. Or as Ferris Bueller'smonotonous teacher,externalwould say: ""Anyone? Anyone?""

"This video can not be played Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, EU Commissioner for Trade Levi jeans and bourbon could be hit with a 25% import tax by the European Union if President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on European steel and aluminium. Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, EU Commissioner for Trade, told the BBC the items were on a draft list of US goods to be taxed. Last week, the President said he would tax imported steel, declaring: ""trade wars are good"". His comments have prompted reaction around the world. Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her concern in a telephone call to Mr Trump on Sunday. Levi Strauss came out strongly against trade barriers. A company spokesperson told the BBC: ""We support open markets and free trade where everyone plays by the rules. Unilateral tariff impositions risk retaliation and destabilizing the global economy, in which case American brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer."" Kamal Ahmed: Why Trump is playing tough on trade Ms MalmstrÃ¶m told the BBC: ""We are looking at possibilities to retaliate, meaning we will also put taxes or tariffs on US imports to the European Union."" She said they would wait for the final decision, but added that ""we are of course preparing. This has been in the air for some time"". She said that if the US went ahead and applied taxes to European steel, the EU would take the issue to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Ms MalmstrÃ¶m stressed that Europe was looking to respond ""to retaliate but not escalate"". But any action by Europe is likely to provoke further action by the US. Shares in major European car makers fell on Monday following a threat by US President Trump to tax their vehicles. Mr Trump said if the EU ""wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies... we will simply apply a tax on their cars"". The US is an important market for cars built in the country. US demand for British-built cars rose by 7% in 2017, with exports reaching almost 210,000, and the US is now the UK's second-largest trading partner after the EU, taking 15.7% of car exports. Why Trump is hanging tough on trade What would China do in a US trade war? Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? Mr Trump has decried the ""$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies"", and vowed to end it. On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. Then came Saturday's threat on EU-made cars. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In January, he had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. Downing Street said that during Mrs May's call to President Trump on Sunday she raised ""our deep concern at the President's forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties' interests."" Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China's National People's Congress, said it was natural that ""some friction will exist"" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (Â£420bn) last year. But he said China would take ""necessary measures"" if its interests were hurt. Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"". EU trade chiefs could apply 25% tariffson around $3.5bn of imports from the US - targeting iconic US exports including Levi's jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and Bourbon whiskey. Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. The move has also been strongly criticised by the International Monetary Fund and the WTO. Where Trump stands on world trade A number of Republicans have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay. Senator Ben Sasse agreed that ""kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families"". Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, told the BBC the proposed tariffs were ""a very costly and inefficient way to help a small number of people"". He says consumers are likely to face higher prices. ""This could be bad or awful, there's no scenario under which it's good."" Industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. But steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Indiana will welcome Mr Trump's comments. Trade Partnership, a Washington-based economics and consulting firm,released an analysis,externalpredicting that the tariffs would lead to net loss of about 146,000 jobs in the US, or more than five for every one gained. President Trump hinted on Monday that if the US achieved a better deal for itself in the latest North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) he would abandon plans for a tariff on Canada's and Mexico's steel imports.

The rest of the tweet is a reference to Canada and US farmers. All three major US stock indexes - the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq - rose by 1% or more on Monday, as investors interpreted Mr Trump's comments as a sign that his plan for tariffs remains up for debate. Substantial changes to the Nafta agreement are not likely to happen soon, however. The current round of Nafta talks, about updating the 24-year old treaty, finished on Monday with little progress. This is the seventh round of eight scheduled meetings. The next is planned for April. The US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the â¬192bn (Â£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%).

"The US plans to impose tariffs on up to $60bn (Â£42.5bn) in Chinese imports and limit the country's investment in the US in retaliation for years of alleged intellectual property theft. The White House said the actions were necessary to counter unfair competition from China's state-led economy. It said years of talks had failed to produce change. China said it was ready to retaliate with ""necessary measures"". Beijing also said it would ""fight to the end"" in any trade war with the US. US stock markets closed lower on Thursday, as investors responded to the announcement. The Dow Jones ended the day at 23,957.89, a fall of 2.9% or 724.42 points - making it the fifth biggest points fall ever. The S&P 500 shed 2.5% or 68.24 points to 2,643.69, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.4% or 178.61 points to finish at 7,166.68. Signing a memo related to the sanctions, Mr Trump said the US and China were negotiating and he was looking for ""reciprocal"" trade terms for American companies. He said the tariffs might be imposed on up to $60bn in Chinese goods - boosting the number from the roughly $50bn figure White House officials cited on Thursday morning during a briefing. The tariffs follow an investigation of Chinese policies ordered by Mr Trump in August. The White House said the review found a range of ""unfair"" practices in China, including restrictions on foreign ownership that pressured foreign companies into transferring technology. The review also found evidence that China imposes unfair terms on US companies; steers investments in the US to strategic industries; and conducts and supports cyber attacks. The White House said it has a list of more than 1,000 products that could be targeted by tariffs of 25%. Businesses will have the opportunity to comment before the final list goes into effect. Trump: Political heir to Abe Lincoln? The problem facing Trump's China probe EU and six other countries exempted from US metals tariffs The US is also exploring ways to limit Chinese investment in the US and will seek to bring complaints about unfair licensing terms to the World Trade Organization, officials said. America's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said protecting US technology was critical to America's economic future. America's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said the US wanted to put ""maximum pressure on China and minimum pressure on US consumers"". On Thursday, China's commerce ministry said it was ready to retaliate against the new tariffs. ""China will not sit idly by and let its legitimate rights and interests be harmed, and will certainly take all necessary measures to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests,"" it said in a statement. The ministry also pointed to a ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that found that Washington had not fully complied with a 2014 ruling against its anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese products, including solar panels and wind towers. China's commerce ministry said the WTO ruling ""proves that the US side has violated WTO rules"" and ""repeatedly abused trade remedy measures"". ""[This] has seriously damaged the fair and just nature of the international trade environment, and weakened the stability of the multilateral trading system."" The WTO has also ruled against China's trade practices. In January, the organisation said China must lower its tariffs on broiler chickens imported from the US. If imposed as described, the tariffs could lead to higher costs for consumers, while retaliation would hit key sectors of the US economy including agriculture and aerospace, analysts say. China was the third largest market for US exports in 2016 and among the biggest buyers of American soybeans, corn, pork and aircraft. On Thursday, shares of plane-maker Boeing sank more than 5%. Representatives of states such as Kansas, which has a large farming base, have been among the most critical of the administration's approach. Several business groups said they agree that there is a problem, but are worried about the administration's strategy. ""American business wants to see solutions to these problems, not just sanctions such as unilateral tariffs that may do more harm than good,"" said John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council, which represents firms that do business in China. US officials acknowledged the possibility of retaliation but say China has more to lose from the relationship. The US imports billions more goods from China each year than it exports, creating a deficit of about $375bn last year that Mr Trump has railed against. The president said Thursday he has asked China to cut that deficit by $100bn ""immediately"". This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? Many analysts dismiss worries about the trade deficit, noting that the exchange benefits both sides. However, there is growing bipartisan concern in America about China's state-led economy and worry that China is seeking technology that could be deployed for military purposes. Congress is debating legislation that would boost the government's power to review foreign business deals, citing the threat posed by state-backed acquisition of US firms. Some politicians remain critical of the administration's approach, saying Mr Trump's bluster aggravates the situation and alienates allies who could help address the problem. ""I get a kind of stomp-your-feet approach makes some people feel good, but in the integrated economy we already have, it's more complex,"" Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday. Steel producers around the world are concerned about US tariffs on steel imports Mr Trump has embraced ""America First"" rhetoric - including criticism of China - that blames other countries for the loss of American jobs and plays well with parts of his base.

His administration has publicised cases brought for dumping goods in the US below cost, but the end result of some of his actions remain in flux. For example, in March, he signed controversial orders imposing heavy tariffs on steel and aluminium - but said some countries such as Canada and Mexico would be spared. The EU and other countries are also in line for exemptions. He is also renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Canada and Mexico.

" The results of an international trial show stem cell transplants can vastly improve the lives of some people with multiple sclerosis. The gruelling treatment involves wiping out a patient's faulty immune system with drugs used to treat cancer - and then rebuilding it using stem cell transplants. The BBC's Caroline Wyatt, who was deemed unsuitable for a trial in the UK, paid for a stem cell transplant in Mexico. Early one evening, the world around me began to spin uncontrollably. My brain froze as the dizziness took hold. My legs gave way and I collapsed on to a friend's living room floor. It was late in 2002 and this was the start of my long, slow path to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and, finally last year, a stem cell transplant. I had spent that week in 2002 filming Siberian tigers in the far east of Russia. We had just flown back through eight time zones to Moscow when I collapsed. A brain scan showed a lesion on the right side of my brain. It wasn't clear exactly what that meant. The neurologist told me that while it might be an early sign of MS, it could equally well be nothing to worry about. “Do come back if you find that you can't walk,” he said with a polite smile as he showed me out. Because I looked so well, it took another 13 years before I was definitively diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS in late 2015. Yet I'd known something was badly wrong when the very first symptoms appeared in 1992, and my arms and hands became so weak and numb that I couldn't type, wash my hair, or even lift a kettle. That was diagnosed as repetitive strain injury, and it improved after several months of rest. But it never really went away, and the fatigue that came with it got worse with every year. Later on, I was told that my constant tiredness was chronic fatigue syndrome, which is also known as ME. The early symptoms of multiple sclerosis are often so similar to many other diseases that it's not unusual to have a lengthy period between the onset of the illness and a definitive diagnosis. By 2015, the symptoms were unmistakable. When I went numb down much of my body for several weeks, I was given another brain scan and finally diagnosed with MS. The neurologist put me on a drug called Tecfidera, which was aimed at modifying the course of the disease. But the tablets didn't work for me. Not long after starting them, I collapsed again - this time in the street - and woke up the next day with double vision. For several months afterwards, I was unable to walk properly and suffered constant dizziness, nerve damage to the eyes and tinnitus. That relapse also left me with problems with proprioception - the knowledge of where my limbs are in space. This meant that I knocked over my cup of tea, or the glass by my bedside at night, and bumped into doors and walls with bruising regularity. This time it was a new lesion on my brain stem that had caused the relapse. The brain stem is one of the most important parts of the brain - regulating the central nervous system, and controlling essential functions such as breathing, swallowing, heart rate, blood pressure and consciousness. The after-effects of that relapse were so bad that I had to give up the job I loved as a specialist correspondent for the BBC. My ability to find words, think and speak clearly, or comprehend and remember material quickly, was - and remains - much diminished. Thankfully my sense of humour was still intact, as my friends and family made light of the eye patch I wore across one eye to deal with the double vision. Each eye was still functioning, but the part of the brain that should have correctly interpreted and merged the signals coming in from both eyes was not. I'm still grateful every day that the double vision resolved itself a few months later. I'd always joked that in order to work in TV news, all you had to be able to do was walk and talk at the same time. But by mid-2016 I could no longer do that. As I lay awake in bed at night, my arms and legs were so weak that I feared that I would soon need a carer just to help me get dressed in the morning. When a kindly nurse at the hospital suggested that bladder problems meant I might think about new drugs, or perhaps even a catheter, I decided I had to take action. At the age of 49, I was not yet ready to accept a level of disability that would take away my independence. I'd seen a Panorama programme made by my colleague Fergus Walsh in 2016 about medical trials using stem cell transplants for MS. It showed near-miraculous results for some patients, especially those with relapsing-remitting MS. The trials in Chicago were led by Dr Richard Burt, with patients taking part at centres around the world. Many years ago while still in training, Dr Burt noticed that leukaemia patients needed to be re-immunised against common illnesses after their immune system was wiped out by chemotherapy. He wondered whether it might have the same impact on auto-immune diseases such as MS by destroying the faulty immune system, with its cellular memory of disease, and allowing the body to start again - or ‘reboot’ - from scratch. It was the beginning of the long journey tohis latest randomised trial results. The initial stage of the trial was aimed at showing that MS patients could safely undergo chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant using the patient's own cells - the building blocks of the immune system. The process is known as a non-myeloablative autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HSCT for short. The first such experimental transplants for MS were performed in the mid-1990s in both Greece and America. However, early mortality rates were unacceptably high. The patients selected were often in the late progressive stages of MS and it was not yet clear what dose of chemotherapy worked best. But as time went on, the centres around the world that offered HSCT for auto-immune diseases began to work out which drugs were most suitable, and what dose of chemotherapy was sufficient to halt MS - as opposed to cancer - without a too-high risk of death. After reading as many of the medical papers as I could, I contacted the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, where neurologist Professor Basil Sharrack and haematologist Dr John Snowden were leading the UK arm of the trial. They offered to perform the stringent tests that were required to see if I would qualify under the trial's strict criteria for treatment. I was deeply grateful to the team at Sheffield for agreeing to see me, but devastated when I learned that I didn't qualify. One of the key tests for patients taking part in the trials or having such treatment on the NHS is an MRI brain scan, which the trials state must show active and inflammatory lesions on the brain. Image from one of Caroline Wyatt's brain scans My initial scan didn't, suggesting to the team that I wouldn't be a good candidate for a stem cell transplant. By then I was aware that I might already be on the cusp of moving into secondary progressive MS, when the illness is well-entrenched and the degeneration of the brain can no longer be stopped. That can mean HSCT may not work as well - or at all - to halt further progression. My decision to go ahead with HSCT abroad was a tough one, reached after long discussions with my family and friends. I was aware that there is a small but significant chance of death (well under 1%) from infection or other complications during or after chemotherapy. That risk is deemed acceptable in more acute illnesses such as cancers that would kill if left untreated. But many neurologists in the UK remain wary of recommending harsh chemotherapy agents for people with MS, whose illness is considered lifelong and chronic. Some prefer to take a “wait and see” approach, rather than treating MS early on with the most powerful but expensive drugs that are now available. Those, too, can have serious side-effects. No neurologist had been able to explain why I had MS nor what had caused it. Decades of scientific research have shown that more than 100 genes can play a role, and that environmental factors may combine with a trigger to set off the fault in the system that leads to MS. Stress often makes symptoms worse. It's thought that MS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective fatty layer of myelin surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, causing scarring or sclerosis. It's a little like mice nibbling on electrical cables and short-circuiting the electricity supply, making the lights flicker on and off before coming back to life - or leaving you permanently sitting in darkness. Those with relapsing-remitting MS may have periods of near-normality, as I did, interspersed with damaging relapses associated with inflammation that causes lesions to develop within the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. *Figure does not include other drugs, including painkillers. anti-spasticity medication etc...(NHS England 2016-17) I was quite happy to undergo chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant if it meant potentially keeping the mice at bay and the lights on for longer, and halting the progression of my MS. I understood that in HSCT, the chemotherapy was aimed at killing off the malfunctioning immune system before the body reboots and reconstitutes a new one - ideally without the faults of the old one. One of my main worries ahead of treatment was that there is a period after chemotherapy, called neutropenia, during which other infections can quickly take hold if not prevented. That can even lead to sepsis, which can be deadly if not treated in time. Yet by the end of 2016, I already felt that the disease itself was killing me - just more slowly than cancer would. Because I looked (and still do) in the very best of health, it was hard for anyone to comprehend that I really was ill and found it difficult to perform even the simplest tasks at home or at work. For me, that small chance of death following chemotherapy was infinitely preferable to the certainty of further silent decline. Day by day, year by year, many people with MS lose a small part of themselves in that daily struggle against constant but invisible neurological fatigue and pain. Many of us see our hopes and ambitions die, and all too often lose our jobs, marriages and closest relationships. Living with a partner who's always exhausted - and whose ability to see, speak or walk can vary from day to day - is rarely easy. Many relationships break up thanks to MS, including my own. And life expectancy for those with MS is usually reduced by some seven to 10 years. While disease-modifying drugs may help alter the course of the disease, many of them can also make patients feel worse. This means that quality of life often suffers with or without drugs. I researched having HSCT for MS elsewhere in the UK after finding out that it is now performed in London by the NHS for patients who qualify, at hospitals including Kings College, Charing Cross and University College Hospital. It is also offered privately. For me, though, time was running out. I'd failed to meet the criteria in Sheffield, so I doubted I would fare better in London. The process of being accepted for treatment there could take many more months. This was precious time in which a fresh relapse might leave my brain so damaged that it might never recover. After speaking to other patients who had undergone HSCT, I applied to Clinica Ruiz in Puebla, Mexico - a private haematology clinic with more than two years of experience of treating international MS patients with stem cell transplants. That meant raising some £60,000 ($84,000) in total to pay for flights, accommodation, nursing care and the treatment itself. It was still significantly cheaper than having the treatment privately in the UK. I was well aware of how lucky I am to have family, friends and colleagues who rallied round to help me to raise the money. Suddenly, in December 2016, Clinica Ruiz got in touch to offer me an earlier date for treatment. I could start on 1 January 2017. That month was a blur of mixed emotions. My oldest brother Simon offered to take me to Puebla, while my middle brother Antony would collect me at the end of treatment. Not surprisingly, my family had serious reservations about me flying into the unknown for a treatment that carried some risk. They were reassured by the fact that Dr Guillermo Ruiz-Arguilles, the chief haematologist at the family-run clinic, had been carrying out stem cell transplants for cancer patients for many years. He had also treated hundreds of MS patients, with good results. Caroline Wyatt with Dr Guillermo Ruiz-Arguilles What also mattered to me was that Clinica Ruiz offered outpatient treatment, with an apartment for each patient to live in with a carer. That meant that during the neutropenic phase, when the immune system is severely compromised, I could control my own environment more effectively, and ensure it remained as free of germs as possible. I decided to pay to have a fully qualified nurse from the clinic live with me for the duration of the 28 days of treatment, for added reassurance and to avoid my brother's cooking. The first day after moving into the apartment in Puebla was taken up by medical tests to ensure that everyone in our group of 20 international patients was fit for transplant. On my second day in Puebla, it was time for the first chemo session. Our sub-group of five patients plus five carers was driven to the clinic from our apartments. I watched as the modern quarter of the city with its shiny new skyscrapers gave way to the smaller, more colourful streets of the old quarter, and wondered what on earth I was doing here. Once at the small, unassuming clinic building, we sat back in comfy leather armchairs as the cyclophosphamide chemotherapy agent dripped slowly into our veins through a needle inserted into the back of our hands. My nurse Yoselim (known as Joy) explained each step and brought water and sick-bags. I was thoroughly ill during each of the four days of chemotherapy, despite anti-nausea drugs. Early each morning, a doctor or nurse would come to the apartment to administer an injection of a mobilising agent that would encourage the stem cells from our bone marrow ahead of the stem cell harvest. Remarkably, despite the nausea during and after those first chemotherapy sessions, I began to feel my “brain fog” lifting. I could read and remember words normally again. No longer did I awake to crippling migraines or headaches in the morning, while the nerve pain in my fingers and toes gradually eased. Best of all, the weight of the concrete bollards that I felt were attached to my legs and arms diminished, although the tinnitus that rang in my ears night and day did not go away. As the days in Mexico wore on, my energy levels rose. Though that may well have been thanks to the steroids that I was taking, and the time available to simply sleep when I needed to, rather than dragging my increasingly disabled body and brain to work. I woke up in the morning feeling well-rested for the first time in years, without the sense of heaviness and confusion in my brain that had become worse with every passing year. The doubts and fears that I had harboured for so many months before the treatment began to disappear. Even the part I had been dreading most was not as bad as anticipated. I was heavily sedated during the insertion of a central venous catheter, also known as a central venous line, into my chest. It would help ease the passage of blood from my veins on stem cell harvest day, and during the stem cells' return a few days later. On stem cell harvest day, I awoke feeling extremely nervous. We were told that we would not be able to go to the loo during apheresis - the stem cell harvest - for the four hours or so that it would last. The clinic recommended nappies, as continence is a problem for many patients with MS. On the same day after the harvest came our penultimate chemotherapy session, with patients hooked up once again - this time to the chemo drip - for a few hours. Our group sat chatting, reading or watching films, with some patients even Skyping friends and family back at home. I'd brought two books with me that day, Atul Gawande's Being Mortal and AA Gill's Pour Me. Somehow, reading about death while hoping for a fresh lease of life with a new immune system felt strangely cheering. In Puebla, the morning of Saturday 14 January 2017 dawned bright and sunny. At 11:30, for one hour, lying down in a comfortable room, I received the stem cells back that would spark the growth of my new immune system. One that I hoped would no longer mistakenly attack the myelin sheath around my nerves, as it had done for so long. Every second of the cells seeping into my veins felt like a rebirth, although I didn't know what the outcome would be. What was flowing through my veins was hope, for the first time in a very long time. Every day for the next 10 days, I was monitored for neutropenia, with blood samples taken every other morning, and an appointment with the haematologist to see how the new blood cells were faring. The cleaner who came to the flat every day left the apartment spotlessly clean and sanitized, to avoid any infection during the period in which the immune system is dangerously low. All food had to be well-cooked in order to avoid food poisoning, while trips out of the flat were restricted to appointments at the clinic. My appetite was smaller than usual, but still healthy. Joy cooked porridge for breakfast and delicious chicken soups or vegetable stews for supper. To my delight, guacamole was still allowed (avocados have a hard skin, so they don't let in bacteria), so I was able to enjoy the best freshly made guacamole I'd ever had. The final infusion was a dose of Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets a protein called CD20 that is found on the surface of white blood cells called B-lymphocytes or B-cells. It is aimed at depleting any remaining lymphocytes following chemotherapy. Doctors conducting HSCT treatment for MS and other auto-immune diseases at clinics around the world often use slightly different protocols, with varying intensities and drugs. More trials are needed to show which protocol works best. But because HSCT uses a method that is already approved for cancer, and drugs that are already licensed for stem cell transplants, there is less money available for trials of HSCT than for new MS drugs, which can prove more profitable for pharmaceutical companies. Even those wishing to study HSCT results from trials around the world have sometimes had to fight hard for funding. So why is it taking so long for HSCT to be accepted as a treatment for MS in the UK? “It has been very challenging,” says Paolo Muraro, professor of neurology, neuroimmunology and immunotherapy at Imperial College London, and the lead author of the largest long-term follow-up so far of HSCT for MS. “A mixture of financial conflict of interests, scepticism, conservative views of MS being a ‘non-malignant’ disease and consequent reluctance and slowness in adopting new therapies involving any risks has slowed down progress.” By the time I left Mexico on 28 January with my brother Antony helping me into a wheelchair to navigate the airport's long corridors, I felt very different to the patient who had arrived with such trepidation just 28 days earlier. By now I had almost no hair as the chemotherapy had caused it to drop out, but that was a small price to pay if it meant I now had the chance to grow a new, functioning immune system. After a brief stop at duty free, I also had a rather wonderful sombrero to hide beneath. Once back in the UK, I was in quarantine at home for several months while my new immune system rebooted. But for me, and for some others, the recovery period has proved far harder than the transplant itself. Chemotherapy is an aggressive treatment, with many after-effects. It's not surprising that the NHS discourages patients from seeking such serious medical treatment abroad - not least because it has a duty of care to pick up the pieces if anything goes wrong. For the first weeks back at home, I slept a lot as I came down from my steroid high, and my energy levels crashed. The second week brought some improvements to my balance, while the third week saw me able to walk further than before, albeit still with support from my trusty walking stick. I continued to avoid people, colds and flu. After the first months, I was able to start stretching exercises at home, and I noticed that the blurriness in my left eye was receding, although my brain and limbs still felt fragile and unreliable. But the following months proved far more challenging.Chemotherapy has a major impact on hormones, especially on top of the menopause. For several months, sleep proved elusive, as I lay either shivering in a cold sweat or wide awake with hot flushes. Most HSCT patients over the age of 32 will be left infertile by the chemotherapy, according to the researchers in Chicago. This is a major consideration for any younger patient. MS had left me unable to have children, so that wasn't a worry for me. Then the migraines began to return, along with the painful stiffness, spasms and numbness in my limbs. It is often said that the recovery from a stem cell transplant for MS is a rollercoaster ride. A little over one year on, that remains true for me and for many others. Today, I quite often feel worse than I did before HSCT. I still need to rest frequently during the day, and when I use my energy for work, I have none left for anything else at all. But there are sunnier days when I feel a little better than I did immediately before the treatment, and then my hopes soar. Of the other HSCT patients with whom I keep in touch via several vital support groups on Facebook, some have seen improvements and are overjoyed. Once again, they can play a full part in family life, and work without exhaustion. Many train hard at the gym or at home, doing their best to regain limb function and balance that was lost over many years. Others report little change. And a few have said that they now feel worse than they ever did before HSCT, and wish they had never had the treatment. Some have had fresh relapses since their transplant, and wonder whether to have HSCT again, or re-start MS drugs. It isn't yet clear why there is such a wide variation in response. Much about the long-term impact of HSCT on auto-immune diseases, from MS to systemic sclerosis or Crohn's disease, is still unknown, and may remain unclear until the causes of these diseases are better understood. Soberingly, over the past year, some patients at international centres have died while having HSCT, making clear that it is not a treatment to be entered into lightly, however effective it can be in halting progression for some. Many patients have struggled after transplant with everything from migraines, headaches, swollen feet or agonising neuropathic pain in the hands and feet, to viruses or bacterial infections that affect the bladder. They can also develop other common infections that resurface in the body when the immune system is fragile, such as the Epstein-Barr virus, herpes or shingles. However, my latest MRI brain scan shows that so far, I have no new lesions on the brain. It's a sign, I hope, that I shall be among the lucky ones for whom the treatment does halt further MS progression for several years. I asked Professor Muraro of Imperial College London how long that benefit might last for those who respond to HSCT. “In the very long term we do not know,” he says.  “We know the durability of effects is still good at five years, but the longer term is a question that could be addressed.” After his last study, he concluded that “with this procedure, we've shown we can ‘freeze’ a patient's disease – and stop it from becoming worse, for up to five years. However, we must take into account that the treatment carries a small risk of death, and this is a disease that is not immediately life-threatening.” So how close are researchers to finding the causes of MS? “I don't think anyone knows how close we are. It is clear we are making stepwise progress. The critical - small or giant - leap may happen at any time,” says Professor Muraro. “Studying HSCT by comparing the immune system before and after treatment provides a great opportunity to find out what may have gone wrong that is corrected by HSCT in the patient where clinical MS is shut down.” I know that I can't, as yet, repair all the damage done to my brain and central nervous system by decades of MS. But I am an optimist, and shall remain so while my immune system finishes reconstituting itself fully by the end of this year, some two years after I started treatment. My goal is to stay healthy enough in the coming years to be there for my wonderful parents as they age, and for my brothers, sister, nieces, nephews, great-nieces and friends. I'd love to be able to continue both to work and enjoy life, rather than sleep-walking through the rest of it in a haze of crushing fatigue. Whatever happens in the future, I am grateful to have had these two years of hope. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0
"The US plans to impose tariffs on up to $60bn (Â£42.5bn) in Chinese imports and limit the country's investment in the US in retaliation for years of alleged intellectual property theft. The White House said the actions were necessary to counter unfair competition from China's state-led economy. It said years of talks had failed to produce change. China said it was ready to retaliate with ""necessary measures"". Beijing also said it would ""fight to the end"" in any trade war with the US. US stock markets closed lower on Thursday, as investors responded to the announcement. The Dow Jones ended the day at 23,957.89, a fall of 2.9% or 724.42 points - making it the fifth biggest points fall ever. The S&P 500 shed 2.5% or 68.24 points to 2,643.69, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.4% or 178.61 points to finish at 7,166.68. Signing a memo related to the sanctions, Mr Trump said the US and China were negotiating and he was looking for ""reciprocal"" trade terms for American companies. He said the tariffs might be imposed on up to $60bn in Chinese goods - boosting the number from the roughly $50bn figure White House officials cited on Thursday morning during a briefing. The tariffs follow an investigation of Chinese policies ordered by Mr Trump in August. The White House said the review found a range of ""unfair"" practices in China, including restrictions on foreign ownership that pressured foreign companies into transferring technology. The review also found evidence that China imposes unfair terms on US companies; steers investments in the US to strategic industries; and conducts and supports cyber attacks. The White House said it has a list of more than 1,000 products that could be targeted by tariffs of 25%. Businesses will have the opportunity to comment before the final list goes into effect. Trump: Political heir to Abe Lincoln? The problem facing Trump's China probe EU and six other countries exempted from US metals tariffs The US is also exploring ways to limit Chinese investment in the US and will seek to bring complaints about unfair licensing terms to the World Trade Organization, officials said. America's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said protecting US technology was critical to America's economic future. America's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said the US wanted to put ""maximum pressure on China and minimum pressure on US consumers"". On Thursday, China's commerce ministry said it was ready to retaliate against the new tariffs. ""China will not sit idly by and let its legitimate rights and interests be harmed, and will certainly take all necessary measures to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests,"" it said in a statement. The ministry also pointed to a ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that found that Washington had not fully complied with a 2014 ruling against its anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese products, including solar panels and wind towers. China's commerce ministry said the WTO ruling ""proves that the US side has violated WTO rules"" and ""repeatedly abused trade remedy measures"". ""[This] has seriously damaged the fair and just nature of the international trade environment, and weakened the stability of the multilateral trading system."" The WTO has also ruled against China's trade practices. In January, the organisation said China must lower its tariffs on broiler chickens imported from the US. If imposed as described, the tariffs could lead to higher costs for consumers, while retaliation would hit key sectors of the US economy including agriculture and aerospace, analysts say. China was the third largest market for US exports in 2016 and among the biggest buyers of American soybeans, corn, pork and aircraft. On Thursday, shares of plane-maker Boeing sank more than 5%. Representatives of states such as Kansas, which has a large farming base, have been among the most critical of the administration's approach. Several business groups said they agree that there is a problem, but are worried about the administration's strategy. ""American business wants to see solutions to these problems, not just sanctions such as unilateral tariffs that may do more harm than good,"" said John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council, which represents firms that do business in China. US officials acknowledged the possibility of retaliation but say China has more to lose from the relationship. The US imports billions more goods from China each year than it exports, creating a deficit of about $375bn last year that Mr Trump has railed against. The president said Thursday he has asked China to cut that deficit by $100bn ""immediately"". This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? Many analysts dismiss worries about the trade deficit, noting that the exchange benefits both sides. However, there is growing bipartisan concern in America about China's state-led economy and worry that China is seeking technology that could be deployed for military purposes. Congress is debating legislation that would boost the government's power to review foreign business deals, citing the threat posed by state-backed acquisition of US firms. Some politicians remain critical of the administration's approach, saying Mr Trump's bluster aggravates the situation and alienates allies who could help address the problem. ""I get a kind of stomp-your-feet approach makes some people feel good, but in the integrated economy we already have, it's more complex,"" Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday. Steel producers around the world are concerned about US tariffs on steel imports Mr Trump has embraced ""America First"" rhetoric - including criticism of China - that blames other countries for the loss of American jobs and plays well with parts of his base.

"The US plans to impose tariffs on up to $60bn (Â£42.5bn) in Chinese imports and limit the country's investment in the US in retaliation for years of alleged intellectual property theft.

"This video can not be played Fire in Glasgow city centre A fire chief has said saving one of Glasgow's most-loved buildings was a priority when tackling a major blaze in Sauchiehall Street. Fire crews say the blaze, in Victoria's nightclub in Sauchiehall Street, is now contained after a ""really complicated"" operation. The fire has been described as ""an inferno"" by the crews fighting it. One of their first priorities was stopping the fire spreading to the 114-year-old Pavilion Theatre. Assistant Chief Officer Lewis Ramsay said: ""It was a really complicated fire with an extensive fire spread, spreading across a number of older tenement-style buildings. An aerial view from the Police Scotland helicopter shows how close the fire was to the Pavilion ""I am delighted to say we have managed to contain it within the block that was affected and more importantly we have managed to protect and save some iconic premises round about, most notably the Pavilion Theatre. ""I can't tell you how relieved I am no-one was injured."" The alarm was raised at about 08:20 on Thursday morning and the first crews were praised for their quick response. Assistant Chief Officer Lewis Ramsay is relieved there were no casualties ACO Ramsay said: ""The first crews did a great job. They got into the premises as quickly as they could but it was an inferno. ""It was like a blowtorch, and they were beaten back by the heat and the flames and a really rapid spread."" He said the fire crews had to come out of the building quickly before undertaking ""some really aggressive firefighting"". ""I had concerns the fire would spread and that was high up in my priorities,"" ACO Ramsay. ""We took steps to ensure that didn't happen and we have now stopped the fire in the building of origin."" Flames were visible from neighbouring streets More than 20 fire appliances, including specialist high reach appliances and a heavy rescue vehicle were involved, with many of the firefighters wearing breathing apparatus. This was partly because of the presence of asbestos, as is common in many older buildings. Residents were evacuated from nearby buildings and police and fire services have warned those in the vicinity to keep windows closed while there is still smoke in the air. The Pavilion Theatre has cancelled its scheduled show on Thursday night. A spokesman for the Pavilion said the fire did not spread to the theatre but there may still be damage which staff have not yet been able to assess. ""We hope that the only damage we have will be smoke-related and to the front doors, which the fire service had to force entry into,"" he said. Earlier, general manager Iain Gordon said the smoke had gone right into the side of the building. ""The building has been there for a long time and is a major part of Glasgow,"" he said. Scottish Opera have cancelled this evening's performance of Ariadne auf Naxos at the Theatre Royal. The theatre sits directly downwind from the fire and has been affected by smoke. City centre streets were sealed off after the alarm was raised, with Hope Street closed to all traffic between Bath Street and Renfrew Street. Renfield Street was also closed between Renfrew Street and Bath Street. Police have confirmed there were no fatalities. An eyewitness who works nearby told the BBC: ""We were in the offices above Starbucks and we saw smoke starting to build. ""The smoke was coming into our building and it seemed to be a more serious situation, stinging our eyes and getting heavier and heavier. So we evacuated."" A local office worker told the BBC: ""We saw a small bit of smoke and it got worse with the flames shooting out the top of the building. It looked like the roof of the second floor of Victoria's nightclub."" Her colleague added: ""The full row of windows on the second floor was on fire and the smoke was pouring out the roof."" Smoke from the fire can be seen across the city Smoke filled much of Sauchiehall Street The incident was raised at First Minister's Questions, with Glasgow MSP Sandra White asking what assistance could be given to the emergency services, businesses and residents affected. Nicola Sturgeon said it was a ""deeply concerning"" incident. She added: ""The Scottish government's resilience unit will remain in contact with the fire services as this incident develops and I will be kept updated in the course of the day. ""But I am sure the whole chamber will want to convey our thoughts to everybody who is affected by what appears to be an extremely serious incident."" The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the whole building appeared to be affected, from the ground floor to the roof. They expect to have crews at the scene for several days.

"This video can not be played Zoe Billingham tells the Today programme police are struggling with demand Some victims of domestic violence and other serious crimes have to wait days to be seen by police officers because 999 calls are not getting a prompt response, a report has found. The Inspectorate of Constabulary said a quarter of forces in England and Wales were often ""overwhelmed"" by demand. The annual review found instances of police taking days to respond to calls that should be acted on within an hour. Police chiefs said increases in demand had put policing under ""real strain"". Thousands of crimes going unrecorded Police struggling with surge in calls Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services' (HMICFRS) annual assessment of police effectiveness said most police forces were doing a good job and keeping the public safe. However, the report said it was concerned that vulnerable victims were ""too often"" not getting a prompt emergency response. Thousands of 999 calls assessed as requiring action within 60 minutes were not dealt with for hours or, in some cases, for several days - mainly because officers were not available to respond. In Cambridgeshire, for example, inspectors found the average time it took for police to respond to a 999 call during September last year was 15 hours. Inspectors said they were concerned by the findings because it showed the system was ""under severe strain and in some forces the cracks are showing"". Zoe Billingham, the Inspector of Constabulary, told Radio 4's Today programme that some callers, such as domestic abuse victims, were being ""put at risk"". But she said the report needed to be put into context, highlighting last year's terror attacks and a significant increase in calls from victims of domestic abuse as factors in a ""massive increase in demand"" on forces. Out of 43 police forces, only Durham Constabulary was ranked as outstanding. It found that ""life and limb"" and ""crime in action"" cases were generally dealt with quickly. But the report criticised the standard of investigations into crimes such as robbery, burglary, car theft and assault. It said officers frequently failed to carry out house-to-house enquiries, gather CCTV evidence and use their body-worn cameras. The National Police Chiefs' Council said it was working with forces to boost their detective numbers and specialist capability to help them manage and reduce demand. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Read the opening paragraphs of the Inspectorate's report and you'd think all was well in policing. ""We congratulate police officers and staff on the way they have largely kept standards high,"" it says. Delve a little further, however, and it becomes clear that a dramatic surge in demand (crimes, calls and emergencies) and a long-term reduction in resources are leaving parts of the service severely stretched. This in turn is putting people's safety at risk, with delays responding to 999 calls the clearest manifestation of the problems. Nevertheless, some forces cope better with the pressures than others, suggesting that good leadership and effective ways of working are as important as funding. The most notable example is Durham Constabulary, which has been graded ""outstanding"" in each of the last three years - the only force to have achieved that ranking. Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said the report found the police provided a good service overall but that ""increases in demand are impacting on forces' ability to meet standards in some important areas"". She said: ""In the last year, policing has been under real strain with rising crime and demand that is more complex, an unprecedented terror threat, and officer numbers at 1985 levels."" Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the findings show ""a deeply serious strain"" on our emergency service. She said: ""For 999 emergencies to go without a response for hours or even days is shocking and deeply distressing for victims, and undermines public safety and the fight against crime.""

"Mr Dowd took over the president's legal team last summer US President Donald Trump's lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election has resigned, US media report. John Dowd, 77, is reported to have concluded that Mr Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice. Other reports say Mr Trump had lost confidence in Mr Dowd's ability to handle special counsel Robert Mueller. In an email to news outlets, Mr Dowd wrote: ""I love the president and wish him well."" The special counsel is investigating possible links between Mr Trump's associates and Russia, as well as whether the president has obstructed the inquiry. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words All you need to know about Trump Russia story Russia-Trump: Who's who? Last week, Mr Dowd called on the Department of Justice to immediately shut down Mr Mueller's investigation - initially saying that he was speaking for the president. But he later clarified that he was speaking for himself and not on Mr Trump's behalf. Mr Dowd took over the president's legal team last summer. Under his leadership, Mr Trump's team of lawyers advised the president to co-operate with the special counsel. Mr Trump has recently begun publicly criticising Mr Mueller by name,external, rather than just his inquiry. In response, several congressional Republicans warned Mr Trump not to consider firing Mr Mueller. Senator Lindsey Graham warned that ""that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency"". Mr Trump has also reportedly insisted he wants to be interviewed by the inquiry, a step Mr Dowd was said to oppose. Last week Mr Trump added combative former US attorney Joe diGenova, who has been a pundit on Fox News, to his legal team. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington DC Just 11 days after dismissing reports that he was shopping for new lawyers and tweeting that he was ""very happy"" with his personal legal team, Donald Trump has hired a new lawyer and parted ways with the head of his legal team. It could be an indication that the president's simmering dissatisfaction with the direction of his legal defence is coming to a head. Up until now, Mr Trump's top lawyers have been pledging full co-operation with Robert Mueller's investigation, assuring that a timely but thorough review of the evidence will end in complete exoneration. Now, however, the president could be opting for a more confrontational approach. His new hire, Joseph DiGenova, has suggested the president is the target of an FBI conspiracy. And last weekend, for the first time, Mr Trump took aim at Mr Mueller by name in a series of incendiary tweets. Mr Mueller is reportedly looking into Mr Trump's business dealings and foreign contacts with the Trump administration beyond just Russia - suggesting that his investigation is nowhere near drawing to a close. The president has been counselled to be patient. That patience could be wearing thin. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas?

"The man, originally from Africa, cannot be named for legal reasons A father has been found not guilty of organising for his nine-year-old daughter to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) to punish her. The 50-year-old man, of south London, had been accused of twice arranging for someone to cut the girl with a razor as she lay on a mat in the hallway. He was also acquitted of five other charges at the Old Bailey, including child cruelty and wounding with intent. The man, originally from West Africa, had denied all of the accusations. The case is only the second FGM prosecution brought to court in the UK, both of which led to acquittals. During the trial, jurors were told the child could not recall the identity of the person who allegedly subjected her to the ordeal twice between 2010 and 2013. The girl said she cried in pain and begged for it to stop but her father just encouraged the cutter, the court heard. The allegations came to light after the girl told a friend, whose mother contacted Childline. The man had been on trial at the Old Bailey since 12 March The prosecution told the jury the FGM did not happen for cultural or family reasons, but as a punishment. However, Kate Bex QC, defending the father, suggested FGM was ""predominantly perpetrated by female cutters on women"" for reasons including ""purification, honour and social acceptance"". Giving evidence, the defendant said the allegations were fabrications arising from the acrimonious breakdown of his marriage. ""I need to know who cut my daughter. It's not me,"" he told the jury. ""I don't know who cut my daughter. I didn't organise it. I was not part of it."" During his evidence, the defendant described allegations by his daughter that he hit her with a cane and threatened her with an iron as the ""height of fabrication"". He said his wife had repeatedly threatened to destroy him during their marriage and had turned his children against him. The children's former nanny told the court the defendant adored his children, and said she had never seen any ill-treatment. Jurors deliberated for more than six hours to find the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, not guilty of all seven charges against him. Leethen Bartholomew, head of the National FGM Centre, said: ""While we respect the decision of the jury it is important to remember that someone did carry out female genital mutilation on the victim almost a decade ago. ""The effects of FGM have a lifelong impact on survivors both physically and psychologically, so it is vital support is in place for her for as long as she needs it.""

"Police released CCTV showing two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU On 4 March, a former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned by a nerve agent, in an attack ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. An extraordinary series of accusations and denials from the highest levels of governments came in the months that followed, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. The attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, left them hospitalised for weeks. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in June in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury, after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday 4 March with his daughter Yulia Skripal flew into London's Heathrow Airport from Russia at about 14:40 GMT on Saturday, 3 March On Sunday, 4 March, at about 09:15 GMT, Mr Skripal's car was seen in Salisbury around London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road At 13:30 GMT his car was seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre Mr Skripal and his daughter arrived at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct at 13:40 GMT Police said the pair went to The Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at 14:20 GMT, where they stayed until 15:35 GMT At 16:15 GMT, emergency services received the first report of an incident Police found the pair on a bench outside Zizzi in an ""extremely serious condition"" Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill after attending the incident, was treated in hospital but discharged on 22 March Det Sgt Nick Bailey was seriously ill 48 people were assessed in hospital in relation to the incident Ms Skripal was released from hospital on 9 April and her father was discharged on 18 May. Both were taken to a secure location Police believe the Skripals were ""targeted specifically"" and are treating the case as attempted murder. Detectives believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok at the front door of their home. Traces of Novichok were alsofound at the Mill and Zizzi, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant at the same time weretold to wash their clothes and possessions. Officers later focused searches in and around Mr Skripal's home and a nearby children's play area at Montgomery Gardens was cordoned off by police. Police appealed for anyone who saw the pair in Mr Skripal's red BMW - licence plate number HD09 WAO - on the morning of the attack. Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident A vehicle that is believed to have been used by Mr Skripal's friend to pick up Yulia from the airport on 3 March was removed from Durrington, Wiltshire, by the Army on 19 March. Witness Jamie Paine said he saw a woman on a bench frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". A doctor, who was shopping with her husband in the city centre on Sunday, said Ms Skripal was ""slumped in her seat, completely unconscious"" and had lost control of her bodily functions. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" The investigation has so far involved 250 specialist counter-terrorism officers and about 180 military personnel, who were deployed to Salisbury to help remove vehicles and objects that may have been contaminated. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, stressed the risk of harm to the public was ""low"" but there was some concern that prolonged exposure could cause health problems. Personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire identified the nerve agent. Its head saidthe precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tested samples of the chemical. Russia accused Britain of blocking access to the OPCW inquiry, but its proposal for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals, who go by the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are suspects in the attempted murder. They are understood to have arrived at Gatwick Airport on Russian passports from Moscow on 2 March, and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. The following day they visited Salisbury for reconnaissance before contaminating Mr Skripal's front door with Novichok on 4 March, police say. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that same night. The men, whose movements were captured on various CCTV cameras, are thought to be aged about 40 and operating under aliases. The officers are thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, and the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, Theresa May has said. In an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, the men said they were tourists, in the UK to visit the ""wonderful town"" of Salisbury andsee its famous cathedral. Details have since emerged showing the man calling himself Alexander Petrov has made around 10 trips to Europe in the last two years. Documents first obtained by the investigative group Bellingcat, shared with the BBC, show that as well as visiting Paris, Geneva and Amsterdam, he appears to have visited the UK three times. He seems to have visited once in September 2016, again between 28 February and 5 March 2017 and finally in March this year- during the period Sergei Skripal was poisoned. On the final visit, the pair both travelled on genuine Russian passports. Recently published pages from Mr Petrov's passport dossiers contain unusual stamps and a blank page where there is normally biographical data - all evidence which may point to the men being undercover intelligence officers, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said. An investigation by Bellingcat has claimed thereal identity of the man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov is actually Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga- a highly decorated military officer. Bellingcat later said the suspect calling himselfAlexander Petrov is Alexander Mishkin, a doctorwho has worked for Russian intelligence since 2010. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians Since the attack, the Kremlin's media machine has responded with a combination of denials and sarcasm. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two suspects are civilians, not criminals and he hoped the men would tell their story soon. A day later an interview with the men was broadcast by Russia's state-run international broadcaster. The Russian foreign ministry had previously called Mrs May's allegations ""insane"", and said the names and photographs of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to Moscow"". At a UN Security Council meeting in September to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and its own citizens. Mission implausible: Russians mock improbable spy duo Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Previously, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or possibly the United States. Another theory - offered by Russia's EU ambassador, Vladimir Chizhov - suggested a UK research laboratory in Wiltshire could be the source. No. Prosecutors will not apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. Sue Hemming, of the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said there was enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"" and it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to charge them with the Salisbury attack. Police say officers continue to work with the CPS on the Amesbury incident. Could the suspects be returned to the UK? Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK. In recent years Mr Skripal is thought to have given lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. A friend from college, Vladimir Svyatski, described Mr Skripal as ""very active, with a positive attitude and creative"". Former colleague Oleg Ivanov told the BBC he was ""the life and soul of the party"". Hiscondition improved from critical to stableon 6 April, and Salisbury District Hospital said he was  responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". He was discharged on 18 May and moved to a secure location. Read more about the poisoned spy Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father His daughter, Yulia, regularly travelled to the UK from her Moscow home to visit her father, relatives told the BBC. ""She told me she liked everything [in the UK],"" childhood friend Irina Petrova said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, Ms Petrova said, and had been the ""perfect kid"", achieving excellent grades at school. Ms Skripal, who friends say worked for multinationals including Nike and PepsiCo, was ""always smiling, just like her mother"", Ms Petrova added. The 33-year-old was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April and taken to a secure location. It is not known what long-term effects she might suffer. This video can not be played CCTV shows Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died in 2012 after suffering from cancer. His elder brother and son have died in the past two years. Some of the deaths, the family believe, happened in suspicious circumstances. The grave of Liudmila Skripal, Sergei's wife, is in London Road Cemetery in Salisbury His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure. He is buried in Salisbury, close to his mother. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6 and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. On 5 April, an unverified recording purported to be between Yulia Skripal and her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, was broadcast on Russian TV. In the recording, Viktoria said she hoped to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be Yulia's tells her that no-one will give her one. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the recording. In the weeks after the poisoning, Theresa May pointed the finger at Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats and their families from the UK. She also said: Ministers and the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia Russian state assets would be frozen if there was evidence they would be used as a weapon against UK nationals and residents Checks on private flights, customs and freight would be increased All planned high-level contacts between the UK and Russia would be suspended The state invitation to Russian's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was retracted In solidarity, 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Germany and France, expelled 145 Russian officials - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow initially responded in kind, expelling 23 British diplomats, 60 US diplomats and several from other countries. It also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Russia then increased that number to 50, as its ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals. Together they have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were poisoned by Novichok Police are linking the attack on the Skripals to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowleywere exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser, labelled Nina Ricci Premier Jour. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing a small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. Scotland Yard said the bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok nerve agents The possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning ofAlexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. An investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that there have been at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia.

"Guess what? The prime minister's priority in Brussels tonight won't be Brexit. Yes, you read that right, top of Theresa May's list at the EU summit won't be giving the long-running talks a shove forward. The deal over the transition period - the buffer zone between Brexit and the ending of all ties - only needs to be rubber stamped on Friday. Of course, there are many more tangles to be sorted in the coming months. But tonight, the prime minister's main goal is to try to stiffen up the EU's response to the threat from Russia. May to warn EU leaders of Russian threat At home, Theresa May has taken a firm rhetorical tone, in response to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. What the government hopes for in the next 24 hours though, is that the other EU nations are willing to come alongside in the same way. The US, UK, France and Germany signed up to a very strong and uncompromising statement last week. But the prime minister will tonight try to create a similarly strong and united front among the other 27 EU member states. In extremely blunt language UK government officials have been briefing that Russia is a ""strategic enemy"" of Europe. Theresa May will tell her counterparts that it is a risk to all. Number 10 wants a robust statement from everyone in response, a show of unity, and by implication, other countries to look to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin. She might not get her way, however. EU countries may share the UK's security concerns about Russia. But member states like Greece and Hungary have their own reasons for concerns about taking a more hostile approach. Can the prime minister get consensus tonight, even persuade other countries to start taking similar action against Russia? It would never have been a straightforward quest to get more than two dozen countries into the same position. But with one foot out of the door, does the UK's foreign policy influence have the same stretch? This is one of the first tests of whether Brexit is harming Britain's powers of persuasion. Will the rest of the EU see Theresa May tonight as the close friend who can hold the room, or with a year until exit, has she just become the awkward neighbour?

"This video can not be played Fire in Glasgow city centre A fire chief has said saving one of Glasgow's most-loved buildings was a priority when tackling a major blaze in Sauchiehall Street. Fire crews say the blaze, in Victoria's nightclub in Sauchiehall Street, is now contained after a ""really complicated"" operation. The fire has been described as ""an inferno"" by the crews fighting it. One of their first priorities was stopping the fire spreading to the 114-year-old Pavilion Theatre. Assistant Chief Officer Lewis Ramsay said: ""It was a really complicated fire with an extensive fire spread, spreading across a number of older tenement-style buildings. An aerial view from the Police Scotland helicopter shows how close the fire was to the Pavilion ""I am delighted to say we have managed to contain it within the block that was affected and more importantly we have managed to protect and save some iconic premises round about, most notably the Pavilion Theatre. ""I can't tell you how relieved I am no-one was injured."" The alarm was raised at about 08:20 on Thursday morning and the first crews were praised for their quick response. Assistant Chief Officer Lewis Ramsay is relieved there were no casualties ACO Ramsay said: ""The first crews did a great job. They got into the premises as quickly as they could but it was an inferno. ""It was like a blowtorch, and they were beaten back by the heat and the flames and a really rapid spread."" He said the fire crews had to come out of the building quickly before undertaking ""some really aggressive firefighting"". ""I had concerns the fire would spread and that was high up in my priorities,"" ACO Ramsay. ""We took steps to ensure that didn't happen and we have now stopped the fire in the building of origin."" Flames were visible from neighbouring streets More than 20 fire appliances, including specialist high reach appliances and a heavy rescue vehicle were involved, with many of the firefighters wearing breathing apparatus. This was partly because of the presence of asbestos, as is common in many older buildings. Residents were evacuated from nearby buildings and police and fire services have warned those in the vicinity to keep windows closed while there is still smoke in the air. The Pavilion Theatre has cancelled its scheduled show on Thursday night. A spokesman for the Pavilion said the fire did not spread to the theatre but there may still be damage which staff have not yet been able to assess. ""We hope that the only damage we have will be smoke-related and to the front doors, which the fire service had to force entry into,"" he said. Earlier, general manager Iain Gordon said the smoke had gone right into the side of the building. ""The building has been there for a long time and is a major part of Glasgow,"" he said. Scottish Opera have cancelled this evening's performance of Ariadne auf Naxos at the Theatre Royal. The theatre sits directly downwind from the fire and has been affected by smoke. City centre streets were sealed off after the alarm was raised, with Hope Street closed to all traffic between Bath Street and Renfrew Street. Renfield Street was also closed between Renfrew Street and Bath Street. Police have confirmed there were no fatalities. An eyewitness who works nearby told the BBC: ""We were in the offices above Starbucks and we saw smoke starting to build. ""The smoke was coming into our building and it seemed to be a more serious situation, stinging our eyes and getting heavier and heavier. So we evacuated."" A local office worker told the BBC: ""We saw a small bit of smoke and it got worse with the flames shooting out the top of the building. It looked like the roof of the second floor of Victoria's nightclub."" Her colleague added: ""The full row of windows on the second floor was on fire and the smoke was pouring out the roof."" Smoke from the fire can be seen across the city Smoke filled much of Sauchiehall Street The incident was raised at First Minister's Questions, with Glasgow MSP Sandra White asking what assistance could be given to the emergency services, businesses and residents affected. Nicola Sturgeon said it was a ""deeply concerning"" incident. She added: ""The Scottish government's resilience unit will remain in contact with the fire services as this incident develops and I will be kept updated in the course of the day. ""But I am sure the whole chamber will want to convey our thoughts to everybody who is affected by what appears to be an extremely serious incident.""

"Mr Sarkozy clinched big trade deals for France with Libya's Gaddafi in 2007 when he was president Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy says allegations he received campaign funding from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi are making his life ""hell"". ""I am accused without any physical evidence,"" Mr Sarkozy told magistrates, Le Figaro newspaper reports. He has been placed under formal investigation for illicit election campaign financing in 2007, misappropriation of Libyan public funds and passive corruption. Mr Sarkozy, 63, denies any wrongdoing. The centre-right politician, who was in police custody being questioned for two days this week, says his Libyan accusers are seeking vengeance for his decision to deploy French warplanes during the uprising which overthrew Gaddafi in 2011. On Thursday,Le Figaro published what it said was the full court statement made by Mr Sarkozy,externalto French investigators (in French). In it, he says that he is aware the allegations against him are ""serious"", but that they amount to ""slander"" and have made his life ""hell"" since 11 March 2011, when the claims were first made by Gaddafi. Analysis by Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Mr Sarkozy has been questioned in police custody These accusations against Nicolas Sarkozy are in a different realm from all those other judicial problems that he has faced. The others are classic allegations of illegal party funding and abuse of influence. This one is about taking money from a foreign dictator. In each case, presumption of innocence has to prevail. Mr Sarkozy's key argument is that he is the victim of a left-wing vendetta: judges out to get him. On Libya, he points out that his accusers - henchmen of Gaddafi and sleazy middlemen - are not exactly paragons of veracity. But the truth is that this is a hammer blow to the former president. The judges believe there are ""serious and coherent"" indications that he did indeed take money from the Libyans, and on that basis they will now conduct their investigation. The implications are devastating. If the charges are true, then the whole story of Sarkozy's presidency will have to be re-assessed. More importantly,  what would it say about the French-led campaign to topple Gaddafi in 2011? A campaign in which the UK was persuaded by France to take part. Big questions - if the charges are true. But don't expect any quick answers. This case could drag on for years. In 2013, France opened an investigation into allegations that Mr Sarkozy's campaign had benefited from millions of euros of illicit funds from Gaddafi. He failed in his bid to return to power in 2012, however, losing to Socialist candidate FranÃ§ois Hollande. The claims came from a French-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine, and some former Gaddafi regime officials. France's Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woes In November 2016, Mr Takieddine told the French news website Mediapart,externalthat in 2006-2007 he had handed over three suitcases stuffed with 200- and 500-euro notes to Mr Sarkozy and Claude GuÃ©ant, who was his chief of staff. Mr Takieddine alleged the cash came from Gaddafi and totalled â¬5m (Â£4.4m; $6.2m). Mr Sarkozy was detained in 2014 in a separate investigation into alleged campaign funding abuses- the first time this has happened to a French ex-president. Mr GuÃ©ant, who was managing Mr Sarkozy's presidential campaign in 2007, told the franceinfo website on Tuesday that he had ""never seen a penny of Libyan financing"". He was placed under formal investigation earlier this year over a â¬500,000 bank transfer in 2008. He has denied wrongdoing and claimed the money came from the sale of two paintings. Criminal proceedings have been launched against Mr Sarkozy in one other case of alleged illicit campaign financing. It is alleged that he engaged in accounting fraud to overshoot the ceiling for campaign expenditure in 2012, which was â¬22.5m. Mr Sarkozy denies he was aware of the overspending. The affair is known as the Bygmalion scandal. In connection with his 2007 campaign, Mr Sarkozy was previously cleared over claims that he had used secret funding from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt and that he had tried to influence investigating magistrates.

"The buses waited in a buffer zone on the outskirts of Harasta until nightfall Syrian rebels and their families are being evacuated from a key town in the besieged Eastern Ghouta region as part of an agreement with the government. Buses carrying 1,480 people, including 600 Ahrar al-Sham rebels, drove out of Harasta as night fell, en route to the rebel-held northern province of Idlib. A military source said hundreds more were expected to follow on Friday. The evacuation deal is the first agreed since the offensive on the Eastern Ghouta was stepped up a month ago. A monitoring group says the air and ground assault has killed 1,500 civilians, injured 5,300 others, and forced 82,000 to flee in recent days. Government soldiers and allied militiamen have driven rebel forces out of about 70% of the region, cutting it into three pockets - one of them around Harasta. 'We will stay until the end': A doctor's battle in Eastern Ghouta Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? The opposition council said20,000 civilians were trapped there last week,external. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta: A mother's diary of life under siege It said air and artillery strikes by the government and its allies during their five-year siege of the Eastern Ghouta had deliberately targeted civilians in the town and destroyed its infrastructure, denying them access to food and medical treatment. Despite the onslaught, a Syrian military source told Reuters news agency that more than 18,000 people were expected to stay in Harasta under government rule. On Wednesday, state media reported that a total of 1,500 rebels and 6,000 civilians were expected to be evacuated under the deal with the government. The implementation of the deal began on Thursday morning with a prisoner swap. State TV reported that 18 people were freed, 13 of them held by the rebels. It interviewed a soldier among them, who thanked God and the army for his release. A man freed as part of a prisoner exchange with Ahrar al-Sham was interviewed by state TV Later, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent confirmed that its personnel had entered Harasta,externaland it posted photos of them helping civilians on to buses. There were conflicting reports about the evacuation's progress throughout the day. State media said rebels and civilians were leaving Harasta on buses every hour, but a BBC Arabic correspondent outside Harasta said the convoy only departed at around 19:00 (17:00 GMT). State TV broadcast pictures of the buses driving slowly down a road in darkness and announced that they were headed to Idlib. Ahrar al-Sham fighters in Harasta agreed to lay down their weapons in return for safe passage to Idlib, home to more than 2.6 million people. Thousands of civilians left other rebel-held towns in the Eastern Ghouta on Thursday Spokesman Monther Fares told the Associated Press that they had faced ""civilian pressure"",externalas a result of the intense air strikes, which had forced people to live underground for three months. The BBC's Martin Patience in Beirut says the deal may put pressure on the rebel groups that control other parts of the Eastern Ghouta to follow suit. Similar deals have been on the table with Jaysh al-Islam - which controls the northern pocket around Douma - and Faylaq al-Rahman - which controls the southern pocket around Arbin and Zamalka - but have yet to get anywhere. Both factions have vowed to keep fighting, even as they have been driven further and further back. Some 300,000 civilians are still believed to be living under siege in rebel-held areas Government air strikes on the southern pocket killed at least 19 people on Thursday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The UK-based monitoring group also said more than 4,000 civilians had fled Douma on foot and crossed into government territory through the al-Wafideen checkpoint over the past 24 hours. The civilians were leaving under an agreement between Jaysh al-Islam and Russia, it added. Rockets and mortars are also still being fired by rebels into government-held districts of Damascus. A police source told Sana that four civilians were killed and 14 others injured by shells that hit the capital on Thursday. Meanwhile, an air strike in Idlib itself reportedly killed 22 civilians. The Syrian Observatory said a market was hit in the town of Harem, which is controlled by the al-Qaeda-linked jihadist alliance, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.

"The man, originally from Africa, cannot be named for legal reasons A father has been found not guilty of organising for his nine-year-old daughter to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) to punish her. The 50-year-old man, of south London, had been accused of twice arranging for someone to cut the girl with a razor as she lay on a mat in the hallway. He was also acquitted of five other charges at the Old Bailey, including child cruelty and wounding with intent. The man, originally from West Africa, had denied all of the accusations. The case is only the second FGM prosecution brought to court in the UK, both of which led to acquittals. During the trial, jurors were told the child could not recall the identity of the person who allegedly subjected her to the ordeal twice between 2010 and 2013. The girl said she cried in pain and begged for it to stop but her father just encouraged the cutter, the court heard. The allegations came to light after the girl told a friend, whose mother contacted Childline. The man had been on trial at the Old Bailey since 12 March The prosecution told the jury the FGM did not happen for cultural or family reasons, but as a punishment. However, Kate Bex QC, defending the father, suggested FGM was ""predominantly perpetrated by female cutters on women"" for reasons including ""purification, honour and social acceptance"". Giving evidence, the defendant said the allegations were fabrications arising from the acrimonious breakdown of his marriage. ""I need to know who cut my daughter. It's not me,"" he told the jury. ""I don't know who cut my daughter. I didn't organise it. I was not part of it."" During his evidence, the defendant described allegations by his daughter that he hit her with a cane and threatened her with an iron as the ""height of fabrication"". He said his wife had repeatedly threatened to destroy him during their marriage and had turned his children against him. The children's former nanny told the court the defendant adored his children, and said she had never seen any ill-treatment. Jurors deliberated for more than six hours to find the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, not guilty of all seven charges against him. Leethen Bartholomew, head of the National FGM Centre, said: ""While we respect the decision of the jury it is important to remember that someone did carry out female genital mutilation on the victim almost a decade ago. ""The effects of FGM have a lifelong impact on survivors both physically and psychologically, so it is vital support is in place for her for as long as she needs it.""

"This video can not be played Zoe Billingham tells the Today programme police are struggling with demand Some victims of domestic violence and other serious crimes have to wait days to be seen by police officers because 999 calls are not getting a prompt response, a report has found. The Inspectorate of Constabulary said a quarter of forces in England and Wales were often ""overwhelmed"" by demand. The annual review found instances of police taking days to respond to calls that should be acted on within an hour. Police chiefs said increases in demand had put policing under ""real strain"". Thousands of crimes going unrecorded Police struggling with surge in calls Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services' (HMICFRS) annual assessment of police effectiveness said most police forces were doing a good job and keeping the public safe. However, the report said it was concerned that vulnerable victims were ""too often"" not getting a prompt emergency response. Thousands of 999 calls assessed as requiring action within 60 minutes were not dealt with for hours or, in some cases, for several days - mainly because officers were not available to respond. In Cambridgeshire, for example, inspectors found the average time it took for police to respond to a 999 call during September last year was 15 hours. Inspectors said they were concerned by the findings because it showed the system was ""under severe strain and in some forces the cracks are showing"". Zoe Billingham, the Inspector of Constabulary, told Radio 4's Today programme that some callers, such as domestic abuse victims, were being ""put at risk"". But she said the report needed to be put into context, highlighting last year's terror attacks and a significant increase in calls from victims of domestic abuse as factors in a ""massive increase in demand"" on forces. Out of 43 police forces, only Durham Constabulary was ranked as outstanding. It found that ""life and limb"" and ""crime in action"" cases were generally dealt with quickly. But the report criticised the standard of investigations into crimes such as robbery, burglary, car theft and assault. It said officers frequently failed to carry out house-to-house enquiries, gather CCTV evidence and use their body-worn cameras. The National Police Chiefs' Council said it was working with forces to boost their detective numbers and specialist capability to help them manage and reduce demand. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Read the opening paragraphs of the Inspectorate's report and you'd think all was well in policing. ""We congratulate police officers and staff on the way they have largely kept standards high,"" it says. Delve a little further, however, and it becomes clear that a dramatic surge in demand (crimes, calls and emergencies) and a long-term reduction in resources are leaving parts of the service severely stretched. This in turn is putting people's safety at risk, with delays responding to 999 calls the clearest manifestation of the problems. Nevertheless, some forces cope better with the pressures than others, suggesting that good leadership and effective ways of working are as important as funding. The most notable example is Durham Constabulary, which has been graded ""outstanding"" in each of the last three years - the only force to have achieved that ranking. Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said the report found the police provided a good service overall but that ""increases in demand are impacting on forces' ability to meet standards in some important areas"". She said: ""In the last year, policing has been under real strain with rising crime and demand that is more complex, an unprecedented terror threat, and officer numbers at 1985 levels."" Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the findings show ""a deeply serious strain"" on our emergency service. She said: ""For 999 emergencies to go without a response for hours or even days is shocking and deeply distressing for victims, and undermines public safety and the fight against crime.""

"The Bank of England has left the door open to raise UK interest rates in May after making no change this month, holding them steady at 0.5%. Two members of the Bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee -  Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders - backed an increase in rates to 0.75%. That was a departure from the unanimous vote at the last MPC meeting in February. In November, theBank raised rates to 0.5%, the first increase for a decade. The MPC said ""ongoing tightening"" was likely to be needed to return inflation back to the Bank's 2% target. On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics saidconsumer price inflation was 2.7% in February, down from 3% the previous month and the lowest figure since July 2017. Kallum Pickering at Berenberg said the March minutes ""give the nod to market pricing for a May hike"". What would a rate rise mean for you? US Federal Reserve raises rates Alan Clarke at Scotiabank said he was ""more and more confident"" that the MPC would raise rates in May. ""Thereafter we expect a rate hike in November, but it's not going to be plain sailing getting there,"" he added. However, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics argued that the committee members would wait until August to raise interest rates again. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) reaffirmed its call for a 0.25 percentage point rise every six months to bring the rate to 2% in 2020-21. The MPC is treading a familiar path. First: signal an interest rate rise is coming by toughening up the language. Bank governor Mark Carney said at the last MPC meeting in February that everyone should start preparing for more rapid interest rate increases than previously signalled. Second: notice that the two hawks on the MPC have split from the more doveish tendency. Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders voted for a rate rise today, just as they did last year for three successive MPC meetings before they were joined by other members of the committee. Rates were finally raised in November to 0.5%. Third: watch the market predict a ""nailed on"" rate rise for the next MPC meeting. Most now believe that a rate rise at the next meeting in May is all but certain. Just two points of caution. Inflation fell more rapidly than expected earlier this week, undermining claims that price rise pressure is a present risk. Growth is fairly weak, and too sharp a yank on the interest rate lever could apply dampeners just when they are not needed. Official figures released on Wednesday showed that average earnings rose by 2.6% in the three months to January - the fastest pace since 2015. On Wednesday, the government announced a 6.5% pay rise for many NHS workers over the next three years. Higher wages could make it harder for the Bank to see inflation fall closer to its 2% target. Muted economic growth is another complication. Last month, the Bank forecast growth of 1.8% for this year and 2019 - well below the UK's historic average. Thursday's MPC minutes said the UK economy would suffer a ""temporary"" hit from the recent cold weather, suggesting growth may slow to 0.3% in the first quarter, down from 0.4% for the last three months of 2017.

"This video can not be played The sugar in a muffin measured out in teaspoons Some blueberry muffins sold by cafes and supermarkets contain more than the recommended daily intake of sugar for adults, researchers have discovered. Ananalysis by Action on Sugar and the Obesity Health Alliance,externalin January found the cakes could contain up to eight teaspoons of sugar. The recommended daily limit for adults is seven - for children it is less. Health experts said the findings showed it was ""all too easy"" to consume ""huge"" amounts of sugar. 'Limit children's snacks to 100 calories' Kids devouring 'breakfast sugar' Action on Sugar and the Obesity Health Alliance, which looked at 28 muffins sold in food outlets in train stations and supermarkets, found 61% of them contained six teaspoons of sugar or more - the upper daily limit  for a child aged seven-to-10 years old. They also found muffins bought at train station food retailers had 19% more sugar per portion and were 32% bigger than those bought in supermarkets. There was also a big variation, with muffins from Marks and Spencer containing just three teaspoons. Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, said: ""We may think grabbing a blueberry muffin is a reasonably healthy option for a snack on the go compared to other cakes or a chocolate bar - yet the figures suggest otherwise. ""There is huge variation in both the size of muffins and the sugar content, and with limited nutrition labelling, it's all too easy to eat a huge amount of sugar in just one serving."" The research also found a lack of nutrition labelling on a number of muffins, both those sold in stations and in supermarkets. The two organisations are now calling for manufacturers to reduce sugar in line with the government's plans to cut it by 20% in common products by 2020. They are also calling for front-of-pack ""traffic-light"" nutrition labelling to be mandatory across all products, including the out-of-home sector. The British Retail Consortium, which represents food retailers, said its members were ""actively engaged"" in Public Health England's sugar reduction strategy and had removed thousands of tonnes of sugar in products such as bakery items. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, its deputy director of food policy, added: ""Food-to-go retailers that provide takeaway products proactively provide energy information for their products and have further nutrition information available whilst all major supermarkets have led the way in providing clear labelling using the UK recommended front-of-pack scheme."" Costa told the BBC that the figure of 40.3g of sugar for its blueberry muffins is not correct. It said this figure appeared on its nutritional information as a result of an internal error. The sugar content was previously 33.4g per muffin, Costa said.

"The buses waited in a buffer zone on the outskirts of Harasta until nightfall Syrian rebels and their families are being evacuated from a key town in the besieged Eastern Ghouta region as part of an agreement with the government. Buses carrying 1,480 people, including 600 Ahrar al-Sham rebels, drove out of Harasta as night fell, en route to the rebel-held northern province of Idlib. A military source said hundreds more were expected to follow on Friday. The evacuation deal is the first agreed since the offensive on the Eastern Ghouta was stepped up a month ago. A monitoring group says the air and ground assault has killed 1,500 civilians, injured 5,300 others, and forced 82,000 to flee in recent days. Government soldiers and allied militiamen have driven rebel forces out of about 70% of the region, cutting it into three pockets - one of them around Harasta. 'We will stay until the end': A doctor's battle in Eastern Ghouta Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? The opposition council said20,000 civilians were trapped there last week,external. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta: A mother's diary of life under siege It said air and artillery strikes by the government and its allies during their five-year siege of the Eastern Ghouta had deliberately targeted civilians in the town and destroyed its infrastructure, denying them access to food and medical treatment. Despite the onslaught, a Syrian military source told Reuters news agency that more than 18,000 people were expected to stay in Harasta under government rule. On Wednesday, state media reported that a total of 1,500 rebels and 6,000 civilians were expected to be evacuated under the deal with the government. The implementation of the deal began on Thursday morning with a prisoner swap. State TV reported that 18 people were freed, 13 of them held by the rebels. It interviewed a soldier among them, who thanked God and the army for his release. A man freed as part of a prisoner exchange with Ahrar al-Sham was interviewed by state TV Later, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent confirmed that its personnel had entered Harasta,externaland it posted photos of them helping civilians on to buses. There were conflicting reports about the evacuation's progress throughout the day. State media said rebels and civilians were leaving Harasta on buses every hour, but a BBC Arabic correspondent outside Harasta said the convoy only departed at around 19:00 (17:00 GMT). State TV broadcast pictures of the buses driving slowly down a road in darkness and announced that they were headed to Idlib. Ahrar al-Sham fighters in Harasta agreed to lay down their weapons in return for safe passage to Idlib, home to more than 2.6 million people. Thousands of civilians left other rebel-held towns in the Eastern Ghouta on Thursday Spokesman Monther Fares told the Associated Press that they had faced ""civilian pressure"",externalas a result of the intense air strikes, which had forced people to live underground for three months. The BBC's Martin Patience in Beirut says the deal may put pressure on the rebel groups that control other parts of the Eastern Ghouta to follow suit. Similar deals have been on the table with Jaysh al-Islam - which controls the northern pocket around Douma - and Faylaq al-Rahman - which controls the southern pocket around Arbin and Zamalka - but have yet to get anywhere. Both factions have vowed to keep fighting, even as they have been driven further and further back. Some 300,000 civilians are still believed to be living under siege in rebel-held areas Government air strikes on the southern pocket killed at least 19 people on Thursday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The UK-based monitoring group also said more than 4,000 civilians had fled Douma on foot and crossed into government territory through the al-Wafideen checkpoint over the past 24 hours. The civilians were leaving under an agreement between Jaysh al-Islam and Russia, it added. Rockets and mortars are also still being fired by rebels into government-held districts of Damascus. A police source told Sana that four civilians were killed and 14 others injured by shells that hit the capital on Thursday. Meanwhile, an air strike in Idlib itself reportedly killed 22 civilians. The Syrian Observatory said a market was hit in the town of Harem, which is controlled by the al-Qaeda-linked jihadist alliance, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.

"Rebel Wilson celebrates after her court victory last year Hollywood actress Rebel Wilson has accused Australian media firms of ""colluding"" with a magazine publisher in their bid to contest a record defamation payout. The Australian actress was awarded A$4.5m(Â£2.7m; $3.6m) last year, after arguing that articles by Bauer Media had portrayed her as a serial liar. Bauer is appealing against the sum, Australia's largest defamation payout. A bid by six Australian media giants to join the appeal was denied on Thursday. The Supreme Court of Victoria rejected the joint application by News Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Nine Network, Seven Network and Macquarie Group. They had argued that the size of the payout could prevent journalism that is in the public interest. Their application was thrown out after Justice Pamela Tate ruled that it was not sufficiently different to Bauer's appeal. Wilson, who has starred in films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, tweeted her approval after the decision. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The media outlets had asserted that the payout was inconsistent with previous rulings, and had effectively removed a ""damages cap"". ""This sets a precedent because if someone has an aggravated damages claim then they can be given unlimited damages - the sky is the limit,"" their lawyer, Justin Quill, said last month. The media organisations did not comment on the ruling on Thursday. In court last year, Wilson argued that eight articles published by Bauer magazines in 2015 had portrayed her as a serial liar, and that this resulted in her being sacked from two feature films. A jury sided with the actress, who has vowed to give the money to charity. Bauer said the articles were not defamatory. Its separate appeal is due to be heard in court next month.

"The UK government is failing rural communities and the natural environment, a report says. The Lords Select Committee document says there should be radical change in how the countryside is looked after. It recommends stripping the environment department Defra of its power to regulate on rural affairs, and reforming the Countryside Code. The Lords said Defra had focused too much on farming and agriculture, rather than other aspects of rural life. The report describes a ""consistent failure, over a number of years, to prioritise the 'rural affairs' element"" of the remit of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). All this, it says, has had a ""profound negative impact ... to the cost of us all"". The Select Committee on the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006 recommends that responsibility for rural affairs should transfer to the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government. According to the report, the body responsible for conserving the natural environment and promoting public access to the land, Natural England (NE), has been ""hollowed out"" and is now largely ineffective. The report's chairman, Lord Cameron of Dillington, said: ""The last major research was done by the Commission for Social Mobility last year, and it said some of the worst spots for deprivation and intergenerational poverty exists in rural England. ""That it's as bad as if not worse than our inner cities. We feel they have been neglected by government, that Defra is not doing a good job and that changes need to be made."" Severe budget cuts and the abolition of the Rural Communities Policy Unit means that NE no longer has the budget or power to effectively and independently regulate government policy. It also means that not enough is being done to promote responsible access to the countryside. Taking advice from the National Farmers Union, it says that the Countryside Code should be re-launched, so more people are aware of how to properly enjoy rural areas. The committee recommends that a subsidy system should give public money to landowners who maintain footpaths This code was designed as a standard set of guidelines for members of the public, to ensure respect and enjoyment in the countryside. A Defra spokesperson said: ""Whether it is developing a new agricultural system outside the EU or safeguarding our countryside, the needs of our rural communities sit at the heart of everything we do."" ""We are continuing to champion rural affairs across government - driving forward high-speed broadband in the most hard to reach areas, increasing housing availability and supporting the creation of more than 6,000 jobs through our dedicated fund for rural businesses."" Some people living in rural areas see a role for the community too. Justin Dyson, a resident of Croyde in Devon, volunteers at a local centre for the elderly. ""Life isn't great here for old people because public transport is terrible and they're alone a lot. But I think it's up to us to help - it's not all down to the government. We need to take responsibility,"" he told BBC News. The Lords committee also considered concerns over the long-term funding and sustainability of the National Trails Network. In a measure also proposed by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove, the committee recommends that a post-Brexit subsidy system should give public money to landowners who maintain footpaths and allow more access to their land. It also suggests that National Trails could be sponsored, calling for Defra to work with the ramblers and other organisations to develop proposals for long-term management and maintenance funding. Stephen Russell from the Ramblers Association said that Natural England had been being ""hamstrung"" by budget cuts: ""The path network, the trails themselves, they benefit so many people: people's health, their well-being, the local economies. It's too important to not address, because of all the different benefits that they bring."" ""We ran a survey in 2015 that pointed to a path network that was generally in good condition but with maybe 10% of the network classed as impassable, and an additional 40% that was in need of improvement."" The committee also highlights concerns over the provision of rural housing, saying Natural England has ""insufficient regard for landscapes"", when offering planning guidance. Lauren Kielb, a resident in Bradford on Avon told the BBC there wasn't enough attention paid to planning in rural towns: ""We've got lots of new housing coming here in Bradford on Avon and  I'm worried about what the impact will be,"" she said. ""The school here is getting larger so it will alienate the local villages from having access to that secondary school. They will become cut off from it."" In addition, the Lords committee report says the requirement for public authorities to ""have regard"" to biodiversity when exercising their functions is ineffective. The report recommends the NERC Act should be amended in order to add a reporting requirement to the duty and the government should also consider strengthening the wording.

"This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that the social network ""made mistakes"" that led to millions of Facebook users having their data exploited by a political consultancy. Cambridge Analytica is accused of improperly using the data on behalf of political clients. In a statement,,externalMr Zuckerberg said a ""breach of trust"" had occurred. In a later interview with CNN he said he was ""really sorry"", and pledged to take action against ""rogue apps"". He added that he was ""happy"" to testify before Congress ""if it's the right thing to do"". In his statement posted on Facebook, he promised to make it far harder for apps to ""harvest"" user information. ""We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. Facebook 'lost sight' of data says insider Facebook warned by advertisers 'enough is enough' Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The data firm's global reach How can you protect your Facebook data? To address current and past problems, Mr Zuckerberg said his company would: investigate all Facebook apps that had access to large amounts of information before the platform was changed ""to dramatically reduce data access"" in 2014 conduct a ""full forensic audit"" of any app with suspicious activity ban any developer that did not agree to a thorough audit ban developers that had misused personally identifiable information, and ""tell everyone affected by those apps"" In future, he said Facebook would: restrict developers' data access ""even further"" to prevent other kinds of abuse remove developers' access to a user's data if the user hadn't activated the developer's app for three months reduce the data that users give an app when they sign in to just name, profile photo, and email address require developers to obtain approval and also sign a contract in order to ask anyone for access to their posts or other private data Mr Zuckerberg added: ""While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past. ""We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward."" This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg in 2009: Facebook privacy is central Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, at Facebook's headquarters I read one thing loud and clear from Mr Zuckerberg's initial statement: Facebook is not prepared to take the blame for what has happened. Contrition has never been Mr Zuckerberg's strong point, and the statement, days in the making, was no different. No apology to users, investors or staff over how this incident was allowed to happen by the data policies in place at the time. No explanation as to why, after learning its data was being abused like this in 2014, it opted to give the companies a telling off instead of banning them outright. No reasoning as to why Facebook failed to inform users their data may have been affected. Technically, it still hasn't. Mr Zuckerberg's words were not an explanation, but a legal and political defence. This company knows it is heading into battle on multiple fronts. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends. This video can not be played Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie says the firm planted fake news Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica - which has no connection with Cambridge University - which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them.

""We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,"" he added. Dr Kogan has said he was told by Cambridge Analytica everything they had done was legal, and that he was being made a ""scapegoat"" by the firm and Facebook. Cambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing. Facebook says users' data was obtained legitimately but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when told to do so.

"This video can not be played Advertisers are ""nervous"" to be associated with Facebook Advertisers are telling Facebook that ""enough is enough"" following a data breach that left millions of users' information open to exploitation. ISBA, a trade body which represents major UK advertisers, will meet Facebook on Friday. If it fails to provide assurances about the security of users' data, advertisers may spend money elsewhere. M&C Saatchi boss David Kershaw said: ""I don't think they're bluffing. They are going to exert real pressure."" Consultancy Cambridge Analytica is accused of improperly using data from millions of Facebook users on behalf of political clients. On Wednesday evening, Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg broke cover for the first time since the scandal erupted to say that  a ""breach of trust"" had occurred and he was ""really sorry"". Mr Kershaw, the boss of one the world's most recognised advertising agencies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think that clients have come to a point, quite rightly, where enough is enough."" He said that advertisers putting pressure on Facebook would help bring about change at the social networking business. ""It is much more likely to be hard money from advertisers rather than consumers running hashtags on Twitter,"" he said, referring to the #DeleteFacebook and #BoycottFacebook hashtags that have become popular. Facebook's share price has fallen since the scandal broke, wiping more than $40bn off the value of the business. Facebook data- are we to blame? Zuckerberg spins himself some time Zuckerberg apologises for data breaches Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The Times reported,externalthat ISBA, whose members represent more than 3,000 brands, is demanding answers from Facebook about the breach. Phil Smith, director general of ISBA, said: ""What we are hearing at ISBA is that advertisers are concerned. When we meet with Facebook tomorrow we want to understand the scope of the inquiry Mark Zuckerberg announced yesterday. ""We want reassurances for our members that it will get to the bottom of the issues and any implications for the public and for advertisers."" Mr Kershaw said: ""From the consumers' point of view, you have these extraordinary services you get from your social media and there's an exchange, you're giving your data. ""I think that most consumers accept that deal unless it comes to where we are now where that data is abused.""

At the time, Unilever's chief marketing officer Keith Weed, said: ""We cannot have an environment where our consumers don't trust what they see online."" Commenting on where else companies could advertise, Mr Kershaw said there are alternatives: ""But we live in a very strong oligopoly with Facebook and Google."" He said M&C Saatchi is forecasting that digital media advertising will grow by 10% this year. However, he said: ""60p in every Â£1 of that increase will go to Facebook and Google and that's not healthy"". While there is much debate about media plurality with newspapers, ""in the digital space, plurality doesn't exist"".

"This video can not be played ""It's the good people that win"", says Tory MP Tobias Ellwood A year on from the Westminster attack, the MP who tried to save the life of a stabbed policeman has recalled the ""eerie"" silence after the officer died. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood, who gave mouth-to-mouth to PC Keith Palmer, said he returned home to see his son in tears asking why someone had been killed and why his Dad had helped. ""All I could offer was there are some bad people in the world, but... it's the good people that win,"" he said. Five people were killed on 22 March. Khalid Masood drove his carat people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing PC Palmer in the Palace of Westminster. Three people were killed outright on the bridge and one died later in hospital, butBBC's Newsnight has learned it could have been worse. Security sources told the programme that barriers outside Parliament saved 25-30 lives on the day of the attack, as they forced Masood's car off the pavement and onto the road. At the end of the barriers he cut back into the pavement and crashed in New Palace Yard before attacking PC Palmer. Newsnight's investigation found Masood was trying to move to Saudi Arabia in May 2016, nearly a year before the attack. However, his work visa was turned down. Meanwhile, police investigating Masood's background suspected him of radicalising another man and giving him religious instructions - but the man was arrested and released without charge. The police and MI5 concluded that Masood had acted alone. Victims of the Westminster terror attack How the Westminster attack unfolded 'I feel angry over my sister's death' Mr Ellwood, who is medically trained, said he was one of a number of people that stepped forward that day. ""Eventually the doctor said ok, I think we're going to have to call it. I remember looking at him and saying, 'you're going to have to tell me to stop, sir, because otherwise I'm going to keep doing this',"" said the MP, whose brother died in the 2002 Bali bombing terror attack. ""I do recall the silence. It was very eerie. Not a single movement of traffic, not a horn, not anybody speaking, no shouts, nothing whatsoever... I was then left there with a couple of the original policeman, who by this time were very, very upset because it was their colleague."" Events have been held to remember 14 people killed in four London terror attacks in 2017. MPs observed a minute's silence in the Commons to remember the dead, while Prime Minister Theresa May has laid a floral tribute outside parliament. Police officers are among those who have paid their respects outside parliament Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said those who had lost their lives defending democracy ""will not be forgotten"". Speaker John Bercow, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the head of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, were among those to attend a vigil of remembrance at Westminster Hall. ""A year ago today, on this estate and on Westminster bridge, we were visited by what I regard as evil,"" said Speaker's Chaplain Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who led the service. #LondonUnited is being projected in four places where terror attacks took place in the capital last year The message #LondonUnited will be projected in four locations ""as an act of solidarity"". London Bridge, Finsbury Park Mosque, Parsons Green underground station, and the Houses of Parliament will have the phrase projected on them overnight. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said Londoners stood together, ""united against terrorism and in hope for the future"". The mayor's office has also organised a digital book of condolence that the public can send messages of solidarity to. The book will become part of a 3D installation in City Hall that will be open to the public until 19 June - the anniversary of the Finsbury Park attack. 22 March:Five people are killed in Westminster after Khalid Masood mounted the pavementin his 4x4 on Westminster Bridge and ploughed into pedestrians.

(From left) PC Keith Palmer, Kurt Cochran and Aysha Frade all died in the Westminster attack PC Shaun Cartwright said: ""Keith loved being a police officer, he just wanted to help people and do his best. ""Most of all I will remember him as a family man who idolised his wife, daughter and his family; they're the important ones that I think about a year on from the Westminster attack."" Senior police officers are expected to attend a number of private memorial services later.

Andreea Cristea had been on holiday with her partner Andrei Burnaz Ms Toi told of how her family had been given hope when Ms Cristea was recovered from the river alive after surviving the 20ft (6m) fall from Westminster Bridge. ""We desperately hoped that she wouldn't die. She survived the brain operation and we thought - she has a chance. But she didn't."" Ms Cristea died two weeks later and was buried in her hometown of ConstanÈa, Romania. Mr Khan said: ""Londoners will never forget the horrific terror attacks on our city in 2017.

Andreea Cristea, 31, and boyfriend Andrei Burnaz, were driven at by Khalid Masood on London's Westminster Bridge. A year after the attack, Magda Toi said thinking of her sister's killer only made her angry. ""I'm not interested in it because my sister is dead and no-one and nothing will bring her back,"" she said. Ms Cristea, on her first trip to the UK, was hurled into the Thames as Masoodsped at a crowd on Westminster Bridge on 22 March 2017.

Ms Toi recalled the moment Mr Burnaz called to say there had been an attack. ""You don't expect to hear on the phone that something tragic has happened,"" she said. Describing her sister, who she helped to raise, Ms Toi said: ""She was very joyful, she was always smiling and loving life. She loved to travel. ""We desperately hoped that she wouldn't die. We thought - if she was found alive in the river - there would be a small chance of survival. Andreea posed for a photograph moments before the attack on Westminster Bridge ""She survived the brain operation and we thought - she has a chance. But she didn't."" Ms Toi added: ""It's very hard to express in words how you feel about someone you miss. ""We still don't believe that this is happening. It's like a nightmare that we wait to finish. ""We wait for her to come to the door or to ring on the phone and suddenly you wake up and know that this won't happen.""

"This video can not be played Zoe Billingham tells the Today programme police are struggling with demand Some victims of domestic violence and other serious crimes have to wait days to be seen by police officers because 999 calls are not getting a prompt response, a report has found. The Inspectorate of Constabulary said a quarter of forces in England and Wales were often ""overwhelmed"" by demand. The annual review found instances of police taking days to respond to calls that should be acted on within an hour. Police chiefs said increases in demand had put policing under ""real strain"". Thousands of crimes going unrecorded Police struggling with surge in calls Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services' (HMICFRS) annual assessment of police effectiveness said most police forces were doing a good job and keeping the public safe. However, the report said it was concerned that vulnerable victims were ""too often"" not getting a prompt emergency response. Thousands of 999 calls assessed as requiring action within 60 minutes were not dealt with for hours or, in some cases, for several days - mainly because officers were not available to respond. In Cambridgeshire, for example, inspectors found the average time it took for police to respond to a 999 call during September last year was 15 hours. Inspectors said they were concerned by the findings because it showed the system was ""under severe strain and in some forces the cracks are showing"". Zoe Billingham, the Inspector of Constabulary, told Radio 4's Today programme that some callers, such as domestic abuse victims, were being ""put at risk"". But she said the report needed to be put into context, highlighting last year's terror attacks and a significant increase in calls from victims of domestic abuse as factors in a ""massive increase in demand"" on forces. Out of 43 police forces, only Durham Constabulary was ranked as outstanding. It found that ""life and limb"" and ""crime in action"" cases were generally dealt with quickly. But the report criticised the standard of investigations into crimes such as robbery, burglary, car theft and assault. It said officers frequently failed to carry out house-to-house enquiries, gather CCTV evidence and use their body-worn cameras. The National Police Chiefs' Council said it was working with forces to boost their detective numbers and specialist capability to help them manage and reduce demand. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Read the opening paragraphs of the Inspectorate's report and you'd think all was well in policing. ""We congratulate police officers and staff on the way they have largely kept standards high,"" it says. Delve a little further, however, and it becomes clear that a dramatic surge in demand (crimes, calls and emergencies) and a long-term reduction in resources are leaving parts of the service severely stretched. This in turn is putting people's safety at risk, with delays responding to 999 calls the clearest manifestation of the problems. Nevertheless, some forces cope better with the pressures than others, suggesting that good leadership and effective ways of working are as important as funding. The most notable example is Durham Constabulary, which has been graded ""outstanding"" in each of the last three years - the only force to have achieved that ranking. Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said the report found the police provided a good service overall but that ""increases in demand are impacting on forces' ability to meet standards in some important areas"". She said: ""In the last year, policing has been under real strain with rising crime and demand that is more complex, an unprecedented terror threat, and officer numbers at 1985 levels."" Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the findings show ""a deeply serious strain"" on our emergency service. She said: ""For 999 emergencies to go without a response for hours or even days is shocking and deeply distressing for victims, and undermines public safety and the fight against crime.""

But the report criticised the standard of investigations into crimes such as robbery, burglary, car theft and assault. It said officers frequently failed to carry out house-to-house enquiries, gather CCTV evidence and use their body-worn cameras. The National Police Chiefs' Council said it was working with forces to boost their detective numbers and specialist capability to help them manage and reduce demand. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Read the opening paragraphs of the Inspectorate's report and you'd think all was well in policing. ""We congratulate police officers and staff on the way they have largely kept standards high,"" it says. Delve a little further, however, and it becomes clear that a dramatic surge in demand (crimes, calls and emergencies) and a long-term reduction in resources are leaving parts of the service severely stretched. This in turn is putting people's safety at risk, with delays responding to 999 calls the clearest manifestation of the problems. Nevertheless, some forces cope better with the pressures than others, suggesting that good leadership and effective ways of working are as important as funding. The most notable example is Durham Constabulary, which has been graded ""outstanding"" in each of the last three years - the only force to have achieved that ranking. Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said the report found the police provided a good service overall but that ""increases in demand are impacting on forces' ability to meet standards in some important areas"". She said: ""In the last year, policing has been under real strain with rising crime and demand that is more complex, an unprecedented terror threat, and officer numbers at 1985 levels."" Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the findings show ""a deeply serious strain"" on our emergency service. She said: ""For 999 emergencies to go without a response for hours or even days is shocking and deeply distressing for victims, and undermines public safety and the fight against crime.""

"Fresh analysis of a controversial study, which recommended exercise and psychological therapy for people with chronic fatigue syndrome, suggests their impact is more modest than first thought. The PACE trial found the treatments to be ""moderately effective"", leading to recovery in a fifth of patients. Butthis new analysis,externalfinds ""no long-term benefits at all"". The authors of the original trial in 2007 said they stood by their findings. That randomised trial was designed to examine the effectiveness of graded exercise therapy (GET) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME. Its findings were positive, but patient groups like the ME Association have always been critical of the way the trial was designed and the way the results were reported. There has also been controversy over the release of data from the trial, with some arguing it should be made available to all researchers for further analysis. The PACE trial,externalreported that 59% of patients who received CBT and 61% who had exercise therapy had improved overall, compared with 45% in a control group. When the results were re-examined, after data was obtained under a Freedom of Information request, researchers found that just 20% of CBT patients and 21% of GET patients improved, along with 10% of control patients. Figures for those who recovered were originally reported as 22% for patients in each of the CBT and GET groups, but this reduced to 8% in the latest re-analysis. Writing in the journal BMC Psychology, lead author Dr Carolyn Wilshire, from the University of Wellington in New Zealand, said the PACE trial moved the goalposts by changing the way treatment success was measured after the trial had begun. She added: ""Until there is positive evidence to suggest otherwise, the conclusion we must draw is that PACE's treatment effects are not sustained over the long term, not even on self-report measures. ""CBT and GET have no long-term benefits at all. Patients do just as well with good basic medical care."" The ME Association, which part-funded the new study, said it was no surprise that ""impressive claims for recovery following CBT and GET are not statistically reliable"". Dr Jon Stone, consultant neurologist at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said better treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome were needed, or more effective forms of rehabilitation. ""Until we have these, the question is whether it is better to offer a modestly effective treatment supported by data from many other trials, with a realistic discussion of its pros and cons, than none at all."" The three authors of the original PACE trial - Prof Michael Sharpe, from the University of Oxford, and Prof Trudie Chalder and Dr Kimberley Goldsmith, from King's College London, said the new analysis had used only part of the data from the trial. They also said many other trials and meta-analyses had replicated the findings of the PACE trial. ""In conclusion, we find little of substance in this critique and stand by our original reports.""

"This video can not be played The war of words between the UK and Russia The EU has recalled its ambassador to Moscow after leaders agreed it was ""highly likely"" Russia was responsible for a nerve agent attack in the UK. The European Council of EU leaders said there was ""no plausible alternative"". Moscow denies responsibility for the attack on an ex-spy and his daughter and said the EU was following an ""anti-Russian campaign launched by London"". Meanwhile, British diplomats expelled from Russia have left the embassy in Moscow ahead of Russia's deadline. Russia decided to expel the British diplomatsin a tit-for-tat response to the UK's expulsion of 23 of its diplomats. Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical but stable condition after the attack on 4 March. Laura Kuenssberg: Small words, big difference Russian spy: What we know so far EU summit moves from Russia to Brexit UK Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the EU support, saying that it was right ""we are standing together"" as the threat posed by Russia ""respects no borders and it is a threat to our values"". The EU said its ambassador to Russia, German Markus Ederer, was recalled ""for consultations"" and was expected in Brussels over the weekend. The European Council statement added: ""We stand in unqualified solidarity with the United Kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to our shared security."" A convoy of vehicles leaves the British Embassy in Moscow ahead of Russia's deadline for 23 UK diplomats to leave the country In response, Russia's foreign ministry said: ""We regret that the EU chose to follow another anti-Russian campaign launched by London and its allies from across the ocean, with the obvious purpose of creating yet another obstacle to normalising the situation on the European continent."" Mrs May briefed her counterparts on Thursday on the poisoning of the Skripals, who were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury. The prime minister set out the evidence the UK has against Russia - including the positive identification of the chemical used as a type of Novichok nerve agent and the knowledge that Russia has produced this agent within the last 10 years. Asked if she had relied on UK intelligence information to convince EU allies, Mrs May said the UK had been sharing ""throughout"" the investigation ""what intelligence we can share with our colleagues"". She said: ""What is crucial is that there was recognition around the table about the threat that Russia poses."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor It might not sound much, but a few small words can make a big difference. The president of the European Council has used the prime minister's language about the Salisbury attack, accepting and agreeing with the British verdict that there is no other ""plausible"" explanation for what happened. That is a small, but significantly different, tone to the statement a few days ago. EU ministers would only say: ""The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible."" The sentiment then was, OK, it might have been them - but you haven't convinced us yet. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Theresa May said, after talks, that it was ""right that we stand together"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he supported the EU's position ""very strongly"" and Ireland could expel Russian officials if they were shown to be acting as intelligence agents. He said there would be a security assessment in the coming days with a decision as early as next week. Lithuania, Czech Republic and Latvia have also said they were considering expelling suspected Russian spies from their countries. But Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said that while he wanted to ""express solidarity"" with Britain, ""we also need to be responsible on that issue"". The European Union has a network of 140 delegations around the world which represent the EU abroad. The EU nominates ambassadors to those embassies. They play a key role in presenting, explaining and implementing the EU's foreign policies to their host country.

"Rebel Wilson celebrates after her court victory last year Hollywood actress Rebel Wilson has accused Australian media firms of ""colluding"" with a magazine publisher in their bid to contest a record defamation payout. The Australian actress was awarded A$4.5m(Â£2.7m; $3.6m) last year, after arguing that articles by Bauer Media had portrayed her as a serial liar. Bauer is appealing against the sum, Australia's largest defamation payout. A bid by six Australian media giants to join the appeal was denied on Thursday. The Supreme Court of Victoria rejected the joint application by News Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Nine Network, Seven Network and Macquarie Group. They had argued that the size of the payout could prevent journalism that is in the public interest. Their application was thrown out after Justice Pamela Tate ruled that it was not sufficiently different to Bauer's appeal. Wilson, who has starred in films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, tweeted her approval after the decision. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The media outlets had asserted that the payout was inconsistent with previous rulings, and had effectively removed a ""damages cap"". ""This sets a precedent because if someone has an aggravated damages claim then they can be given unlimited damages - the sky is the limit,"" their lawyer, Justin Quill, said last month. The media organisations did not comment on the ruling on Thursday. In court last year, Wilson argued that eight articles published by Bauer magazines in 2015 had portrayed her as a serial liar, and that this resulted in her being sacked from two feature films. A jury sided with the actress, who has vowed to give the money to charity. Bauer said the articles were not defamatory. Its separate appeal is due to be heard in court next month.

"This video can not be played Advertisers are ""nervous"" to be associated with Facebook Advertisers are telling Facebook that ""enough is enough"" following a data breach that left millions of users' information open to exploitation. ISBA, a trade body which represents major UK advertisers, will meet Facebook on Friday. If it fails to provide assurances about the security of users' data, advertisers may spend money elsewhere. M&C Saatchi boss David Kershaw said: ""I don't think they're bluffing. They are going to exert real pressure."" Consultancy Cambridge Analytica is accused of improperly using data from millions of Facebook users on behalf of political clients. On Wednesday evening, Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg broke cover for the first time since the scandal erupted to say that  a ""breach of trust"" had occurred and he was ""really sorry"". Mr Kershaw, the boss of one the world's most recognised advertising agencies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think that clients have come to a point, quite rightly, where enough is enough."" He said that advertisers putting pressure on Facebook would help bring about change at the social networking business. ""It is much more likely to be hard money from advertisers rather than consumers running hashtags on Twitter,"" he said, referring to the #DeleteFacebook and #BoycottFacebook hashtags that have become popular. Facebook's share price has fallen since the scandal broke, wiping more than $40bn off the value of the business. Facebook data- are we to blame? Zuckerberg spins himself some time Zuckerberg apologises for data breaches Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The Times reported,externalthat ISBA, whose members represent more than 3,000 brands, is demanding answers from Facebook about the breach. Phil Smith, director general of ISBA, said: ""What we are hearing at ISBA is that advertisers are concerned. When we meet with Facebook tomorrow we want to understand the scope of the inquiry Mark Zuckerberg announced yesterday. ""We want reassurances for our members that it will get to the bottom of the issues and any implications for the public and for advertisers."" Mr Kershaw said: ""From the consumers' point of view, you have these extraordinary services you get from your social media and there's an exchange, you're giving your data. ""I think that most consumers accept that deal unless it comes to where we are now where that data is abused."" This video can not be played Facebook ""has taken too long to realise the scale of its responsibilities"" Baroness Martha Lane Fox tells World at One Last month, consumer goods group Unilever threatened to withdraw advertising from Facebook and internet giant Google if they did not do more  to police extremist and illegal content on their platforms. At the time, Unilever's chief marketing officer Keith Weed, said: ""We cannot have an environment where our consumers don't trust what they see online."" Commenting on where else companies could advertise, Mr Kershaw said there are alternatives: ""But we live in a very strong oligopoly with Facebook and Google."" He said M&C Saatchi is forecasting that digital media advertising will grow by 10% this year. However, he said: ""60p in every Â£1 of that increase will go to Facebook and Google and that's not healthy"". While there is much debate about media plurality with newspapers, ""in the digital space, plurality doesn't exist"". Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said he is ""really sorry"" about the data breach Meanwhile, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said that its application to search Cambridge Analytica's offices had been adjourned by a High Court judge until Friday. On Monday, UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said she was seeking a warrant to search the consultancy's premises after Channel 4 News secretly recorded the firm's executives boasting about their abilities to sway elections by using tactics such as sending Ukrainian sex workers to an opponent's residence.

"Pilot Andy Hill survived the Hawker Hunter jet crash The pilot of a vintage jet which crashed on to a dual carriageway during the Shoreham Airshow, killing 11 men, is to be charged with manslaughter. Andy Hill was performing aerobatics when the Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to the A27 in Sussex on 22 August 2015. Families of those who died have waited nearly three years to learn whether charges would be brought, an MP said. Mr Hill, from Hertfordshire, who is 54 on Thursday, is due to appear before Westminster magistrates on 19 April. He is to face 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence and one of endangering an aircraft, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Mr Hill, of Sandon, Buntingford, Hertfordshire, was questioned for the first time by police in December 2015 under caution, but was not arrested. He had voluntarily attended an interview. Families met with prosecutors at Sussex Police headquarters in Lewes earlier to discuss the decision. Simon Ringrose, from the CPS special crime division, said he had found there was sufficient evidence to charge Mr Hill after a ""careful review"" of the case. Phil and Sue Grimstone, whose son Matthew died when the aircraft hit his car, said they were pleased a decision had ""finally been made"" and they hoped the criminal process would ""progress swiftly"". Edwina Abrahams, whose wedding chauffeur husband Maurice, 76, was on his way to pick up a bride when he died, said she was ""very relieved"" by the announcement. Mrs Abrahams, 62, said: ""It's taken such a long time to get here. Now we think that this time next year it will all be behind us. It has taken too long."" The Hawker Hunter jet plummeted on to the A27 on 22 August 2015 The Grimstones' solicitor, Jim Morris, said the decision had taken over two and a half years, and an inquest expected to take eight weeks to complete could only commence after criminal proceedings had ended. Tim Loughton, MP for Worthing East and Shoreham, welcomed the announcement, but criticised the delay in bringing charges. ""Frankly those families have been in limbo for far too long and this should have happened a long time ago,"" he said. Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove where some of the victims' families reside, said: ""This is the right decision. My instinctive first reaction is that for the families this must be just an enormous moment for them to hear this and an unbelievable relief."" ""I want this to move forward with the pace it has been missing to date."" James Healy-Prat, head of aviation at Stewarts Law, who is representing some of the victims' families, said ""emotions had been mixed"". ""At least the families now know what the position is with the criminal proceedings,"" he said. ""But it means the inquest will likely be delayed by another year at least, which is difficult for them."" ""So it could be 2019, four years after the event, before they can get closure."" The Shoreham Airshow has not been staged again since the disaster Mr Hill, a trained Royal Air Force instructor and fast jet pilot, was seriously injured in the crash, which saw him thrown clear of the aircraft. He was initially placed in a medically induced coma and was interviewed by police following his discharge from hospital. Coroner Penelope Schofield had said she was working towards holding a full inquest in the autumn, but the proceedings will be postponed until criminal proceedings have concluded. Sussex Police confirmed that Mr Hill would be formally charged with the offences and said the force's specialist officers will continue to support the families and friends of those who died. The Shoreham Airshow has not been staged again since the disaster, out of respect for the families of the men who died.

"This video can not be played Boris agrees with MP's Putin and Hitler comparison Boris Johnson has likened the way President Putin is promoting the World Cup in Russia to Hitler's notorious use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The foreign secretary said Labour MP Ian Austin was ""completely right"" to say Russia's president wanted to ""gloss over [his] brutal corrupt regime"". Mr Johnson said that he would have an ""urgent conversation"" with Russia about the safety of fans at the tournament. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said he was ""poisoned with hatred"". A Downing Street spokesman confirmed Mr Johnson was speaking on behalf of the government and that they were working closely with police on plans for the World Cup. The foreign secretary said it was of ""crucial importance"" in light of 23 British diplomats being expelled from Russia - including the individual responsible for football fans. So far, there have been 24,000 applications from England fans to attend the World Cup this summer, compared with 94,000 at the same stage in the build-up to Rio in 2014. Mr Johnson said: ""The numbers are well down but that does not mean we are not deeply concerned about how they may be treated."" The Foreign Office will produce detailed travel advice closer to the time. Russian diplomats leave amid spy row Russian spy: What we know so far The exchange came as the Foreign Affairs Select Committee discussed the Salisbury spy attack. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital after being poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok. The former military intelligence officer and his daughter were found slumped on a bench and unconscious on 4 March. On Thursday, Theresa May will tell EU leaders that although the attempted assassination of the Skripals took place on UK soil, the Russian threat places all European nations at risk. She will tell the European Council summit in Brussels that ""the UK will stand shoulder to shoulder with the EU and with Nato to face these threats together,"" adding: ""United, we will succeed."" Officers still guard areas of Salisbury which the Skripals had visited Earlier, Boris Johnson described it as ""a sign"" from President Putin that ""no-one could escape the long arm of Russian revenge"". He said: ""[The attack] was a sign that President Putin or the Russian state wanted to give to potential defectors in their own agencies: 'This is what happens to you if you decide to support a country with a different set of values. You can expect to be assassinated'."" He also said Russia chose the UK for the attack as it had ""called out"" Russian abuses ""time and again"". Analysis: By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Just when you thought relations between Britain and Russia couldn't get any worse. Drawing any sort of parallel between Vladimir Putin and Adolf Hitler is incendiary. Much of Russia's self-image is based on accounts of the Soviet Union's triumph over fascism and Nazism in ""The Great Patriotic War""- never mind that there had been a Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact until Hitler smashed it by attacking Soviet positions in 1941. Boris Johnson has been trying to keep this major row an international one, pitting Britain and her Western allies against the Kremlin. That international support for Britain undoubtedly remains strong, but just now the diplomatic dispute feels a bit more like a bilateral one- between two states - once again. Adolf Hitler became German leader in 1933 and used Berlin's hosting of the Summer Games of 1936 as part of the propaganda for his Nazi regime. He had already brought in rules in the country to ensure all athletics organisations had an ""Aryan-only"" policy, which led to international backlash. But despite boycott threats, the games went ahead. Speaking at the Commons committee hearing, Mr Austin said: ""The idea of Putin handing over the World Cup to the captain of the winning team; the idea of Putin using this as a PR exercise to gloss over the brutal, corrupt regime for which he is responsible; it fills me with horror,"" he said. Mr Johnson could be heard saying, ""I'm afraid that's completely right, completely right"", during Mr Austin's comments. The foreign secretary then added: ""Your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow in the World Cup, in all the venues, yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right. ""I think it is an emetic prospect frankly to think of Putin glorying in this sporting event."" However, when Mr Austin said he believed the football team should pull out of the competition, Mr Johnson disagreed. ""On balance it would be wrong to punish them [the fans] or the team who have worked on this for an incredibly long time, given up their lives to it,"" he said. On the issue of fan safety, Mr Johnson said he needed to have an ""urgent conversation"" with the Russians around how they ""propose to fulfil their obligations under their FIFA contract to look after all fans"". The England team is in training for the competition this summer However, he admitted this conversation had yet to take place. Despite the attack, Mr Johnson said the overall aim of improving relations with Russia -as discussed during his trip to Moscow in December 2017- remained ""effectively unchanged"". He claimed the UK had ""many admirers among the Russian people"" and the UK wanted to ""hold out the hand of friendship"" to them, as the quarrel was with the Kremlin, not the citizens. Meanwhile, the British ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, has been accused of snubbing a meeting called by the foreign ministry in Moscow to discuss Skripal case. A tweet from the Foreign Office said a representative did attend, but added: ""We received no credible explanation why a nerve agent produced in Russia was used on UK soil. ""Instead, Russia continues to spread lies & disinformation."" Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, said: ""Perhaps this is another eloquent demonstration of the absurdity of the situation when questions are being asked but the unwillingness to hear some answers is being shown."" Officers are helping inspectors with their equipment in Salisbury Speaking at the meeting, Russian foreign ministry official Vladimir Yermakov suggested the UK might have been behind the attack. ""Either the British authorities are not able to provide protection from such a, let's say, terrorist attack on their soil, or they, whether directly or indirectly, I am not accusing anyone, have orchestrated an attack on a Russian citizen,"" he said. Mr Yermakov also disputed the UK's finding that Novichok was used in the attack. ""Any use of a military-grade poison would inevitably lead to numerous casualties immediately on the site of the poisoning,"" he said. ""The picture in Salisbury is completely different."" In Salisbury, inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have arrived to begin collecting evidence, including at The Mill pub, where the Skripals drank before falling ill.

"This video can not be played ""It's the good people that win"", says Tory MP Tobias Ellwood A year on from the Westminster attack, the MP who tried to save the life of a stabbed policeman has recalled the ""eerie"" silence after the officer died. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood, who gave mouth-to-mouth to PC Keith Palmer, said he returned home to see his son in tears asking why someone had been killed and why his Dad had helped. ""All I could offer was there are some bad people in the world, but... it's the good people that win,"" he said. Five people were killed on 22 March. Khalid Masood drove his carat people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing PC Palmer in the Palace of Westminster. Three people were killed outright on the bridge and one died later in hospital, butBBC's Newsnight has learned it could have been worse. Security sources told the programme that barriers outside Parliament saved 25-30 lives on the day of the attack, as they forced Masood's car off the pavement and onto the road. At the end of the barriers he cut back into the pavement and crashed in New Palace Yard before attacking PC Palmer. Newsnight's investigation found Masood was trying to move to Saudi Arabia in May 2016, nearly a year before the attack. However, his work visa was turned down. Meanwhile, police investigating Masood's background suspected him of radicalising another man and giving him religious instructions - but the man was arrested and released without charge. The police and MI5 concluded that Masood had acted alone. Victims of the Westminster terror attack How the Westminster attack unfolded 'I feel angry over my sister's death' Mr Ellwood, who is medically trained, said he was one of a number of people that stepped forward that day. ""Eventually the doctor said ok, I think we're going to have to call it. I remember looking at him and saying, 'you're going to have to tell me to stop, sir, because otherwise I'm going to keep doing this',"" said the MP, whose brother died in the 2002 Bali bombing terror attack. ""I do recall the silence. It was very eerie. Not a single movement of traffic, not a horn, not anybody speaking, no shouts, nothing whatsoever... I was then left there with a couple of the original policeman, who by this time were very, very upset because it was their colleague."" Events have been held to remember 14 people killed in four London terror attacks in 2017. MPs observed a minute's silence in the Commons to remember the dead, while Prime Minister Theresa May has laid a floral tribute outside parliament. Police officers are among those who have paid their respects outside parliament Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said those who had lost their lives defending democracy ""will not be forgotten"". Speaker John Bercow, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the head of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, were among those to attend a vigil of remembrance at Westminster Hall. ""A year ago today, on this estate and on Westminster bridge, we were visited by what I regard as evil,"" said Speaker's Chaplain Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who led the service. #LondonUnited is being projected in four places where terror attacks took place in the capital last year The message #LondonUnited will be projected in four locations ""as an act of solidarity"". London Bridge, Finsbury Park Mosque, Parsons Green underground station, and the Houses of Parliament will have the phrase projected on them overnight. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said Londoners stood together, ""united against terrorism and in hope for the future"". The mayor's office has also organised a digital book of condolence that the public can send messages of solidarity to. The book will become part of a 3D installation in City Hall that will be open to the public until 19 June - the anniversary of the Finsbury Park attack. 22 March:Five people are killed in Westminster after Khalid Masood mounted the pavementin his 4x4 on Westminster Bridge and ploughed into pedestrians.

A colleague of PC Keith Palmer, the officer who was stabbed when he confronted Masood at the Palace of Westminster, said the officer was a ""loyal friend"", ""always happy"" and dedicated to his job, his daughter and his wife. (From left) PC Keith Palmer, Kurt Cochran and Aysha Frade all died in the Westminster attack PC Shaun Cartwright said: ""Keith loved being a police officer, he just wanted to help people and do his best. ""Most of all I will remember him as a family man who idolised his wife, daughter and his family; they're the important ones that I think about a year on from the Westminster attack."" Senior police officers are expected to attend a number of private memorial services later. This video can not be played Tobias Ellwood MP told Newsnight: ""It was very eerie ... not a horn, no shouts... nothing whatsoever"" The sister of Andrea Cristea, a Romanian tourist who was hurled into the River Thames after Masood's car hit her,has spoken about how she refuses to dwell on her killer. Speaking to BBC London, Magda Toi said thinking of Masood only made her angry. ""My sister is dead and no-one and nothing will bring her back,"" she said. Andreea Cristea had been on holiday with her partner Andrei Burnaz Ms Toi told of how her family had been given hope when Ms Cristea was recovered from the river alive after surviving the 20ft (6m) fall from Westminster Bridge. ""We desperately hoped that she wouldn't die. She survived the brain operation and we thought - she has a chance. But she didn't."" Ms Cristea died two weeks later and was buried in her hometown of ConstanÈa, Romania. Mr Khan said: ""Londoners will never forget the horrific terror attacks on our city in 2017. ""We will never forget the bravery of our emergency services and first responders who ran towards danger while urging the rest of us to run to safety.""

"Mr Sarkozy clinched big trade deals for France with Libya's Gaddafi in 2007 when he was president Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been placed under formal investigation over allegations he received campaign funding from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He is being investigated for illicit campaign financing, misappropriation of Libyan public funds and passive corruption. He was released on Wednesday following two days of questioning over the financing of his 2007 campaign. Mr Sarkozy, 63, has denied wrongdoing. He says his Libyan accusers are seeking vengeance for his decision to deploy French warplanes during the uprising which overthrew Gaddafi in 2011. The centre-right politician failed in his bid to return to power in 2012, losing to socialist FranÃ§ois Hollande. In 2013, France opened an investigation into allegations that Mr Sarkozy's campaign had benefited from millions of euros of illicit funds from Gaddafi. One of Mr Sarkozy's former ministers and a close ally, Brice Hortefeux, was also reportedly questioned by police on Tuesday. Alexandre Djouhri is in London fighting extradition to France A former aide, Alexandre Djouhri, is fighting extradition to France after being arrested in London in January on suspicion of money laundering as part of the case. The Swiss businessman has denied the allegation,externaland says the investigation is politically motivated, according to Reuters news agency. The claims about funding from Gaddafi came from a French-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine, and some former Gaddafi regime officials. Mr Sarkozy was detained in 2014 in a separate investigation into alleged campaign funding abuses- the first time this has happened to a French ex-president. France's Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woes Sarkozy under investigation In November 2016, Ziad Takieddine told the French news website Mediapart,externalthat in 2006-2007 he had handed over three suitcases stuffed with 200- and 500-euro notes to Mr Sarkozy and Claude GuÃ©ant, who was his chief of staff. Mr Takieddine alleged that the cash came from Gaddafi and totalled â¬5m (Â£4.4m; $6.2m). Ziad Takieddine says he delivered Libyan cash to Mr Sarkozy's aides Mr GuÃ©ant, who was managing Mr Sarkozy's presidential campaign at the time, told the franceinfo website on Tuesday that he had ""never seen a penny of Libyan financing"". He was placed under formal investigation earlier this year over a â¬500,000 bank transfer in 2008. He has denied wrongdoing and claimed the money came from the sale of two paintings. French daily Le Monde reported that Bashir Saleh, who ran Libya's sovereign wealth fund at the time, had confirmed that Gaddafi had financed Mr Sarkozy. Possible charges in this case would be influence peddling, fraud, handling of stolen goods and money laundering. Criminal proceedings have been launched against Mr Sarkozy in one other case of alleged illicit campaign financing. It is alleged that he engaged in accounting fraud to overshoot the ceiling for campaign expenditure in 2012, which was â¬22.5m. Mr Sarkozy denies he was aware of the overspending. The affair is known as the Bygmalion scandal. In connection with his 2007 campaign, Mr Sarkozy was previously cleared over claims that he had used secret funding from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt and that he had tried to influence investigating magistrates.

"This video can not be played The fire is believed to have started on the 13th floor on Wednesday night An investigation into a major fire at a Dublin hotel, which destroyed at least five floors, will begin as soon as the high-rise building is declared safe. Up to 200 people were in the Metro Hotel in Ballymun when the fire started at about 20:00 local time on Wednesday. Dublin's chief fire officer said he was relieved that there were no injuries.

Patrick Fleming said he believed the fire began on the 13th floor and spread to the 10th. He added the intervening floors, 11 and 12, did not catch fire. However, he said the building has sustained considerable smoke and water damage and will not be habitable for some time. Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÃ, Mr Fleming said about 60 firefighters and several appliances were involved in the operation to extinguish the blaze. He said it was the biggest fire Dublin Fire Brigade had dealt with so far this year. The fire did not spread to the 11th or 12th floor but they were damaged by smoke and water Mr Fleming said there was no reason to believe the fire was suspicious at this stage, but the cause will be investigated by fire officers and GardaÃ­ (Irish police). The chief fire officer said he wanted to reassure people living in apartment blocks that this ""was not a Grenfell-type fire"" - referring to the tower block disaster in London last year. He said the evacuation was very successful, but urged apartment block residents to make themselves aware of evacuation procedures in their own buildings. About 150 guests staying in the hotel at the time have all been accounted for, as have those living in the building. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The hotel was used as temporary, homeless accommodation in recent years, but there are no families living there currently. The hotel guests have been relocated to the nearby Carlton Hotel. One witness told RTÃ News that the fire broke out in a room on the 13th floor, which was next door to his own room. He said he looked out on the balcony and saw flames in the room, and then went to tell reception and the fire service. Firefighters battle Dublin hotel blaze.

Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""It is with deep sadness that I heard of the death of Corporal Jonathan Bayliss whilst flying with the Red Arrows on Anglesey.

EU ministers would only say: ""The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible."" The sentiment then was, OK, it might have been them - but you haven't convinced us yet.

He said there would be a security assessment in the coming days with a decision as early as next week. Lithuania, Czech Republic and Latvia have also said they were considering expelling suspected Russian spies from their countries. But Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said that while he wanted to ""express solidarity"" with Britain, ""we also need to be responsible on that issue"". The European Union has a network of 140 delegations around the world which represent the EU abroad. The EU nominates ambassadors to those embassies.

"Pilot Andy Hill survived the Hawker Hunter jet crash The pilot of a vintage jet which crashed on to a dual carriageway during the Shoreham Airshow, killing 11 men, is to be charged with manslaughter. Andy Hill was performing aerobatics when the Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to the A27 in Sussex on 22 August 2015. Families of those who died have waited nearly three years to learn whether charges would be brought, an MP said. Mr Hill, from Hertfordshire, who is 54 on Thursday, is due to appear before Westminster magistrates on 19 April. He is to face 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence and one of endangering an aircraft, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Mr Hill, of Sandon, Buntingford, Hertfordshire, was questioned for the first time by police in December 2015 under caution, but was not arrested. He had voluntarily attended an interview. Families met with prosecutors at Sussex Police headquarters in Lewes earlier to discuss the decision. Simon Ringrose, from the CPS special crime division, said he had found there was sufficient evidence to charge Mr Hill after a ""careful review"" of the case. Phil and Sue Grimstone, whose son Matthew died when the aircraft hit his car, said they were pleased a decision had ""finally been made"" and they hoped the criminal process would ""progress swiftly"". Edwina Abrahams, whose wedding chauffeur husband Maurice, 76, was on his way to pick up a bride when he died, said she was ""very relieved"" by the announcement. Mrs Abrahams, 62, said: ""It's taken such a long time to get here. Now we think that this time next year it will all be behind us. It has taken too long."" The Hawker Hunter jet plummeted on to the A27 on 22 August 2015 The Grimstones' solicitor, Jim Morris, said the decision had taken over two and a half years, and an inquest expected to take eight weeks to complete could only commence after criminal proceedings had ended. Tim Loughton, MP for Worthing East and Shoreham, welcomed the announcement, but criticised the delay in bringing charges. ""Frankly those families have been in limbo for far too long and this should have happened a long time ago,"" he said. Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove where some of the victims' families reside, said: ""This is the right decision. My instinctive first reaction is that for the families this must be just an enormous moment for them to hear this and an unbelievable relief."" ""I want this to move forward with the pace it has been missing to date."" James Healy-Prat, head of aviation at Stewarts Law, who is representing some of the victims' families, said ""emotions had been mixed"". ""At least the families now know what the position is with the criminal proceedings,"" he said. ""But it means the inquest will likely be delayed by another year at least, which is difficult for them."" ""So it could be 2019, four years after the event, before they can get closure."" The Shoreham Airshow has not been staged again since the disaster Mr Hill, a trained Royal Air Force instructor and fast jet pilot, was seriously injured in the crash, which saw him thrown clear of the aircraft. He was initially placed in a medically induced coma and was interviewed by police following his discharge from hospital. Coroner Penelope Schofield had said she was working towards holding a full inquest in the autumn, but the proceedings will be postponed until criminal proceedings have concluded. Sussex Police confirmed that Mr Hill would be formally charged with the offences and said the force's specialist officers will continue to support the families and friends of those who died. The Shoreham Airshow has not been staged again since the disaster, out of respect for the families of the men who died.

"Lower back pain is the leading cause of disability globally but too often patients are let down by the treatment they are offered, say experts. They have written a series of papers inThe Lancet,externalasking the worldwide medical profession to stop offering ineffective and potentially harmful treatments. Strong drugs, injections and surgery are generally overkill, they say, with limited evidence that they help. Most back pain is best managed by keeping active, they advise. Recommendations that doctors follow in the UK are clear about what investigations and treatment patients should expect. Some patients will require a scan to rule out underlying causes, but in most cases they are deemed unnecessary because they are likely to be inconclusive. Signs that something more significant might be wrong include: difficulty passing urine feeling the needing to pass urine, when there is none there impaired sexual function such as loss of sensation during intercourse numbness or tingling in the genitals or buttocks loss of bladder or bowel control loss of power in legs Most adults will experience back pain at some point. Episodes are usually short-lasting with no consequence, but recurrence is common - about one in three people will have a recurrence within a year of recovering from a previous bout, according to the researchers. UK guidelines recommend a mix of physical exercise, advice and support to help patients cope with symptoms and enjoy a better quality of life. Health staff should not treat back pain or sciatica with equipment such as belts, corsets, foot supports or shoes with special soles. They should not offer acupuncture, traction (stretching the back using weights or machines), or electrotherapy (passing electric current or ultrasound waves through the body), says theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence,external. A doctor may offer an opioid pain medicine, such as codeine, if anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, have not helped or the doctor thinks they are not right for the patient. But opioid pain medicine can cause dependence. 1) Your back is stronger than you may think - the spine is strong and not easily damaged, so in most instances the pain will be down to a simple sprain or strain 2) You rarely need a scan 3) Avoid bed rest and get moving (but avoid aggravating activities) 4) Do not fear bending or lifting - do it in a way that is comfortable, using the hips and knees 5) Remember that exercise and activity can reduce and prevent back pain 6) Painkillers will not speed up your recovery 7) Surgery is rarely needed 8) Get good quality sleep if you can, because it will help you feel better overall 9) You can have back pain without any damage or injury 10) If it doesn't clear up, seek help but don't worry - book an appointment to see your doctor or physiotherapist if the pain persists Source:Chartered Society of Physiotherapy,external Prof Martin Underwood, from Warwick University, who is one of the 31 authors of The Lancet papers, said: ""Our current treatment approaches are failing to reduce the burden of back pain disability. ""We need to change the way we approach back pain treatment in the UK and help low- and middle-income countries to avoid developing high-cost services of limited effectiveness. ""Quite a lot of people get exposed to high-tech medical and invasive procedures. There's very little evidence base to support their use."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""One size does not fit all."" ""We know that being active and working is good for our patients' health, so GPs and our teams will readily advocate lifestyle changes to patients that can help ease their pain and keep them in work, but for some patients, particularly in more serious cases, there is a limit to how realistic a significant amount of exercise is. ""For these patients whilst not a cure, drug-therapy can provide a great deal of relief and should not be dismissed entirely - the most effective approach, as with any medication, is that it should be prescribed at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time."" She added: ""It is also the case that access to psychological treatments, such as talking therapies, which we know can be beneficial for patients suffering from lower back pain, is patchy across the country.""
