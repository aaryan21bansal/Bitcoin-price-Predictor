"An Australian woman has been killed by a US police officer responding to a 911 call in Minneapolis. The Minnesota Department of Public Safetysaid,externalpolice responded to ""a call of possible assault"" when ""at one point an officer fired their weapon, fatally striking a woman"". Officials said the officers' body cameras were not turned on at the time of the Saturday shooting. The victim has been identified by Australian officials as Justine Damond. According to Australian media, the 40-year old woman was living in Minneapolis with her fiancÃ©. The woman called 911 to report a noise near her home when the incident occurred, reports said. Ms Damond, dressed in her pyjamas, reportedly approached the driver's side door and was talking to the officer at the wheel after the police arrived, theMinneapolis Star-Tribune reported,external, citing three sources with knowledge of the incident. The officer in the passenger seat, identified by local media as Mohamed Noor, reportedly drew his gun and shot Ms Damond through the driver's window, the newspaper reported. Mr Noor's lawyer, Tom Plunkett, confirmed on Monday that his client had fired his weapon, killing Ms Damond. ""We take this seriously with great compassion for all persons who are being touched by this,""he said in a statement to CBS News,external. A man claiming to be Ms Damond's stepson alsosaid in a Facebook video,externalthat she was the one who alerted authorities. ""Basically, my mom's dead because a police officer shot her for reasons I don't know,"" said the man, named Zach. ""I demand answers. If anybody can help, just call the police and demand answers. I'm so done with all this violence,"" he said. ""America sucks. These cops need to get trained differently. I need to move out of here."" The Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said an investigation is under way and authorities are looking into whether there is any video of the incident. Minneapolis mayor Betsy Hodges said in a statement she was ""heartsick and deeply disturbed by what occurred last night"". Over the past few years the US has seen aseries of civilian killings at the hands of policethat have caused widespread concern and criticism. Ms Damond, nee Justine Ruszczyk, taught meditation classes at the Lake Harriet Spiritual Community. She used the surname of the man she was expected to marry in August, Don Damond,according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune,external. Ms Damond studied to be a veterinarian before she relocated to the US, where she is believed to have been for at least the last three years. According to her website, she also practised yoga and meditation for more than 17 years and is a ""qualified yoga instructor, a personal health and life coach and meditation teacher"". Mohamed Noor fired his gun and killed Ms Damond, his lawyer says Alison Monaghan, a friend who trained Ms Damon in alternative therapies,told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,externalshe was ""the most beautiful person"" who moved to the US to ""follow her heart"" for a ""new life"". About 200 neighbours, family members and residents shocked by the shooting gathered for a vigil on Sunday night where she died. Her death made front-page news in her native Australia. ""I mean ask anybody here, they're shocked,"" said Ms Damond's studentCorey Birkholz told CBS News,external. He described Ms Damond as ""a very conscious, loving person and you wouldn't associate that with a gunshot in an alley"". ""I don't know anything about the law or police work to that extent but to me, it seems really stupid. You have a body camera, aren't you supposed to use them?"" Mr Birkholz added. Mrs Hodges echoed his sentiments, saying at a news conference: ""I share the same questions other people have about why we don't have body camera footage of it, and I hope to get answers to that in the days coming."" The two officers involved in the shooting are on paid administrative leave. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs released a statement on Monday on behalf of Ms Damond's family. ""This is a very difficult time for our family,"" the statement said. ""We are trying to come to terms with this tragedy and to understand why this has happened.""

"The video of ""Khulood"" walking around Ushayqir was shared initially on Snapchat The authorities in Saudi Arabia are investigating a young woman who posted a video of herself wearing a miniskirt and crop-top in public. The woman, a model called ""Khulood"", shared the clip of her walking around a historic fort in Ushayqir. The footage sparked a heated debate on social media, with some calling for her arrest for breaking the conservative Muslim country's strict dress code. Other Saudis came to the woman's defence, praising her ""bravery"". Women in Saudi Arabia must wear loose-fitting, full-length robes known as ""abayas"" in public, as well as a headscarf if they are Muslim. They are also banned from driving and are separated from unrelated men. Saudi women criticise cleric's advice Saudi women's rights video goes viral Are Saudi women really that oppressed? In the video initially shared on Snapchat over the weekend, Khulood is seen walking along an empty street in a fort at Ushayqir Heritage Village, about 155km (96 miles) north of the capital Riyadh, in Najd province. Najd is one of the most conservative regions in Saudi Arabia. It was where the founder of Wahhabism - the austere form of Sunni Islam that is practised by the Saudi royal family and religious establishment - was born in the late 18th Century. The video was quickly picked up by Saudis on Twitter, where opinion was divided between those who believe Khulood should be punished and others who insisted she should be allowed to wear what she wanted.

"Newly built homes in Yorkshire will be demolished by the HS2 rail line, the government has confirmed. The line's eastern route, to Leeds from Birmingham, will run east of Sheffield, with some trains going into the city via a new spur and existing lines. But 16 of 216 homes on a housing estate in Mexborough will be demolished. The government's preferred routes, from Crewe to Manchester and from the West Midlands to Leeds, were laid outlast November,external. Earlier the government announced seven contracts worth nearly Â£7bn for some of the line's civil engineering work between Birmingham and London. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the full line would connect Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield and the East Midlands in a Y-shaped network, with all of them being linked to London by the line. ""Britain's new railway line will bring huge economic benefits across the country and help ensure this government delivers on its promise to spread wealth beyond London and the south-east,"" said the Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling following the announcement. He dismissed claims that the project will end up costing significantly more than the Â£55.7bn budgeted. Speaking in the House of Commons later he said: ""There have been some wild rumours, I have to say, in the last 24 hours about the cost of the project, based on, frankly, a finger in the air by people who are not involved in the project. ""I would simply remind the House that it is incredible, inconceivable and simply nonsense to suggest that HS2 will cost five times the amount HS1 cost per mile. ""This project has a cost attached of Â£55.7 billion for the whole thing, it is currently on time and on budget and I expect it to stay that way."" Residents of the Shimmer housing estate in Mexborough have disputed that only 16 houses will be demolished by the new line. Karen Schofield, whose family farm is also on the proposed route, told the BBC that the government's decision was ""unthinkable"". ""It's the worst possible news that anybody wants to hear, that you're going to lose your family home, which my husband and his brothers... they bought, what, 40-odd years ago,"" she said. ""There's horses, there's stables, we've provided employment for local communities... and it's ok HS2 saying they're going to compensate like-for-like... we've invited them to come down here and have a look what we've built up over the years."" Mexborough residents 'deserted' by demolition plan HS2 reveals winners of building contracts Where did Carillion's problems come from? The government admitted that its existing compensation scheme - which offers homeowners the ""un-blighted"" value of their home plus 10% - would not be enough to allow the Mexborough residents to buy an equivalent house locally. ""The particular circumstance of the Shimmer estate development could mean that the statutory compensation package may not allow homeowners to acquire a similar property in the local area,"" the Department for Transport said. The government will now devise a plan with local residents and political representatives, which would ""ensure Shimmer homeowners can secure a comparable local home,"" the DfT said. The government's final route means that no new stations will be built in South Yorkshire. Ed Miliband, the Labour MP for Doncaster North whose constituency covers the Shimmer estate, said putting the line through his constituency was ""wrong and perverse"". ""It flies in the face of evidence, logic, and above all, the economic needs of South Yorkshire,"" he said. ""The government and HS2 should be ashamed about the way they have gone about this decision. Their arguments do not add up, the consultation was a sham, and the residents have been ignored,"" he added. But Philippa Oldham, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, argued that the overall HS2 plan would be of benefit to the country. ""By freeing up the capacity on the East Coast Mainline, West Coast Mainline, through the HS2 route we'll be able to shift some of our freight network onto the rail network from the road network,"" she said. ""So that will ease congestion on our roads providing that we have an integrated transport strategy.""

"US officials say the Maryland complex doubles as a spying outpost Russia has been pressing demands that the US give it access to two diplomatic compounds seized in the US last year. After high-level talks between both sides, one Russian official involved said the row had ""almost"" been resolved. Russia has been angered by the move, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov calling it ""daylight robbery"". In December the US expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shut the compounds over suspicions of meddling in US elections. The talks saw US Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon host Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Washington on Monday. Mr Ryabkov sounded upbeat after three hours of talks with the American diplomat. This video can not be played What does body language tell us about the Trump-Putin G20 meeting? He was asked by reporters if the spat over the diplomatic compounds had been settled, and he replied: ""Almost, almost."" US officials did not comment and there has been no official press briefing. The meeting was meant to have been held in June in St Petersburg, but was cancelled after the US government added 38 individuals and organisations to its list of sanctions over Russian activity in Ukraine. Before the talks Russia made clear it was demanding restored access to the facilities. ""We consider it absolutely unacceptable to place conditions on the return of diplomatic property, we consider that it must be returned without any conditions and talking,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Mr Lavrov said that this was not the way decent and well-brought-up people behaved. ""How can you seize property which is protected by a bilateral, inter-governmental, ratified document and, to return it, act according to the principle 'what is mine is mine, and what is yours we'll share'?"" he said during a visit to Belarus. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Last week Russia said it was considering ""specific measures"" in retaliation, including the expulsion of 30 US diplomats and seizure of US state property. Ex-President Barack Obamaacted against Russiaafter US intelligence sources accused Russian state agents of hacking into Democratic Party computers to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The Long Island property is surrounded by trees The US seized a Russian diplomatic property on Maryland's Eastern Shore - a sprawling 45-acre (18.2-hectare) retreat. The facility, acquired during the Cold War, was used by Russian diplomats for recreation, such as tennis and swimming. But it also had sophisticated communications, and US officials said it doubled as a spying outpost The other diplomatic property is a New York mansion at Glen Cove, Long Island. It has 49 rooms and is similarly surrounded by woods. Like the Maryland mansion, its location is ideal for eavesdropping on US communications, US officials say Luxury Russia resorts in US crosshairs President Donald Trump's team is under investigation over alleged Russian collusion during last year's presidential campaign. The Kremlin has denied interfering in the election. The Obama sanctions came on top of existing Western sanctions imposed because of Russia's role in the Ukraine conflict. At the time Mr Putin refrained from tit-for-tat retaliation - unlike in previous diplomatic spats. Mr Trump had been elected to succeed President Obama just weeks before. Russia says President Trump presented ""no plan to resolve the crisis"" when the issue was raised at the G20 meeting in Hamburg on 7 July. Russia would retaliate if no compromise was reached at the meeting between Mr Ryabkov and Mr Shannon, the Russian newspaper Izvestia reported. Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington Russian officials welcomed the tone of the recent meeting between the two presidents. But the political climate in Washington has only grown more toxic, with the ongoing inquiries into allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election, and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. That makes any concessions to Moscow controversial. Russia's threat to expel some American diplomats if it does not get its property back would further complicate the strained relationship.

"French car hire firm Europcar has admitted that it may have to pay out as much as Â£30m to British motorists who were overcharged for car repairs. UK Trading Standards officers launched an investigation after its office in Leicester received complaints. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is also planning to launch an inquiry, according to theDaily Telegraph,external. The paper says more than half a million motorists could have been overcharged for repairs over many years. In a statement, Europcar said: ""Europcar's view is that the implications of the investigation will be somewhere in the region of Â£30m."" But the company - whose shares fell by 2.5% on Monday - said it had no further comment to make. The Telegraph said some people were charged four times what they should have been for routine repairs. The figures suggest an average compensation payment of up to Â£60 for every motorist who was overcharged. Europcar's website,externalsays it charges an administration fee of Â£40 for each repair, plus up to Â£25 for a replacement wiper blade, and up to Â£350 for replacing a tyre.

"Delta Air Lines has responded to the ""derogatory"" tirade that conservative author Ann Coulter directed at them throughout the weekend. The right-wing pundit's ire began after she was moved from her pre-booked seat on a flight from New York to Florida. After landing on Saturday she began to rant to her 1.6m Twitter followers, eventually comparing Delta to fascists. ""Delta expects mutual civility throughout the entire travel experience,"" the airline hit back. ""We are sorry that the customer did not receive the seat she reserved and paid for,"" Delta said in a statement posted to its website. ""More importantly, we are disappointed that the customer has chosen to publicly attack our employees and other customers by posting derogatory and slanderous comments and photos in social media."" Students sue Berkeley amid Coulter row ""Her actions are unnecessary and unacceptable"", continued the statement which was posted on Sunday - more than 24 hours after Ms Coulter's onslaught began. Ms Coulter's more than 30 tweets include insults to the passengers, flight crew, Wifi, and corporate employees. ""So glad I took time investigate the aircraft & PRE-BOOK a specific seat on @Delta, so some woman could waltz at the last min & take my seat,"" she wrote, returning to Twitter the next morning to mockingly say the company's motto is ""How can we make your flight more uncomfortable?"". The pundit also posted photos of the flight attendant and the woman seated in her original seat, whom she referred to as ""dachshund-legged"". Delta said that the incident happened during boarding, when staff ""inadvertently"" moved the author - whose works include In Trump We Trust and Adios America! - to a window seat from an aisle. The company statement added that they tried to contact Ms Coulter in order to apologise and refund her the $30 (Â£23) cost that she paid to pre-book the seat, but did not hear back from her until Sunday night. They add that after some initial confusion sparked by passengers asking to change seats, Ms Coulter was eventually able to take her place at the seat listed on her ticket. But Ms Coulter insisted on Monday that the money was never the issue, saying ""30!. It cost me $10,000 of my time to pre-select the seat I wanted, investigate type of plane & go back periodically to review seat options"".

"""A bluish foreign body"" turned out to be a ""hard mass"" of 17 lenses stuck together with mucus Surgeons have removed 27 contact lenses from the eye of a 67-year-old woman who had come to Solihull Hospital for routine cataract surgery. ""A bluish foreign body"" turned out to be a ""hard mass"" of 17 lenses stuck together with mucus, and 10 more were then found under further examination. A report in the BMJ,externalsaid she had worn disposable lenses for 35 years, and had not complained of any irritation. But after they were removed, she said her eyes felt a lot more comfortable. Specialist trainee in ophthalmology Rupal Morjaria toldOptometry Today,external: ""None of us have ever seen this before. ""It was such a large mass. All the 17 contact lenses were stuck together. ""We were really surprised that the patient didn't notice it because it would cause quite a lot of irritation while it was sitting there. ""She was quite shocked. She thought her previous discomfort was just part of old age and dry eye."" The case report said the patient had poorer vision in her right eye and deep-set eyes, which may have been a factor in the lenses becoming lost. Association of Optometrists spokeswoman Ceri Smith-Jaynes said losing contact lenses in the eye was a common problem but they usually worked their way out.

"This video can not be played Justine Greening said every school in England would benefit Schools in England are being promised an extra Â£1.3bn over two years, as the government responded to pressure from campaigns over funding shortages. But the cash for schools will be taken from elsewhere in the education budget, such as spending on free schools. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says it represents a real-terms freeze on school budgets for the next two years. Education Secretary Justine Greening told MPs she recognised there was public concern over school funding. Ms Greening told the House of Commons this ""significant investment"" would help to ""raise standards, promote social mobility and to give every child the best possible education"". Not new money from the Treasury, but money from savings within education budget Â£280m cut from the free schools budget and Â£315m from ""healthy pupils"" projects The DFE is promising Â£416m extra for schools from savings in 2018-19 and a further Â£884m in 2019-20 A new minimum per pupil funding limit will be set in secondary schools at Â£4,800 The Institute for Fiscal studies says the extra money is more generous than promised in the Conservative manifesto - and will freeze average school budgets at current levels over the next two years But in the years between 2015 and 2020, the IFS says school budgets will have declined in real terms by 4.6% But Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: ""This is all being funded without a penny of new money from the Treasury. ""They are not committing any new money and have not been clear about exactly what programmes they will be cutting to plug the funding back hole."" This video can not be played Angela Rayner: ""They've taken with one hand and put it in with the other"" But Jules White, a West Sussex head teacher who co-ordinated a campaign over funding shortages, said: ""The government finally appears to be listening."" But he cautioned that any increase would need to keep up with ""rising pupil numbers and inflationary costs"". Heads push MPs for answers on school funding Big cities hit in funding shake-up Is school funding the next crisis? School funding cuts up to 2020 warning Schools consider cutting school week Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said this was a ""step in the right direction and an acknowledgment of the huge level of concern around the country on this issue"". But he said schools would still have to see the implications of the money being ""saved from elsewhere in the education budget"". Chris Keates leader of the NASUWT teachers' union called Ms Greening's statement ""a recycled announcement of recycled money"". Jo Yurky, who headed a parents' campaign over funding, said this was ""positive news"" and an ""amazing turn-around"" in attitude from ministers, but pressure needed to be kept up on protecting funding. A joint statement from the NUT and ATL teachers' unions accused the government of ""smoke and mirrors"". ""Whilst any extra money is welcome this isn't enough to stop the huge cuts that schools are making,"" said the teachers' unions. School funding became a major issue during the general election, with school leaders and teachers' unions warning that budget shortages would mean cuts to staffing and subjects. A protest over school funding cuts was held in London at the weekend They pointed to evidence from the National Audit Office and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which warned of Â£3bn funding gap and schools facing an 8% real-terms budget cut. During the election, the Conservatives had promised an extra Â£1bn per year, which on top of planned increases, would have meant the core schools budget rising by about Â£4bn in 2021-22. Most of this extra funding was going to come from scrapping free meals for all infants, a policy which was subsequently ditched. Under the plans announced by Ms Greening on Monday, the overall core schools budget will rise by Â£2.6bn between 2017-18 and 2019-20. All schools will receive at least an increase of 0.5% in cash terms. The Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: ""This is a desperate attempt to pull the wool over people's eyes. ""Schools are still facing cuts to their budgets once inflation and increasing class sizes are taken into account."" As well as concerns about the overall amount of money available, there has been controversy over how it is divided between individual schools. A newNational Funding Formula was announced by education secretary Justine Greening before Christmas. Ms Greening said the new formula would go ahead and would address unfair and inconsistent levels of funding. Under the new arrangements, from 2018-19, the minimum funding per secondary pupil would be set at Â£4,800 per year. For many years there have been complaints that schools in different parts of the country were receiving different levels of per pupil funding. Details of an updated version of the formula, with budgets for individual schools, are being promised for the autumn.

"This video can not be played Prince George required some gentle encouragement to leave the plane The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their two children are in Warsaw at the start of their visit to Poland and Germany. Their five-day tour of the two European countries is at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Kensington Palace said Prince George, three, and Princess Charlotte, two, would be seen ""on at least a couple of occasions over the course of the week"". They joined their parents in Canada last year for an official trip. ""The duke and duchess are very much looking forward to this tour and are delighted with the exciting and varied programme that has been put together for it,"" a Kensington Palace spokesman said. Charlotte and George looked out of the window after landing in Warsaw Princess Charlotte was helped off the plane by her mother They were greeted at Warsaw Chopin Airport by the UK's ambassador to Poland, Jonathan Knott, and his wife, alongside Poland's ambassador to Britain, Arkady Rzegocki. Prince George and Princess Charlotte were last seen in public on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for a flypast following the Trooping the Colour ceremony for the Queen's birthday last month. The royals will travel to Germany on the second leg of their trip By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent For Prince George and Princess Charlotte such trips are a novelty but, as the future of the British monarchy, they'll one day become a way of life. For their parents, the visit to Poland and Germany will inevitably be viewed in the context of Brexit. It won't have any impact on the negotiations. It will, the Foreign Office hopes, remind people of the strength of the ties that will endure after the UK has left the EU. It's this mission the royals have pursued in recent months in various European cities. Read more from Peter The royal couple and their children were welcomed in Warsaw at a meeting with President Andrzej Duda. Prince William and the duchess joined the president and the first lady to greet well wishers around the presidential palace. Student Magda Mordaka, 21, said: ""We were telling [the duchess] that she is beautiful and perfect, but she said it's not true - it's just the make-up."" The Polish ambassador to the UK presented the royal couple withthree books to give to George and Charlotte.,externalThey were Mr Miniscule and the Whale, Bees: A Honeyed History, and Maps. Catherine and Poland's first lady received flowers while meeting children Prince William and Catherine visited the Warsaw Rising Museum, dedicated to the 1944 Polish uprising to liberate Warsaw from German occupation during World War Two. Some 200,000 Polish people died during 63 days of fighting. Prince William and Catherine paid their respects to the fallen soldiers of the uprising when they visited a wall of remembrance. The names of 34 British servicemen, who died trying to give supplies to the Polish soldiers, were also listed on the wall. The duke and President Andrzej Duda lit a candle to honour the fallen The royals felt a pulsating wall that symbolised the Nazis not being able to stop Warsaw's heartbeat Later, William spoke at an evening garden party to celebrate the Queen's birthday, telling guests in Polish: ""Good evening, we hope you have a nice party."" He also also hailed Poland's ""courage, fortitude and bravery"" in surviving centuries of assaults, particularly its ""incredible bravery"" during the Nazi occupation. He read a message from the Queen detailing 1,000 years of ties between the UK and Poland. Catherine wore a sleeveless white dress by Polish designer Gosia Baczynska for the occasion. Baczynska's designs, worn here by Catherine, featured in Paris fashion week In Germany later this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold a private meeting with the royal couple in Berlin before they visit the Brandenburg Gate, a symbol of German unification. The duke and duchess will also visit Berlin's Holocaust museum and memorial. A boat race is planned in the Germany city of Heidelberg, which is twinned with Cambridge.

"The giant iceberg known as A-68 that was produced in the Antarctic last week continues to drift seaward. All the latest satellite images indicate the gap between the 6,000-sq-km block and the floating Larsen C Ice Shelf from which it calved is widening. The particular image on this page was acquired by the Deimos-1 satellite. It is not easy getting pictures of the Antarctic at this time of year because of the long winter nights and because of cloud cover. Those spacecraft that have so far spied the berg have been relying on radar or on infrared sensors to pierce these difficulties. Giant iceberg splits from Antarctic Iceberg 'doodles' trace climate history Antarctica's troublesome 'hairdryer winds' The graveyard of giant icebergs The monster berg - which is a quarter the size of Wales, and one of the biggest ever recorded - is so far behaving as expected. Theory suggests it should move, in the first instance, down the slope in the ocean surface that has been created by winds in the Weddell Sea pushing water up against the coast. But the leftward deflecting effect of the Coriolis force, produced by the Earth's rotation, should keep the berg relatively close to the continent's edge. Interestingly in the Deimos image, acquired on Friday, it appears as though a large segment of ""fast ice"" that was attached to the berg has broken free. This fast ice is considerably thinner than the main block - a few metres thick versus the 200-plus-metres of the berg itself. In this Sunday thermal image from Nasa's Aqua satellite, the strong white lines are the signal of water which is warm relative to the surrounding ice and air. It also suggests a large section of fast ice has detached from the berg Thomas Rackow and colleagues from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, are following the block with keen interest. Theyrecently published research,externalin which they modelled the drift of icebergs through Antarctic waters - taking into account the different influences that act on small and large objects. There are essentially four ""highways"" that bergs travel, depending on their point of origin. A-68 should follow the highway up the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, leading from the Weddell Sea towards the Atlantic. ""It will most likely follow a northeasterly course, heading roughly for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands,"" Dr Rackow told BBC News. ""It will be very interesting to see whether the iceberg will move as expected, as a kind of 'reality-check' for the current models and our physical understanding."" Simulated highways: Small to medium bergs (Classes 1-3) generally have a lifetime of a couple of years; the big bergs (Classes 4-5) are mostly all gone after 10 years Polar research agencies are already discussing the scientific opportunities afforded by the breakaway. Scientists will want to understand what effect the calving might have on the remaining parts of the ice shelf. Ten percent of Larsen C's area was removed by the departing berg, and this loss could change the way stress is configured and managed across the shelf. There are numerous cracks just north of a pinning point known as the Gipps Ice Rise. These fissures have long remained static, held in place by a band of soft, malleable ice. Researchers will want to check the departure of A-68 will not alter the status of these cracks. There are also some fascinating investigations to be done on the seafloor that will soon be uncovered when the berg moves completely clear of the shelf. Previous big calvings have led to the discovery of new species.

"Roger Federer's two sets of twins stood out in the crowd as they watched their dad make Wimbledon history on Sunday - for wearing matching outfits. Girls Myla Rose and Charlene Riva, seven, were dressed in identical flowery dresses. Boys Leo and Lenny, three, both wore a pale blue jacket, white trousers and the same dark shoes. Dressing twins in identical outfits is not uncommon among parents, but some experts warn it may not be a good idea. Keith Reed, chief executive of the Twins and Multiple Births Association (Tamba), says it is important for parents to help multiple birth children develop their own identities. This can be done by dressing them differently and using their individual names rather than calling them ""the twins"" or ""the triplets"". He adds: ""If they are used to always being together or always wearing the same clothes, then the older they get the more distressed they may become if you try to make changes. ""However this does not mean denying their special relationship as one of a multiple. ""Rather it allows them to see themselves as individuals who have the bonus of being part of a multiple unit."" Twins Farrah, left, and Rae are sometimes dressed in the same outfits Carla Hallmark, 38, from south-east London, is mum to one-year-old non-identical girls Farrah and Rae. She says she sometimes dresses her daughters in the same outfits out of convenience. ""We don't really think about it. It's literally go into the shop and buy two of those, two of those and two of those. ""If the girls were identical I think my view would be very different. Our two look so different, so for me it wasn't really a problem and I decided it for ease. ""It's simply about getting up in the morning and going to their wardrobe and grabbing two of those and two of those. It's not a conscious decision to dress them the same every day. ""Yes it's quite cute and I don't dislike the way it looks but it really it is about ease. I don't think it really matters until they get to an age where they tell you what they are not going to wear. ""For now, while we are trying to get them out of the door in 15 minutes in the morning, it's certainly for ease."" The parents of identical twins Heidi, left, and Izzy ensure they wear different outfits But for some parents of twins, they have made a conscious decision not to dress their children in matching or identical outfits. PR director Marc Cohen, 37, from north London, is a dad to seven-year-old identical twins Izzy and Heidi. He says: ""Everyone is different but for us it's hard to get our heads around why anyone would want to have kids dressed the same, particularly if they are identical. ""They have their own personalities and they're their own people and from such an early age to have them dressed the same removes quite a lot of their personality. ""It does present challenges. I can understand if you've got a lot of kids it might be easier to be dressing them the same way. ""But as they get older it's really hard to encourage their individuality with identical twins, so I think it's worth working that bit harder to give them their own personalities."" Twins Jasper and Phoebe Tomkins on their first day at school Lauren Apfel, editor of online parenting magazine Motherwell and mum of twins Phoebe and Jasper, six, is against dressing twins the same and says parents tend to do it because it is considered ""cute"". ""People are fascinated by twins, and they love seeing them as an adorable diptych. But this is more about appearances than what is actually best for the kids themselves,"" she adds. ""Twins will always have a special bond. Dressing them differently doesn't do damage to that possibility. ""Rather it is an important step towards allowing them to thrive as individuals within their sibling relationship, as opposed to their identities being dominated by it."" Eight stars who have a twin Two sets of twins born on same day Nursery's dress call after twin influx Clinical psychologist Linda Blair, who has written a book exploring sibling relationships, says there is a fascination with multiple births and parents often try and ""enhance the attraction"" by making their children look alike. But she warns it can have a negative impact on the children themselves and their relationship with their sibling. ""Children want more than anything to be seen as special in their parents' eyes, as different from everyone else. ""When you duplicate them, you're not going to harm them in some kind of long-term way, but what you're doing is putting the warmth of their relationship at risk. ""The person they are going to want to compete with and push away is the person who is most like them. ""So it isn't good for the sibling relationship to dress them alike and put them in one box. ""The best way to raise confident kids is to continually praise and be proud of their differences and uniqueness."" Do you dress your twins in identical outfits?

"Primark has recalled thousands of men's flip-flops over fears they may contain dangerous levels of a cancer-causing chemical. The discount fashion chain said it had come to its attention that the footwear ""does not meet the Primark usual high standards for chemical compliance"". The products in question are men's flip-flops in blue, black and khaki. The company said customers will be offered a full refund and do not have to produce proof of purchase. Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, said the footwear was sold in stores between 4 January and 2 June this year as part of its Cedar Wood State range. ""We have found levels of a restricted substance in the product in excess of the 1.0 mg/kg requirement,"" it said on the website. A Primark spokesperson confirmed that the chemical in question was chrysene, used in dark coloured dyes, but said it was present at levels that would pose a minimal health and safety risk to customers. The fault was discovered by Primark following up an inquiry by a third party, the company said. ""We take the safety of our customers, and the quality of our products very seriously,"" the spokesperson said.

"Line is the market leading messaging app in several Asian countries Have you ever ignored your spouse's text messages? Be warned: it could be used against you in court. A woman in Taiwan has been granted a divorce, using the ""Read"" indicators on the Line messages she had sent to her husband as proof that he had been ignoring her. The app showed he had opened the text messages, but didn't reply to any of them. A judge ruled in her favour earlier this month. It's called ""blue-ticking"" - a term that refers to the act of reading but not replying to someone's messages. The concept comes from social media apps such as WhatsApp and Line, which use tick notifications to show when someone has received and read your message. The judge in Hsinchu district's family affairs court cited the ignored Line messages as key evidence of the woman's marriage being beyond repair, ruling that she was therefore entitled to a divorce. Taiwan top court backs same-sex marriage Uproar over Emirates 'ban' of Taiwan flag Taiwan grandma carried fish in Â£900 bag Over a period of about six months, the wife, surnamed Lin, sent her husband several text messages, including one after she was admitted to hospital because of a car accident, according to Judge Kao. In one message she told her husband she was in the emergency room and asked why he simply read her messages but didn't reply, she said. Although her husband did visit her once in hospital, the court found that his subsequent ignoring of her messages was grounds for divorce. ""The defendant did not inquire about the plaintiff, and the information sent by the plaintiff was read but not replied to,"" the court ruling said. ""The couple's marriage is beyond repair."" Apps like Whatsapp use a system of ticks to show users when their messages have been sent, received and read A month or two after her accident, the husband finally sent his wife a brief message. ""It was about matters related to their dog and notified her there was mail for her, but he didn't show any concern for her,"" Judge Kao said. ""It appears there's very little interaction with the plaintiff; the defendant rarely replies to the plaintiff's messages."" The couple had been married since 2012. She is in her 50s and had been previously married. He is in his 40s. Judge Kao said there were additional problems with the marriage. After moving into the home her husband shared with his mother, younger brother, and sister-in-law, Ms Lin had to pay most of the family's bills and other expenses. Her mother-in-law had also asked her to take out a loan to pay her father-in-law's taxes. Her husband did not have a stable income. A quick guide to the Line app WhatsApp: What the blue ticks mean Line could raise $1.3bn in share sale His family was cited as being ""unfriendly"" towards her, according to court documents. They would restrict how long she could shower and how high she could turn up the water temperature, the filings say. The ignored Line messages were the last straw, said Judge Kao. ""A normal couple shouldn't treat each other like thatâ¦ The Line messages were a very important piece of evidence. It shows the overall state of the marriageâ¦ that the two parties don't have good communication,"" she said. ""Now internet communication is very common, so these can be used as evidence. In the past, we needed written hardcopy evidence,"" she noted. Ms Lin's husband can file an appeal after receiving the court ruling by certified mail. But it seems unlikely to happen. According to Judge Kao, he has never showed up for a court hearing and hasn't responded to any of the court's other notices. And unlike Line messages, the court can't even tell if he's ""Read"" them.

"This video can not be played Justine Greening said every school in England would benefit Schools in England are being promised an extra Â£1.3bn over two years, as the government responded to pressure from campaigns over funding shortages. But the cash for schools will be taken from elsewhere in the education budget, such as spending on free schools. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says it represents a real-terms freeze on school budgets for the next two years. Education Secretary Justine Greening told MPs she recognised there was public concern over school funding. Ms Greening told the House of Commons this ""significant investment"" would help to ""raise standards, promote social mobility and to give every child the best possible education"". Not new money from the Treasury, but money from savings within education budget Â£280m cut from the free schools budget and Â£315m from ""healthy pupils"" projects The DFE is promising Â£416m extra for schools from savings in 2018-19 and a further Â£884m in 2019-20 A new minimum per pupil funding limit will be set in secondary schools at Â£4,800 The Institute for Fiscal studies says the extra money is more generous than promised in the Conservative manifesto - and will freeze average school budgets at current levels over the next two years But in the years between 2015 and 2020, the IFS says school budgets will have declined in real terms by 4.6% But Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: ""This is all being funded without a penny of new money from the Treasury. ""They are not committing any new money and have not been clear about exactly what programmes they will be cutting to plug the funding back hole."" This video can not be played Angela Rayner: ""They've taken with one hand and put it in with the other"" But Jules White, a West Sussex head teacher who co-ordinated a campaign over funding shortages, said: ""The government finally appears to be listening."" But he cautioned that any increase would need to keep up with ""rising pupil numbers and inflationary costs"". Heads push MPs for answers on school funding Big cities hit in funding shake-up Is school funding the next crisis? School funding cuts up to 2020 warning Schools consider cutting school week Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said this was a ""step in the right direction and an acknowledgment of the huge level of concern around the country on this issue"". But he said schools would still have to see the implications of the money being ""saved from elsewhere in the education budget"". Chris Keates leader of the NASUWT teachers' union called Ms Greening's statement ""a recycled announcement of recycled money"". Jo Yurky, who headed a parents' campaign over funding, said this was ""positive news"" and an ""amazing turn-around"" in attitude from ministers, but pressure needed to be kept up on protecting funding. A joint statement from the NUT and ATL teachers' unions accused the government of ""smoke and mirrors"". ""Whilst any extra money is welcome this isn't enough to stop the huge cuts that schools are making,"" said the teachers' unions. School funding became a major issue during the general election, with school leaders and teachers' unions warning that budget shortages would mean cuts to staffing and subjects. A protest over school funding cuts was held in London at the weekend They pointed to evidence from the National Audit Office and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which warned of Â£3bn funding gap and schools facing an 8% real-terms budget cut. During the election, the Conservatives had promised an extra Â£1bn per year, which on top of planned increases, would have meant the core schools budget rising by about Â£4bn in 2021-22. Most of this extra funding was going to come from scrapping free meals for all infants, a policy which was subsequently ditched. Under the plans announced by Ms Greening on Monday, the overall core schools budget will rise by Â£2.6bn between 2017-18 and 2019-20. All schools will receive at least an increase of 0.5% in cash terms. The Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: ""This is a desperate attempt to pull the wool over people's eyes. ""Schools are still facing cuts to their budgets once inflation and increasing class sizes are taken into account."" As well as concerns about the overall amount of money available, there has been controversy over how it is divided between individual schools. A newNational Funding Formula was announced by education secretary Justine Greening before Christmas. Ms Greening said the new formula would go ahead and would address unfair and inconsistent levels of funding. Under the new arrangements, from 2018-19, the minimum funding per secondary pupil would be set at Â£4,800 per year. For many years there have been complaints that schools in different parts of the country were receiving different levels of per pupil funding. Details of an updated version of the formula, with budgets for individual schools, are being promised for the autumn.

"Cambridge United fan Simon Dobbin was left with brain damage after he was attacked in March 2015 A group of football hooligans described as ""a pack of animals"" has been jailed over an attack which left a football fan unable to walk or speak. Simon Dobbin, from Suffolk, was left brain damaged after the assault in Southend, Essex, in March 2015. Three of the 12 men sentenced at Basildon Crown Court were jailed for five years for violent disorder. Mr Dobbin's wife told the court her husband had been given a life sentence through the group's actions. He spent a year in hospital as a result of the attack which happened after his team, Cambridge United, played at Southend United's ground Roots Hall. For more reaction to his story visit BBC Local Live: Suffolk,external Mr Dobbin was in court for sentencing - the first time he had come face-to-face with his attackers - but had to leave when he became upset. This video can not be played Simon Dobbin was left brain damaged following the attack Simon Dobbin (pictured centre) had been watching Cambridge United at Southend United before he was attacked Det Ch Insp Martin Pasmore, who led the investigation into the attack, said the men were like a ""pack of animals"". He said: ""These are individuals that are mainly spending their time in pubs and drinking and looking for the opportunity to have fights with other so-called football fans/hooligans."" The detective also said accusations that Mr Dobbin had been ejected from the stadium on the day he was attacked were ""absolute nonsense"". ""Let me be clear, Simon Dobbin is a thoroughly decent man,"" he added. ""He was not involved in any form of disturbance and was not ejected from the match or any other establishment. ""He is an entirely innocent victim of an unprovoked savage attack which left him with a permanent and devastating brain injury."" In a victim impact statement, wife Nicole Dobbin said she ""hates what these violent thugs have done to us"".

"Newly built homes in Yorkshire will be demolished by the HS2 rail line, the government has confirmed. The line's eastern route, to Leeds from Birmingham, will run east of Sheffield, with some trains going into the city via a new spur and existing lines. But 16 of 216 homes on a housing estate in Mexborough will be demolished. The government's preferred routes, from Crewe to Manchester and from the West Midlands to Leeds, were laid outlast November,external. Earlier the government announced seven contracts worth nearly Â£7bn for some of the line's civil engineering work between Birmingham and London. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the full line would connect Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield and the East Midlands in a Y-shaped network, with all of them being linked to London by the line. ""Britain's new railway line will bring huge economic benefits across the country and help ensure this government delivers on its promise to spread wealth beyond London and the south-east,"" said the Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling following the announcement. He dismissed claims that the project will end up costing significantly more than the Â£55.7bn budgeted. Speaking in the House of Commons later he said: ""There have been some wild rumours, I have to say, in the last 24 hours about the cost of the project, based on, frankly, a finger in the air by people who are not involved in the project. ""I would simply remind the House that it is incredible, inconceivable and simply nonsense to suggest that HS2 will cost five times the amount HS1 cost per mile. ""This project has a cost attached of Â£55.7 billion for the whole thing, it is currently on time and on budget and I expect it to stay that way."" Residents of the Shimmer housing estate in Mexborough have disputed that only 16 houses will be demolished by the new line. Karen Schofield, whose family farm is also on the proposed route, told the BBC that the government's decision was ""unthinkable"". ""It's the worst possible news that anybody wants to hear, that you're going to lose your family home, which my husband and his brothers... they bought, what, 40-odd years ago,"" she said. ""There's horses, there's stables, we've provided employment for local communities... and it's ok HS2 saying they're going to compensate like-for-like... we've invited them to come down here and have a look what we've built up over the years."" Mexborough residents 'deserted' by demolition plan HS2 reveals winners of building contracts Where did Carillion's problems come from? The government admitted that its existing compensation scheme - which offers homeowners the ""un-blighted"" value of their home plus 10% - would not be enough to allow the Mexborough residents to buy an equivalent house locally. ""The particular circumstance of the Shimmer estate development could mean that the statutory compensation package may not allow homeowners to acquire a similar property in the local area,"" the Department for Transport said. The government will now devise a plan with local residents and political representatives, which would ""ensure Shimmer homeowners can secure a comparable local home,"" the DfT said. The government's final route means that no new stations will be built in South Yorkshire. Ed Miliband, the Labour MP for Doncaster North whose constituency covers the Shimmer estate, said putting the line through his constituency was ""wrong and perverse"". ""It flies in the face of evidence, logic, and above all, the economic needs of South Yorkshire,"" he said. ""The government and HS2 should be ashamed about the way they have gone about this decision. Their arguments do not add up, the consultation was a sham, and the residents have been ignored,"" he added. But Philippa Oldham, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, argued that the overall HS2 plan would be of benefit to the country. ""By freeing up the capacity on the East Coast Mainline, West Coast Mainline, through the HS2 route we'll be able to shift some of our freight network onto the rail network from the road network,"" she said. ""So that will ease congestion on our roads providing that we have an integrated transport strategy.""

"The age-check requirement is supposed to make it harder for children to see pornography A nine-month countdown to the introduction of compulsory age checks on online pornography seen from the UK has begun. The April 2018 goal to protect under-18s was revealed as digital minister Matt Hancock signed the commencement order for the Digital Economy Act, which introduces the requirement. But details as to how the scheme will work have yet to be finalised. Experts who advised ministers said the targeted date seemed ""unrealistic"". The act also sets out other new laws including punishing the use of bots to snatch up scores of concert tickets, and mandating the provision of subtitles on catch-up TV. The age-check requirement,externalapplies to any website or other online platform that provides pornography ""on a commercial basis"" to people in the UK. It allows a regulator to fine any business that refuses to comply and to ask third-party payment services to withdraw support. The watchdog will also be able to force internet providers to block access to non-compliant services. Ministers have suggested one of several ways this might work would be for pornographic sites to demand credit card details before providing any access, since in the UK consumers typically have to be over 18 to have a card of their own. But the specifics are being left to the as-yet unappointed regulator to determine. While it has been proposed that the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) will assume this role, a spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport said the appointment would not be formalised until the autumn. ""We are already working closely with DCMS to ensure the effective implementation of the act,"" a spokeswoman for the BBFC told the BBC, but added that it was too early to say more about what guidance it might issue. The measure has been welcomed by child protection charities including Childnet. ""Protecting children from exposure, including accidental exposure, to adult content is incredibly important, given the effect it can have on young people,"" said its chief executive Will Gardner. ""Steps like this help restrict access."" Mindgeek, which operates several of the world's most popular porn sites, has also previously indicated support. But two experts who advised the government on its plans have expressed reservations about both how quickly the scheme is being rolled out and its wider implications. ""It seems to me to be a very premature date,"" commented Dr Victoria Nash, lead author of areport commissioned in the run-up,externalto the law being drafted. ""The idea you can get a regulatory body up and running in that timeframe seems extraordinary to me. ""And while I don't have a problem with asking these companies to act responsibly, I don't see it as a solution to stopping minors seeing pornography."" This, she explained, was because the act does not tackle the fact that services including Twitter and Tumblr contain hardcore pornography but will not be required to introduce age-checks. Nor, she added, would teens be prevented from sharing copied photos and clips among themselves. ""It may make it harder for children to stumble across pornography, especially in the younger age range, but it will do nothing to stop determined teenagers,"" Dr Nash concluded. Porn site age verification from 2018 Porn sites could be blocked by ISPs Age checks for porn sites in Queen's Speech One cyber-security expert on the same advisory panel was more critical. ""The timeline is unrealistic - but beyond that, this is one of the worst proposals I have seen on digital strategy,"" said Dr Joss Wright from the Oxford Internet Institute. ""There are hundreds of thousands of websites where this material can be accessed and you are not going to catch all of those. ""There's privacy issues - you're requiring people to effectively announce the fact they are looking at this material to the credit card authorities. ""And there's serious security issues from requiring people to enter their credit card details into untrusted sites. ""They may well say there will be other magical ways to do the age check, but I very much doubt they will be non-discriminatory [against adults without credit cards], transparent, privacy-preserving and secure for end-users."" Other topics covered by the act on which work can now formally begin include: requiring video-on-demand programmes to contain subtitles as an option making it a criminal offence to use automated computer programs, known as bots, to bulk-buy event tickets before selling them on at inflated prices simplifying planning rules to make it easier to install mobile and broadband infrastructure raising the maximum penalty for instances of online piracy from two to 10 years Some provisions set out by the act have already come into force, including the introduction of a ""broadband universal service obligation"" to give households the right to request download speeds of at least 10 megabits per second, and increased fines for firms behind nuisance calls. ""The Digital Economy Act is about building a strong, safe and connected economy,"" said Mr Hancock. ""It will secure better support for consumers, better protection for children on the internet, and underpin a radical transformation of government services.""

"President Rouhani began his second term at loggerheads with influential hardliners Two high-profile judiciary cases in Iran this weekend have underlined renewed political tensions between the country's recently re-elected president, Hassan Rouhani, and establishment hardliners. The first case involves thearrest of the president's own brother, and the second an American academic jailed for 10 years after being convicted of espionage. The arrest of Hossein Fereydoun, Hassan Rouhani's brother who goes by a different surname, was not wholly unexpected. During Mr Rouhani's first term, Hossein Fereydoun was one of his most trusted advisors. Although he did not occupy any official position Mr Fereydoun was present at the high-level international nuclear negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme, acting as the president's ""eyes and ears"". Hossein Fereydoun was one of the president's closest advisers He has frequently been the target of corruption allegations, most notably during last May's bitterly hard-fought presidential election, when President Rouhani's two main challengers, Ebrahim Raisi and Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, frequently mentioned him and also accused Mr Rouhani of nepotism for continuing to support him. Although Mr Rouhani won the election with a clear majority, the two losing candidates show no signs in backing down in their criticism of him. While the charges against Mr Fereydoun are not clear, a spokesman for the Iranian judiciary said on Monday that he had been detained in relation to an ongoing investigation.  He was subsequently freed on bail, according to reports. This video can not be played Hassan Rouhani worked hard for re-election - but he'll have to work even harder on three big issues The second case, which made headlines around the world, was the10-year prison sentence for Xiyue Wang, a Princeton post-graduate history student who was in Iran doing research for a doctoral thesis on late 19th Century and early 20th Century history. He is reported to have been arrested several months ago but the news only became public when the sentence was announced, and few details are known. Commenting on the case without naming Mr Wang, an Iranian judiciary spokesman described him as ""an American infiltrator"". An Iranian news site with ties to the Judiciary said Mr Wang was part of a ""spider network"" - Iranian code for a spy ring. Whether by coincidence or part of a meticulous plan, both cases share one important aspect: both will put President Rouhani in a difficult position, both at home and abroad, as he begins a second term facing big challenges to fulfil the expectations of an electorate hoping for reform and economic progress. Inside Iran, the arrest of the president's brother and most trusted adviser is seen by many observers as a major blow to his plans for the next four years. If the case goes further and charges are made, specially charges of corruption, it could pave the way for more  accusations to be made against other officials and even the president himself. US-Iran tensions have risen in recent months Outside Iran, the arrest of Mr Wang, a dual Chinese-US citizen puts even more pressure on an already fragile relationship with the US government. President Trump and his administration have taken a much harder line on Iran than their predecessors. The president has made clear his distaste for the 2015 nuclear deal, but while it remains in place for now, there have been no official contacts between Iran and the US since he took over, and the two countries have traded mutual accusations. The jailing of Mr Wang can only cause more bitterness and widen the gap between the two sides. Mr Wang is certainly not the first US citizen to be jailed in Iran - although all of the other current detainees are joint US-Iranian nationals. But every time a case like this arises the result is more bad headlines, diplomatic headaches, and long negotiations which often end with none of the initial accusations being proved. It's still too early to predict what the outcome will be for both of these current cases, and the details are still too sketchy. One thing is certain though - both cases carry a very strong message to a president who very publicly challenged the establishment, judiciary and revolutionary guards during recent presidential campaigns, accusing them of not only sabotaging nuclear negotiations but also his domestic plans for reforming Iran's politics and economy. They are accusations that the hardliners are not likely to forget and one for which they will be seeking revenge.

"With rumour swirling, gossip in the air about the cabinet, it is hard to work out what is really going on. Since Mrs May didn't really win the prize she was expecting, ministers have become an unruly lot. Tomorrow, they're all going to get a telling off (with apologies to the truth). Why is she so cross? Davidwants her job, although he says that he doesn't and isn't thinking about it, it's only his friends getting excited. Boriswants the job too, although he says he doesn't want it yet, and guess what, it's only his friends getting a bit excited. This excitement sometimes involves those friends saying rude things about the other one. Neither of them, nor any of their friends, wantPhilipto get the job. Some ofPhilip'sfriends want him to get the job, but maybe he's not so sure. What he really wants is to stay in charge of the money, whoever has the big job.

They'll probably never go to each other's houses again for dinner but they may not quite feel like poisoning the other's dinner. Then there'sLiam, who also likes Brexit a lot. He likes running for the big job. He says he doesn't want that opportunity to come up, but if it does, he might well have another go because he likes doing it so much. There's alsoAndrea, who smiles a lot and likes Brexit, a lot. She didn't really enjoy going for the big job last time, but if it happens again, the chance to run again might make her smile, a lot. Then there's the newer gang, likePriti, who also likes Brexit and might like to try for the big job one day. So mightSajid, who doesn't really like Brexit that much, but might want to join in the big race too. Philip. Amber, Michael (number two) and Liam And don't forgetAmber, whoPhilipandDavidare apparently trying to get into their gang - but it's tricky because she doesn't like Brexit and could also fancy having a go at the top post too one day, although she'd probably need to make a few more friends in her home town. And there'sPatrick, who didn't like Brexit either. No one really wants to be friends with him at the moment. He was meant to be in charge of trying to win the big prize but that didn't quite go according to plan. Then there areGreg,Karen,Justine,Michaelnumber two,Davidnumber two,Jeremy,Davidnumber three,Alunand yes,Davidnumber four. None of them really like Brexit very much. Most of them (apart fromDavidnumber three) would also likePhilip(remember him?) to write some bigger cheques for their departments. But he isn't really in the mood to do that, remember.

"This video can not be played ""Steve"", who is on the Prevent programme, tells Today's Sangita Myska that drink and drugs helped fuel his extremism The number of far-right extremists on the UK's anti-radicalisation scheme has risen significantly, latest figures show. ""Steve"", who is on the Prevent programme, says drink and drugs helped fuel his extremism. When I met Steve, the first thing I noticed were his prominent far-right and Nazi tattoos. I asked him to explain them to me and, as he did so, he appeared to examine his ink-stained skin with a mixture of confusion and disgust. ""Years ago I had a kind of warrior-type figure,"" he says, ""with a very significant English shield, a weapon. ""The other one here says 'English Martyr',"" he says, adding that ""more recently and more dangerously I had two Waffen-SS tattoos on my fingers"". Steve has asked us to disguise his identity to keep him safe from his former associates. He tells me the tattoos no longer represent his political views and that things changed six months ago, when he was picked up by counter-extremist authorities. He now receives intensive de-radicalisation counselling via the Channel programme, part of the government's counter-extremism strategy, Prevent. Last year, far-right extremists accounted for one-third of all referrals to Channel - which very rarely gives access to those on it - up from a quarter in 2015. The Home Office says in some areas, far-right referrals ""account for more than half"" of all those sent on the scheme. What is the Prevent strategy? Does the anti-radicalisation strategy work? The growing problem of far-right radicalisation Steve says his fascination with extremism began in his childhood. ""As a child a lot of my friends would have Action Men dressed up in British military costume. ""I'd always go for stormtroopers or any kind of Germanic influence. I felt they were the underdog,"" he says. ""As I grew, I liked the power element and the ruthlessness of the Nazi regime. ""I always told myself that the only thing I didn't like about the Nazi regime was the way they treated the Jews."" As he got older, he says his markings became an attempt to be taken seriously by those with hardened far-right views, ""The kind of language I was using at the time, it was evidence that it was the real deal, the real thing. It wasn't just idle chit-chat in pubs saying right-wing mantra."" Steve has mental health issues. He is an alcoholic and occasional cocaine user. ""Your ability to make wise decisions is blurred,"" he says, when asked about his addictions. ""I was in the company of people who were quite happy to jump on a bus to the next EDL march. I'd be on my merry way just to fit in with people."" ""It could be a simple phone call,"" he adds. ""You could be quite innocently be sitting in a pub, playing darts, chatting, and the next minute there's a phone call and there's a minibus on the way."" The call would come from someone in his social circle, he says, someone saying ""there's a march on 10 miles away, let's go for a drink and see what's happening"". He is currently receiving counselling for his substance abuse and interest in far-right ideas. Prevent operates in the so-called pre-criminal space. In other words, it aims to identify people before they commit a terrorist act. Steve has not been convicted of any racially-aggravated crimes or terrorist offences. He says he has given money to a far-right political party, but was not a registered member. Six months ago, his life took ""a surreal turn"" when he ended up with a dedicated counter-terrorism unit officer assigned to him. ""During the worst moment of my drinking, I went to A&E on several occasions, where I believe I was being quite abusive in the reception area. ""I was carrying around a book lots of people consider dangerous - called American Psycho - a book full of violence and nasty stuff."" Steve says the drinking and drug abuse meant what happened next remains hazy. ""I found myself in my flat, surrounded by policemen, and the counter-terrorism unit identified themselves. I realised, I was in some kind of serious trouble."" It is, controversially, now a requirement that hospital staff report those they believe to be at risk of radicalisation to the authorities. Steve cannot remember for sure whether this happened in his case. But he now receives intense one-to-one counselling funded by Channel, an arm of the Prevent strategy. His mentor, Mohammed Ashfaq, founded a drug and alcohol charity. He says he has conducted de-radicalisation work with Islamist and far-right extremists. He argues Prevent is a vital tool in safeguarding vulnerable individuals - including, he adds, people like Steve. ""People were trying to use his vulnerability to drugs and other underlying mental health issues, knowing full well he was easy to prey on, easy to manipulate and easy to go and do something for them."" He says Steve was the victim of organised psychological groomers. ""This is how extremists work. They prey on the most vulnerable. They groom them and then go out and get them to do their dirty work."" Steve has been sober for six months. He's left the predominantly white market town where he grew up. His social circle perpetuated what he calls an ever-decreasing circle of alcohol, drugs and tolerance of racist attitudes - and a discourse littered with racist terms. As he looks at his skin again, I ask Steve how he feels now about his Nazi and far-right tattoos. He takes a long pause and says: ""It's like another world. It is what it is. It's probably the most embarrassing and unforgiving thing I've ever done in my life. ""And I'm ashamed.""

"When Carolyn McCall announced that she was moving from the Guardian Media Group to become chief executive of EasyJet, rival Ryanair's Michael O'Leary dismissed her as a media luvvie. With her new post at ITV, which she will take up early next year, Mr O'Leary can happily call her a media luvvie again, although her track record shows her capabilities spread far more widely. Her first six months in the job in 2010 were enough to make anyone match fit. Those saw three of the aviation industry's biggest headaches: volcanic ash clouds, a spike in the oil price and an air traffic controllers strike. EasyJet's Carolyn McCall heads to ITV EasyJet boss shares three secrets But there's little in her early years that would suggest her as an establishment candidate whose career would read like a perfectly mapped flight path through some of the UK's best-known boardrooms, including Lloyds TSB, Tesco, Burberry and New Look. She once described herself as a ""coaster"" at school, and rather middling as a school student, and claims she never had a plan for her career. Born in Bangalore, in Southern India in 1961, she completed much of her schooling there before moving to the UK, attending school in Matlock in Derbyshire before going on to university at Canterbury in Kent. University of Kent, Canterbury, history and politics degree Teacher training, Holland Park Comprehensive University of London, politics Masters degree Costain Guardian Media Group, chief executive EasyJet, chief executive ITV, chief executive (January 2018) After that she almost became a teacher, doing her training at Holland Park Comprehensive in London, one of the most notorious of its time for its mixed demographic and free-thinking ethos. That experience seemed to have served to make her own appetite for education stronger and she went for a master's degree in politics from the University of London. Her first job was at builders Costain, but she was strongly drawn towards the media. To her delight she applied for and became a research planner at the Guardian in 1986, where her boss, a woman, shocked her by saying she could become the group's chief executive. And, reader, she did. By 2000, she had risen through the commercial ranks to become chief executive of the newspaper business, Guardian News & Media, and in 2006 she took the helm of the parent company. Management Today magazine called her: ""One of the toughest operators to have risen through the Guardian Media Group's ranks."" One of her landmark achievements there in 2005 was to take the paper from a Daily Telegraph-sized broadsheet to the pioneering, smaller Berliner format at an expense that raised eyebrows. But she also was involved at the start of the digital version of the Guardian. During her time at EasyJet, passenger numbers have almost doubled. She has also doubled the number of female applicants to become pilots under the Amy Johnson initiative. On a more prosaic level, she is known for mucking in with the flight crew when flying, helping to clear up the rubbish while getting to know the staff and their concerns. Her interest in supporting the progress of women is underlined by her naming one of her three children after political activist Emmeline Pankhurst, who helped women win the right to vote. She is one of just a handful of female chief executives in the top 100 companies. She was named Veuve Clicquot Business Woman of the Year in April 2008, was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to women in business, was awarded a damehood in the New Year Honours list for services to the aviation industry and on top of that has been given France's highest merit, the Legion d'Honneur.

"European Court of Justice headquarters, Luxembourg The UK government has published a ""future partnership paper"" as it works towards ending the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom after Brexit. So what does the ECJ do, and why is it so important to the Brexit process? The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is actually composed of two separate courts - the Court of Justice and the General Court. From 2004 to 2016 there was a third court, the Civil Service Tribunal, but its work is now done by the General Court. To avoid confusion this article will refer to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to describe the work of the entire institution. If you want to know more detail, or look up a specific case, you can do sohere.,external The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which is a separate institution. The ECtHR is based in a different city, Strasbourg, and is not part of the European Union. It is the ECtHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ has tended to support British efforts to extend the remit of the single market. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg - NOT the ECJ It decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and it settles disputes between them. It ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties; and it allows member states to challenge EU legislation. It interprets EU law at the request of national courts. Taken all together, this means that the ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, and pretty much everything else that the EU does. It all comes back to that Brexit referendum slogan ""Take Back Control"". At the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, Theresa May, as the new prime minister, declared: ""We are not leaving (the EU) only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen."" Vague promises to take back control of our laws suddenly became a very specific promise to end the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK. It became a government red line. Theresa May highlighted ECJ membership as an issue for Brexit at the 2016 Conservative Party conference Yes, we can. That's because trade deals usually have their own inbuilt dispute procedures. But any company from the US or Japan or anywhere else that wants to sell its product in the European single market has to comply with all EU regulations, and with all ECJ rulings about any of those regulations. If foreign companies don't comply, they can't operate in the EU. The same applies in reverse, of course, to European companies that want to sell their products elsewhere. Not if they want to operate in the single market, no. They are not immune from EU law. Quite the opposite, in fact. Take Google for example, which was fined a record 2.4bn euro by the European Commission in June for abusing its dominance of the search engine market. If Google wanted to appeal, it would have to make its case before the European Court of Justice. Google's office in the Netherlands: The company was fined 2.4bn euro by the ECJ In that sense, no, not directly, because companies can choose whether they want to trade abroad or not. But the really difficult issue for any country that wants to ""leave"" ECJ jurisdiction entirely is that the European Court is the ultimate arbiter for all the rules and regulations that make the EU tick. So if the UK wants to stay in the European Air Safety Agency, or the European Arrest Warrant, or the European Medicines Agency or any number of other bodies that regulate various aspects of our lives, it will have to accept that the ECJ will have a role to play in UK affairs. Air traffic control - one of many activities affected by the ECJ Here's one illustration of how thin this red line can be. Since the referendum, the government has confirmed that it still intends to join a new Unified Patent Court that is being set up by EU member states, even though the new court will regard ECJ decisions as legally binding and refer its own legal questions to the ECJ. Yes, that's right. Every time you dig beneath the surface of Brexit you stumble across the European Court of Justice. To get rid of it entirely would mean cutting all the ties we have, setting up dozens of regulatory bodies of our own, and starting many things from scratch. Also, don't forget, if the UK wants to negotiate a period of transition, to smooth the path towards full exit from the EU, it will have to accept that the writ of the ECJ will continue to run for quite some time after Brexit. That's another policy area in which the role of the ECJ will have to be negotiated. The EU insists that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit. UK negotiators say that is not acceptable, partly because it is a commitment that would have to last for many decades in some cases. People on both sides of the Channel hope it is, at least in some respects. On the citizens' rights issue, for example, there are suggestions that some kind of independent tribunal, involving both EU and UK judges, could be set up. There are some precedents for this. Similarly when it comes to the single market there are parallel structures such as the EFTA Court (which governs the affairs of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, the three non-EU members of the European Economic Area) that are nominally independent of the ECJ. But in practice, the EFTA Court follows ECJ rulings extremely closely. The UK could in theory set up something similar. The EU may be ready to live with that, but ardent Brexiteers will raise objections. That's one of the reasons why David Davis has spoken of a 'new and unique solution' - he has to try to keep everyone happy! The trouble is that legal issues such as jurisdiction are extremely difficult to fudge, and there does appear to be a substantial gap in perception between the two sides. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis (left) and EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier David Davis has made the sporting argument that if you're Manchester United and you go to play Real Madrid, you don't let Madrid nominate the referee. But the EU sees the footballing metaphor rather differently: the UK is choosing to leave a league of 28 teams. If it wants to come back to play the odd friendly, the EU would argue, it has to accept that the panel of referees will remain the same.

"Older white Americans still hold most of the economic and political power in the US. But the great ethnic diversity of younger generations means that change is coming. America's workforce, politics and place on the world stage will soon be changed forever. So great and so rapid are the shifts in the country's population, that, in the coming decade, the US is set to be transformed far more than other nations. Almosthalf of millennials and children are from ethnic minority groups,externaland it is this great diversity that is at the heart of demographic changes. As the country comes to rely on them for its future prosperity, everyone will have to consider how society must change to make a success of this new reality. Donald Trump rode into the White House on awave of support from older white Americans- those over the age of 45. Many were drawn to his promise of creating a better economy. But part of Mr Trump's appeal was his stance ongrowing immigrant populations and political correctness. His position reflected the fears of some older white people - part of a cultural generation gap identified by national polling in recent years. More than half of white baby boomers and older Americans questioned for a 2011 survey by the Pew Research Center saw the growing numbers of newcomers from other lands asa threat to American values and customs.,external And older white Americans were found by a 2015 PRRI poll to be more likely than younger generations to thinkthe country's culture and values are worse today than in the 1950s.,external Yet despite their fears, the economic well-being of the nation may well hinge on this younger and more diverse population. The white population of the United States will soon be on the decline. The median age of whites - the point at which half the population is older and half younger - is now 43. Among Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority, the median age is 29; while it is 20 for mixed race Americans, the fastest growing minority. In eight years' time, America's white population is expected to start falling, as the number of people dying exceeds the number of births. Already, the number of white under-18s is falling - a pattern which will continue because of a decline in the population of white women of childbearing age. Most striking of all, perhaps, is the speed at which the white population is ageing. By 2030, the number of white over-65s will have grown by 42%. Non-Hispanic US white births now the minority in US (May 2012) The changing face of US ethnicity (November 2012) At the same time, the number of white people of working age will have grown by only 9%. The reality is that America will soon have large numbers of older white people dependent on the support of younger, more diverse, generations. In the near future, the majority of children born in the US will be from ethnic minorities. Already, minorities make up nearly half of American youth; and, as white baby boomers retire, minorities - particularly Hispanics - will account for all the growth in the US workforce. A California dual language school: Much of the growth in the US workforce is coming from Hispanic minorities It is their contributions to economic growth, to tax revenues, pensions and old age medical insurance that will be relied upon. These demographic facts raise important questions about how government spending should be allocated. Currently, large numbers of minority children in the US attend under-resourced schools. Four-year college enrolment for Hispanics and black people,external, while rising, continues to stand well below that of whites. Many lack thefinances and guidance they need to secure middle class jobs,external. Income inequality has hit minority youth,externalparticularly severely and threatens to lead to continued inequality in the future. Young generations of ""new minorities"" - Hispanics, Asians, and multiracial Americans - are interacting with older minorities and white Americans, as they pursue opportunities in a country that is in dire need of more youth. This ""just in time"" population boost comes from recent immigration and somewhat higher birth rates. The states that are benefitting most are in the south and west of the US - where minorities have bolstered the gains in the child populations. In contrast, many states in the nation's Northeast and Midwest are facing losses in their mostly white child populations, which are not being replaced by the births and in-migration of young minorities. This surge in the number of young workers leaves the US in a much better position than many other industrialised nations. The population of the US - about 325 million people - has risen by nearly 100 million since 1980. It is expected to rise to 400 million by the middle of the century - a very different scenario to that projected for most of the developed world. For example, compared with Japan, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom - countries with generally older populations, lower birth rates, and lower immigration - the US working age population is expected to grow faster: by more than 5% between 2010 and 2030. This population growth will, in turn, help to power America's economy - increasing production, consumption and entrepreneurial opportunities. Yet were it not for its youthful new minorities - Hispanic and Asian Americans - the country's workforce would actually decline. New minorities may also offer the youthfulness that can bring energy, innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit. Although the present culture gap between the generations may persist in the short run, the reality of America's changing population is likely to mean that ""demography is destiny"". The ""diversity explosion"" that the nation is now experiencing will alter all aspects of society. Leaders at all levels of government - and Americans in general - will have to consider what investments are needed in today's young minorities to help the country prosper. The United States - much more than its peers - is on the cusp of great change. This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. William H Frey,externalis a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Diversity Explosion: How New Racial Demographics Are Remaking America.

"Stephen Hough told police he was stealing petrol elsewhere when Janet was killed A man who raped and killed a 15-year-old schoolgirl in 1976 has been jailed for 15 years. Janet Commins' body was found near a school field in Flint, north Wales, by three children playing hide and seek. Stephen Hough, 58, from Flint, wasconvicted of manslaughter, rape and sexual assaultat Mold Crown Court last week. He was cleared of murder. Hough was sentenced to 12 years and a further three after admitting sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl in 2016. The two sentences will run consecutively. After his arrest following the 2016 incident, Hough's DNA matched samples found on Janet's body, prompting his arrest and subsequent trial on charges relating to her death. Talking about the offences dating back to 1976, Mr Justice Lewis said Hough had shown ""no remorse whatsoever for what you did to that young girl"". ""You knew what you were doing... for your own sexual pleasure"". Hough was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter, eight years for rape and eight years for sexual assault - the sentences will run concurrently. The judge said he took into account the fact Hough was 16 when he committed the crimes. How police caught Janet Commins' killer after 41 years Schoolgirl killer convicted 41 years on Janet Commins: Stephen Hough guilty of 1976 rape and killing This video can not be played Stephen Hough guilty of Janet Commins Flint manslaughter This video can not be played Janet's uncle Derek Ierston described Hough as a ""wild animal"" Janetwent missing after leaving her home to go swimmingon 7 January 1976. Four days later, her body was found under a thicket near a school playing field. She had beensuffocated during a sexual assault. Noel Jones, who was 18 at the time, admitted killing her and served half of a 12-year prison sentence. Although he has never challenged his conviction, he told Hough's trial he wasmade a scapegoat by policebecause he was a barely literate Gypsy. Hough was questioned after Janet's death but was ruled out by police after he said he was stealing petrol the night she was killed - an offence for which he was fined. In 2016, his DNA was taken by police in an unrelated matter and a match was found with samples taken from Janet's body at the time. The jury heard it was abillion times more likelyto belong to Hough than anyone else. Senior investigating officer Det Supt Iestyn Davies said: ""Very quickly after his DNA was taken [in 2016] and entered on the database, it hit against a crime stain from that 1976 investigation and that prompted us to fully reopen the case."" This video can not be played Stephen Hough answered âno commentâ to police questions about Janet Commins' death Trisha Foley, scientific support officer with North Wales Police, praised the ""foresight"" of the scientists dealing with the case at the time. ""The fact that the material was placed onto slides and then a slip was added over actually preserved that evidence. ""To obtain not only a profile but a full DNA profile with a statistical probability of one to a billion that it matched Stephen Hough, in that timescale - that's a significant result."" The court heard Hough had been court-martialled in 1988 for grievous bodily harm with intent while serving as a soldier in Germany. He attacked a hotel receptionist and was in the process of ""strangling"" her when he was disturbed by others. He was jailed for five years, reduced through the ranks and discharged. Janet left her house to go swimming and her parents Eileen and Ted never saw her alive again Janet's body was found hidden under bushes near Gwynedd Primary School Det Supt Davies added: ""Janet was subjected to an horrific, sustained and brutal sexually-motivated assault and the impact upon her family, friends an the entire community was enormous. ""Hough is now in prison, where he rightly belongs."" In a victim impact statement read out in court, Janet's uncle Derek Ireston described his niece as a ""loving child, slightly timid and shy, but fun to be with"". He said Hough ""stole Janet's future"" and her mother Eileen has been ""hurting and suffering for 41 years"". His statement added: ""The investigation in 1976 seemed to me to be shoddy... anything as a family that we put forward was dismissed. ""We also, as a family, feel for Noel Jones who has also suffered so much since 1976."" The Independent Police Complaints Commissionis investigating how North Wales Police handledthe original investigation. Iwan Jenkins, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""The huge advancements in forensic testing since the 1970s were the key factor in being able to bring this case to court. ""Our thoughts have been with Janet's family throughout the investigation and trial. They now have the assurance of knowing that her killer has finally been brought to justice."" The judge said Hough killed Janet ""in the course of a violent sexual assault"" Schoolgirl killer 'was a scapegoat' Girl 'died quickly in 1976 sex attack' Man 'raped and murdered girl in 1976' Man denies murder of schoolgirl in 1976 Man guilty of 1976 rape and killing Janet Commins: Justice after 41 years Schoolgirl killer convicted 41 years on.

"Rob Greig: ""They hit us with everything they could"" On 23 June the British parliament came under a sustained cyber attack. In a matter of hours hackers made around 200,000 attempts to get into online user accounts. It was Rob Greig who got the call: ""You need to get yourself over there right now."" And so battle began. The attack - which led to officials disabling remote access to thousands of email accounts of MPs, peers and their staff - was first spotted by parliament's security operations centre. This was where Mr Greig, as director of the parliamentary digital service, was summoned to that Friday morning. Parliament cyber-attack 'hit up to 90 users' Cyber-attacks: Is my computer at risk? There had been some suspicious activity his team had looked at. That was not particularly unusual. The previous evening, the team had increased security on a number of accounts. But this, in turn, triggered the events that unfolded that Friday morning. The hackers realised that the defenders had spotted their work and were on to them. And so they stepped up a gear. ""They hit us with everything they could,"" Mr Greig says. ""We saw around 200,000 attempts to get into our users' accounts."" There was an automated ""brute force"" element of the attack which targeted weak passwords. But the attackers also knew enough about parliamentary security policies to try to avoid being spotted, by spacing out their attempts. By 13:30, Mr Greig had informed the 9,000 users of the parliamentary system that an incident was under way. His team fought to keep the attackers out of the system by blocking access to particular services - but then the attackers adapted. ""Their attack vector changed and they came for a different service,"" says Mr Greig. ""So someone was sat there watching. It wasn't just [an automated] script running. Someone was reacting."" The tussle between attackers and defenders lasted for about 24 hours as members of the team cancelled weekend and holiday plans and in one case, even left a wedding, to help manage the response. On Saturday, it became clear that some data had been compromised and stolen. Because of that, the decision was taken to lock all accounts so they could not be accessed remotely outside of parliament. It was at this point that news of the attackbecame publicas parliamentarians revealed they could no longer access their emails. Allow Twitter content?

""Our number one priority was to maintain the democratic activity that takes place in those two chambers - and all the systems, services and databases that run around that - that's what our decision making was based on and that's what we achieved,"" Mr Greig explains. He said subsequent investigations revealed that fewer than 50 email accounts belonging to fewer than 30 users were compromised (a figure smaller than originally reported but which remains subject to change). The National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre are both investigating, and so there is caution about saying too much. ""What I would say is that it doesn't look like to me to be an amateur attack,"" says Mr Greig. ""My direction of travel in terms of where we are going from this, it looks more like a state activity than anything else."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Greig was two years into a three-year cyber security programme to upgrade parliamentary cyber security. Multifactor authentication - which protects email accounts by requiring more than just a password to log on - had already been rolled out to new members and staff at the general election. That was quickly extended to all users, accelerating existing plans. There are a number of challenges specific to protecting parliament - including the presence of more than 650 offices in every constituency as well as 9,000 users. Parliament also guards its independence from government. The so-called Wilson doctrine limits the ability of intelligence agencies to monitor the communications of parliamentarians. This is designed to stop them being spied on, but makes it trickier to carry out the defensive monitoring of electronic communication that occurs at government departments. Mr Greig says it did not hinder responding to the June incident, but acknowledges there are issues in how it operates in the current world of modern cyber attacks. ""There is a question mark over the relevance of the Wilson doctrine and how effective it is as a policy,"" he says. Parliaments and the political process have been targeted in a number of countries in recent months and Mr Greig knows this may not be the last time he gets a phone call summoning him to the Security Operations Centre. ""It was always going to happen,"" Mr Greig says, the screens on the wall filled with evidence of all the activity on the network. ""And I'm sure something will happen again.""

"An artist's impression of the proposed HS2 Euston station The winners of Â£6.6bn worth of contracts to build the first phase of HS2 between London and Birmingham have been announced by the government. UK firms Carillion, Costain and Balfour Beatty are among the consortiums who will build tunnels, bridges and embankments on the first stretch of the new high speed rail line. The contracts will support 16,000 jobs. The final routes of the Manchester and Leeds branches of HS2 are due to be announced later. It will include a decision over its path through Sheffield. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""As well as providing desperately needed new seats and better connecting our major cities, HS2 will help rebalance our economy."" What do we know about HS2? Cash offer to residents on HS2 route But critics say the Â£56bn project will damage the environment and is too expensive. The first trains are not expected to run until 2026. Mr Grayling told the BBC's Today programme that the high-speed rail network will be ""on time, on budget"" and the government has ""a clear idea of what it will cost"". He disputed a report that emerged over the weekend detailing a study by quantity surveyor Michael Byng who estimated that the cost of HS2 could balloon to more than Â£100bn, making it the most expensive railway in the world. Mr Grayling described the figure as ""nonsense"". Commenting on the decision to spend on infrastructure amid the 1% cap on public sector pay, Mr Grayling said: ""That's a very different issue because we are talking about capital investment over the next 15 years. We are not talking about current spending that the chancellor will decide on come the Budget."" The contracts to design and build areas of the high speed rail line have been split into three groups: south, central and north. Carillion, which last week issued a profit warning and announced the immediate departure of its chief executive, has won two ""lots"" within the central area. Itsshare pricerose by 7.7% to 60.5p on Monday but it has fallen by more than 76% over the last 12 months. This includes one ofthe most controversial and complex areas of the routethat runs between the Chiltern tunnels and Brackley. Carillion, which is part of a consortium with three other companies to design and build the two lots, announced on Monday that it had appointed accountancy firm EY to support a strategic review of the business. The decision over its route through the North of England has been delayed for several years due to a series of disagreements, the most controversial of which has been which route it should take through Sheffield. The government's preferred plan for the route through Yorkshire would mean bulldozing the newly built Shimmer estate in Mexborough. The government says HS2 is ""on time"" but they're clearly not talking about the route for the second phase, which was first promised in around 2014. I remember flying a drone over a farm in Cheshire four years ago, filming the proposed route at the time. The farmer has been waiting ever since then to find out if he'll lose his business. He got in touch with me last year saying, ""obviously we know nothing more today than we did when you were with us nearly 30 months ago, as the decision for HS2 Phase 2b has been put off yet again"". Anyone affected by the line now gets a year or two to put their case together and present it toa special committee of MPswho'll go through thousands of fears and objections before recommending any changes to the final route or the way it's designed. When you talk to people adversely affected by HS2 they all say the same thing. Their lives go into limbo, often for years, just waiting for answers. Parliament granted powers to build the first phase of the line between London and Birmingham in February. Preparatory work has begun and major construction work is due to start in 2018-19. It is due to open in December 2026. A Bill to deliver Phase 2a from the West Midlands to Crewe will be published by Mr Grayling later on Monday. Services on this section are due to begin in 2027. Phase 2b from Crewe to Manchester, and Birmingham to the East Midlands and Leeds, is due to open in 2033. The companies who have won the contracts to design and build the first phase of HS2 are: Area South Euston tunnels and approaches - SCS joint venture: Costain (UK), Skanska Construction UK (Sweden) and STRABAG (Austria) Northolt tunnels - SCS JV Area Central Chiltern tunnels and Colne Valley Viaduct - Align joint venture:  Sir Robert McAlpine (UK), Bouygues Travaux Publics (France) and VolkerFitzpatrick (UK) North Portal Chiltern tunnels to Brackley - CEK joint venture: Carillion Construction Ltd (UK), Eiffage Genie Civil SA (France), Kier Infrastructure and Overseas (UK) Brackley to south portal of Long Itchington Wood Green tunnel - CEK JV Area North Long Itchington Wood Green Tunnel to Delta Junction and Birmingham Spur - BBV joint venture: Balfour Beatty Group (UK), VINCI Construction Grands Projets (France), VINCI Construction UK Ltd and VINCI Construction Terrassement Delta Junction to West Coast Main Line Tie-In - BBV JV Cash offer to residents on HS2 route HS2 'parkway sites' shortlist revealed Bid shortlist for key HS2 franchise named Rival lobby groups warn on HS2 rail costs What is HS2 and why scrap the Manchester link?

"The US doctor who has offered to treat terminally ill Charlie Gard has attended a meeting at Great Ormond Street Hospital to decide whether he should travel to America for therapy. Dr Michio Hirano will discuss Charlie's condition with doctors treating him and independent specialists. Great Ormond Street has given Dr Hirano an honorary contract giving him the same status as its own physicians. It means he can examine Charlie and has full access to his medical records. Charlie Gard case explained The visit has been arranged as part of the latest stage of a court fight, brought by Charlie's parents Connie Yates and Chris Gard, from Bedfont, south west London, over whether he should be given experimental treatment in America. Judges have heard that Charlie, who was born on 4 August 2016, has a form of mitochondrial disease, a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. Dr Hirano, a professor of neurology at the Columbia University Medical Centre in New York, has offered an experimental therapy called nucleoside. 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the family division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: The Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose their fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case, after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court Last week, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) released a copy of its latest submission to the High Court. In a statement published on its website, the hospital said: ""At the heart of Charlie's parlous and terrible condition is the question, how can it be in his best interests for his life-sustaining treatment to be withdrawn? ""Charlie has been treated on GOSH's neonatal intensive care unit for many months now and very sadly, the question that arises for him arises for other patients and families at the hospital too."" Connie Yates and Chris Gard want Charlie to receive an experimental therapy called nucleoside The hospital added it had treated more than 1,000 patients with mitochondrial disease and offered pioneering treatment, including nucleoside treatment, where appropriate. ""Despite all the advances in medical science made by GOSH and the other hospitals around the world, there remain some conditions that we cannot cure and we cannot ameliorate."" The hospital said it remained the unanimous view of its doctors that withdrawal of ventilation and palliative care were all the hospital could offer Charlie. It said his treatment team and all those from who the hospital obtained second opinions were of the view Charlie had ""no quality of life and no real prospect of any quality of life"".

"This video can not be played Nurse Felicity Richards said finding a parking space could add up to an hour to her working day Seventy-five members of staff at a Cardiff hospital have been left ""broken"" by a court ruling that means they owe thousands of pounds in parking tickets, a campaigner has said. On Friday, a judge at Cardiff Civil Justice Centre ruled private company Indigo could collect the charges from University Hospital of Wales staff. This means 75 people with outstanding tickets must pay the debt. Sophie Round, a healthcare support worker, said she was ""gutted"". ""It's not really the outcome that we wanted and what we earn doesn't really cover the fines,"" she added. Campaigner Sue Prior said: ""It's horrendous. Some of them [staff] are broken. They're scared stiff, petrified, they feel sick. This affects everyone from cleaners to doctors."" She said staff had permits which allowed them to park in designated areas for Â£1.05 a day, but a lack of spaces meant staff had been forced to park in unauthorised areas. It had been claimed that one nurse owed Â£150,000 but it has since been said this is not the case. Indigo said as a ""gesture of goodwill"" in April 2016 it cancelled all parking charge notices up to the end of March 2016 and reduced the charge to Â£10 if paid within 14 days. Healthcare support worker Sophie Round (centre) said she was 'gutted' by the judgement A spokesman said Friday's court hearing related to three ""persistent offenders"" who had accumulated in excess of 100 tickets between them since April 2016. He added: ""As the company responsible for managing parking and ensuring the free flow of traffic at Cardiff UHW, we have an obligation to ensure enforcement of parking restrictions... the court's ruling has justified our decision to take this action."" Staff nurse Felicity Richards said: ""I have to allow 45 minutes to an hour extra to park my car every morning. ""By the time I get into work there are usually no parking spaces and I have to park off site and quite often I have to park a 20 to 25 minute walk away."" But Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said more than 98% of staff complied with parking regulations and it was ""disappointing"" some had ""chosen to refuse to co-operate"". Len Richards, the board's chief executive, said: ""People have known what the potential outcome could be and I don't think there's anything we can do, as an organisation, to defend them from that."" This video can not be played The health board's chief executive Len Richards said parking controls were brought in ""for health and safety"" He said the parking controls were brought in for health and safety reasons, and the board had been ""working very hard"" to increase parking and create sustainable travel plans. ""The park and ride started in May this year... we also changed the flow of traffic through the site to make it more controlled and safer and, in doing that, we increased the amount of parking that was available by about 50 car parking spaces. ""We are working with the council around creating a public service hub for vehicles and buses to transport people and make that easier for staff, and we are working on a cycle hub to encourage people to cycle to work."" In 2015, iturged staff to pay any parking fines,,externalsaying they had been correctly issued and it did not intend to dispute them. Indigo has had a contract to manage and maintain the hospital's car parks for several years and has 1,250 spaces there. Tina Donnelly, the director of Royal College of Nursing Wales, said it was hoped car parking charges at the hospital would be scrapped from June 2018. But, in the meantime, she said: ""Due to the current cap on pay, nurses are contacting us with hardship issues, and car parking charges only add to their financial problems. A solution to this issue needs to be found."" Ms Prior said she had been campaigning on behalf of staff because two of her children were born blind at the hospital, but after medical intervention now have some sight. ""I had to help. Without those people and the NHS my children would be blind,"" she said. Seventy-five cleaners, doctors and nurses have outstanding tickets Staff 'gutted' at losing parking case.

"Baboons and other wildlife are a common site near Livingstone A baboon in Zambia has tampered with the cables at a power station in the south of the country leaving 50,000 people without electricity. It caused the blackout on Sunday morning by climbing into the power station and pulling at the lines.

"This video can not be played Passengers watch as woman dragged along platform by Rome metro Footage of a woman being dragged along a platform by a train, after her bag got trapped in the door, has raised safety questions about Rome's metro. Natalya Garkovich, 43, was left in intensive care after sensors failed to register the strap and emergency brakes did not stop the train's advance. The footage also shows train driver Gianluca Tonelli eating before driving away. The incident is being investigated, but Mr Tonelli says he followed protocol. ""I know that I was wrong and I am devastated by what happened to that woman,"" Mr Tonelli told Italian daily Corriere della Sera [in Italian,external]. ""But in the video it can also be seen that I looked twice in the mirror, I was not reckless."" Ms Garkovich, who local media report is a Belarusian national, was initially in intensive care, but her condition has since improved. Reports suggest she has broken bones from the accident. The CCTV footage obtained by Corriere shows Ms Garkovich boarding the train at Termini station, before changing her mind at the last minute. As she backs out of the train, her bag appears to become stuck - and despite the efforts of people on the platform, she cannot be freed. Local news outlets report that passengers on board the train pulled a number of emergency levers, but were unsuccessful. It is believed Ms Garkovich was not pulled into the tunnel. The first Mr Tonelli knew of the accident was when he pulled into the next station, according to reports. CCTV footage showed the woman being pulled along the platform The CCTV footage shows that Mr Tonelli was eating while the train was in the platform. But Carlo Rienzi, president of consumer rights group Codacons, said the failure of both the door and emergency levers meant Mr Tonelli could not be fully to blame. ""The emergency systems on board must function properly,"" he said in a statement, ""Therefore we consider it outrageous and offensive to say the train driver is entirely responsible, when you should thoroughly investigate the Rome subway security systems and their proper operation."" Meanwhile, Stefano Bottoni, national secretary of trade union Sul, said extra measures were needed to avoid a repeat of the accident. ""If the trains were equipped with cameras in the cockpit it might have been different,"" he told news agency Ansa (in Italian,external).

"Warren Buffett has advised his wife to put her money into simple index funds after his death What's the best financial investment? If anyone knows, it's Warren Buffett, the world's richest investor. He's worth tens of billions of dollars, accumulated over decades of savvy investments. His advice is in a letter he wrote to his wife, advising her how to invest after his death,which anyone can read [page 20, paragraph 6],external. Those instructions: pick the most mediocre investment you can imagine. Put almost everything into ""a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund"". An index fund is mediocre by definition. It passively tracks the stock market as a whole by buying a little of everything, rather than trying to beat the market by investing in individual companies - as Warren Buffett has done so successfully for more than half a century. Index funds now seem completely natural. But as recently as 1976, they didn't exist. Before you can have an index fund, you need an index. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. In 1884, a financial journalist called Charles Dow had the bright idea to take the price of some famous company stocks and average them, then publish the average going up and down. He ended up founding not only the Dow Jones company, but also the Wall Street Journal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average didn't pretend to do anything much except track how shares were doing, as a whole. Charles Dow's first Industrial Average tracked the closing stock prices of 12 companies But thanks to Charles Dow, pundits could talk about the stock market rising by 2.3% or falling by 114 points. More sophisticated indices followed - the Nikkei, the Hang Seng, the Nasdaq, the FTSE, and most famously the S&P 500. They quickly became the meat and drink of business reporting all around the world. Then, in 1974, the world's most famous economist took an interest. Paul Samuelson had revolutionised the way economics was practised and taught, making it more mathematical and engineering-like, and less like a debating club. His book Economics was America's bestselling textbook in any subject for almost 30 years. He won one of the first Nobel memorial prizes in economics. Samuelson had already proved the most important idea in financial economics: that if investors were thinking rationally about the future, the price of assets such as shares and bonds should fluctuate randomly. That seems paradoxical, but the intuition is that all the predictable movements have already happened: lots of people will buy a share that's obviously a bargain, and then the price will rise and it won't be an obvious bargain any more. His idea became known as the efficient markets hypothesis. Paul Samuelson (left) received the 1996 National Medal of Science for his contribution to economic science It's probably not quite true. Investors aren't perfectly rational, and some are more interested in covering their backsides than taking well judged risks. But the hypothesis is true-ish. And the truer it is, the harder it's going to be for anyone to beat the stock market. Samuelson looked at the data and found - embarrassingly for the investment industry - that, indeed, in the long run, most professional investors didn't beat the market. And while some did, good performance often didn't last. There's a lot of luck involved, and it's hard to distinguish that luck from skill. In his essayChallenge To Judgment,externalSamuelson argued that most professional investors should quit and do something useful instead, such as plumbing. He also said that, since professional investors didn't seem to be able to beat the market, somebody should set up an index fund - a way for ordinary people to invest in the stock market as a whole, without paying a fortune in fees for fancy professional fund managers to try, and fail, to be clever. Then, something interesting happened: a practical businessman paid attention to an academic economist's suggestion. John Bogle had just founded a company called Vanguard, whose mission was to provide simple mutual funds for ordinary investors, with no fancy stuff and low fees. And what could be simpler and cheaper than an index fund - as recommended by the world's most respected economist? So Bogle set up the world's first index fund, and waited for investors to rush in. Investors were initially slow to put their money into John Bogle's index funds They didn't. When Bogle launched the First Index Investment Trust, in August 1976, it flopped. Investors weren't interested in a fund that was guaranteed to be mediocre. Financial professionals hated the idea - some even called it ""un-American"". It was certainly a slap in their faces. Bogle was effectively saying: ""Don't pay these guys to pick stocks, because they can't do better than random chance. Neither can I, but at least I charge less."" People called Vanguard's index fund ""Bogle's Folly"". But Bogle kept the faith, and slowly people started to catch on. The warrior monks who invented banking Just google it: The student project that changed the world How the lift transformed the shape of our cities How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform Active funds are expensive, after all. They often buy and sell a lot, in search of bargains. They pay analysts handsomely to fly around meeting company directors. Their annual fees might sound modest - just a percent or two - but soon mount up. Eventually, fees can swallow a quarter or more of a typical fund. If such funds consistently outperform the market, that's money well spent. But Samuelson showed that, in the long run, most don't. The super-cheap index funds looked, over time, to be a perfectly credible alternative to active funds - and much cheaper. Today 40% of US stock market funds are passive trackers rather than active stock-pickers Slowly and surely, Bogle's funds grew and spawned more and more imitators - each one passively tracking some broad financial benchmark or other, each one tapping into Samuelson's basic insight that if the market is working well, you might as well sit back and go with the flow. Forty years after Bogle launched his index fund, fully 40% of US stock market funds are passive trackers rather than active stock-pickers. You might say that the remaining 60% are clinging to hope over experience. Index investing is a symbol of the power of economists to change the world that they study. When Samuelson and his successors developed the idea of the efficient markets hypothesis, they changed the way that markets themselves worked - for better or worse. It wasn't just the index fund. Other financial products, such as derivatives, really took off after economists worked out how to value them. Samuelson ranked the invention of the index fund alongside Gutenberg's printing press Some scholars think the efficient markets hypothesis itself played a part in the financial crisis, by encouraging something called ""mark to market"" accounting - where a bank's accountants would work out what its assets were worth by looking at their value on financial markets. There's a risk that such accounting leads to self-reinforcing booms and busts, as everyone's books suddenly and simultaneously look brilliant, or terrible, because financial markets have moved. Samuelson himself, understandably, thought that the index fund had changed the world for the better. It's already saved ordinary investors literally hundreds of billions of dollars. For many, it will be the difference between scrimping and saving or relative comfort in old age. In a speech in 2005, when Samuelson himself was 90 years old, he gave Bogle the credit. He said: ""I rank this Bogle invention along with the invention of the wheel, the alphabet, Gutenberg printing, and wine and cheese: a mutual fund that never made Bogle rich, but elevated the long-term returns of the mutual-fund owners - something new under the Sun.""

"Havaianas are now produced in all colours of the rainbow It is one of the simplest shoes on the planet: a piece of plastic, roughly the outline of your foot, with a crude strap holding the sole to your toes. Yet Brazil's Havaianas brand took the humble flip-flop to new heights. The company behind them was sold earlier this week for $1bn (Â£780m). Selling about 200 million pairs every year, it had produced a domestic and international phenomenon. Across the country, there are whole shops dedicated to them. Rows and rows, in all colours and styles. There are strappy ones, shiny ones, ones in the colour of your favourite football team, ones with huge platform wedges. The colourful rubber shoes have become synonymous with Brazil. Many carry a little Brazilian flag on their strap. ""Havaianas embodies Brazil's fun, vibrant & spontaneous way of life,"" claims the company's Twitter account. And it is this strong identity that has helped it hold its own, against cheap versions of what is an easy-to-replicate design. The company adds embellishments and metallic shines to boost prices and desirability Overseas, they have also proved a hit, and often sell at highly inflated prices: A pair encrusted with Swarovski crystals currently sells for almost $100 (Â£80) at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. They are sold all over the world, from the UK to Australia. The success is a sure sign that the shoe's status has entirely flip-flopped it itself, from its 1960s origins as a purely functional, working-class footwear. Back then, they were made only in one blue-and-white design, worn by workers across the country and sold by travelling salesmen out of the back of vans. The company maintains that the first variation happened by accident in 1969, when one batch turned out green and became a surprise hit. And that, according to local experts, is the secret of their success: they took a simple design and started experimenting. This really kicked off in the 1990s, according to Daniel Gallas, the BBC's South America Business Correspondent, based in Sao Paulo. ""The company created different prototypes, accepted branding partnerships. With a few tweaks, a product costing 10 reais [Â£2, $3] could be sold for ten times that amount,"" he says. ""Brazil's masses could still purchase the old models; rich emerging Brazilians could afford the new, fancy ones. It was a turning point in the company - when it became an international hit and revenues multiplied."" Havaianas has also branched into patriotic, football-themed footwear Eduardo Alves, a luxury lifestyle writer based in Rio de Janeiro, calls it one of ""the most remarkable upgrades in the history of fashion"". Suddenly they were in vogue. ""It was the opposite when I was kid,"" a Brazilian friend once told me, of growing up in late-1980s Brasilia. ""I was mortified when my mum brought us all pairs to wear to school. They felt so uncool."" Back then, they were so commonplace they were put on a list of fundamental products by the Brazilian government, alongside various household groceries, in its attempts to control inflation. But, says Eduardo Alves, there is also a darker side to the success story. Alpargatas - the company that make the shoes - was owned by theJ&F group, which manages the fortune of the billionaire Batista family and which has recently been at the centre of the biggest corruption scandal the country has known. A customer picks out a pair in a store in the upmarket Hamptons area of New York In May, news broke that Joesley Batista, chairman of the group's meatpacking business, had secretly taped conversations with President Michel Temer; the pair wereallegedly discussing bribes. The J&F group has since been hit with a record fine of more than $3bn, and the sell-off will pay off some of those debts. Do Brazilians care? Many have boycotted other products from the J&F group, but not all have made the Havaianas connection. And now the famous flip-flop is moving on, under the new ownership of three Brazilian banking groups.

"The Lib Dems picked up on a lack of papers on one side of the table in this photograph Brexit Secretary David Davis has called on both sides in the negotiations on the UK's departure from the European Union to ""get down to business"". Mr Davis was in Brussels to launch the second round of formal talks. He said his priority was to ""lift the uncertainty"" for EU citizens living in the UK and Britons living in the EU. The EU says there must be substantial progress on this - and on a financial settlement and the issue of the Irish border - before trade talks can begin. Appearing alongside EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Davis said there had been a good start to the process and it was time to get to the ""substance of the matter"". This video can not be played David Davis (left) and Michel Barnier resume Brexit talks in Brussels Mr Barnier said the negotiators would ""now delve into the heart of the matter"". Talks will cover citizens' rights, finance, Northern Ireland and Euratom, with separate negotiating teams set up for each issue. A UK government source told the BBC that 98 British officials were in Brussels for the negotiations. Mr Davis spent two to three hours in the EU quarter, meeting Mr Barnier for between 45 minutes and a hour before returning to London. The two men are expected to give an update on progress made at a press conference on Thursday. All you need to know about Brexit 'Tech will not solve Brexit border issue' Earlier this month, Theresa May's offer to give the three million EU citizens in the UK ""settled status"" after Brexit was immediately dismissed by European Council President Donald Tusk as ""below our expectations"". And Mr Barnier has said there were still major differences between the EU and UK on the subject. Speaking at a separate European Council meeting in Brussels, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted the UK had made a ""very fair, serious offer"". By Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe correspondent The call to ""get down to business"" from David Davis is meant to signal that the Brexit talks are entering a serious phase after an opening session of pleasantries and procedural discussions. That might raise eyebrows on the European side where there's a perception that Britain dithered for months after the Brexit referendum before getting down to talks. The UK says it's prioritising the issue of mutual citizens rights after its opening proposals received a lukewarm response in Brussels. The atmosphere around this second round of talks may have been improved a little by a government acknowledgement that the UK has obligations to the EU which will survive withdrawal and which need to be resolved. Mr Johnson has said that Brussels can ""go whistle"" if it expected the UK to pay an ""extortionate"" bill as part of the separation. The government's official position, confirmed in a Parliamentary statement last week, is that it will ""work with the EU to determine a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of our continuing partnership"". The EU has insisted that citizen rights - along with the ""divorce payment"" and border issues - must be dealt with before future UK-EU trade can be discussed. Reality check: What is the European Court of Justice? Blair: EU could compromise on freedom of movement Sir Keir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, criticised Mr Davis for spending ""only a few minutes in Brussels before heading back to Whitehall"". ""There is no agreed cabinet position on vital Brexit issues, the negotiating team is not prepared and the Prime Minister has lost her authority,"" he said, calling for engagement ""with the substance of talks"". The Liberal Democrats' Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, said Mr Davis' brief visit to Brussels - and a lack of briefing papers on the UK side of the table in when the negotiators posed for a photograph - was proof that government preparation for the negotiations was lacking. ""He didn't have any position papers with him because this government has no agreed Brexit position,"" he said. Lord O'Donnell, the UK's former top civil servant, suggested the chances of a smooth Brexit were at risk. ""It appears that cabinet members haven't yet finished negotiating with each other, never mind the EU,"" he was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. What happens now that a deal's been done?

"People in the UK will have to prove they are 18 before being allowed to access pornography websites from next year, the government is to announce.

Users may be asked to provide credit card details, as gambling websites do. Companies breaking the rules set out in theDigital Economy Act,externalface being blocked by their internet provider. Under the plans, firms supplying payment and other services to the pornography websites could be notified about any breach. A regulatory body will be asked to oversee and enforce the new rules.

Leah Kerry was found unconscious at about 04:50 BST on Saturday at Bakers Park in Newton Abbot, Devon. Jacob Khanlarian from Newton Abbot, was charged with two counts of intent to supply a class A drug and one of intent to supply a class B substance.

Their five-day tour of the two European countries is at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Kensington Palace said Prince George, three, and Princess Charlotte, two, would be seen ""on at least a couple of occasions over the course of the week"". They joined their parents in Canada last year for an official trip. ""The duke and duchess are very much looking forward to this tour and are delighted with the exciting and varied programme that has been put together for it,"" a Kensington Palace spokesman said. Charlotte and George looked out of the window after landing in Warsaw Princess Charlotte was helped off the plane by her mother They were greeted at Warsaw Chopin Airport by the UK's ambassador to Poland, Jonathan Knott, and his wife, alongside Poland's ambassador to Britain, Arkady Rzegocki. Prince George and Princess Charlotte were last seen in public on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for a flypast following the Trooping the Colour ceremony for the Queen's birthday last month. The royals will travel to Germany on the second leg of their trip By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent For Prince George and Princess Charlotte such trips are a novelty but, as the future of the British monarchy, they'll one day become a way of life. For their parents, the visit to Poland and Germany will inevitably be viewed in the context of Brexit. It won't have any impact on the negotiations. It will, the Foreign Office hopes, remind people of the strength of the ties that will endure after the UK has left the EU. It's this mission the royals have pursued in recent months in various European cities. Read more from Peter The royal couple and their children were welcomed in Warsaw at a meeting with President Andrzej Duda. Prince William and the duchess joined the president and the first lady to greet well wishers around the presidential palace. Student Magda Mordaka, 21, said: ""We were telling [the duchess] that she is beautiful and perfect, but she said it's not true - it's just the make-up."" The Polish ambassador to the UK presented the royal couple withthree books to give to George and Charlotte.,externalThey were Mr Miniscule and the Whale, Bees: A Honeyed History, and Maps. Catherine and Poland's first lady received flowers while meeting children Prince William and Catherine visited the Warsaw Rising Museum, dedicated to the 1944 Polish uprising to liberate Warsaw from German occupation during World War Two. Some 200,000 Polish people died during 63 days of fighting. Prince William and Catherine paid their respects to the fallen soldiers of the uprising when they visited a wall of remembrance. The names of 34 British servicemen, who died trying to give supplies to the Polish soldiers, were also listed on the wall. The duke and President Andrzej Duda lit a candle to honour the fallen The royals felt a pulsating wall that symbolised the Nazis not being able to stop Warsaw's heartbeat Later, William spoke at an evening garden party to celebrate the Queen's birthday, telling guests in Polish: ""Good evening, we hope you have a nice party."" He also also hailed Poland's ""courage, fortitude and bravery"" in surviving centuries of assaults, particularly its ""incredible bravery"" during the Nazi occupation. He read a message from the Queen detailing 1,000 years of ties between the UK and Poland. Catherine wore a sleeveless white dress by Polish designer Gosia Baczynska for the occasion. Baczynska's designs, worn here by Catherine, featured in Paris fashion week In Germany later this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold a private meeting with the royal couple in Berlin before they visit the Brandenburg Gate, a symbol of German unification.

"Mr Rodrigues says he wanted to do something for a living that he really liked Carl Rodrigues says that his family and friends all thought he had lost his mind. ""Everybody thought I had gone completely nuts,"" he says. ""They were saying 'what's wrong with this guy? Is he having a hippy moment?'."" Mr Rodrigues, a successful IT consultant, had woken up one day and decided to quit the day job. Instead of doing lucrative work for other people, he was going to retire to his basement and develop a best-selling computer product. The significant problem was that he didn't have any ideas. But to the worry of his wife, and scorn of his mother-in-law - who lived with them - he was undeterred. So back in 2001 he shut himself away beneath his house in the Canadian city of Mississauga, and started to try to dream up something. ""My goal was that I wanted to see what I could produce if I did something I really liked,"" he says. ""I didn't know what I was going to do, but I thought I would give it a shot."" After a month of working ""crazy hours"", Mr Rodrigues had come up with his first fully formed idea - a software system that allowed the user to control his or her mobile phone from their laptop. Mr Rodrigues squirreled himself away in his basement Naming his company Soti, sales of the system started to grow slowly, until 12 months later Mr Rodrigues got a phone call out of the blue from one of the UK's largest supermarket groups. The firm didn't want to sell the system to its customers, instead it wanted to incorporate it into its operations, so staff could better communicate and pass on data and other information. Mr Rodrigues, now 55 and Soti's chief executive, says: ""I was still in my basement when I got a call from the company, saying they would like to place an order. ""I don't think they realised that they were talking to just one guy in a basement, so when the person asked to speak to someone in sales I came back on the phone with a slightly different tone."" The little ruse worked, and the UK firm placed a ""huge order"" for 20,000 units. The firm specialises in mobile technology software systems Soti has never looked back; and while most people have never heard of the firm - because it sells its mobile technology software systems to companies instead of consumers - it today has annual revenues of $80m (Â£62m). This is despite Mr Rodrigues not needing any external investment. The business remains 100% owned by him and his wife. Continuing to turn down numerous takeover bids, including an undisclosed offer from Microsoft in 2006, the Canadian business leader instead says he wants Soti to ""become as big as they get"" in the computer world. Born in Pakistan to a Roman Catholic family that had its roots in the former Portuguese colony of Goa on India's west coast, Mr Rodrigues emigrated to Canada with his parents and four siblings when he was 11. The decision to leave Pakistan was Mr Rodrigues' mother's. He says she was increasingly concerned at political and social instability in the country in the early 1970s. He says: ""Dad was happy in Pakistan, but mum wanted us kids to have a nice safe place to grow up in, and have a good education."" Carl (the youngest of the two boys) and his family left Pakistan in the early 1970s As the family spoke English at home, Mr Rodrigues says he had no problem settling in Toronto. He even liked the significantly colder weather. ""I was dying to see snow,"" he says. ""This magical thing I had never seen."" After ""doing enough at school to go to university"", Mr Rodrigues did a degree in computer science and mathematics at the University of Toronto. He then spent a number of years working as a consultant, before launching Soti in 2001. Today the company is valued at more than $1bn (Â£770m), and has 17,000 business customers around the world, and 700 employees across 22 countries. Instead of still being based in Mr Rodrigues' basement, its headquarters is split across two buildings in Mississauga, which borders Toronto in the Canadian province of Ontario. The company has 700 workers around the world Technology journalist Martin Veitch who has followed Mr Rodrigues' career, says Soti has been so successful because of its specialised approach. ""I think Soti is an example of a company that has succeeded by being focused on a business niche,"" says Mr Veitch, who is contributing editor of website IDG Connect. ""A lot of its rivals are huge vendors that play in virtually every aspect of IT. That's fine for those customers that like 'one throat to choke', but for others a company that is a specialist represents a better fit.""

He explains: ""I'm so busy doing other things, they need to be their own CEOs and run their own organisations."" One problem Mr Rodrigues says the company has faced, is struggling to recruit enough good computer programmers. Mr Rodrigues wants his senior managers to consider themselves to be their own chief executives To get around this problem he has had to think creatively, and Soti advertises for people with no programming experience or qualifications to try their luck. So far the firm has recruited 16 or so people under the initiative that sees applicants put through a number of tests. Soti has also hired 20 programmers from the Ukraine, who it helped move to Canada with their families. While Mr Rodrigues no longer has to work from his basement, his mother-in-law still lives with him, his wife and their two sons.

"This video can not be played EasyJet boss: 'Get to know people' ITV has appointed the boss of EasyJet, Carolyn McCall, as its new chief executive. Ms McCall, who has been at EasyJet for seven years, will take over the running of the commercial broadcaster early next year. ITV's previous chief executive, Adam Crozier, left in June. She will be paid an annual salary of Â£900,000, plus pension and possible bonus and incentives. Before running EasyJet, Ms McCall was chief executive at the Guardian. She also is a non-executive director at fashion company Burberry, sits on the board of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and is a trustee at the Royal Academy. Ms McCall said the decision to leave EasyJet had been ""really difficult"", but after seven years at the company the time was right for a move: ""The opportunity from ITV felt like the right one to take. It is a fantastic company in a dynamic and stimulating sector."" Straight talking, no-nonsense, charming, effective. Those are some of the descriptions I've heard of Dame Carolyn McCall who this morning confirmed one of the worst kept secrets in British business that she will become the new CEO of ITV. For the customers and shareholders of EasyJet, her track record is impressive. Since taking over in 2010, passenger numbers have grown 56% and the share price has tripled. But it's perhaps her impact on the industry as a whole that will prove most lasting. Michael O'Leary freely admitted that EasyJet had ""wiped the floor"" with Ryanair - forcing his company into a rethink on its approach to customer relations. EasyJet doesn't like the terms ""budget"" or ""no frills"" - preferring the word ""value"". EasyJet played a big part in redefining what that word meant to customers and in doing so ruffled the feathers of the big birds of aviation like BA, Lufthansa and KLM. ITV's outgoing CEO Adam Crozier was considered a great success and will be a tough act to follow at ITV but tough is another word you could chuck in to describe Carolyn McCall. ITV chairman Peter Bazalgette said: ""In a very impressive field of high calibre candidates, Carolyn stood out for her track record in media, experience of an international operation, clear strategic acumen and strong record of delivering value to shareholders. I'm delighted we'll be working together at ITV."" John Barton, EasyJet chairman, said: ""I speak for absolutely everyone at EasyJet in saying we will be sorry to see Carolyn leave and that we wish her well in her exciting new role."" Her bonus plan on joining ITV will be up to a maximum of 180% of salary, and there will be a long-term incentive plan up to 265% of salary. ITV described it as ""broadly the same remuneration opportunity"" to Mr Crozier's. This video can not be played EasyJet boss: 'Get to know people' The broadcaster's shares were the top riser on the FTSE 100 in early trading,  jumping almost 3% to 180p. Analysts at Liberum said it was a positive appointment, noting that she had been credited with transforming EasyJet's fortunes over the past seven years. ""She is seen as being very good with people, at building a strong management team around her and at the ability to 'work the room',"" Liberum said. ""She also has very good links on the government side, which should be very helpful in areas such as retransmission revenues for ITV.""

"This video can not be played Nurse Felicity Richards said finding a parking space could add up to an hour to her working day Seventy-five members of staff at a Cardiff hospital have been left ""broken"" by a court ruling that means they owe thousands of pounds in parking tickets, a campaigner has said. On Friday, a judge at Cardiff Civil Justice Centre ruled private company Indigo could collect the charges from University Hospital of Wales staff. This means 75 people with outstanding tickets must pay the debt. Sophie Round, a healthcare support worker, said she was ""gutted"". ""It's not really the outcome that we wanted and what we earn doesn't really cover the fines,"" she added. Campaigner Sue Prior said: ""It's horrendous. Some of them [staff] are broken. They're scared stiff, petrified, they feel sick. This affects everyone from cleaners to doctors."" She said staff had permits which allowed them to park in designated areas for Â£1.05 a day, but a lack of spaces meant staff had been forced to park in unauthorised areas. It had been claimed that one nurse owed Â£150,000 but it has since been said this is not the case. Indigo said as a ""gesture of goodwill"" in April 2016 it cancelled all parking charge notices up to the end of March 2016 and reduced the charge to Â£10 if paid within 14 days. Healthcare support worker Sophie Round (centre) said she was 'gutted' by the judgement A spokesman said Friday's court hearing related to three ""persistent offenders"" who had accumulated in excess of 100 tickets between them since April 2016. He added: ""As the company responsible for managing parking and ensuring the free flow of traffic at Cardiff UHW, we have an obligation to ensure enforcement of parking restrictions... the court's ruling has justified our decision to take this action."" Staff nurse Felicity Richards said: ""I have to allow 45 minutes to an hour extra to park my car every morning. ""By the time I get into work there are usually no parking spaces and I have to park off site and quite often I have to park a 20 to 25 minute walk away."" But Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said more than 98% of staff complied with parking regulations and it was ""disappointing"" some had ""chosen to refuse to co-operate"". Len Richards, the board's chief executive, said: ""People have known what the potential outcome could be and I don't think there's anything we can do, as an organisation, to defend them from that."" This video can not be played The health board's chief executive Len Richards said parking controls were brought in ""for health and safety"" He said the parking controls were brought in for health and safety reasons, and the board had been ""working very hard"" to increase parking and create sustainable travel plans. ""The park and ride started in May this year... we also changed the flow of traffic through the site to make it more controlled and safer and, in doing that, we increased the amount of parking that was available by about 50 car parking spaces. ""We are working with the council around creating a public service hub for vehicles and buses to transport people and make that easier for staff, and we are working on a cycle hub to encourage people to cycle to work."" In 2015, iturged staff to pay any parking fines,,externalsaying they had been correctly issued and it did not intend to dispute them. Indigo has had a contract to manage and maintain the hospital's car parks for several years and has 1,250 spaces there. Tina Donnelly, the director of Royal College of Nursing Wales, said it was hoped car parking charges at the hospital would be scrapped from June 2018. But, in the meantime, she said: ""Due to the current cap on pay, nurses are contacting us with hardship issues, and car parking charges only add to their financial problems. A solution to this issue needs to be found."" Ms Prior said she had been campaigning on behalf of staff because two of her children were born blind at the hospital, but after medical intervention now have some sight. ""I had to help. Without those people and the NHS my children would be blind,"" she said. Seventy-five cleaners, doctors and nurses have outstanding tickets Staff 'gutted' at losing parking case.

"This video can not be played North Korea announces the missile test on 4 July South Korea has proposed holding military talks with the North, after weeks of heightened tension following Pyongyang's long-range missile test. If they were to go ahead, they would be the first high-level talks since 2015. A senior official said talks should aim to stop ""all hostile activities that raise military tension"" at the fortified border between the Koreas. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has long signalled he wants closer engagement with the North. North Korea has not responded to the South's proposal yet. In a recent speech in Berlin, Mr Moon said dialogue with the North was more pressing than ever and called for a peace treaty to be signed. He said such dialogue was crucial for those who seek the end of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme. However, the North's frequent missile tests, including the most recent one of an intercontinental ballistic missile, are in consistent violation of UN resolutions and have alarmed its neighbours and the US. Is latest test a game-changer? What can the world do about N Korea? How advanced is its nuclear programme? South Korea's Vice Defence Minister Suh Choo-suk told a media briefing that talks could be held at Tongilgak, a North Korean building in the Panmunjom compound in the demilitarised zone between the two countries, which was used to host previous talks. He proposed that the talks be held on 21 July, and said: ""We expect a positive response from the North."" South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon also urged the restoration of communication hotlines between the two Koreas, cut last year after a North Korean nuclear test. The BBC's Karen Allen in Seoul says the ultimate aim of these talks would be to end the military confrontation that has dominated relations between the two Koreas for decades. But it could begin with confidence-building measures such as ending the infamous loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border, she says. The Red Cross and the government have also proposed a separate meeting, aimed at discussing how to hold reunions of families separated by the Korean War, which ended in 1953. But analysts say these could be highly fraught with Pyongyang still angry at the South's unwillingness to repatriate high-profile defectors.

"Firefighters, teachers and other public sector workers are thousands of pounds a year worse off than they were in 2010, the TUC has said. With inflation outpacing the government's 1% limit on pay rises for state employees, real wages are being eroded, said the trades union body. It said prison officers and paramedics were more than Â£3,800 a year poorer. However, the chancellor has said state sector workers get a 10% ""premium"" over private sector counterparts. The government has come under pressure since the election in June to alter its policy of limiting pay rises in the public sector. ""It's been seven long years of pay cuts for our public servants. And ministers still won't tell us if relief is on the way,"" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said. Inflation measured by the most commonly used method, CPI, which does not take housing costs into account, has picked up in recent months hitting 2.9% in May. According to the Bank of England it averaged 2.7% a year between 2010 and 2016. The TUC calculates that if firefighters' wages had kept pace with inflation their average pay would be nearly Â£2,900 higher than it is. For nuclear engineers and teachers the figure is about Â£2,500. On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Chancellor Philip Hammond said public sector pay had ""raced ahead"" of the private sector after the economic crash in 2008. He added that when ""very generous"" public sector pension contributions were taken into account, public sector workers enjoyed a 10% ""premium"" over their private sector counterparts, Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private sector? But Mr Hammond refused to comment on reports he had said at a meeting that public servants were ""overpaid"". The average pay for an NHS paramedic is Â£35,577. But if the paramedic's salary in 2010 had kept pace with inflation measured by CPI, by now he or she should be earning Â£39,435 - Â£3,888 more, says the TUC. The TUC says if RPI (the inflation measure which does include housing costs) is used, the paramedic would need to earn Â£41,717 - Â£6,140 more -  to maintain their 2010 spending power. The TUC's analysis suggests workers in different parts of the public sector are out of pocket in real terms to varying degrees (based on CPI): Crown prosecutor Â£4,400 NHS specialist dietician Â£3,858 Prison officer Â£3,819 Firefighter Â£2,888 Nuclear maintenance engineer Â£2,591 Teacher Â£2,414 Lifeguards' Â£2,200 NHS ancillary staff Â£897 Pay rises for most public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% each year since 2013. Before that, there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. Trade unions plan to submit a petition to the Treasury on Monday calling for the pay cap to be lifted.

"An artist's impression of the proposed HS2 Euston station The winners of Â£6.6bn worth of contracts to build the first phase of HS2 between London and Birmingham have been announced by the government. UK firms Carillion, Costain and Balfour Beatty are among the consortiums who will build tunnels, bridges and embankments on the first stretch of the new high speed rail line. The contracts will support 16,000 jobs. The final routes of the Manchester and Leeds branches of HS2 are due to be announced later. It will include a decision over its path through Sheffield. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""As well as providing desperately needed new seats and better connecting our major cities, HS2 will help rebalance our economy."" What do we know about HS2? Cash offer to residents on HS2 route But critics say the Â£56bn project will damage the environment and is too expensive. The first trains are not expected to run until 2026. Mr Grayling told the BBC's Today programme that the high-speed rail network will be ""on time, on budget"" and the government has ""a clear idea of what it will cost"". He disputed a report that emerged over the weekend detailing a study by quantity surveyor Michael Byng who estimated that the cost of HS2 could balloon to more than Â£100bn, making it the most expensive railway in the world. Mr Grayling described the figure as ""nonsense"". Commenting on the decision to spend on infrastructure amid the 1% cap on public sector pay, Mr Grayling said: ""That's a very different issue because we are talking about capital investment over the next 15 years. We are not talking about current spending that the chancellor will decide on come the Budget."" The contracts to design and build areas of the high speed rail line have been split into three groups: south, central and north. Carillion, which last week issued a profit warning and announced the immediate departure of its chief executive, has won two ""lots"" within the central area. Itsshare pricerose by 7.7% to 60.5p on Monday but it has fallen by more than 76% over the last 12 months. This includes one ofthe most controversial and complex areas of the routethat runs between the Chiltern tunnels and Brackley. Carillion, which is part of a consortium with three other companies to design and build the two lots, announced on Monday that it had appointed accountancy firm EY to support a strategic review of the business. The decision over its route through the North of England has been delayed for several years due to a series of disagreements, the most controversial of which has been which route it should take through Sheffield. The government's preferred plan for the route through Yorkshire would mean bulldozing the newly built Shimmer estate in Mexborough. The government says HS2 is ""on time"" but they're clearly not talking about the route for the second phase, which was first promised in around 2014. I remember flying a drone over a farm in Cheshire four years ago, filming the proposed route at the time. The farmer has been waiting ever since then to find out if he'll lose his business. He got in touch with me last year saying, ""obviously we know nothing more today than we did when you were with us nearly 30 months ago, as the decision for HS2 Phase 2b has been put off yet again"". Anyone affected by the line now gets a year or two to put their case together and present it toa special committee of MPswho'll go through thousands of fears and objections before recommending any changes to the final route or the way it's designed. When you talk to people adversely affected by HS2 they all say the same thing. Their lives go into limbo, often for years, just waiting for answers. Parliament granted powers to build the first phase of the line between London and Birmingham in February. Preparatory work has begun and major construction work is due to start in 2018-19. It is due to open in December 2026. A Bill to deliver Phase 2a from the West Midlands to Crewe will be published by Mr Grayling later on Monday. Services on this section are due to begin in 2027. Phase 2b from Crewe to Manchester, and Birmingham to the East Midlands and Leeds, is due to open in 2033. The companies who have won the contracts to design and build the first phase of HS2 are: Area South Euston tunnels and approaches - SCS joint venture: Costain (UK), Skanska Construction UK (Sweden) and STRABAG (Austria) Northolt tunnels - SCS JV Area Central Chiltern tunnels and Colne Valley Viaduct - Align joint venture:  Sir Robert McAlpine (UK), Bouygues Travaux Publics (France) and VolkerFitzpatrick (UK) North Portal Chiltern tunnels to Brackley - CEK joint venture: Carillion Construction Ltd (UK), Eiffage Genie Civil SA (France), Kier Infrastructure and Overseas (UK) Brackley to south portal of Long Itchington Wood Green tunnel - CEK JV Area North Long Itchington Wood Green Tunnel to Delta Junction and Birmingham Spur - BBV joint venture: Balfour Beatty Group (UK), VINCI Construction Grands Projets (France), VINCI Construction UK Ltd and VINCI Construction Terrassement Delta Junction to West Coast Main Line Tie-In - BBV JV Cash offer to residents on HS2 route HS2 'parkway sites' shortlist revealed Bid shortlist for key HS2 franchise named Rival lobby groups warn on HS2 rail costs What is HS2 and why scrap the Manchester link?

"Rob Greig: ""They hit us with everything they could"" On 23 June the British parliament came under a sustained cyber attack. In a matter of hours hackers made around 200,000 attempts to get into online user accounts. It was Rob Greig who got the call: ""You need to get yourself over there right now."" And so battle began. The attack - which led to officials disabling remote access to thousands of email accounts of MPs, peers and their staff - was first spotted by parliament's security operations centre. This was where Mr Greig, as director of the parliamentary digital service, was summoned to that Friday morning. Parliament cyber-attack 'hit up to 90 users' Cyber-attacks: Is my computer at risk? There had been some suspicious activity his team had looked at. That was not particularly unusual. The previous evening, the team had increased security on a number of accounts. But this, in turn, triggered the events that unfolded that Friday morning. The hackers realised that the defenders had spotted their work and were on to them. And so they stepped up a gear. ""They hit us with everything they could,"" Mr Greig says. ""We saw around 200,000 attempts to get into our users' accounts."" There was an automated ""brute force"" element of the attack which targeted weak passwords. But the attackers also knew enough about parliamentary security policies to try to avoid being spotted, by spacing out their attempts. By 13:30, Mr Greig had informed the 9,000 users of the parliamentary system that an incident was under way. His team fought to keep the attackers out of the system by blocking access to particular services - but then the attackers adapted. ""Their attack vector changed and they came for a different service,"" says Mr Greig. ""So someone was sat there watching. It wasn't just [an automated] script running. Someone was reacting."" The tussle between attackers and defenders lasted for about 24 hours as members of the team cancelled weekend and holiday plans and in one case, even left a wedding, to help manage the response. On Saturday, it became clear that some data had been compromised and stolen. Because of that, the decision was taken to lock all accounts so they could not be accessed remotely outside of parliament. It was at this point that news of the attackbecame publicas parliamentarians revealed they could no longer access their emails. Allow Twitter content?

""Our number one priority was to maintain the democratic activity that takes place in those two chambers - and all the systems, services and databases that run around that - that's what our decision making was based on and that's what we achieved,"" Mr Greig explains. He said subsequent investigations revealed that fewer than 50 email accounts belonging to fewer than 30 users were compromised (a figure smaller than originally reported but which remains subject to change). The National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre are both investigating, and so there is caution about saying too much. ""What I would say is that it doesn't look like to me to be an amateur attack,"" says Mr Greig. ""My direction of travel in terms of where we are going from this, it looks more like a state activity than anything else."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Greig was two years into a three-year cyber security programme to upgrade parliamentary cyber security. Multifactor authentication - which protects email accounts by requiring more than just a password to log on - had already been rolled out to new members and staff at the general election. That was quickly extended to all users, accelerating existing plans. There are a number of challenges specific to protecting parliament - including the presence of more than 650 offices in every constituency as well as 9,000 users. Parliament also guards its independence from government. The so-called Wilson doctrine limits the ability of intelligence agencies to monitor the communications of parliamentarians. This is designed to stop them being spied on, but makes it trickier to carry out the defensive monitoring of electronic communication that occurs at government departments. Mr Greig says it did not hinder responding to the June incident, but acknowledges there are issues in how it operates in the current world of modern cyber attacks. ""There is a question mark over the relevance of the Wilson doctrine and how effective it is as a policy,"" he says.

"This video can not be played North Korea announces the missile test on 4 July South Korea has proposed holding military talks with the North, after weeks of heightened tension following Pyongyang's long-range missile test. If they were to go ahead, they would be the first high-level talks since 2015. A senior official said talks should aim to stop ""all hostile activities that raise military tension"" at the fortified border between the Koreas. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has long signalled he wants closer engagement with the North. North Korea has not responded to the South's proposal yet. In a recent speech in Berlin, Mr Moon said dialogue with the North was more pressing than ever and called for a peace treaty to be signed. He said such dialogue was crucial for those who seek the end of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme. However, the North's frequent missile tests, including the most recent one of an intercontinental ballistic missile, are in consistent violation of UN resolutions and have alarmed its neighbours and the US. Is latest test a game-changer? What can the world do about N Korea? How advanced is its nuclear programme? South Korea's Vice Defence Minister Suh Choo-suk told a media briefing that talks could be held at Tongilgak, a North Korean building in the Panmunjom compound in the demilitarised zone between the two countries, which was used to host previous talks. He proposed that the talks be held on 21 July, and said: ""We expect a positive response from the North."" South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon also urged the restoration of communication hotlines between the two Koreas, cut last year after a North Korean nuclear test. The BBC's Karen Allen in Seoul says the ultimate aim of these talks would be to end the military confrontation that has dominated relations between the two Koreas for decades. But it could begin with confidence-building measures such as ending the infamous loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border, she says. The Red Cross and the government have also proposed a separate meeting, aimed at discussing how to hold reunions of families separated by the Korean War, which ended in 1953. But analysts say these could be highly fraught with Pyongyang still angry at the South's unwillingness to repatriate high-profile defectors.

"This video can not be played Noel Conway: 'I want to be able to say goodbye at the right time' The High Court has begun hearing the legal challenge of a terminally ill UK man who wants the right to die. Noel Conway, who is 67 and has motor neurone disease, wants a doctor to be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose when his health deteriorates further. He said he wanted to say goodbye to loved ones ""at the right time, not to be in a zombie-like condition suffering both physically and psychologically"". Any doctor who helped him to die would face up to 14 years in prison. Mr Conway was too weak to attend the court in person. His lawyer, Richard Gordon QC, told the High Court in London that Mr Conway faced a stark choice either to seek to bring about his own death now whilst still physically able to do so, or await death with no control over how and when it comes. Mr Gordon said the change to the law that Mr Conway wanted would apply only to adults who are terminally ill with less than six months to live and who have a settled wish to die. Mr Conway, of Shrewsbury, told the BBC: ""I will be quadriplegic. I could be virtually catatonic and conceivably be in a locked-in syndrome - that to me would be a living hell. That prospect is one I cannot accept."" MPs reject 'right to die' law British man dies at Dignitas centre Assisted dying debate: The key questions Mr Conway, a retired college lecturer, was once fit and active but motor neurone disease is gradually destroying all strength in his muscles. He cannot walk and increasingly relies on a ventilator to help him breathe.  As his disease progresses, he fears becoming entombed in his body. Before his illness Noel Conway was a keen skier, climber and cyclist Mr Conway is being supported by the campaign group Dignity in Dying, but the issue polarises opinion. Baroness Jane Campbell - a disability rights campaigner - says changing the law would send all the wrong signals. The last major challenge to the law was turned down by the Supreme Court three years ago. This video can not be played Lord Falconer describes the assisted dying law as ""absolutely outrageous"" on Radio 4's Today It ruled that while judges could interpret the law it was up to Parliament to decide whether to change it. In 2015 MPs rejected proposals to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, in their first vote on the issue in almost 20 years. Supporters of the current legislation say it exists to protect the weak and vulnerable from being exploited or coerced. The case is expected to take up to four days. Assisted suicide - helping or encouraging another person to kill themselves - is illegal under English law. Under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) for England and Wales, it is punishable by up to 14 year's imprisonment. In Scotland, helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution. There have been severalunsuccessful attempts to change the law, as well as some high-profile cases that have challenged it. 2001: Diane Pretty, who had motor neurone disease, fought a long, and unsuccessfully, legal battle to win the right for her to end her life. She took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that her husband should be given immunity from prosecution should he help her to die. She lost and died at a hospice near her home in 2002. Debbie Purdy had multiple sclerosis 2009: Debbie Purdy, who had multiple sclerosis, won a landmark ruling in 2009 when the courts agreed that it was a breach of her human rights not to know whether her husband would be prosecuted if he accompanied her to a Swiss clinic where she could end her life. That prompted Keir Starmer - the then Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales - to publish guidelines setting out what was taken into consideration when weighing up a prosecution. Debbie died in a hospice in England in 2014. Tony Nicklinson, before his illness 2012: Two men suffering from locked-in syndrome lost their legal fight to be helped to die. Tony Nicklinson and a man known only as Martin - both left paralysed after a stroke - had argued that doctors should be allowed to end their lives without punishment. Martin argued that the DPP policy on encouraging or assisted suicide was not clear enough for people such as carers to know how they could provide assistance without the risk of being prosecuted. Tony Nicklinson died in August 2012 after refusing food. 2016: The family of deceased locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson and paralysed road accident victim Paul Lamb lose their right-to-die challenges at the European Court of Human rights. They campaigned that disabled people should have the right to be helped to die with dignity.

"Camilla wore a navy dress coat by designer Fiona Clare An official portrait of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall has been unveiled, ahead of Camilla's 70th birthday on Monday. The photograph, taken in May, shows Charles and Camilla in the morning room of their London home, Clarence House. Photographer Mario Testino described the duchess as a ""beautiful person"". The duchess celebrated her birthday over the weekend with a private party at the couple's family home, Highgrove House, in Gloucestershire. Testino, known forhis glamorous shots of the rich and famous,first captured Charles and Camilla in 2006 for their first wedding anniversary, on an assignment for Vogue. The Peruvian photographer said that when he first met Camilla, more than a decade ago, he ""discovered a kind and beautiful person with a wonderful sense of humour"". He added: ""I'm honoured to document their royal highnesses the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall on this very important date."" Testino is something of a family favourite. He took Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge's official engagement photos in 2010, and has also taken official photographs of both Prince George and Princess Charlotte.
