"Killing Eve season two picks up where season one ended, which is to sayâ¦ badly. After seven faultless episodes, the grand finale of the best TV series of 2018 was almost as underwhelming as Eve Polastri's marriage. All the delicious ingredients of the previous shows were still there (excellent acting, writing, soundtrack, and directing), but someone tweaked the recipe and served up a bit of dog's dinner with a distinctly hammy whiff. The smell lingers well into the opening episode of the new series, which is a little too knowing and, on occasion, close to becoming a pastiche of itself. Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is too predictable, Eve (Sandra Oh) is too wrung out, and Niko her husband, too needy. Thankfully, Fiona Shaw shows the way with understated class and intelligence, as Eve's boss Carolyn. Fiona Shaw as the ruthless spy chief, Carolyn Martens, who has a tricky relationship with Eve The action begins 30 seconds after the last season finished. M16 agent Eve is standing on the staircase of assassin Villanelle's Parisian apartment. She is holding the bloody knife with which she stabbed the ruthless Russian psycho-killer, who has played her party trick and disappeared into thin air. Sandra Oh says agent Eve Polastri goes to ""a psychologically dark place"" in the second series Filming the scene where assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) tries to hail a taxi, moments after being stabbed There's a lot of hyperventilating and many a furrowed brow. That's on screen, and maybe off it as well in the writers' room. The daunting task facing Emerald Fennell and her scriptwriting collaborators was how to pick up where Phoebe Waller-Bridge left off and somehow re-juice a dried up drama. The mutual obsession between Eve and Villanelle, which is the key dramatic device driving the story, had climaxed at the end of season one in a disappointingly limp stand-off followed by a dull heart-to-heart and a half-baked fight. It put the show into intensive care, which is where Villanelle soon fetches up while Eve heads back to London to try to fix her marriage and find a new job. Villanelle, still in her pyjamas, leaves hospital sooner than she should after being treated for her injuries The quality of the acting, our investment in the characters, and some quickly laid new plotlines are enough to entice you to watch the second 40-minute episode. At which point Killing Eve returns gloriously to form, with a funny, clever script that starts to rebuild the sexual tension between agent and assassin. The two remain infatuated with each other but now there is some added spice. Villanelle has competition for Eve's attentions and it ain't coming from Niko. That's the hook, not the mysterious baddies The Twelve, who any one of the protagonists could belong to for all we know - or care. Needless to say, Villanelle still murders people with the regularity and sensitivity of an automated phone call asking if you've been in a car crash, but the killings are a side show. Owen McDonnell is back as Eve's long-suffering husband, Niko Sean Delaney plays Kenny Stowton, who is a loyal part of Eve's team, and Carolyn's son The real drama is in the relationships between the players: Carolyn and her son Kenny (Sean Delaney). Eve and Niko. Villanelle and her handlers. And, of course, between Eve and Villanelle. Will they get it together? Will one kill the other? Can a cold-blooded murderer become a vulnerable, compassionate human being? In other words, the same issues that kept us on tenterhooks in season one. It fell short. Will season two be better and succeed in delivering its punchline? You can find out later on Saturday when the entire series drops on the BBC iPlayer. I've seen the first four and my hopes are high. Killing Eve is top quality television. And not just from a British standpoint, it ranks with the very best shows coming out of Hollywood. It's no surprise the head of Netflix has cited it as the one title he truly covets. That it is superbly made is a given in these golden days of box office box sets. But that's not what makes it stand out; it is not the reason that Killing Eve will sit alongside Friends and Breaking Bad as an all-time TV classic. It is the balance it strikes between bone-dry humour reminiscent of the best of early James Bond, and an exploration of identity, sexuality, and isolation in the second decade of the 21st Century. Fiona Shaw, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Jodie Comer all won Baftas for Killing Eve For this, much of the credit must go to Luke Jennings, the Observer's dance critic. For Villanelle is his creation. He originally self-published the story as a series of online novellas before it was picked up by a canny TV producer. Once it had been commissioned for telly Jennings had his work cut out to do his day job while collaborating with Waller-Bridge on the television scripts, ""I felt like Stalin, planning murder all day and watching Swan Lake in the evening,"" he wrote in the Observer last year. His background in ballet provides an interesting insight into his creation. The juxtaposition between beauty and the beast is what makes Killing Eve so compelling. As does the not-always merry dance he takes us on. You could argue that Jennings has written the most brilliant, exquisitely choreographed, blood-soaked pas de deux.

"This video can not be played The crew of the USS Chancellorsville had a close-up view of the Admiral Vinogradov (video from 2019) A Russian warship and a US warship have come close to collision in the western Pacific Ocean, with each side blaming the other for the incident. Russia's Pacific Fleet said the cruiser USS Chancellorsville crossed just 50m (160ft) in front of the destroyer Admiral Vinogradov at 06:35 Moscow time (03:35 GMT). It was forced to perform ""emergency manoeuvring"" to avoid the US ship. But US forces blamed the Russians, claiming their ship was responsible. US Seventh Fleet Commander Clayton Doss called the Russians ""unsafe and unprofessional"", saying their destroyer ""made an unsafe manoeuvre against USS Chancellorsville"". He dismissed the Russian allegation as ""propaganda"". Another US Navy image showed the Russian destroyer Admiral Vinogradov (l) close to the USS Chancellorsville Admiral Vinogradov came within 50 to 100 feet (15m-30m) of the USS Chancellorsville in the Philippine Sea, the US said. The Russian Pacific Fleet meanwhile said the incident took place in the southeast of the East China Sea, and added they had sent a message of protest to the US ship's commanders. In a statement it said the US warship had ""suddenly changed direction and crossed the path of Admiral Vinogradov just 50m away,"" forcing the Russian crew to make a quick manoeuvre. This video can not be played The US Navy posted this video of its plane being intercepted by a Russian jet The US said later that it would lodge a formal diplomatic complaint, or demarche, with Russia over its warship's movements. ""We'll have military-to-military conversations with the Russians, and of course we'll demarche them,"" acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters. Both countries regularly accuse the other of dangerous military manoeuvres - at sea and in the air. In November, the US posted footage of a Russian jet intercepting one of its planes over the Black Sea - a move they called ""irresponsible"", but which the Russians said was to stop ""a violation of Russian airspace"". By Jonathan Marcus, BBC  defence and diplomatic correspondent Two warships; two narratives - but one very real chance of accident or potential injury. There is simply no reason for vessels of this size to be in such close proximity. One of them - or maybe even both - was at fault. Both sides blame the other. But this kind of incident is becoming ever more frequent and it does generally seem to be the result of a concerted policy by Russia to challenge US and its allies naval operations whenever possible. Often these incidents occur in the Black Sea which Moscow sometimes regards as its own lake; a view with which other states on its shores - some of them Nato members, or aspiring Nato members - disagree. Such incidents between the US and Russia are less frequent in Asian-Pacific waters, where the tensions tend to be between US and Chinese ships or aircraft. But wherever it occurs naval brinkmanship of this kind is dangerous and unnecessary.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: How the PM fought through Brexit battles Theresa May has officially stepped down as the leader of the Conservative Party, but will remain as prime minister until her successor is chosen. She has handed in her private resignation letter to the backbench 1922 Committee, two weeks after announcing her intention to leave. Eleven Conservative MPs are vying to replace her as party leader and, ultimately, prime minister. The winner of the contest is expected to be announced in the week of 22 July. Mrs May, who has said it was a matter of deep regret that she had been unable to deliver Brexit, remains acting party leader during the leadership election process. Meanwhile,the Conservatives fell to third place in the Peterborough by-election, behind winners Labour and the Brexit Party in second place, in what is traditionally a Tory-Labour marginal seat.

The UK was originally meant to leave the European Union on 29 March but that was then pushed back to 12 April and eventually 31 October. When Mrs May announced her resignation, she said it was time for a new prime minister to try to deliver Brexit. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said Mrs May is expected to announce a number of domestic policies before her final departure, with sources saying she is aiming for an announcement a week on issues like the environment and women in the workplace.

The committee said it was now inviting nominations from those Conservative MPs ""who wish to stand for election as the next party leader"". Leadership nominations close at 17:00 on Monday, a statement said. By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check Constitutionally speaking, Theresa May keeps the same powers. But in the eyes of MPs she may lack the authority to introduce any radical policies between now and handing the reins over to a new prime minister. While Mrs May is still free to make policy or funding announcements, any pledges would eventually need to be made into law. According to Catherine Haddon, from the Institute for Government think tank, there's no guarantee MPs would give Mrs May's announcements the green light - especially with such a small working majority. Aside from policy, Mrs May will continue to represent the UK abroad and she is still free to make public appointments and make changes to her team of ministers. She will be able reward some of those she has worked with - including knighthoods and appointments to the House of Lords. But the resignation honours listhas been controversial in the past- so it will be interesting to see how many appointments Mrs May makes. Leadership candidates need eight MPs to back them. MPs will then vote for their preferred candidates in a series of secret ballots held on 13, 18, 19 and 20 June. The final two will be put to a vote of members of the wider Conservative Party from 22 June, with the winner expected to be announced about four weeks later. Speaking to BBC Politics Live, leadership contender Sam Gyimah said he had considered dropping out of the Conservative Party leadership race but insisted he would ""get to the starting line"" by Monday. Three of his rivals, former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, former Government Chief Whip Mark Harper and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, have also said they have the eight nominations needed. While the contest does not officially start until Mrs May steps down, candidates have already been jostling for position. How the next prime minister gets a Brexit deal through Parliament andwhether they would countenance a no-deal exithas been the dominant question of the campaign so far. The winner of the contest to lead the Conservative Party will become the next prime minister. Who has declared and who still might? Where does each candidate stand on Brexit? Dominic Raab's suggestion at a hustings on Wednesday that he would be prepared to shut down Parliament - the process known as prorogation - to ensure the UK leaves the EU on 31 October has been criticised by his rivals. And Commons Speaker John Bercow said on Thursday it was ""simply not going to happen"". Conservative leadership contender Michael Gove has said the UK must not be bound by a ""fixed"" date if it needs slightly more time to get a deal. Others, such as Mr Raab and Boris Johnson, insist the UK must leave on 31 October, whether it has approved a deal with Brussels or not. Reality Check: Did May solve her seven burning injustices? Former trade minister Lord Digby Jones has called on Mrs May's successor to provide more ""stability"" for UK businesses over Brexit. He told the BBC'sWake Up to Moneyprogramme that they should ensure the UK leaves the EU on 31 October, ""preferably with a deal - but without a deal rather than not coming out"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I don't know who the new leader is going to be, but it seems to be a choice between no deal, no deal and no deal, as far as I can understand it.""

"Eliza and Poppy filled 12 bags with litter on their canal boat holiday The Canal and River Trust claims waterways could be free of litter within a year if visitors each pick up one piece of rubbish. Here are some people who are doing more than their fair share. ""If everyone did their little bit, the world would be a better place,"" said nine-year-old Poppy. She and her sister Eliza, seven, spent an hour a day picking litter during their canal boat holiday in Shropshire, ending their excursion with 12 bags of rubbish. Crisp packets, sweet wrappers and bottles were their most common finds, a scene replicated on waterways across England. The Canal and River Trust has saidit is ""on a mission to eradicate plastic"", as canals and rivers act as ""plastic highways"". Dan Perry, the co-founder ofRage Against Rubbish,external, agrees -with single-use plastics a major concern for many. He said he had seen eels trapped inside discarded bottles and swans fashioning nests from plastic bags, not to mention the harm to animals ""ingesting micro-plastics"". Rage Against Rubbish volunteers carry out a litter pick once a month His group, which meets one Saturday a month for three hours, was formed in April 2018 after he and his friends decided to tackle the amount of litter they spotted while kayaking on the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal. ""It was only when we began to quantify the litter and saw our boats full of rubbish that we realised just how big a problem it was,"" he said. Rage Against Rubbish attracts between 30 and 50 volunteers, some in the water and others on land. Mr Perry said some of the litter could be accidental, caused by seagulls pulling rubbish out of bins or the wind blowing recycling, but much of it would be people actively discarding items ""thinking it is someone else's problem to sort out"". One outing saw the group collect 4,500 individual items of litter, while discoveries have ranged from food wrappings and bottles to shopping trolleys and a set of temporary traffic lights. He said: ""I'm not sure we will ever fully cure it but I do think when people see our flotilla of canoes it does have an impact. ""I think it does get people thinking differently, the real impact is going to come through people changing their habits."" One outing saw the Rage Against Rubbish volunteers collect 4,500 items of litter Seeing the efforts made by volunteers to clear up the towpaths in Birmingham has resulted in a reduction in littering, according to Tom Wilding, co-ordinator of Our Wild in Birmingham. The group, which meets every Wednesday, started clearing overgrown hedges, picking litter and planting plants along a 1.2-mile (2km) stretch of the city centre canal in January 2018. He said: ""I think what we are doing is showing people that we are looking after these patches of land and something is happening, we want people to feel some ownership of these areas."" The Canal and River Trust runs anumber of Towpath Taskforces across the country,external. The trust is also encouraging visitors to the waterways to pick up just one piece of litter, although anything that appears hazardous or dangerous should not be touched. Such items can bereported to the trust,external. Keep Britain Tidy alsooffers a number of volunteering schemes,external. A similar scheme takes place on the first Friday of every month in Oxford. The city's Towpath Taskforce tackles ""anything that upsets the towpath,"" according to co-ordinator Sonny King. Their last three-hour clean-up led to the removal of 24 bags of litter from a one-mile length of the canal. In Leeds, a local roller derby team joined the effort by skating along the towpath picking up litter. Cait Price said: ""We enjoy skating down this canal path and really wanted to do something to help. We picked up all sorts of rubbish."" Members of the Leeds Roller Derby team carried out a litter pick Watersurveying firm APEM,externalhas also picked up all sorts of rubbish, including an inflatable sheep and blow-up guitar from the River Irwell near Manchester. The firm's consultants have collected 175 bags of rubbish since March, and are donating money for each one to environmental charities. Divisional director Peter Dennis said he launched the scheme after spotting agricultural plastic in a waterway in North Wales. He said: ""It just looked awful and I knew it was destined for the sea, the only way of preventing that was if I picked it out."" Raising awareness is key, he said, because ""preventing this stuff from getting in the river in the first place is better than having to deal with it once it is there or has gone out to sea"". ""It's just a sensible thing to be doing,"" he added. APEM consultants have found an array of objects in the River Irwell 'Mission to eradicate' plastic in canals Canal crusaders clean up waterways.

"Mr Trump praised both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in his joint press conference with Mrs May As President Trump leaves the UK on the final day of the US state visit, what can we say we have learned from the last three days? Whisper it quietly, but the capacity of the president to shock appears to be waning. His visit resulted in much diplomatic carnage - the row with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan; the pre-trip newspaper interviews advising on Brexit - but little seemed unexpected, as if Mr Trump was following a script with which we are now familiar. In pictures: Trump's final day of UK state visit Donald Trump clarifies comments about 'nasty' Meghan Khan: Trump 'acting like an 11-year-old' There were the usual half-lies - the numbers protesting against his visit, about the extent of US-UK trade. There were the abrupt policy changes over whether or not the NHS would be involved in any future trade deal. And there was the unapologetic advice about who our next prime minister should be, and what policy he or she should adopt over Brexit. But few appeared to be surprised by this. People will continue to approve or disapprove of Mr Trump, depending on their viewpoint, but somehow the phenomenon that is Trumpism has become normal. There were fewerprotesters on the streetsthan last time. The president, in turn, showed he could do modest, conducting a news conference with less bombast than usual where he praised Theresa May's handling of Brexit. He even managed to get through an entire day with the royal family without breaking protocol. This visit seemed to show that for all the reservations some may feel, Britain is beginning to realise that Mr Trump is here to stay and it had better get used to him. British diplomats can hardly contain their relief and pleasure that the state visit went off with hardly a foot wrong. ""We showed we can still do it,"" one told me. In pictures: Trump's state visit to the UK The marching bands, the scarlet Grenadiers, the grandeur of the state banquet, the pomp, the pageantry and the royals, the royals! One senior official described the Queen as ""our secret weapon"". She is clearly one of the few people in the world who can inspire awe in President Trump: the sheer weight of her experience, longevity and acquaintance with eleven of his predecessors placing a lid on the braggadocio - at least for a moment or two. The Queen gave a speech at the state banquet on Monday night Only she could have got away with using her banquet speech to deliver a firm message about the importance of the post-war international institutions that Mr Trump distrusts. This was followed by a successful piece of diplomacy by the UK in getting the president to sign up to a joint D-Day proclamation with 15 other countries in favour of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law. Did the Queen call out Trump at the state banquet? The aim was to use the occasion once again to remind Mr Trump of the importance of the international rules-based order and the crucial role the transatlantic relationship has played in that. But for all the backslapping among Britain's diplomats, there is still the risk that the success of the state visit and D-Day commemorations is used to cover up the UK's relative weakness, the vain hope that a display of ceremonial prowess with echoes of past military glory can somehow correct the international damage the Brexit debate has inflicted on Britain's reputation overseas. ...but will it be seen as a high-water mark for the special relationship? At the start of the week British officials emphasised that the D-Day commemorations were the thing that mattered and that the long-delayed state visit was happening only because of the anniversary. What were the D-Day landings? 10 things you might not know about D-Day It would be a moment that really mattered - a reminder of the shared sacrifice that formed the foundation of the US-UK relationship. The danger is that the history and the memories simply put in sharp focus the realisation that the world has moved on, that we are now in a new century where the transatlantic relationship is less central than before. The focus now is on China and the new bipolar world. The UK has used this visit to remind the president of the importance of the transatlantic relationship, something Britain will need even more once it leaves the European Union. Mr Trump sat next to the Queen during the D-Day commemorations But Mr Trump has given no evidence that his transactional, bilateral view of world affairs has changed, and that alliances are based not on past nostalgia but current interests. He made it clear that future trade talks with Britain would be hard. He had no compunction in dismissing Jeremy Corbyn as a ""negative force"", a man who as leader of the opposition could one day face him across the table in Downing Street. It was noticeable, too, how many Conservative leadership contenders were willing to challenge openly Mr Trump's promise - since revoked - to include the NHS in any future trade deal. Trump rows back on NHS trade remarks In other words, for all the talk of a special relationship, our future prime minister (whoever he or she will be) was quite happy to define themselves against the US president, even when Mr Trump was in Britain as an honoured guest of the Queen. Ahead of the state visit, there was much commentary suggesting there would be a row over Britain's attitude towards the Chinese telecoms giant. The US believes the firm is too close to the Chinese state. And when the UK suggested it might be possible for Huawei to provide part of its future 5G phone network, there were grim warnings that the US might as a result restrict the intelligence it shares with Britain. US-China trade war in 300 words How damaging is the Huawei row for the US and China? Yet this seems to have been the dog that did not bark over the last few days. President Trump declared that ""we are going to be able to work out any differences"" and ""we will have no problem with that."" So what reassured him? British officials deny that any decision has been made, let alone communicated to Mr Trump. But clearly the UK's promise that the security of its intelligence network will be paramount in any decision has gone a long way to take the heat out of this row. And the reason this matters is because intelligence is a core element of the UK-US relationship, and any potential threat to that relationship would matter. We should not forget that only recently Mr Trump repeated his claim that British intelligence agencies spied on his election campaign in 2016. Theresa May is prime minister and will remain so until such time that the Conservative party elects her successor at the end of July. Yet her imminent departure hung over this visit like a thin mist. Donald Trump felt able to joke about it,telling her publicly: ""I don't know exactly what your timing is but stick around, let's do this (trade) deal"". The president appeared to spend more time alone with Conservative leadership contenders than he did with the prime minister, holding a meeting with Jeremy Hunt, chatting to Michael Gove at the state banquet and having a 20 minute phone call with Boris Johnson. This video can not be played President Trump gave his opinion on three Tory leadership hopefuls Mr Trump also met other Brexiteer politicians such as Brexit party leader Nigel Farage and the former Conservative cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. During his news conference, Mr Trump felt able to praise both Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt, and even cheekily asked the foreign secretary whether Mr Gove might make a good prime minister. On one level this was extraordinary, an astonishingly rude intervention in the domestic politics of another country. But Mrs May is such a lame duck that Mr Trump got away with it. She, in turn, felt more able to be explicit about her differences with the president, whether on Iran or China, warning him about the benefits of ""cooperation and compromise"". But Donald Trump knows that Britain's approach to Brexit, trade and China will be decided by Mrs May's successor, and neither side could disguise the fact.

I'm not going to lie, I'm petrified."" Lisa Valentine's son, Bradleigh, has a potentially fatal nut allergy, so the first time she watches him being fed some peanut will be a leap of faith. The six-year-old's family, from Wrexham, are hoping he can take part in a ground-breaking trial to reduce his sensitivity with tiny doses of peanut. Lisa admits ""it's a risk"" but says that for Bradleigh and their family, it could transform their lives. Birthday parties, holidays and eating out are normal and exciting events in the lives of most children while growing up. But none of it is simple for Bradleigh. Fearing any contact with products containing nuts could trigger a reaction or even cause him to have an anaphylactic shock, Lisa takes precautions. ""We can't just go and just eat here or there - we can't do that and we will never do that,"" she says. ""We won't go on holiday... we won't go on an aeroplane because we don't want to put him at risk."" Bradleigh's family hope that an immunotherapy trial could change everything But the family hope the immunotherapy trial could change everything. ""Our lives would be completely different,"" says Lisa. ""If it worked, I don't think I would buy him a bag of peanuts, but I don't think we'd scrutinise the 'may contain', which would mean that we could go to the supermarket and just put things in."" Around 2-4% of children in the UK have a peanut allergy, according to recent figures. Currently, most peanut allergy therapies involve using tiny amounts of carefully prepared peanut flour. But as it can be expensive, it may never be available on the NHS. Easyjet bans nuts on all flights Nut allergy woman home after five years Extreme allergies: 'I couldn't even eat an apple' Researchers at Imperial College London are hoping that using boiled peanuts could be a more cost-effective and safer option. Paediatric allergist and immunologist Dr Paul Turner, responsible for the trial at St Mary's Hospital, London, says: ""We're trying to look at different ways - cheaper ways - of doing this sort of treatment safely, that would also be affordable in the context of the NHS."" Following the first trial, all patients who completed a year of the boiled nut therapy were able to tolerate eating six to eight peanuts without experiencing significant symptoms. Dr Turner, who developed the idea while working abroad in Australia, said it had been very successful. ""Colleagues of mine had noticed that some children from south east Asia were allergic to peanut butter, which is made out of roasted peanuts, but not boiled peanut soup,"" he said. ""That got us thinking, what happens when you boil peanuts that makes it less allergic in some people?"" Dr Paul Turner, Paediatric Allergist and Immunologist at St Mary's Hospital, London is responsible for the trial Boiling peanuts reduces the amount of the peanut protein that triggers the immune system to react in an allergic reaction. As part of this novel immunotherapy trial, patients are given small doses of boiled peanuts over an extended period of time. Despite the trial being conducted in a strictly controlled environment by trained researches, Lisa is still concerned about the potential impact of feeding Bradleigh peanuts. ""It's risky, isn't it? Every time, every other week, that he has that little bit more - or it might be the first time - he could have an anaphylactic shock,"" she said. ""As much as you think he's going to be in a controlled environment where the hospital can save him, what if they can't? ""You do worry as a mum - you are going to worry about those kinds of things, so it is risky. But it could change his life."" To participate in the trial, Lisa will have to travel with Bradleigh from Wrexham to London every other week and stay in the city overnight. Although it may be expensive, the family have decided to ""find a way of doing it, whatever it would take"". They have also been helped by friends and family who've been raising money. Lynne Regent, the chief executive of the Anaphylaxis Campaign, welcomes the potential of this type of treatment. ""I think it's fantastic. If people are affected by severe food allergies, at the moment, really the only path they can take is avoidance and also carrying their rescue medication,"" she said. Parents are being warned by the researchers not attempt to self-medicate their children or attempt this type of therapy themselves. They're hoping that their own trial may lead to a cost-effective and safe treatment being available on the NHS, which could transform the lives of thousands of children and young people.

"Millions of people will be tuning in to see England take on Spain in the Women's World Cup final. The tournament in Australia and New Zealand has so far seen more than 1.7 million tickets sold and has been the highest-profile women's football competition yet. It's the latest peak in a growing interest in the women's game, which has been building up over the last few years - after decades in the shadow of men's football. But it wasn't always like that - at one time, the sport flourished in England. Matches pulled in huge crowds - sometimes more than 50,000 people. But then the women's game was effectively banned, with the FA at the time saying the game of football was ""quite unsuitable for females"". It was another half century until women's football got back on its feet - and that's one reason it lags behind the men's game today. Lily Parr throwing a javelin during training Lily Parr was a winger and one of the first female professional players. She played for the Dick, Kerr's Ladies team which got its name from the munitions factory in Preston where most of the team worked during World War One. They were the first women's team to play wearing shorts, and the first to go on an overseas tour. Lily was also a smoker, which led to rumours her wages were supplemented by packets of Woodbine cigarettes. In 2002, she became the first woman to be inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame - and she recently becamethe first female footballer to be commemorated with a statue. The Dick, Kerr's Ladies team take on the French Ladies International team at Herne Hill, London There was a huge growth in women's football during the war when women were called upon to do factory jobs left by the men who had gone to fight. On Christmas Day in 1917, 10,000 spectators watched two women's teams playing at Preston. And when Dick, Kerr's Ladies played St Helen's Ladies on Boxing Day 1920 they pulled in a crowd of 53,000 at Everton's Goodison Park ground, with thousands more fans locked outside. Play during the Theatrical Ladies Football match at Tottenham, north London, in 1912 On 5 December 1921, the Football Association banned women from playing on FA-affiliated pitches which meant stars like Lily Parr could no longer play at grounds with spectator facilities. The FA at the time said ""the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged"". Preston Ladies training in 1939 Joan Briggs, England centre forward, training in July 1959 In 1971 the ban was finally lifted following the formation of the Women's Football Association (WFA) a couple of years earlier. Girls playing in 1970, a year before the effective ban on women playing in professional stadiums was lifted The Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 made it easier for women to train to become professional referees. This video can not be played A profile of Joan Briggs, ""celebrated star of the ladies' soccer world"". It has always been pretty tough to watch women's football on television with the first TV reports of the Women's FA Cup final results in the 1970s. In 1989 Channel 4 started to provide regular coverage of women's football. And the FA outlined its plans to develop the women's game from grassroots to elite level in 1997. The England team in 1997, when the FA set out a new mission to develop the women's game It was only in 2018 that the Women's Super League (WSL) became fully professional. Now, the latest figures show 3.4 million women and girls play football in England. The Euro 2022 final drew a record crowd of 87,192 at Wembley, where England beat Germany  to win their first major women's tournament. There has since been growing investment, meaning better salaries and longer contracts for women. When it comes to those watching on TV in the UK, England's World Cup semi-final against Australia was the most watched of the tournament so far, with a peak audience of 7.3 million. A version of this article was published in 2019. The Women's World Cup final between England and Spain on Sunday will be shown live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website from 09:45 BST.

"Khuram Butt booked a trip to Turkey, but his wife, Zahrah Rehman, told an inquest she feared he would go on to Syria The older brother of the leader of the London Bridge attack has apologised on behalf of his family, saying he is sorry ""from the depths of his heart"". Addressing the families of the eight people who were killed, Saad Butt said if he could turn back time he would change places with every one of them. At the inquest into their deaths, he said his brother, Khuram, had been ""the life and soul of the party"". But he developed extreme views after becoming angry over events in Syria. Over the last four years he had become increasingly angry, Saad Butt told the inquest, over ""foreign policy, the wars, the injustices overseas"". These ""created the disgust in my brother's heart to the place which gave my brother safety,"" Mr Butt, a youth worker, said, adding: ""Only God knows what he was thinkingâ¦ We were from the same womb but we are different people."" Butt, 27, and two accomplices mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge with a rented van before stabbing people in nearby Borough Market on 3 June 2017. All three men were shot dead by police less than 10 minutes after the violence began. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Mr Butt told the inquest: ""Sorry. Sorry from the depths of my heart, and on behalf of my family. ""If I could turn back time I would change places with every one of you, even if it meant losing my life to my own brother."" The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden The Old Bailey heard that the family had intervened in February 2015 to take away Khuram Butt's passport and that of his wife and baby boy because they were worried he would take them to join the Islamic State group in Syria. The attacker's wife,Zahrah Rehman, told the inquest previouslyhe had booked tickets to Turkey - but she had alerted her family because she was afraid he would try to take them on to Syria from there. ""He wanted to fight the armed forces on behalf of Isis,"" said Saad Butt, but he said they persuaded him to drop his plans. After that, Mr Butt said he continued monitoring his brother's activities but never contacted counter-terror officers. Mr Butt, who had carried out anti-extremism work with the government, said he felt ""competent"" supervising his brother. There was nothing his brother was doing that indicated he should contact the authorities, he said. ""He was on their radar,"" he told the inquest. ""He was reported by two family members on two different occasions in 2015. ""I'm not a Prevent [a strand of the government's counter-terror strategy] officer. What did MI5 do about him?"" Keiligh Baker, BBC News The court fell silent as Butt's brother, Saad, sobbed as he read out a statement he had written, addressed to the families of the victims. At several points he had to pause to audibly collect himself before continuing with the speech. He also described a dream he had had in the April before the attack in which Butt appeared at his place of work, a youth centre, wearing a suicide belt. Crying, he said: ""He was clean shaven and his lips were blue. ""Just as he was about to detonate I hugged him. I hugged him to stop him from hurting people. ""But we cannot turn back time."" Mr Butt also told the court he did not know his brother had appeared in a Channel 4 documentary called the Jihadis Next Door in 2016 - a time when he was grieving over the death of his daughter who was killed in an accident. When asked whether it was surprising that he had not been made aware of the programme, which showed his brother associating with extremists, he replied: ""My daughter died because of third degree burns and I think, as far as the family was concerned, that was the least of my worries. ""Me and my wife totally collapsed."" The inquest was shown an image of 14 men at a barbecue held outside Khuram Butt's flat He also described a barbecue before the attack at which a friend of his brother stuck a skewer into some meat and said: ""That is how you gut a Kuffar"" - an unbeliever. The event was organised by Khuram Butt to celebrate the birth of his second child, a daughter. The inquest was shown a photo of 14 men praying outside his flat on the day. Two of the 14 men - Butt and one of his accomplices, Rachid Redouane - would carry out the London Bridge attack three weeks later. Breaking down into tears, Mr Butt described the early hours of the Sunday morning after the attack, when he realised what his brother had done. ""His daughter was only one month at the time,"" he said. ""Only God knows what he was thinking."" Those who died were: Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39.

"Private astronauts will be permitted up to 30 days' travel to the ISS Nasa is to allow tourists to visit the International Space Station from 2020, priced at $35,000 (Â£27,500) per night. The US space agency said it would open the orbiting station to tourism and other business ventures. There will be up to two short private astronaut missions per year, said Robyn Gatens, the deputy director of the ISS. Nasa said that private astronauts would be permitted to travel to the ISS for up to 30 days, travelling on US spacecraft.

The two companies hired by Nasa are Elon Musk's SpaceX, which will use its Dragon capsule, and Boeing, which is building a spacecraft called the Starliner.

Nasa does not own the station however - it was built, beginning in 1998, with Russia, which has taken a more relaxed approach in recent decades to commerce.

"The boss of UK book retailer Waterstones is being parachuted in to help the turnaround of giant US chain Barnes & Noble. James Daunt's appointment was announced as part of a takeover of Barnes & Noble by hedge fund Elliott Management, which already owns Waterstones. The deal values the largest US book chain, hit by the rise of online sites such as Amazon, at close to $700m. Elliott hopes Mr Daunt can repeat his turnaround of Waterstones. Mr Daunt said: ""Physical bookstores the world over face fearsome challenges from online and digital. We meet these with investment and with all the more confidence for being able to draw on the unrivalled bookselling skills of these two great companies."" He will be based in New York, but remain at the helm of Waterstones. Elliott bought a majority stake in Waterstones last year from Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut, who rescued the chain from near-collapse in 2011. Michelle Obama signs copies of her bestselling book at Barnes & Noble in New York City. Barnes & Noble has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1993. Its rapid growth and big-store format helped to sideline many independent booksellers. But the chain suffered after Amazon turned the market upside down, and Barnes & Noble's efforts to pull in a more tech-savvy audience with its Nook e-book reader failed to compete with the Kindle and other tablets. In 2014, Barnes & Noble closed its New York Fifth Avenue store - once the world's largest bookstore - and has faced declining sales for at least the past three years. It has about 627 outlets. Last year it made a loss of $137.7m before tax on sales of $3.6bn. Leonardo Riggio, founder and chairman of Barnes & Noble, said: ""We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Elliott, the owner of Waterstones, a bookseller I have admired over the years. ""In view of the success they have had in the bookselling marketplace, I believe they are uniquely suited to improve and grow our company for many years ahead."" Waterstones has faced its own challenge from Amazon, but it returned to profit in 2016 after six years of losses. Mr Daunt oversaw a big investment in the stores, concentrating on turning them into places to browse and organising more in-store events. He said Elliott's financial backing would allow him to invest in Barnes & Noble's store estate and ""make them look a bit nicer"".

"The boss of UK book retailer Waterstones is being parachuted in to help the turnaround of giant US chain Barnes & Noble. James Daunt's appointment was announced as part of a takeover of Barnes & Noble by hedge fund Elliott Management, which already owns Waterstones. The deal values the largest US book chain, hit by the rise of online sites such as Amazon, at close to $700m. Elliott hopes Mr Daunt can repeat his turnaround of Waterstones. Mr Daunt said: ""Physical bookstores the world over face fearsome challenges from online and digital. We meet these with investment and with all the more confidence for being able to draw on the unrivalled bookselling skills of these two great companies."" He will be based in New York, but remain at the helm of Waterstones. Elliott bought a majority stake in Waterstones last year from Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut, who rescued the chain from near-collapse in 2011. Michelle Obama signs copies of her bestselling book at Barnes & Noble in New York City. Barnes & Noble has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1993. Its rapid growth and big-store format helped to sideline many independent booksellers. But the chain suffered after Amazon turned the market upside down, and Barnes & Noble's efforts to pull in a more tech-savvy audience with its Nook e-book reader failed to compete with the Kindle and other tablets. In 2014, Barnes & Noble closed its New York Fifth Avenue store - once the world's largest bookstore - and has faced declining sales for at least the past three years. It has about 627 outlets. Last year it made a loss of $137.7m before tax on sales of $3.6bn. Leonardo Riggio, founder and chairman of Barnes & Noble, said: ""We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Elliott, the owner of Waterstones, a bookseller I have admired over the years. ""In view of the success they have had in the bookselling marketplace, I believe they are uniquely suited to improve and grow our company for many years ahead."" Waterstones has faced its own challenge from Amazon, but it returned to profit in 2016 after six years of losses.

But that's all from me tonight. The World Cup kicked off with a bang! I'm back for the Spain v South Africa match tomorrow. There's some incredible individual stories behind the South African team so I'm looking forward to seeing how they get on. See you then! Now that the World Cup is well and truly underway, we have three more games coming up tomorrow and you can follow them all on the BBC. First up isGermany v Chinaat 14:00 BST and you can watch that live from Rennes on BBC One, as well as following the live text.

Text 81111 (UK only). France have looked good in this game, but the next game is where they need to keep their composure. However, they are a top quality side and they deserve to go far in their own World Cup. Paul, Newmarket Rachel Brown-FinnisEx-England goalkeeper on BBC One Germany v China is probably the pick of the games on Saturday. Germany have gone under the radar a little bit and not been as stunning in terms of form and results as previous years so it will be good to see what their level is. Feast your eyes on these. Four goals, two headers and a peach of a curler.

both sides get through their groups and meet back here. They are two great attacking

France controlled the game and they have danger everywhere. The full-backs, the centre-backs, the wingers were devastating in the first-half and then they bring on Valerie Gauvin - she looked something special as well. This is a team who will be in the running to win this tournament - no doubt about it.

     China PR defeated Norway 0-4 in 1991. South Korea have lost six matches at the tournament, half of which have come against France (3). Eugenie

It looked like an adults v children game. FT: France 4-0 South Korea Tom GarryBBC Sport at Le Parc des Princes Both sets of players have set off on laps of honour. The South Korea fans behind one goal are waving their scarves in the air too. They've clearly enjoyed the spectacle regardless.

Down the middle Wendie Renard is not renowned as the fastest player and they do have spells where they switch-off. South Korea pressed higher in the second-half but they were too far off the French in the first-half and France showed how dominant and stunning they can be when you give them the ball.

France are top and where they are expected to be after the next two rounds of matches. France 4-0 South Korea Alex ScottEx-England international on BBC One Exactly what the fans wanted.

"People pitched up on plastic chairs outside Size on Carnaby Street Thousands of people queued for hours to get their hands on trainers designed by rapper Kanye West. Shoppers were waiting outside stores from midnight to grab a pair of Adidas Yeezy Boost 350s.

In Birmingham, long lines snaked outside of the Size shoe shop, on Lower Temple Street. One man in the queue told the BBC he had already been offered Â£300 by a friend who could not get to the store. Similarly long queues were seen outside Foot Locker in the Bullring, with a security guard urging people who were desperate to sneak a peek at the trainers not to rush when the doors opened.

Shoppers waited outside Union Street in Glasgow in a bid to get their hands on the trainers Queues were seen at Foot Locker on Oxford Street Professor Evanschitzky, from Aston Business School, said that while the limited nature of the stock and celebrity branding had an impact on sales, people sometimes queued for the experience.

"This video can not be played Peterborough chooses ""hope over fear"" - Jeremy Corbyn Labour has narrowly seen off a Brexit Party challenge to hold on to its Peterborough seat in a by-election. Union activist Lisa Forbes retained the constituency for Labour, taking 31% of the vote and beating the Brexit Party's Mike Greene (29%) by 683 votes. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called it an ""incredible"" win for the ""politics of hope over the politics of fear"". But Nigel Farage, who founded the Brexit Party less than two months ago, called its showing ""very significant"". The Conservatives came third with 21%, while the Liberal Democrats were fourth with 12%, followed by the Green Party on 3%. Fifteen candidates stood Turnout was 48.4%, down from 67.5% in the 2017 general election, when Labour beat the Tories by 607 votes Voters in Peterborough backed Leave by 61% to 39% in the 2016 EU referendum Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Tory big guns Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt visited the city during the hard-fought campaign Theresa May, who will officially resign as Conservative leader later, did not visit the constituency The Peterborough by-election was called after Fiona Onasanya - who won for Labour in 2017 but was convicted of lying over a speeding offence and thrown out of the party - became the first MP to be ousted under recall rules. In her victory speech, Ms Forbes said, to cheers from her supporters, that ""the politics of hope can win regardless of the odds"". ""Despite the differing opinions across our city, the fact that the Brexit Party have been rejected here in Peterborough shows that the politics of division will not win,"" she said. The Brexit Party had been the bookmakers' favourite to take the Cambridgeshire seat - which would have been its first at Westminster - following its success in the recent European elections. This video can not be played ""I'm pleased the Brexit Party didn't win"" The Labour leader challenged the next Tory leader to call an immediate general election Joining Labour's victory celebrations on a visit to the city, Mr Corbyn said: ""All the experts wrote Lisa Forbes off. All the experts wrote Labour off. Write Labour off at your peril."" The Labour leader said the party had triumphed due to its anti-austerity message and its opposition to a ""cliff-edge"" no-deal Brexit that would threaten jobs and investment. He challenged whoever succeeds Theresa May as Conservative leader to call an immediate general election. Despite the Brexit Party's failure to take the seat, leader Mr Farage said he was ""pretty buoyed"", as it had ""come from nowhere and produced a massive result"". He rejected claims that its focus on a single issue limited its appeal, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme we have a ""very strong, simple message that people believe in"". Mr Farage later handed in a letter to Downing Street calling for his party's MEPs to be included in the UK's Brexit negotiating team. He told reporters he believed the NHS should be included in future US trade negotiations despite the political outcry when Donald Trump raised the possibility earlier this week - comments which the US president subsequently appeared to row back on. The Brexit Party has made a huge impression - but history is written by the winners. Had Nigel Farage's party actually won this narrowly, he would have had much more momentum to argue not just to get Brexit done by the end of October, but to have huge influence potentially over how the Conservatives choose their leader. Had Labour lost narrowly, there would have been a big demand from the rank and file for Jeremy Corbyn to sharpen his Brexit act and to call for a referendum under all circumstances. That has not happened either. The conclusion that the Labour leadership is drawing from this is that people actually wanted to talk about things other than Brexit. By talking about council cuts, crime, and education, they managed not to fight on the same territory as their opponents and were able to carve out their own distinctive message, get out their core vote and sneak over the line. Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson tweeted his ""commiserations"" to Tory candidate Paul Bristow, who, he said, ""did not deserve to come third"", while fellow contenders Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Jeremy Hunt said the result showed the threat from Labour. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the ""clear message"" from its poor performance in Peterborough as well as in recent council and European elections was the public wanted the government to deliver on the Brexit referendum result. This video can not be played Nigel Farage reacts to the Peterborough result Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice said the Peterborough by-election had not been as ""dramatic"" as the UK-wide European elections last month, in which the Brexit Party and Liberal Democrats came first and second. But he added that the combined results had been ""enough to disturb the regular rhythms of two-party politics"". Ms Forbes caused controversy during the campaign when she liked a social media post which said Theresa May had a ""Zionist slave masters agenda"". Labour said she had liked a video expressing solidarity with the victims of March's terror attacks on mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch ""without reading the accompanying text, which Facebook users know is an easy thing to do"". ""She has fully accounted for this genuine mistake and apologised,"" a party source said. But the Jewish Labour Movement called for Ms Forbes to have the Labour whip suspended, meaning she would have to sit in the Commons as an independent MP. Meanwhile, Labour Against Antisemitism asked for her to be suspended from the party, calling her election a ""dark day"" for Labour. New MP hails 'significant' win.

"Johanna Konta had not won a match at Roland Garros until this year 2019 French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:26 May-9 June Coverage:Live text and radio commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app. Johanna Konta missed out on becoming the first British woman to reach a Grand Slam final since 1977 by losing to Czech teenager Marketa Vondrousova in the French Open semi-finals. The 26th seed's extraordinary run here ended with a 7-5 7-6 (7-2) defeat by the unseeded 19-year-old in windy conditions in front of a sparse crowd. Konta, 28, was unable to convert three first-set points - and paid the price. Vondrousova plays Australian Ashleigh Barty in Saturday's final. The Czech, who has not dropped a set, is the first teenage finalist at Roland Garros since Serbia's Ana Ivanovic in 2007. Konta was bidding to become the first British woman to win a Grand Slam singles title since Virginia Wade triumphed at Wimbledon 42 years ago and the first singles player from the nation - man or woman - to win at Roland Garros since Sue Barker in 1976. ""It is always tough to lose a match, any match, and always tough to lose matches where you have opportunities and chances,"" said Konta, who had never won a main-draw match at the Paris venue before this tournament. ""But I feel very comfortable and assured that I did the best I could out there. ""It's hard to lose any match like this but my opponent played well and I'm proud of how I played."" However, Konta said she was ""surprised"" at the match being moved out to Court Simonne-Mathieu - Roland Garros' third show court - with organisers reshuffling the schedule because of bad weather. The new 5,000-seater stadium was barely a third full for the semi-final. How Konta's defeat unfolded and follow Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal in men's semi-finals Barty beats Anisimova to reach final Konta was playing in her third Grand Slam semi-final on a third different surface - having reached the last four at the 2016 Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2017. The women's draw has been blown wide open over the past fortnight, and the Briton was the only semi-finalist in Paris to have reached this stage of a Slam previously. Vondrousova is competing in the main draw of a Grand Slam for the ninth time, while her furthest previous run at a major was reaching the fourth round at last year's US Open. However, Konta's greater experience did not tell as tension got the better of the former world number four at crucial moments. She led 5-3 in both sets before allowing Vondrousova to break back and seize the initiative. Konta's shot selection on her first two chances to seal the opening set proved significant, spooning a wild drive-volley long and planting a sliced backhand into the net. ""The way the point was going I'd take that as a drive volley nine out of 10 times and nine out of 10 times I'd make that,"" she said. ""And the point after I clipped the net so there wasn't too much wrong there."" Although she did manage to put those shots behind her and earn a third chance, that opportunity disappeared as well when Vondrousova put away a forehand winner on her way to a crucial hold. Konta's confidence sapped as she failed to serve out the opener from 5-4 - and then there was a sense of deja vu when she also failed to serve out from the same position in the second. A double fault handed over the break - and the momentum - as Vondrousova ran away with the tie-break to seal victory in one hour and 45 minutes. ""I didn't regret anything I did there,"" Konta said. ""I feel comfortable with how I played and what I tried to do. I don't have any regrets. ""Overall I played a very tough opponent, who was better than me on the day."" There were many empty seats on Court Simonne-Mathieu Rows of empty seats are not what you would expect to see at a Grand Slam semi-final, yet that was the scene as Konta and Vondrousova battled for a place in Saturday's final. Both women's semi-finals were due to be played on the 15,000-seater Philippe Chatrier on Thursday, but rain leading to play being cancelled on Wednesday had a knock-on effect and organisers moved them to smaller show courts. While Barty and Anisimova played on Suzanne Lenglen, which can house 10,000 fans, Konta and Vondrousova were moved to Roland Garros' picturesque third show court, which opened this year. Despite being open to those with outside court tickets, the stadium was barely half full. The entire top tier was virtually empty, with large patches of light-coloured wooden seats visible on the bottom deck. It was not a good look for Roland Garros' organisers, who had faced plenty of criticism for moving the women's semi-finals out to the smaller show courts. WTA boss Steve Simon called the decision ""inappropriate and unfair"",while former world number one Amelie Mauresmo said it was a ""disgrace"". Konta appeared to agree with their criticism without explicitly supporting it, adding the decision to move the women's semi-finals ""speaks for itself"". ""What is tiring and what is really unfortunate in this, more than anything, is that female athletes have to sit in different positions and have to justify their scheduling or their involvement in an event or their salary or their opportunities,"" she said. ""I think to give time to that is even more of a sad situation than what we found ourselves in today in terms of the scheduling."" This video can not be played Scheduling matches is not my job - Konta Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller This was, without doubt, a missed opportunity for Johanna Konta. Leading both sets 5-3, and playing with purpose, Konta lost her way. Her thought process became clouded, and her shot selection went awry. Konta has not yet been been able to reproduce her best form in a Grand Slam semi-final. Defeats by Angelique Kerber in Melbourne, and Venus Williams at Wimbledon, were less of a surprise. But this time Konta had the experience, and the lead. Let's hope there will be further opportunities to come, and let's not forget how far Konta has come in six weeks. At the start of the clay-court season she was in danger of slipping out of the world's top 50. She is now a top-20 player once again, and has put together a remarkable clay-court season of 15 wins - a statistic which back in April seemed utterly implausible.

"This video can not be played The crew of the USS Chancellorsville had a close-up view of the Admiral Vinogradov (video from 2019) A Russian warship and a US warship have come close to collision in the western Pacific Ocean, with each side blaming the other for the incident. Russia's Pacific Fleet said the cruiser USS Chancellorsville crossed just 50m (160ft) in front of the destroyer Admiral Vinogradov at 06:35 Moscow time (03:35 GMT). It was forced to perform ""emergency manoeuvring"" to avoid the US ship. But US forces blamed the Russians, claiming their ship was responsible. US Seventh Fleet Commander Clayton Doss called the Russians ""unsafe and unprofessional"", saying their destroyer ""made an unsafe manoeuvre against USS Chancellorsville"". He dismissed the Russian allegation as ""propaganda"".

"This video can not be played The crew of the USS Chancellorsville had a close-up view of the Admiral Vinogradov (video from 2019) A Russian warship and a US warship have come close to collision in the western Pacific Ocean, with each side blaming the other for the incident. Russia's Pacific Fleet said the cruiser USS Chancellorsville crossed just 50m (160ft) in front of the destroyer Admiral Vinogradov at 06:35 Moscow time (03:35 GMT). It was forced to perform ""emergency manoeuvring"" to avoid the US ship. But US forces blamed the Russians, claiming their ship was responsible. US Seventh Fleet Commander Clayton Doss called the Russians ""unsafe and unprofessional"", saying their destroyer ""made an unsafe manoeuvre against USS Chancellorsville"".

The company plansto shut its sitein the town in autumn 2020, blaming costs and changing customer demand. Mr Drakeford said workers felt they had done ""everything that the company has asked of them"". In a phone call with the prime minister, he called for Bridgend staff to be given thesame support as those losing their jobs at Honda in Swindon,external. A spokesman for the first minister described the conversation with Theresa May as ""constructive"" and said Mr Drakeford had explained the importance of Ford to the Bridgend economy.

"Bank overdraft fees are to undergo a major shake-up, which the UK financial regulator is calling the biggest overhaul for a generation. Banks and building societies will no longer be allowed to charge fixed daily or monthly fees for overdrafts. In addition, there will no longer be higher fees for unplanned overdrafts than for arranged ones. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the new rules would start by April 2020. Under the new measures, which were first proposed in December, banks will also be required to charge a simple annual interest rate on all overdrafts, and overdraft advertisements will need to come with that rate clearly displayed, to help consumers compare various products. In 2017, banks made more than Â£2.4bn from overdrafts - with 30% alone coming from unarranged overdrafts. Previous research showed those aged between 35 and 44 were most likely to have some form of overdraft, and about 10% of all 18 to 24-year-olds had exceeded their overdraft limit in the previous 12 months. Megzer Dorj says that he paid about Â£900 in overdraft fees last year. ""I'm not able to get a planned overdraft limit,"" the 32-year-old chef says. ""When I go into it, they charge me on a monthly basis. In the last year, 2018, I paid Â£900. That is just the charge, nothing else."" He says he kept getting charged after going into an unarranged overdraft for day-to-day living costs. He's delighted that the FCA has taken action. Overdraft woes: 'We were one bill away from disaster' Lloyds' overdraft fees unacceptable, says MP The regulator said the changes would make overdrafts ""simpler, fairer, and easier to manage"". It will mean: No difference between arranged and unarranged overdraft prices - but no cap on the cost either An end to monthly or daily fees A requirement for banks to advertise their overdraft rate as a single annual interest rate, or APR Banks will still be able to refuse to make a payment if a customer does not have the funds to cover it, but any resulting fee for the customer must reflect the cost to the bank Banks must do more to identify and help customers who are showing signs of financial strain or are in financial difficulty When the new rules come into force, the typical cost of borrowing Â£100 through an unarranged overdraft would drop from Â£5 a day, to less than 20p, the regulator said. However, some fear that the costs to those who previously used arranged overdraft charges might rise, or charges for accounts may rise. Banks and building societies will be required to charge a simple annual interest rate on all overdrafts, and overdraft advertisements will need to come with that rate clearly displayed, to help consumers to compare various products. The FCA's chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said the overdraft market was currently ""dysfunctional"" and ""causing significant consumer harm"" because vulnerable customers are often hit by excessive charges for unarranged overdrafts, which can be 10 times as high as fees for payday loans. ""Consumers cannot meaningfully compare or work out the cost of borrowing as a result of complex and opaque charges, that are both a result of and driver of poor competition,"" said Mr Bailey. ""The decisive action we are taking today will give greater protections to millions of people who use an overdraft, particularly the most vulnerable."" Eric Leenders, from bank trade body UK Finance, said: ""Overdrafts can provide a convenient way for customers to smooth their short-term cash-flow, and there is a highly competitive market in the UK. The banking industry is committed to helping customers manage their money and we will be working closely with the FCA to implement these rules."" Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said overdrafts were one of the most common areas of concern when worried consumers contacted the charity. ""Overdraft charges can have serious knock-on effects for people's debt and mental health. These new rules should help thousands of people from getting trapped in a debt spiral,"" she said. ""If, after these measures are introduced, people still pay over the odds, the FCA should review the need for an interest rate cap to ensure no one is paying back more than twice what they borrowed."" Peter Tutton, of debt charity StepChange, said: ""We would like the regulator to be more pro-active and fleet of foot in identifying and refining the specific, practical steps banks should be taking to help customers escape the overdraft trap more quickly, and to break the cycle of repeat use of overdrafts.""

Former Beatles drummerRingo Starr also tweeted a picture,,externalalong with the message: ""God bless Dr John, peace and love to all his family. I love the doctor, peace and love."" His career started in the late 1950s, when he became prominent as a pianist and singer on the New Orleans music scene. Born Malcolm John Rebennack in New Orleans, his love of music was fostered by his father, who ran an appliance store that also sold records. His mother, meanwhile, had worked as a model, and thanks to her connections, Malcolm's face appeared on boxes of Ivory Soap. Despite being kicked out of the church choir, he pursued his love of music, attending local clubs and working at a studio in town during his teens. His first love was the guitar, but he had to switch to piano after being shot while trying to defend a bandmate who was being pistol-whipped in 1960. ""Ronnie was just a kid and his mother had told me 'You better look out for my son,'"" he told Smithsonian.com in 2009. ""Oh God, that was all I was thinking about. I tried to stop the guy, I had my hand over the barrel and he shot."" He later became part of the famed ""Wrecking Crew"" - a group of LA backing musicians who played on hits by Aretha Franklin, Van Morrison, Cher Frank Zappa and countless others. The Dr John character, modelled on a voodoo priest, was created in the late 1960s. Rebennack initially wanted another singer to play the role, but when they pulled out at the last minute, ""I just did it myself out of spite,"" he said. ""I never thought I would be doing another record. I never wanted to be a frontman. All of a sudden, I got into it, and it wasn't as bad as I thought."" Blending New Orleans jazz, blues and psychedelia, he gained recognition with the release of his album Gris-Gris in 1968; and scored a US top 10 hit in 1973 with Right Time, Wrong Place. Dr John performing at the Grammy Awards in 2013 His live shows were known for their carnival atmosphere and he would wear costumes of bright colours, feathers and plumes, and scatter glitter on the audience. The musician, who successfully battled heroin addiction, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend in 2011; and won his most recent Grammy in 2012 when Locked Down was named best blues album. That album touched on drugs, his time in prison - he got a two-year sentence for drug charges in the mid-60s - and efforts to repair his relationship with his children. He was married twice and toldthe New York Times,externalhe had ""a lot"" of children. Blues guru Dr John on voodoo rock.

"This video can not be played Workers react to news that Ford's engine plant will close in 2020 Workers at the Ford Bridgend engine plant feel angry and betrayed, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. The company plansto shut its sitein the town in autumn 2020, blaming costs and changing customer demand. Mr Drakeford said workers felt they had done ""everything that the company has asked of them"". In a phone call with the prime minister, he called for Bridgend staff to be given thesame support as those losing their jobs at Honda in Swindon,external. A spokesman for the first minister described the conversation with Theresa May as ""constructive"" and said Mr Drakeford had explained the importance of Ford to the Bridgend economy. The UK government announced a Â£16m programme to help suppliers, and a taskforce to promote Swindon for building electric cars, after Honda announced it would shut its plant in the town. The Welsh Government is planning to establish its own taskforce to aimed at ""maximising the strengths that are here in Bridgend"", Mr Drakeford said earlier on Friday. Five reasons the car industry is struggling Political reaction: 'Workers deserve better' Ford set to close Bridgend plant in 2020 Meanwhile a trade union official accused the company of trying to ""bribe"" employees with redundancy packages - and said shop stewards were willing to ""take the fight to Ford"". About 1,700 people work at the factory, which opened in 1980. This video can not be played The story of Ford in Bridgend ""There is a palpable sense of anger, and a betrayal really, amongst the workforce who feel they have done absolutely everything that the company has asked of them over recent years to put this plant in the best possible place,"" Mr Drakeford said. He said discussions would continue with the workforce to see ""how the period of consultation that now follows can be used to put pressure on the company to remain here in south Wales"". Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said on Tuesday the UK government and Welsh Government ""have already been working on potential investors"" but ""clearly there is a lot more work"". Mr Cairns also said he has been in touch with Mr Skates about exploring the production of electric vehicles as a means of protecting jobs in the Bridgend area. In numbers 1,700workers Â£3.3bnvalue to Welsh economy over 10 years Â£140mWelsh Government support Â£45,000average annual salary Mr Drakeford could not say who would be on the Welsh Government taskforce. ""It's important to calibrate the taskforce according to local circumstances, to do it in consultation with local players and local interests,"" he said. He said the government will be looking ""at who we need to bring around the table to make sure that those skills are known and advertised, whether there is a need to re-skilling to make sure the training packages are in place, and that they are tailored to the needs of individuals"". The first minister said the company told him that Brexit ""was a background factor"". ""It may not be a major precipitating factor. But the uncertainty that Brexit brings, the way in which the UK is regarded by global companies looking to serve a whole European market. It is inevitable that Brexit plays its part,"" he said. Mark Drakeford said Brexit was a factor in the background of the decision to close the site Ford of Europe president Stuart Rowley on Thursday said the decision was nothing to do with Brexit. ""We are committed to the UK. However, changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead,"" he added. Peter Hughes, Unite Wales regional secretary, said ""a lot of shop stewards feel like they're being bribed, and they feel like the membership is being bribed to make sure that they take the redundancy package and don't take any action."" ""What came out loud and clear is that the shop stewards are really willing to take the fight to Ford,"" he said. Asked what exactly that meant, Mr Hughes said: ""I think it could mean anything from industrial action to whatever is in the gift of members to do."" Ben Cottam: ""We want to see some leadership exhibited"" Meanwhile, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said business leaders and politicians must work together to understand ""what a post-Ford Bridgend looks like"". FSB Wales' head of external affairs Ben Cottam said Ford had been ""in the economic landscape for 40 years"". ""Around that has grown up a small business supply chain so we know that this is going to cause some real concern among smaller businesses. ""What we need to do now is identify those businesses, understand how they're affected and I think we want to see support from government, both in Cardiff Bay and in Westminster to support them to diversify, to re-skill and to look for new opportunities."" This video can not be played Jeremie Manning says workers were ""let down big time"" Jeremie Manning, of Abercynon, has worked at Ford in Bridgend for 15 years. ""It hasn't sunk in yet. Many of us suspected something because of the way the plant has been running in recent years but the speed of the announcement swept everyone off their feet. ""We thought we would have longer but it took everyone by surprise. Even the plant manager struggled to give the news. Everyone was in a state of shock. ""It's not just us, it's the community around south Wales. We know the supply chain and the jobs that were created. This is massive. ""It's not nice to go home and tell your wife this news. Hopefully I've got 15 months work if it's not cut short but that's not long to re-skill. ""Morale has been rock bottom for a few years because this has been hanging over us for a while. ""We have dealt with everything that was thrown at us - but it hasn't worked. ""I think Ford were just kicking the can down the road with false promises. They need to rethink. They owe it to us and the community."" 'It's a dreadful blow for the whole region - not just the town' - Freya Bletsoe Shop owner Freya Bletsoe said the knock-on affect from the closure would be a ""dreadful blow"" to the region. She added: ""Bridgend puts millions into the Cardiff City Deal. Now is the time for that deal to do what it's supposed to by investing and helping make this region economically viable."" Bridgend 'hanging on by its fingernails' Local traders have called for help in minimising the impact on the wider community. Michelle Smith says businesses in Bridgend rely on each other Michelle Smith, president of the Porthcawl Chamber of Trade, fears any new jobs will not make up for the loss of 1,700 well-paid posts at Ford.

"This video can not be played A look at the steps Mexico is taking to deal with migrants Mexico has deployed 6,000 members of its National Guard on its border with Guatemala in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants heading to the US. Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard is in Washington trying to stop the US from placing trade tariffs on Mexican goods over illegal migration. US President Donald Trump has vowed to enact import duties of 5% on Monday if no agreement is reached. On Wednesday, he said ""not nearly enough"" progress was being made. After the latest talks on Thursday, Mr Ebrard said he was ""an optimistic man."" Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Trump's border wall - in seven charts He said forces would be stationed on Mexico's southern border with Guatemala to prevent migrants entering the country. ""We have explained that there are 6,000 men and that they will be deployed there,"" he said, adding that talks would continue Friday. Analysis by Will Grant, BBC Latin America correspondent The White House may welcome an offer of 6,000 more troops on Mexico's southern border, but given the unpredictability of this presidency, it's not yet clear if that will be enough for President Trump to call off the tariffs. Meanwhile, in Mexico itself, the proposal has quite a different complexion. To Mr LÃ³pez Obrador's critics, it looks like he has essentially given in to the Trump administration by offering to further militarise what is already a pretty militarised part of Mexico. The Mexican delegation in Washington says the Mexican government is doing all it can on immigration. It's difficult to get the balancing act right, said one Mexican senator, between regulating migration from Central America and clamping down in the way the Trump administration would like. One interesting development is the call by President LÃ³pez Obrador for a rally this weekend in the border city of Tijuana, ostensibly to celebrate Mexican sovereignty. It's a sign that Mr Trump can push too far. If Mexico responds to US tariffs with tariffs of its own, especially ones targeted in important swing states like Ohio, then we could see a tit-for-tat economic conflict that will hurt consumers and workers on both sides of the border. Under the US president's proposal, duties would rise by 5% every month on goods including cars, beer, tequila, fruit and vegetables, reaching 25% by October. Mr Trump wants Mexico to stop the hundreds of thousands of mostly Central American migrants who have been seeking entry to the US this year. The president announced the planned Mexico tariffs last week on Twitter, catching members of his own party and financial markets unawares. This video can not be played More than 1,000 migrants cross through a hole in the fence near El Paso, Texas, in the largest single border breach ever recorded US Customs and Border Protection announced this week that migrant arrests had surged in May to the highest level in more than a decade. Border Patrol apprehended 132,887 migrants attempting to enter the US from Mexico in May, marking a 33% increase from the month before. It said 84,542 were families and 11,507 unaccompanied children. The arrests were the highest monthly total since Mr Trump took office. Another 11,391 migrants were deemed ""inadmissible"" and turned away after arriving at US ports of entry, bringing the overall figure to 144,278. ""We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger, the system is broken,"" said acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders. Official figures show illegal border crossings have been in decline since 2000. In 2000, 1.6 million people were apprehended trying to cross the border illegally - that number was just under 400,000 in 2018. In 2017, Mr Trump's first year in office, the figures were the lowest they had been since 1971. The decline was in large part due to a dip in the number of people coming from Mexico. In the past two years, however, the number of arrests has been rising again, especially in recent months. The current surge is overwhelming US authorities because so many migrants, including families with children, are claiming asylum.

"The Peterborough constituency was called ""the mother of all marginals"" by the Renew candidate Peter Ward Days after they marked their ballots for the European elections, the people of Peterborough will go to the polls again - to choose their MP. They're facing a by-election, on Thursday, because of the departure of former Labour MP Fiona Onasanya, whowas removed by a recall petitionafter being jailed for lying about a speeding offence. The voters of Peterborough have a lot of choice: fifteen candidates, some of them from new political parties, are pounding the streets to try to win people over. But what do voters want in their MP - if election apathy doesn't get to them first? The city of Peterborough is not what you would call a safe seat. The Renew candidate Peter Ward has described it as ""the mother of all marginals""; it was taken from the Conservatives in 2017 by Ms Onasanya on a wafer-thin majority. There was nothing marginal about the city's support for leaving the EU, however: in the 2016 referendum, on a 72.4% turnout, voters backed Leave by 61% to 39%. The 15 candidates fighting for Peterborough WATCH: Peterborough by-election candidates debate Peterborough is one of the fastest-growing cities in the UK, with a population of 197,000 people, and strong transport connections to London and the industrial north. The city, on the edge of the Fens, has long attracted large numbers of immigrants, attracted by its factories, warehouses and agricultural work. According to the Centre for Cities, Peterborough has outperformed most of the country for rapid employment growth. So what are the big issues the people of the city want their new MP to tackle? Ann Marie Gutteridge says the Brexit impasse is causing voter apathy Ann Marie Gutteridge, 39, runs Sweet Memories on Peterborough market. There have recently been local elections followed by European elections, and she thinks this is putting people off voting. ""There are too many elections, and Brexit is all we hear about,"" she says. ""Why bother? It's not working. This is a major city and the new MP has to listen to the people, and unless they support their own area, it's not worth it. ""The city centre desperately needs regenerating, trade is next to nothing here, it's all jewellery shops, betting shops or restaurants."" Ice cream man Shazad Mahmood sees affordable housing and tackling fly-tipping as priorities ""This city really needs more affordable housing,"" saysShazad Mahmood, 39, who runs the Jim Boys ice cream van in the city with his brother. ""Getting people on track before they get off track is important. We're lucky here because there are plenty of jobs and this is a fast-growing city. ""Plus I also don't understand why Peterborough has so much fly-tipping. ""How hard is it to phone the council who'll take it away for you?"" Angelique Williams runs a vegan food stall ""The impact on the environment - not just climate change but animal agriculture and chronic diseases in our schools - is the most important thing now,"" says market food vendorAngelique Williams, 49. The former business analyst, who moved to the UK from South Africa in 1996, said she's also worried about the pressure on local businesses to survive with high rents and rates. But she says Peterborough is full of ""little pockets of beauty"" - the cathedral and parks, the Art Deco lido, unique buildings and a big artistic community. ""This is a small city with a great international flavour; we have to support each other,"" she says. ""I want our new MP to be compassionate: a doer - not a taker - someone who will stand up and defend Peterborough."" Inga Pumpure-Skaba wants reassurances from the new MP about Brexit Inga Pumpure-Skaba, 33, is the site manager at Gladstone Park community centre. She is a single mum of two and is originally from Latvia. ""I've been here for more than nine years and my children are at primary and secondary schools. There's a wonderful Latvian community - our whole lives are here,"" she says. ""I want a guarantee from the new MP that I'll still be entitled to work and have access to healthcare and education, whatever happens in the next few months. ""The hardest part is seeing the election leaflets coming through, promising jobs for English people - it's discrimination and that's wrong."" Inga is currently applying to stay through the EU Settlement Scheme, but is finding the process confusing and difficult. ""There is work in Peterborough and good opportunities for jobs - it's one of the city's strengths,"" she says. ""We want to be here."" Charity volunteer Jordan Limond wants more visible police in the housing estates Jordan Limondvolunteers with a charity that supports more than 70 rough sleepers in the city every day. ""I want our MP to live up their policies - to mean what they say they're going to do locally,"" he says. ""They have to live here, to understand the heartbeat of the community. To support the NHS, to boost police to tackle anti-social behaviour.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May: How the PM fought through Brexit battles Theresa May has officially stepped down as the leader of the Conservative Party, but will remain as prime minister until her successor is chosen. She has handed in her private resignation letter to the backbench 1922 Committee, two weeks after announcing her intention to leave. Eleven Conservative MPs are vying to replace her as party leader and, ultimately, prime minister. The winner of the contest is expected to be announced in the week of 22 July. Mrs May, who has said it was a matter of deep regret that she had been unable to deliver Brexit, remains acting party leader during the leadership election process. Meanwhile,the Conservatives fell to third place in the Peterborough by-election, behind winners Labour and the Brexit Party in second place, in what is traditionally a Tory-Labour marginal seat.

The UK was originally meant to leave the European Union on 29 March but that was then pushed back to 12 April and eventually 31 October. When Mrs May announced her resignation, she said it was time for a new prime minister to try to deliver Brexit. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said Mrs May is expected to announce a number of domestic policies before her final departure, with sources saying she is aiming for an announcement a week on issues like the environment and women in the workplace.

The committee said it was now inviting nominations from those Conservative MPs ""who wish to stand for election as the next party leader"". Leadership nominations close at 17:00 on Monday, a statement said. By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check Constitutionally speaking, Theresa May keeps the same powers. But in the eyes of MPs she may lack the authority to introduce any radical policies between now and handing the reins over to a new prime minister. While Mrs May is still free to make policy or funding announcements, any pledges would eventually need to be made into law. According to Catherine Haddon, from the Institute for Government think tank, there's no guarantee MPs would give Mrs May's announcements the green light - especially with such a small working majority. Aside from policy, Mrs May will continue to represent the UK abroad and she is still free to make public appointments and make changes to her team of ministers. She will be able reward some of those she has worked with - including knighthoods and appointments to the House of Lords. But the resignation honours listhas been controversial in the past- so it will be interesting to see how many appointments Mrs May makes. Leadership candidates need eight MPs to back them. MPs will then vote for their preferred candidates in a series of secret ballots held on 13, 18, 19 and 20 June. The final two will be put to a vote of members of the wider Conservative Party from 22 June, with the winner expected to be announced about four weeks later. Speaking to BBC Politics Live, leadership contender Sam Gyimah said he had considered dropping out of the Conservative Party leadership race but insisted he would ""get to the starting line"" by Monday. Three of his rivals, former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, former Government Chief Whip Mark Harper and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, have also said they have the eight nominations needed. While the contest does not officially start until Mrs May steps down, candidates have already been jostling for position. How the next prime minister gets a Brexit deal through Parliament andwhether they would countenance a no-deal exithas been the dominant question of the campaign so far. The winner of the contest to lead the Conservative Party will become the next prime minister. Who has declared and who still might? Where does each candidate stand on Brexit? Dominic Raab's suggestion at a hustings on Wednesday that he would be prepared to shut down Parliament - the process known as prorogation - to ensure the UK leaves the EU on 31 October has been criticised by his rivals. And Commons Speaker John Bercow said on Thursday it was ""simply not going to happen"". Conservative leadership contender Michael Gove has said the UK must not be bound by a ""fixed"" date if it needs slightly more time to get a deal. Others, such as Mr Raab and Boris Johnson, insist the UK must leave on 31 October, whether it has approved a deal with Brussels or not. Reality Check: Did May solve her seven burning injustices? Former trade minister Lord Digby Jones has called on Mrs May's successor to provide more ""stability"" for UK businesses over Brexit. He told the BBC'sWake Up to Moneyprogramme that they should ensure the UK leaves the EU on 31 October, ""preferably with a deal - but without a deal rather than not coming out"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I don't know who the new leader is going to be, but it seems to be a choice between no deal, no deal and no deal, as far as I can understand it.""
