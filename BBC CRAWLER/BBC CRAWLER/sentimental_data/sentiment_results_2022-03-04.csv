"Models walk the runway in a Chanel fashion show in Moscow in 2018 French luxury giants have joined other firms in announcing they will suspend sales in Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. LVMH, Hermes, Kering and Chanel have decided to temporarily shut their shops in Russia, the firms said on Friday. It follows calls from Ukrainian high-end stores to ""stand up"" following the invasion of the country. Luxury retailers have so far largely been left out of sanctions introduced by Western governments. But many have found doing business and fulfilling orders in the region more difficult, after measures introduced by the UK, European Union and US. The maker of pricey Birkin bags Hermes and the Swiss Cartier owner Richemont were among the first firms to announce that they would pause business in Russia. LVMH, which owns such brands as Christian Dior, Givenchy and Bulgari among others, will close its 124 boutiques in the country from Sunday. Chanel, famous for its boucle jackets, said in a LinkedIn post: ""Given our increasing concerns about the current situation, the growing uncertainty and the complexity to operate, Chanel decided to temporarily pause its business in Russia."" Kering, which is home to Gucci and Saint Laurent, has two shops in Russia, along with 180 employees in the country. The French firm said its decision was due to ""growing concerns regarding the current situation in Europe"". H&M temporarily suspends all sales in Russia What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? An executive at a luxury Ukrainian department store told the BBC that high-end firms must ""choose humanity over monetary gain"". Marusya Koval, marketing director at Tsum Kyiv, pointed out that some firms have pledged aid, but have not commented on whether they will stop selling their products in Russia.

"A planned mass evacuation of civilians from Mariupol is aborted as Russia continues shelling the key southern city People hoping to escape are forced back to their shelters after a planned ceasefire fails to materialise Civilians have also been unable to leave the nearby city of Volnovakha Heavy bombardments have been reported in Irpin - a town on the north-western outskirts of Kyiv Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin has warned the West he would regard any no-fly zone over Ukraine as an act of war Ukraine's president has repeated his call for a no-fly zone. Western leaders say they don't want to make the situation worse Edited by Jessica Murphy For technical reasons, we will be switching out live coverage to a new webpage. You can continue to follow our around the clock coverage of the war in Ukraineat this link here. US President Joe Biden has said his administration is
working closely with Congress to secure additional funding for Ukraine. Biden made the statement during a phone call with his Ukrainian
counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday. The US president reiterated his support for
Ukraine and praised the skill and bravery of its citizens and troops. A White House readout from the call made no mention of Zelensky's repeated requests for assistance in setting up a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The US and other Nato nations have rejected such
requests over concerns it could escalate the conflict. Instead they have focused on imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia and some
of its wealthiest people. They have also been providing military, medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. From Rome to Munich to London, people gathered today to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's the second weekend in a row that people have protested in cities around the world to show their support for Ukraine. Watch to see where the demonstrations took place.  This video can not be played Canada's foreign ministry is urging Canadians to avoid all travel to Russia, and has told Canadian citizens there that they ""should leave while commercial means are still available"". It told citizens that if they stayed, they could face ""shortages of essential products and services"" and ""may not be able to use your banking cards for payment or to withdraw funds"". It also warned that those who remain in Russia should  ""not depend on the Government of Canada to help you leave the country"". Earlier today, the US State Department issued a similar advisory, telling citizens there to depart immediately. The UK Foreign Office has also told  Britons whose presence in Russia is ""not essential"" that they are strongly advised to consider leaving by currently available commercial routes. The mayor
of Mariupol says Russian forces have intensified shelling in the Ukrainian city. Vadym
Boychenko said the port city was in âa very, very difficult state of siegeâ. âRelentless
shelling of residential blocks is ongoing, airplanes have been dropping bombs
on residential areas,â the AP news agency quoted him as saying. He added
that residents, including women and children, came under fire as they tried to
leave the city. The port
city has been witnessing intense shelling for days as Russian troops have been
trying to cut Ukraine off from this strategically important sea link. Russian forces have continued to shell Mariupol despite agreeing to a ceasefire, throwing an attempted mass evacuation of civilians into chaos. You can read more about that here Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with US President Joe Biden today. ""As part of the constant dialogue, I had another conversation with @POTUS,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""The agenda included the issues of security, financial support for Ukraine and the continuation of sanctions against Russia."" Zelensky also spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, shortly after Bennett's three-hour meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Although Israel is a key ally of the US, Bennett has tried to preserve a good relationship with Russia. Israel, at the request of Zelensky, has offered to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In the Black Sea port of Kherson - the only large city to have fallen to the Russian army so far - people have been protesting the Russian invasion. On Friday, some residents snubbed Moscow's distribution of humanitarian aim, chanting patriotic slogans and waving Ukrainian flags. ""It was thousands of people, not hundreds,"" one man who attended the protests told the BBC. The BBC has withheld his name for security reasons. ""We chanted that Kherson is Ukraine,"" he told BBC's Newshour. ""People shouted at Russia's military, 'Go home, we don't want you here. We want to live in Ukraine, we want to live with Europe, not with Russia.'"" The man confirmed reports that Russian shoulders fired guns into the air to deter protesters. He said residents do currently have electricity and limited internet. ""We are just living from day-to-day,"" the man said. ""It's still some scary times."" Hospitals across Ukraine are facing threats of supply shortages as the number of wounded grows, said Alex Wade, an emergency co-ordinator with MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) to the BBC. ""The situation is incredibly worrying and is certainly getting more worrying by the day,"" Wade said on BBC's Newshour earlier today. ""There are ruptures in what hospitals need to support their patients."" In some cases medical aid has been stymied by the advancing Russian invasion. Some towns - like port city Mariupol - have been cut off from both power and critical interventions from aid agencies like MSF. ""We are no longer able to communicate with the hospital [in Mariupol],"" Wade said. ""And we're very concerned we will lose access to supplying more hospitals in the coming days.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a renewed effort among world leaders to ensure that Russia's invasion of Ukraine fails. Writing in the New York Times, Johnson set out a six-point plan, including rapidly strengthening defences in Nato countries. ""Putin must fail and must be seen to fail in this act of aggression,"" he wrote. ""It is not future historians but the people of Ukraine who will be our judge."" The UK's Labour Party has criticised the prime minister for not acting more quickly with sanctions. Johnson is expected to repeat his pitch to fellow Western leaders this week. He will be meeting withCanadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauandDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutteon Monday and hosting leaders from theCzech Republic, Hungary, PolandandSlovakiathe following day. Read more about Johnson's plea for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskiy said today that he had spoken to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and announced the country will receive more of its Starlink satellite internet terminals this coming week. ""Talked to @elonmusk,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""Iâm grateful to him for supporting Ukraine with words and deeds. Next week we will receive another batch of Starlink systems for destroyed cities. Discussed possible space projects. But Iâll talk about this after the war."" Starlink provides high-speed internet from space with satellites flying in low Earth orbit. Musk said on
Thursday that the system was the only non-Russian communications
system still working in some parts of Ukraine in the wake of
Russia's invasion. Meanwhile, in an address to the Ukrainian people on Saturday night, Zelensky urged citizens in Russian occupied areas of the country to fight back against Vladimir Putin's military. âUkrainians! In all of our cities, where the enemy invaded, go on the offensive. Go out on the streets. We need to fight every time we have an opportunity,â he said. Tim FranksBBC Newshour, Lviv Fourteen-year-old Mariana is
about to add herself to the more than one million people whoâve fled over the border. Sheâs at Lviv station in Ukraine with her younger sister and aunt, hoping to board a
train to Poland. Itâs been an exhausting two-day trek from her home in
Kharkiv, in the north-east. Sheâs left her parents and her grandparents
behind. And Mariana can barely speak for the tears. âIâm
scared,â she sobs. âMy parents stayed. I really want to see them. I donât want to go to Poland.â Her grandparents were too frail to
leave home. But that home has become unrecognisable. Which is why
Marianaâs mother and father made their agonising decision to part from their
children. Theyâd spent days cowering, hungry and terrified in a basement
as the bombardment closed in. âI donât want this,â Mariana pleads. âPlease stop this. Why should we die?â A US ban on Russian oil will be the first priority for lawmakers, Congressman Mike Quigley told CNN a short while ago. ""The first thing you'll see Congress push for is an embargo,"" he said, noting that around 8% of US oil imports are from Russia. An embargo would be ""traumatic for our European allies"", who are more dependent, the Illinois Democrat said. ""So that's going to take quite a bit of diplomacy."" His comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with Quigley and more than 300 of his colleagues, calling for a bar on the import of Russian oil. A ban on Russian oil has provided a rare moment of bipartisan co-operation in the US Congress - both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have publicly pressured the Biden administration to implement an embargo. The US is one of the world's biggest oil producers, whereas the EU relies on imports to meet 61% of its energy needs. Shell said today that it made the ""difficult decision"" to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to ensure a continued supply of energy to the European market. ""Cargos from alternative sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply,"" the oil giant said in a statement. It said the firm is facing challenges in shifting from Russian oil ""because of how significant [it] is to global supply"". Shell said it would commit profits from its ""limited amount of Russian oil"" to a dedicated fund going towards humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Shell said earlier this week it will end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It said it will also sell its 50% stake in two Siberian oilfield projects. Russian oil exports account for about 8% of global supply. There has been a growing push in recent days for countries to shun Russian oil and gas - a move currently being considered by the United States. Allow Twitter content?

The payments giants Mastercard and Visa have announced that they are suspending their operations in Russia in protest over the invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, Mastercard said that Russian banks would no longer be supported
by its network and any card issued by the company outside of
country would not work at Russian merchants or ATMs. The company said it had listened to representations from partners and taken its decision due to the ""unprecedented nature of the current conflict and the uncertain economic environment"". Meanwhile, Visa said that it would work to cease all transactions in the country in the coming days, adding that Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia would also stop working in the country' territory. Al Kelly, Visa's CEO and chairman, said the company had been ""compelled to act following Russiaâs unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed"". âWe regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values,â he concluded. Taking a step away from the developments on the battlefield in Ukraine for moment, let's look briefly at some news from the football pitch. Head coach of Premiere League football club Chelsea, Thomas Tuchel, has criticised the club's supporters who sang owner Roman Abramovich's name during a minute's applause for Ukraine before their 4-0 win over Burnley today. On WednesdayAbramovich announced his decision to sell the clubamid heavy scrutiny following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He's alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. Some Chelsea fans chanted Russian Abramovich's name throughout the game, and were booed by Burnley fans. ""It's not the moment to do this,"" Chelsea manager Tuchel said. ""If we show solidarity we show solidarity and we should do it together.""

David WillisBBC News, Washington Pro-Ukraine supporters have been gathering outside the White House Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeated a call for a no-fly zone over his country in a video-link address to nearly 300 US lawmakers. He also called for a ban on imports of Russian oil and pleaded for Russian-made fighter jets, which his countryâs pilots know how to fly, to help fight the enemy advance in his country. In response, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said he'd help the Biden administration to facilitate their transfer from Eastern Europe Zelensky also underscored the need for additional military support and humanitarian aid, but two of his other requests have already been rejected by the US. Firstly, the no-fly zone which, while cutting off Russian air support, would also risk drawing Nato allies into the conflict. And secondly, the ban on the import of Russian oil which the Biden administration fears could further inflate the price of petrol. The Italian fashion group Prada says it is suspending all retail operations in Russia As we've been reporting, a number of global brands have said they will stop sales in Russia. Luxury brand Prada has now joined them. Other companiessuch as LVMH, Hermes, Kering and Chanel have already confirmed they will shut their shops in the country. Earlier the Spanish-owned business Inditex said it wouldclose all 502 Russian stores of its eight brands, including Zara, Bershka and Stradivarius, from Sunday. Sebastian UsherBBC Arab Affairs Editor Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett travelled to Moscow to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin earlier. The urgency of Bennett's visit was underlined by the fact that the Israeli prime minister - who's an Orthodox Jew - broke Shabbat (the Jewish day of rest) in order to fly to Moscow. Exceptions can only be made under Jewish law in situations in which life is threatened. Bennett's trip was also kept under wraps until he was already in the Kremlin holding some two-and-a-half hours of talks with President Putin. The two men have met several times before and appear to have a good relationship. The Ukrainian President Vlolodymyr Zelensky had earlier called on the Israeli prime minister to mediate in the current conflict. Among those accompanying Bennett was the Housing Minister Zeev Elkin, who has long served as a Russian translator for Israeli leaders.  He was born in Kharkiv and has relatives still in Ukraine. Following the talks, PM Bennett travelled onto Germany where he is set to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. As we've been reporting, the Russian authorities have restricted access to BBC websites in Russian and English, as well as other international and independent media, accusing them of circulating ""false information"" about what is happening in Ukraine. In response, the BBC said ""access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week"". Record numbers of people have read the BBC's Russian language news website since the invasion. Here's a reminder of how to get around the BBC ban in Russia:  The BBC has also launched two new shortwave frequencies broadcasting World Service English news for four hours a day to Ukraine and parts of Russia: Â© 2025 BBC.

"Graham Bonham-Carter is said to be linked to Oleg Deripaska through five properties, according to the NCA A judge has frozen UK bank accounts operated by a British businessman amid allegations they are linked to one of Russia's most controversial oligarchs. Accounts linked to Graham Bonham-Carter, second cousin of actress Helena, and part of the extended famous family, were put on hold on Friday. National Crime Agency investigators believe the accounts were being used to help Oleg Deripaska avoid sanctions. It is alleged Mr Bonham-Carter manages property on behalf of the oligarch. Granting the order, Westminster Magistrates Court has given the National Crime Agency six months to investigate the accounts, in one of the first public court moves against an oligarch since the Ukraine crisis began. Mr Bonham-Carter's lawyers have been contacted for comment. There is no suggestion anyone else in the Bonham-Carter family is being investigated by the NCA. Mr Deripaska (left) pictured with President Putin in 2014 Oleg Deripaska is one of the richest men associated with President Putin - having made billions from his stake in Russia's aluminium industries. He's been subjected to US sanctions since 2018 - but is not under any sanctions in the UK. He first became widely known in the UK in 2008, when it emerged he had been involved in talks over a donation to the Conservative Party via George Osborne. The donation was never made - but the story triggered a huge row at the time about links between British politicians and Russia's elites. Mr Bonham-Carter is described, on his Linkedin profile, as the director of a company that runs private homes and estates. Andrew Chadwick, a National Crime Agency investigator, told Westminster Magistrates Court that it wanted to freeze five bank accounts associated with Mr Bonham-Carter, of Surrey, to allow Mr Chadwick to investigate suspected links to Oleg Deripaska. ""The application is in respect of account-freezing orders for several bank accounts, held by Graham Bonham-Carter, of Surrey,"" said Mr Chadwick. ""My investigation is that he is heavily linked with a well-known Russian oligarch, who is linked to various crimes and criminality and is currently subject to sanctions in the United States. ""My submission is that funds in accounts held by Mr Bonham-Carter may be for the use of, or from, criminal activity."" ""Oleg Deripaska is a Russian national subject to sanctions since 2019,"" said Mr Chadwick. The officer told the court theUS Treasury alleges Mr Deripaska has been involved in money laundering,external, threatening rivals, wiretapping a government official, extortion, racketeering, ordering a murder and having links to Russian organised crime. Mr Deripaska has called the US allegations and sanctions absurd. The court heard that Mr Bonham-Carter had no criminal record and was not under investigation for taking part in organised crime. He was said to be linked to Mr Deripaska through five properties - two in the United States and three in the UK, all of which are suspected to be ultimately held for the oligarch's benefit. In London, Mr Chadwick said two properties, worth a combined Â£50m, were owned by a company based in the British Virgin Islands. That company benefited Mr Deripaska and the 'care-of' mailing address had been to Mr Bonham-Carter. Hamstone House, near Weybridge in Surrey, is on the market for Â£18m The third UK property is Hamstone House, a mansion near Weybridge, Surrey, currently on the market for Â£18m. Mr Chadwick said that it was owned by Edenfield Investments and, according to public research, Mr Bonham-Carter's name had appeared on Land Registry documentation for the property when it was purchased. One of the aforementioned London properties had also been the forwarding address for mail to Hamstone House. The two US properties, in New York and Washington, are owned by a company headed by Mr Bonham-Carter. ""Based on that information [about Mr Deripaska's apparent property] I have reasonable grounds to suspect that the accounts are being held for unlawful conduct,"" said Mr Chadwick. ""Mr Bonham-Carter has well-documented strong links to Mr Deripaska. ""The suspicion is that property held in the name of Mr Bonham-Carter, or companies that he is linked to, in fact belongs to Mr Deripaska - and the reason for the structure is to mask the true ultimate beneficial owner and to evade the sanctions."" District Judge Tan Ikran approved the National Crime Agency's freezing order for the next six months - allowing the agency time to investigate. The accounts hold just over Â£100,000, but the NCA has established that nearly Â£800,000 has additionally flowed through them since November 2020. Mr Bonham-Carter will have the chance to make representations to the court at a date to be fixed. Why have there been delays to UK Russia sanctions?

"Boris Vilkitsky is carrying Russian gas Dockers in Kent have refused to unload two tankers of Russian gas, forcing them to go elsewhere, a union has said. The Boris Vilkitsky and Fedor Litke have been diverted from the Isle of Grain, the largest terminal in Europe for importing liquefied natural gas. Unison head of energy Matt Lay said staff were ""determined to support the Ukrainian people and uphold the sanctions imposed against Russia"". However, there are concerns over a loophole in the current sanctions. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced on Tuesday that the UK had become thefirst country to pass a law banning shipswith ""any Russian connection"" from entering its ports. Mr Lay said: ""Sadly, this doesn't seem to be the case."" ""The Department for Transport rules only appear to cover the ownership and operators of vessels, not the cargo."" The Isle of Grain LNG is the largest terminal in Europe for importing liquefied natural gas The two tankers contain enough liquid gas to supply the UK for up to 12 days. The ships are sailing under the flag of Cyprus. Many ship owners opt to use a flag of another country for taxation or regulatory reasons. Mr Lay added: ""The government must act immediately to stop Russian goods continuing to arrive in the UK under the cover of another country."" A National Grid Spokesperson said: ""In line with government policy, we do not expect any Russian-linked ships to dock at Grain."" By Simon Browning, BBC News Business Correspondent As the ground war in Ukraine continues, an economic offensive with Russia is under way. Western governments have united during the last week to enforce broad sanctions on the Russian economy, its businesses and their leaders. Western retailers have pulled back too. But how effective are sanctions? Blocking Russian vessels alone in this scenario may not be enough as many Russian businesses use transport that is licensed and registered in other countries, such as Cyprus, Hong Kong or The Bahamas. Experts say this is a loophole in sanction enforcement. The rule of law is important here, because on what grounds would you block a vessel in line with Russian sanctions that is flagged in Cyprus or another country? An enormous amount of due diligence would also need to be applied to every vessel movement and what the vessels are carrying. This would require huge amounts of enforcement, which sanctions experts say is substantial and complicated. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said the sanctions apply to ships that are Russian owned, operated, controlled, registered or flagged. He added: ""Ministers are exploring options to further reduce the already small amount of imports we do get from Russia and we continue to urge Europe to put in place plans to end their dependence in Russian gas."" Julian Bray, editor-in-chief of international shipping newspaper TradeWinds, said: ""While the cargoes themselves are not sanctioned, the ships are. And the number of ships is very wide, and can be added to ad hoc. ""The sanctions have effectively paralysed shipping to and from Russia. The legal uncertainties, risks to crews, insurance costs, and the potential financial and reputational risks means that very few ships and cargoes are moving.""

"It's more than a week since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. Residents of the capital Kyiv and several other cities are under bombardment from Russian missiles. A nuclear power station also came under attack, causing an international outcry. Readers of the BBC News website have been sending in questions about the situation. Some of them are answered here by: James Waterhouse, reporting for the BBC from Kyiv Frank Gardner, the BBC's security editor Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at the University of Sheffield How is military aid getting into Ukraine? Why doesn't the Ukrainian air force attack the long Russian convoy? - David Finch Ukraine's western border with Poland and other Nato countries is still not in Russian hands  (the Russian invasion has come from the three other sides - north, south and east), so there is still a corridor for supplies to come in. The Black Sea coast however is now largely under Russian control and deemed unsafe for most shipping. Everyone is baffled as to why Ukraine has not done more to attack the Russian convoy as it is a sitting duck for drone and airstrikes. There are several possible explanations, Ukraine may be running out of armed drones and its small, outnumbered air force may be wary of being shot down by Russian air defence batteries. Ben Barry from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggests the Ukrainians may well be safeguarding what resources they do have in readiness to counter-attack when the Russians get closer to Kyiv. What exactly will it take for Western powers to get involved here? - Rob Frank The West has made it clear it will only get involved militarily if Russia attacks a Nato country. Ukraine is not in Nato but nearby countries Poland and the Baltic states are, hence Nato has been rushing reinforcements to bolster those countries' borders. That said, Western countries are supplying Ukraine with ""defensive"" equipment to help it try to repel the Russian invasion. This includes anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles. Some are calling for Nato to introduce a no-fly zone to stop Russian planes from carrying out airstrikes on Ukrainian cities. But Nato says it won't do that as it would entail shooting down Russian planes and that could lead to war with Russia. So far I have heard nothing about prisoners of war. Are both sides taking any? - David Taylor Yes. There are reports of Russian conscripts who have been taken prisoner and been given mobile phones to call home. Their families, we are told, thought they were just being sent to the Donbas region on a small operation, or even an exercise, but certainly not a full-scale invasion. Does Nato have any strategy for Russia attacking operational nuclear plants in Ukraine? - Barry Johnson I don't think anyone even foresaw this, but beyond a lot of rhetoric condemning it as reckless and unacceptable, there's not a lot the West can do, short of military intervention. This has been ruled out, as there are full-scale battles raging across Ukraine. On the other hand, it is not in Russia's interest to have a nuclear contamination disaster so close to its borders so the scenario of a nuclear plant being targeted may not be repeated. Beach defences being prepared in the southern Ukrainian port of Odessa, ahead of a feared coastal attack by Russia How worried should we be? The situation at the Zaporizhzhya power station is now under control and there has been no release of radioactive material. At the  site, the reactors are being shut down, which puts them into a safe state. The reactors themselves are well-shielded and resistant to fire or impact. More generally speaking, we should be concerned that nuclear facilities are military targets, because there are real risks of a nuclear accident. How would it affect us here in the UK if something was to happen to the nuclear plant? - Victoria Udell We are really too far away for there to be any hazard from radioactivity being released in the event of an accident. If an accident were to occur, it wouldn't be quite like the one that occurred at Chernobyl in 1986. There, the graphite in the core caught fire and, because it burned for 10 days, the radioactive smoke was lifted high into the atmosphere and spread widely around Europe. The reactors in Ukraine do not contain graphite, so are unlikely to catch fire or spread radioactivity widely. Footage of the fire which followed shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant What would really happen if a fire broke out or a bomb did get dropped directly at the plant or in the cooling units? - Maria If there was a fire inside the reactor building, it would be instantly extinguished by the automatic safety systems. The reactor buildings themselves are fairly robust, so the nuclear fuel should be quite safe in there. An explosion would only occur if there was a nuclear meltdown, which could be caused by the electricity supply to the site AND the back-up generators being damaged. If this happened to an operating nuclear power plant, then there could be an explosion like the one that happened Fukushima. At Zaporizhzhya, the reactors are being put into a ""shutdown"", which means a nuclear meltdown could not happen. How dangerous was the attack on Ukraine's nuclear plant? What's your life like right now as a reporter in Kyiv? Are there signs of normal life? The day-to-day couldn't be more different from just over a week ago. We often covered the politics of this crisis, maybe even filmed with people across Kyiv, a city we could freely move around in. Now we are covering a full-scale war. Events are moving so quickly, and we find ourselves in and out of a bomb shelter like thousands of others. The food we are having for now is still fresh - often Ukraine's signature borscht soup as well as ham and cheeses. However, we are the extremely lucky ones. We've spoken to people now living in Metro stations where there is no running water or food being provided. Above ground, the normal full pavements and busy nightlife have disappeared. Instead, there are blockades and military checkpoints. Occasional friendly smiles have been replaced with nervous, wary looks. You can see the weight of tension on people's faces as they wait for what might be coming. An underground metro station used as a bomb shelter in Kyiv If Kyiv is eventually surrounded by Russian forces, would airdrops of supplies (food, ammunition) be possible, like the Berlin airlift? - Fred Williams It's not clear yet what would happen if Kyiv was surrounded. Negotiators from both Ukraine and Russia have agreed to create ""humanitarian corridors"" to let citizens escape the fighting. It's possible Ukrainian forces could use these temporary ceasefires to resupply, as it was agreed food and water could be delivered to cities where there's been the heaviest fighting. For now, supermarkets and pharmacies can stay open in cities. Stock is more limited and there are long queues though. The distant rumbling of shells exploding is becoming more continuous as well. You become quite sensitive to the smallest changes. Occasionally a crackle of gunfire will make you jump. Russian troops are continuing to mostly advance from the east and north, and the worry is Kyiv will find itself under a form of military chokehold, as we've seen with other cities.

"Re:Store shops, which sell Apple products in Russia, have been closed. Apple has become the latest major firm to halt all product sales in Russia, in a widening corporate backlash to the country's invasion of Ukraine. The tech giant was said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the Russian invasion and stands with those ""suffering as a result of the violence"". Apple Pay and other services such as Apple Maps have also been limited. Nike did not comment on the conflict but customers are no longer able to order its products online. An automated message said Nike was halting online orders because it could not guarantee delivery of goods to customers in Russia. However, the website directed customers to their nearest Nike stores. One Ukrainian member of parliament, Lesia Vsylenko,tweeted,externalthat the sportswear giant's move was a great example of how private companies could impose sanctions against Russia. Russians can no longer order Nike products online A series of high profile brands have pulled back from Russia in recent days, including film studios, carmakers and technology firms. Google has removed Russian state-funded publishers such as RT from its features. Mobile banking apps in Russian, such as Russia's VTB Bank's app, may soon not function fully on devices using Apple's iOS operating system, according to news agency RIA. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant? Apple said in a statement that the firm had disabled both traffic and live incidents in Apple Maps in Ukraine as a ""safety and precautionary measure for Ukrainian citizens"". Last week, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov published an open letter to Apple on Twitter, in which he asked Apple to cut Russia off from its products, services, and App Store.

Apple's iPhones are the third best-selling smartphone in Russia, supplying about 13% of all the handsets sold last year,according to market research firm Counterpoint,external.However that represents less than 2% of Apple's global iPhone sales. Earlier, Google restricted news firms funded by the Russian government from advertising tools and some features on YouTube. ""We are committed to complying with all sanctions requirements and we continue to monitor the latest guidance,"" the company wrote in a blog post. The company also told the BBC that Google Pay had been limited in the country - for those using sanctioned banks. Google has not, however, blocked Google Pay in Russia. Google also said ""most of our services (like Search, Maps and YouTube) currently remain available in Russia, continuing to provide access to global information and perspectives."" Apple is generally fairly good at keeping its head down when it comes to global affairs. For example, it has faced criticism for not standing up to China over its treatment of Uyghurs. This move then is significant, and unusual, by the iPhone maker. One by one global brands have been moving to distance themselves from Russia - making the country look more and more isolated. But it was by no means certain that Apple would make this move. The company had started to receive criticism for its relative silence on Ukraine. The BBC had reached out to Apple for comment, but had not received a reply until this announcement. There are many phone companies in Russia, and plenty of alternatives to Apple products. People with iPhones will also still be able to use the App Store - the pause in sales will not have a huge immediate impact. But as brands desert Russia, its citizens will begin to notice that products they used to buy, simply aren't available anymore. Meanwhile, the Finnish network equipment maker Nokia said it would stop deliveries to Russia to comply with sanctions imposed on the country following the invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, Netflix also said it had ""no plans"" to add state-run channels to its Russian service. Russian regulations had required it to carry 20 free-to-air news, sports and entertainment channels in the country. The biggest shipping firms in the world, Danish Maersk and Geneva-based MSC, also suspended container shipping to and from the country on Tuesday. The UK has also banned ships from Russia in its updated sanctions. Russia supplies a sixth of the world's commodities so will now be cut off from a significant part of shipping trade. Motorbike firm Harley-Davidson also suspended business and shipments of its bikes to Russia. And US plane manufacturer Boeing Co said on Tuesday it was suspending parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines -  as well as major operations in Moscow after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"Russia has blocked access to Facebook Facebook has hit out at a ban on its platforms introduced in Russia on Friday amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia's communications regulator said the ban was a response to restrictions placed on its media there. It said there had been 26 cases of ""discrimination"" against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020. There were also reports that the use of Twitter had been restricted by the Russian regulator, Roskomnadzor, on Friday evening. Facebook's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said that ""soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information"". Facebook had previously been limited in the country, along with platforms including Twitter. Although its use was restricted, Facebook had not been blocked entirely in the country. On Friday Russian media quoted the regulator as saying that Twitter had been restricted following a request by the prosecutor general from 24 February, the day of the invasion of Ukraine. Twitter did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the reports. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Apple halts sales and limits services in Russia Meta, the company that owns Facebook, said last week though that it had restricted Russian-backed outlets across the European Union and was globally demoting content from state-affiliated media. It had also refused to stop fact-checking several Russian state media outlets, including RT and Sputnik. Russia's media regulator said in a statement: ""Since October 2020, 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media and information resources by Facebook have been recorded."" The statement says,externalthe block on Facebook platforms has been introduced ""to prevent violations of the key principles of the free flow of information"". In response Meta said: ""We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organize for action.""

The White House said it was ""deeply concerned"" by Russia's decision to block the US company, and said the move was part of a broader effort to ""choke off information"". ""This is part of their effort ... to cut off a range of information from their public,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said, adding that the US was also ""concerned about the threat on freedom of speech in the country"". The ban comes after Russia's Parliament passed a new law this week imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military. The BBC also said it would temporarily suspend the work of all its journalists and support staff in Russia following the introduction of the law. Other technology and social media giants have faced pressure to respond to the crisis in Ukraine from investors and their users. Apple, for example, has halted all product sales in Russia, and limited other services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Its retail stores in the country have closed as well.

"Living in the basement - Rustam, Liana, Vera, and Tyson the cat Seven days which sparked a burning patriotic resolve in Ukraine, which propelled people the world over, from presidents and prime ministers, bankers and business leaders, football stars to figure skaters, artists and activists, to stand up and be counted to condemn Russia's aggression. The Russian rouble collapsed, the UN General Assembly called on Moscow to pull out; Russian leaders denounced this ""Russiaphobic frenzy"". And, on the ground, swathes of Europe's second-largest country were reduced to smoking ruins, a harrowing echo of Russia's blistering campaigns in Grozny and Aleppo. In the days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv was a European city of golden-domed cathedrals gleaming in the night, brightly-lit restaurants serving steaming bowls of borsch, corner kiosks pouring coffee behind frosty winter windows. And the world was a place where many thought a blitzkrieg across a border was only history's business. At the Munich Security Conference, many a government minister quietly told me ""I just don't think it will happen"". And, of course, not against the capital. But in her home in Kyiv, 37-year-old Liana was ready with bags packed, including some books; clothes ironed, enough money from an ATM to last a while. Her mother Vera refused to do the same. Her friends poked fun at her. But Liana's son Rustam, a bespectacled 13-year-old wired to his smartphone, was ready too. In the dead of night on Thursday 24 February, in a city which couldn't sleep, rumours and reports electrified social media and exploded in chat groups. This snippet ""Russian action will begin at 4am"" shot through cyberspace with the kind of chilling precision Western intelligence reports had used for weeks to warn of ""an imminent invasion"" by nearly 200,000 Russian troops and heavy weaponry now massed along the borders. Local flights kept cancelling, parents wondered if they should take their children to school in the morning, journalists started asking each other if they were staying. By 05:00, posts cascaded across the internet - ""hearing thuds"" in Kyiv, Kramatorsk, Melitopol, Chernobyl, Odessa. The list was long. At 05:58, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted ""Putin has launched a full-scale invasion"". Hours earlier, President Vladimir Putin had announced the start of a ""special military operation"" in eastern Ukraine. At 06:00 Liana called her mother. ""I told you so. Are you packed?"" By nightfall, roads out of Kyiv were gridlocked. Homes were emptied of energy as a city went underground, to basements and bomb shelters, to subway stations with marble stairways and magnificent mosaics built deep below in the 1960s to also double as Cold War bunkers. It was a day which ended the tidy life of Liana, who runs a small office supply company, and terrified her mammoth Maine Coon cat, who found he couldn't live up to his namesake - the US professional boxer Mike Tyson known as Iron Mike. I met them all in a cavernous basement in the city centre, two floors below ground, where our BBC team also took shelter. A tight-knit family, including mother Vera with a shock of red hair and an even warmer smile, took up residence on thin mats on the hard floor next to ours. Lyse broadcasting from the basement ""It was a difficult night,"" declared champion boxer-turned-mayor Vitali Klitschko as the day dawned on Saturday with news that Russian forces were now advancing on Ukrainian cities from the north, east, and south. ""Russian troops are not in our city,"" he reassured ""Kyivians"" who woke - if they slept at all - asking that very question. His rallying cry was amplified hours later, on that day, and every day after, by the comedian-turned-president-in-a-suit-turned-wartime-leader-in-olive-green-attire. ""We won't lay down our arms,' President Volodmyr Zelensky declared, rebuffing ""fake news"" that he'd done the opposite. ""Are you worried?"" I asked Liana. ""I can't be sad, I must be hopeful to support our president,"" she exclaimed in her own act of resistance underground. Tyson, however, was hiding upstairs, under a bed. And Liana worried about her father living north of the capital, in a village close to Chernobyl, now occupied by Russian forces. He'd crept out of his home last night, crawling through fields under cover of darkness, to see Russian troops throwing tarpaulin over heavy weaponry to hide them from view. In Kyiv, air raid sirens were now blaring day and night, a chilling soundtrack of the city. A weekend curfew came in force. We discreetly rigged up a smartphone to broadcast from the basement where at least five dogs, including Kurt a puffy white Pomeranian named after the American singer-songwriter, and Andrew, a trembling Yorkshire terrier, never seemed to bark. On Sunday, Liana and Vera rushed pell-mell toward me. ""What happened?"" I asked, trying to suppress a note of worry. ""Thank you, thank you!"" they shouted excitedly, words tumbling over the other. Their friends in the US, Britain, and the UAE had sent them screenshots of our BBC broadcast. There they were, in the corner of the screen, quietly sitting along the wall. ""Now they know we're safe!"" they gushed, reflecting that surge of anxiety worldwide in the large Ukrainian diaspora as the invasion intensified. But news from Liana's father was ominous. He could hear Russian tanks rumbling past, heading south towards Kyiv. His electricity was now cut; he cooked potato soup outside, on an open fire in sub-zero temperatures, all the while trying to hide the flame. By Monday, when the weekend curfew lifted, satellite images shared by Maxar technology revealed a massive Russian armoured column, stretching along 40 miles (64km) of road, stopped just 20 miles from Kyiv. The plight of other cities was even more foreboding. Residential areas of Kharkiv, the second largest city to the west, were being pounded - so was Chernihiv to the north. Sleeping quarters Thin mats have been replaced by mattresses in this new subterranean world - Ukraine beds down and digs in. All through the night, smartphones glow under covers.  Liana, like everyone else, connects incessantly with friends and family across Ukraine and beyond. A Russian missile has slammed into her father's vegetable garden, smashing his sustenance for the long run. Rustam, intense at the best of times, is now an extension of his phone saturated by everything Ukraine. Sometimes Tyson the cat emerges from under his bed above ground for a comforting cuddle. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has vowed to continue the offensive until ""its goals are achieved"". It's been a week of war. Unparalleled sanctions imposed on Russia are being described as economic war. A war crimes investigation has already been launched, and everyone everywhere is taking a stand. Even the International Feline Federation (FIFe) has banned the import of any Russian breeds of cats. The southern city of Kherson has fallen. Mariupol is encircled by Russian forces, without electricity, running water, or enough food. The armoured convoy north of Kyiv still hasn't made its move. And Liana is in a flood of tears. ""Eight Russian soldiers barged into my father's house last night looking for cigarettes, and they've taken over his house,"" she wails. She hears a story about a family who tried to flee and was shot dead on the spot. They're looking for young men able to fight. She says her elderly father sits in a chair and doesn't dare move. In some areas, whole neighbourhoods have been obliterated by Russian firepower or seem to be under its sway. Now it's the second week. More than a million Ukrainians have fled. Many are staying to pick up guns to fight. ""We are the nation that broke the plans of the enemy in the first week,"" boasts President Zelensky in his latest video message, still dressed in olive-green. President Putin announces his ""special military operation is going according to plan"", vowing to ""destroy this anti-Russia created by the West"". Last night Kyiv was rocked by explosions, coming ever closer to city centre, which painted the sky orange. When the night curfew lifts, Liana and her mother Vera make a dash to the shops to check for supplies - including cat food - on fast-emptying shelves. Then she settles in to try to read the tome she packed for what could be a long and anxious haul.

"Sainsbury's, Aldi, Asda and Waitrose have all announced they will axe Russian products amid the war in Ukraine. Sainsbury's will remove Russian Standard vodka and Karpayskiye black sunflower seeds from its shelves. Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, will no longer sell Russian vodka either. Asda's announcement will apply to about 100 products - mostly spirits, but also includes fish and some sweets. The supermarkets follow moves from the likes of Morrisons and Co-op, which said on Thursday that they would withdraw Russian-made vodka from sale. Sainsbury's said it would also change the name of chicken Kiev to ""chicken Kyiv"" to match the Ukrainian spelling of the capital. A spokesperson for Britain's second-biggest supermarket said: ""We stand united with the people of Ukraine. ""We have reviewed our product range and have decided to remove from sale all products that are 100% sourced from Russia."" Mohsin Issa, Asda's co-owner, said: ""We stand with our customers and colleagues who are shocked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine -  and our thoughts are with those people whose lives are affected by this crisis."" Meanwhile, the John Lewis Partnership said that it would also remove a line of Russian-made pizza oven pellets from sale in its department stores. ""We're working with our suppliers to review products that have components of Russian origin and will be seeking to mitigate further exposure to the region,"" a spokesperson said. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Why the Ukraine conflict could push up prices The Co-op, the first supermarket chain to announce such a move on Thursday, said that its decision was ""a sign of solidarity with the people of Ukraine"". It took Russian Standard vodka off sale with immediate effect as it is ""overtly marketed as being Russian"" and is produced in the country, a spokesperson for the Co-op said. Sainsbury's confirmed on Friday that it would, however, continue to sell JJ Whitley vodka products, after the manufacturer said it planned to move all production away from St Petersburg to Chorley in Lancashire. ""We support their announcement earlier in the week that they are moving all production to Chorley in the UK by the end of this month and will therefore continue to sell those products,"" it said. According to reports in theDaily Telegraph,externalnewspaper, Tesco is also considering renaming chicken Kiev to match the Ukrainian spelling of the capital city Kyiv. It has not yet confirmed whether or not it will remove Russian-sourced products, but has said previously it is following UK government rules on trading with the country. Elsewhere, other supermarkets in Europe have also taken action. The Netto discount chain has already stopped selling Russian products across its stores Germany, Poland and Denmark.

"John Stahl appearing at the Royal Court Theatre, London in 2016 Game Of Thrones actor John Stahl has died at the age of 68, his agent has confirmed. The Scottish actor played the role of Rickard Karstark in two series of the popular HBO fantasy show. He was also well known for playing Inverdarroch in the long-running soap opera Take The High Road. A statement from his agent Amanda Fitzalan Howard described him as ""an actor of remarkable skill and a stalwart of Scottish theatre"". Stahl, who was from Sauchie in Clackmannanshire, also appeared in numerous theatre productions during his career, including performances at The Royal Shakespeare Company and The National Theatre. Scottish screenwriter Peter May also remembered the actor and recalled how he had recently attended his online wedding. He said: ""Terribly sad to hear that my old friend, John Stahl, has passed. I wrote so many scenes for the character of Inverdarroch that he portrayed in Take The High Road. ""Only recently attended his online wedding. Saw him last in Adelaide, Australia, for a fun reunion. RIP John."" Writer Ian Rankin, best known for his Inspector Rebus novels, said he had hoped to work with the actor again after he featured in his play Long Shadows, describing his portrayal as ""terrifying and charismatic"".

"Russia has blocked access to Facebook Facebook has hit out at a ban on its platforms introduced in Russia on Friday amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia's communications regulator said the ban was a response to restrictions placed on its media there. It said there had been 26 cases of ""discrimination"" against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020. There were also reports that the use of Twitter had been restricted by the Russian regulator, Roskomnadzor, on Friday evening. Facebook's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said that ""soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information"". Facebook had previously been limited in the country, along with platforms including Twitter. Although its use was restricted, Facebook had not been blocked entirely in the country. On Friday Russian media quoted the regulator as saying that Twitter had been restricted following a request by the prosecutor general from 24 February, the day of the invasion of Ukraine. Twitter did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the reports. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Apple halts sales and limits services in Russia Meta, the company that owns Facebook, said last week though that it had restricted Russian-backed outlets across the European Union and was globally demoting content from state-affiliated media. It had also refused to stop fact-checking several Russian state media outlets, including RT and Sputnik. Russia's media regulator said in a statement: ""Since October 2020, 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media and information resources by Facebook have been recorded."" The statement says,externalthe block on Facebook platforms has been introduced ""to prevent violations of the key principles of the free flow of information"". In response Meta said: ""We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organize for action.""

The White House said it was ""deeply concerned"" by Russia's decision to block the US company, and said the move was part of a broader effort to ""choke off information"". ""This is part of their effort ... to cut off a range of information from their public,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said, adding that the US was also ""concerned about the threat on freedom of speech in the country"". The ban comes after Russia's Parliament passed a new law this week imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military. The BBC also said it would temporarily suspend the work of all its journalists and support staff in Russia following the introduction of the law. Other technology and social media giants have faced pressure to respond to the crisis in Ukraine from investors and their users. Apple, for example, has halted all product sales in Russia, and limited other services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Its retail stores in the country have closed as well.

"Viktor Zhora was giving a press conference on the cyber-conflict from an undisclosed location Ukraine's cyber-security authority says it is fighting a war in the digital realm, as well as on the ground. The ministry says it is facing constant cyber-attacks against its government and infrastructure networks, with individual officials now being targeted. It claimed that its cyber-defences are repelling most attacks. But it added that the cyber-conflict with Russia was unprecedented, describing it as a ""hybrid war"". In the first press conference since the war began, Viktor Zhora, deputy chairman of the State Service of Special Communications, said: ""These two wars [we are fighting] are part of this hybrid war. ""This is happening for the first time in history and I believe that cyber-war can only be ended with the end of conventional war, and we will do everything we can to bring this moment closer."" Mr Zhora said that his cyber-security teams have been working to defend critical Ukrainian web services successfully and that ""they are not afraid of Russian"" attacks on their power grids or nuclear sites. The Anonymous hacking collective has taken up cyber-arms against Russia In 2015 and 2016, hackers, thought to be under orders from the Kremlin, caused power cuts to Ukrainian cities. Western intelligence services have blamed Russia for other attacks on Ukraine, such as the NotPetya one in 2017. Cyber-attacks escalate against Ukrainian websites Ukraine invasion: How the war is being waged online Russia's vigilante hackers join the attack on Ukraine In the weeks leading up to the invasion, the country suffered three separate waves of low level cyber-attacks, one of which theUK and US has blamed on Russian military hackers.,external Government and financial service websites were knocked offline briefly, and some were defaced with a warning to Ukrainians to ""expect the worst"". At the same time, authorities discovered a more serious ""wiper"" attack, which removed the data from a small number of private company networks in Ukraine. However, the cyber-security world has been surprised by a lack of large impactful attacks from Russia during the war. Mr Zhora says they are happening but Ukraine's defences are blocking them. Since the invasion began, the ministry has also taken the highly controversial step of launching an ""IT Army of Ukraine"", which has been carrying out cyber-attacks on Russian targets. This included attempts to disrupt transport and power networks. Ukraine websites were defaced with a threatening message in February The Telegram group for the organisation now has 270,000 members, but the ministry estimates that there could be as many as 400,000 hackers fighting online for Ukraine. Mr Zhora defended the formation of the cyber-army, insisting that it is a ""volunteer movement"" and that no attacks on civilian computer networks are being carried out. ""We call it a cyber-resistance and we're doing everything possible to protect our land and our cyber-space. We are trying to protect our networks and to make the aggressor feel uncomfortable with their actions in cyber-space and in Ukrainian land. ""These cyber-warriors are not targeting civil targets, they are targeting military and government targets."" Other groups, including the hacker collective Anonymous, have joined the fight, declaring ""cyber-war"" on President Putin. The group claims to have been taking down Russian websites, defacing them and encouraging people to ""review bomb"" Russian businesses online with messages about the war. Mr Zhora says he can't condone the illegal hacking, but that normal peacetime rules don't apply. ""We do not welcome any illegal activity in cyber-space. We believe that every part should be responsible with their actions. But the world order changed on 24 February. ""We have a martial law here in Ukraine and I don't think that appealing to moral principles works, since our enemy doesn't have any principles.""

"Jack Ritchie took his own life in Vietnam in 2017 after years of gambling addiction A teacher with a gambling addiction who took his own life was failed by ""woefully inadequate"" warnings and treatments, a coroner has said. Jack Ritchie's disorder had ""spiralled out of control"" before his death aged 24, but the help available did not meet his needs, an inquest heard. The resulting ""feelings of shame and hopelessness"" had made him feel suicidal, coroner David Urpeth said. Mr Ritchie's parents said gambling was ""the root and trigger of Jack's death"". Speaking on the steps of Sheffield Town Hall, where the inquest was held, his mother Liz Ritchie said: ""Jack was abused by parasites who inflict life-threatening illness for profit and then blame the victims, making them feel that everything is their fault and that they are better off dead. ""As his family, we know that Jack was not the problem and in our grief we are also victims of predatory companies and a collusive government."" Man's gambling addiction began as teen Parents hope inquest will spur gambling law change Jack's father, Charles Ritchie said: ""The government accepted that our frontline NHS staff - our GPs, our nurses - had no training to be able to recognise, diagnose or treat gambling disorders. ""It must now be clear we need a statutory levy for the NHS to remove any gambling industry influence over information and treatment."" The two-week inquest heard Mr Ritchie, from Sheffield, had become hooked in his late teens when he would use fixed-odds terminals in betting shops. He spent the subsequent years battling with his addiction, but died while working in Vietnam in November 2017. Charles and Liz Ritchie set up the charity Gambling with Lives following the death of their son In a narrative conclusion, South Yorkshire senior coroner Mr Urpeth said gambling had been a factor in Mr Ritchie's death, which was a ""stark reminder of the terrible consequences that can flow from an addiction"". He said information about the dangers and associated treatments available at the time was ""woefully inadequate and failed to meet Jack's needs"". ""Jack did not understand that being addicted to gambling was not his fault,"" Mr Urpeth said. ""That lack of understanding led to feelings of shame and hopelessness which, in time, led to him feeling suicidal."" The coroner said he would be writing to a number of government departments with warnings about how future deaths could be prevented and particularly highlighted the need for more training for GPs about gambling disorders. He told the hearing that ""evidence showed there were still significant gaps"" in provision for gambling disorders and warnings about the dangers. Mr Ritchie's parents believe that failures on the part of UK authorities to address gambling issues contributed to their son's death. Mr Urpeth praised the couple for their campaigning, saying they had ""channelled their terrible loss into a tireless battle"" for reform, and that he believed they had done all they could to help their son. Mr and Mrs Ritchie believe the hearing is the first so-called Article 2 inquest in a case relating to suicide following gambling. This means its scope included an examination of whether any arm of the state breached its duty to protect their son's right to life. Following the inquest, a Gambling Commission spokesman said: ""Jack's death was a tragedy and we have met and spoken with Jack's parents on several occasions to understand and agree how we can learn from their experience to inform the way we work. ""These conversations, along with those of others who have experienced harm, strengthens our commitment to protect consumers and make Britain's gambling market fairer and safer.""

"Anchor Rahul Shivshankar (left) apologised after he realised the error An Indian news anchor has inspired jokes and memes after yelling at the wrong guest while debating the Ukraine crisis. Rahul Shivshankar berated a Ukrainian journalist for almost two minutes, thinking he was addressing Daniel McAdams, a US foreign policy commentator. He only realised his mistake when Mr McAdams - the other guest - spoke up. The exchange went viral, making ""McAdams"" a top Twitter trend in India. Indian viewers are used to news anchors shouting down their panellists and going on rants during their shows. Many of these anchors, including Mr Shivshankar, the editor-in-chief of popular English news channel Times Now, are accused of being biased towards India's governing party, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In this instance, Mr Shivshankar was speaking on his show India Upfront to Mr McAdams, executive director of the Ron Paul Institute, and Bohdan Nahaylo, chief editor of Kyiv Post. But the names and titles of the two men were wrongly placed on air, so Mr Nahaylo was identified as Mr McAdams and vice versa. The viral clip began with Mr Shivshankar asking ""Daniel McAdams"" to ""just take a bit of a chill pill"". Mr Nahaylo then responds that he doesn't want to relax as his country is at war. Mr Shivshankar proceeds to ask ""Mr McAdams"" to ""get off the fence"" and send US troops to Ukraine if he is so concerned about the country. He goes on to rant about ""colonial agendas"" and the Afghanistan war, interspersing ""Mr McAdams"" into every other sentence. The real Mr McAdams, in the meantime, is seen trying to make himself heard above the cacophony. ""I'm not talking!"" he finally manages to burst out. ""It's the other guy who's talking!"" But Mr Shivshankar, who thought he was now talking to his Ukrainian guest, responded that ""Mr McAdams"" had ""gone completely ballistic"" and should ""go fight alongside Ukrainians if he felt so strongly about the war"". ""Dear host, I haven't said a word yet. I don't know why you're yelling at me,"" the real Mr McAdams persists. ""I am not yelling at you, I am talking about Mr McAdams,"" an oblivious Mr Shivshankar responds. ""I AM Mr McAdams! I am Mr McAdams and I haven't said a word, so stop yelling at me!"" says Mr McAdams, generating a quiet ""oh"" from Mr Shivshankar, who then apologises, saying he got confused. The clip led to a lot of amusement on social media, with many pointing out that it was the kind of moment that could only be produced by the cacophonous Indian TV media. Allow Twitter content?

"A jump in the price of gas amid the Ukraine conflict has added to worries that annual UK household energy bills could reach Â£3,000. The cost of gas in Europe and the UK has hit record levels as fears persist that Russian supplies could be reduced. Higher costs for aluminium and copper also means UK shoppers are likely to face further price rises, the head of the London Metal Exchange has said. Economists have warned inflation, which tracks the cost of living, may hit 10%. Wholesale markets are where UK energy suppliers buy their gas to sell on to consumers. On Friday, wholesale gas prices for delivery to UK supplier jumped to 508p per therm. If prices remain high for long periods it will push up household bills, adding to cost of living pressures. Over the past few days, gas prices have been extremely volatile, but the trend has been upwards. On Thursday, an industry body warned thatUK household energy bills could reach as high as Â£3,000 a year. In addition, the recent surge in the cost of metals is also likely to push up the prices of some goods. Copper prices are at five-year highs, and other commodities have jumped in price since the Ukraine conflict began. Matthew Chamberlain, who leads the London Metal Exchange, told the BBC's Today programme that prices for canned goods and copper wiring may rise. ""We've seen aluminium and nickel up 30% since the beginning of the year, and that will ultimately be passed on to consumers when you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure."" Why are prices rising so quickly? Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Panmure Gordon economist Simon French told the BBC that the UK's inflation rate could now hit 10%. Sarah Hewin, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, agreed, warning that with rising gas prices feeding into higher energy bills, and increasing petrol and food prices, it was ""entirely feasible"" that inflation could move beyond the 7.5% rate that the Bank of England has predicted for April. ""Russia and Ukraine are important grain producers so we're likely to food prices rising here in the UK as well,"" she said. ""Overall, food, energy and transport account for around 25% of consumer prices. It's possible, if the crisis continues in the coming weeks, and even months, that inflation could move up to double digits in the UK"". UK petrol prices have hit another record, with the average price of a litre of petrol reaching Â£1.53 a litre, while diesel reached Â£1.57 a litre. This week, the price of Brent crude - the global oil benchmark - surged to more than $119 a barrel at one point, the highest since May 2012. On Friday, it was trading at around $114 a barrel. Stock markets across Europe tumbled on Friday following sharp falls in Asia after a fire broke out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the largest in Europe. London's FTSE 100 closed 3.5% down while France's CAC-40 index dropped 5% and Germany's Dax also fell 4.4%. Reflecting the sharp rise in commodity prices, Anglo-Russian gold producer Polymetal saw its share price in London jump by more than 25%. Evraz, the Russian steel-maker which counts oligarch Roman Abramovich as a major shareholder, also saw its share price jump by 23%. The fire at the Ukraine nuclear power plant happened after Russia troops shelled the site. Some investor concerns were eased after officials said the plant's safety was ""secured"". The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later said that it had spoken to Ukraine's leadership and had been told important equipment at the plant was still working. The shelling has drawn international condemnation, with the US President Joe Biden joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in urging Russia to cease the shelling and allow firefighters to access the site. In recent days, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent shockwaves through the global financial and energy markets, as investors try to understand the implications of sanctions and supply chain disruptions. The price of gold, which is regarded as a safer asset in times of uncertainty, has increased by 7.3% in a month to $1,938 per ounce. The Russian rouble has hit a record low against the US dollar as countries around the world impose tough sanctions on the country. Meanwhile, more British executives are bowing to pressure to quit Russian companies. James Rutherford on Thursday became the latest UK national to step down from a Russian company's board, resigning from the Roman Abramovich-backed steel firm Evraz. It came after the business group the Institute of Directors called on Britons to resign from the boards of Russian companies, due to the invasion of Ukraine.

"David Malpass says ""it's too early to say"" if the war in Ukraine will lead to a global recession The war in Ukraine is ""a catastrophe"" for the world which will cut global economic growth, the president of the World Bank has told the BBC. ""The war in Ukraine comes at a bad time for the world because inflation was already rising,"" said David Malpass. He stressed his biggest concern is ""about the pure human loss of lives"" that is occurring. Thousands of civilians and soldiers are thought to have been killed by the fighting. Mr Malpass said the economic impact of the war stretches beyond Ukraine's borders, and the rises in global energy prices in particular ""hit the poor the most, as does inflation"". Food prices have also been pushed up by the war, and ""are a very real consideration and problem for people in poor countries"". Why the Ukraine conflict could push up prices Don't buy Russian oil, says Ukraine energy giant Why the world is waging economic war on Russia Mr Malpass points out that both Russia and Ukraine are big food producers. Ukraine is the world's biggest producer of sunflower oil, with Russia number two, according to S&P Global Platts. Between them they account for 60% of global production. The two countries also account for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan. Wheat prices on the Chicago future exchange have been trading at 14-year highs. Ukraine is the world's biggest producer of sunflower oil but the war has stopped exports Russian supplies of these commodities are being restricted because of the widespread sanctions which make it hard for the rest of the world to buy its products. Ukrainian supplies have been stopped because fighting has closed the country's ports. ""There's no way to adjust quickly enough to the loss of supply from Ukraine and from Russia, and so that adds to prices,"" said Mr Malpass. He says the same is true of Russian energy supplies, and it is particularly damaging for western Europe, where governments have ""neglected other aspects of how to have enough electricity"". About 39% of the EU's electricity comes from power stations that burn fossil fuels, andRussia is the biggest source of that oil and gas. As the EU looks to accelerate its transition to other energy sources, Vladimir Putin's government ""may permanently lose some of their markets"", said Mr Malpass. Such a loss of income is just one way this war will dent living standards in Russia, so too will thefall in the value of the roubleand the inflation that brings. The war in Ukraine will cause more problems for a global economy, David Malpass says The World Bank has committed $7.9bn to help develop Ukraine's economy since the 2014 revolution. That money has helped the country institute wide-ranging economic reforms including privatisations in the energy and banking sectors, as well as efforts to make its farmland more productive. Less than a month before the Russian invasion Ukraine's independent central bank forecast that the $180bn economy would grow 3.4% this year, after the difficulties of the pandemic. However, war means ""a catastrophic impact for our economy, for the region overall"", according to Alexander Rodnyansky, who is an economic adviser to President Zelensky. He adds: ""We've already seen massive destructions of roads and bridges and infrastructure. So that is something that will have to be rebuilt over the years when the war is over. ""It's hard to put a number on that right now, but we can already see that we've given up percentages and GDP growth just because of what happened already."" With hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the country or joining the fight against Russia the workforce has shrunk dramatically, which is making it difficult to keep the wartime economy going. ""Production is just collapsing"", says Mr Rodnyansky, who says there are disruptions to vital food and energy supplies. War is having ""a catastrophic impact"" on Ukraine's economy, says Alexander Rodnyansky Big western companies, such as food manufacturer Nestle and brewer Carlsberg, have big operations in Ukraine that have been disrupted by the war. A surge of foreign investment in recent years helped to reshape the Ukrainian economy amid a corruption crackdown that was part of a deal for development support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia 'I can't pay' - Russians feel the pain of sanctions Mr Rodnyansky said that shift ""absolutely reflects the people's desire in Ukraine to integrate with the European Union, to be part of the European family, and to just have a democratic, strong, economically free country that's flourishing"". He says there has been a drive to digitisation that has made it easier to do business in the country: ""It stands in stark contrast to what happens in Russiaâ¦ and that's perhaps another reason why the Russian leader just so blatantly hates everything about Ukraine and what Ukraine stands for."" This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on Russian gas and oil Mr Malpass is concerned that the war will do long term damage to those changes that Ukraine's economy and people have benefited from. A desire to stop them unravelling is one reason why the World Bank is in the process of putting together a $350m aid package for Ukraine which is expected to be approved within the next few days. ""It will help fund the budget of Ukraine,"" said Mr Malpass. With tax revenues collapsing because of the war it will help pay for things such as government salaries, social welfare and emergency supplies. He is conscious that as well as the risk to the lives of millions of Ukrainian, the war could ""be a lasting [economic] setback, where Russia pulls them toward Russia, under the ideas, the goals of an individual leader"". ""Their per capita income has fallen below China's because in part because of economic mismanagement, and because they really have maintained such a centralised system of decision making under Putin for now, ever since 2000."" He adds: ""The risk is that Ukraine is controlled by that."" The warnings by Mr Malpass came as the British Chambers of Commerceâ¯(BCC) cut its growth forecast for the UK's economy, amid soaring inflation, tax rises, and global shocks including Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The BCC predicts the UK will grow by 3.6% this year, down from its previous forecast of 4.2%, with consumer spending expected to slow as household incomes come under pressure from rising inflation. The new estimate is less than half the 7.5% growth rate seen last year, when the UK's economy rebounded from the Covid-induced slump in 2020.

"MPs have backed legislation to stop Vladimir Putin's allies from laundering money and hiding wealth in the UK. TheEconomic Crime Actbecame law in March after being rushed through Parliament. The UK is thought to beawash with Russian cashand other money looted from the former Soviet Union. That cash is buried in vast amounts of property - from office blocks to mega mansions - and the true owners are hidden in a web of secretive shell companies. These are organisations that only exist on paper and are registered in offshore tax havens. The Economic Crime Act is meant to help end that -  having been promised since 2016. It was shelved earlier in 202,  amid much criticism - including from the fraud minister,Lord Agnew, who quit. Now, the invasion of Ukraine has prompted a government U-turn. Only part of the original plan has made it into law because there's not enough Parliamentary time to deal with all proposals. The legislation: creates a register of overseas ownership of UK land and property - with punishments for withholding details overhauls Unexplained Wealth Orders makes it easier to prosecute anyone involved in sanctions-busting If an individual owns a property, investigators and the public can find out who they are. The police will often seize property belonging to British drug bosses because it's easy to identify, and will have been bought with their criminal wealth. But discovering who owns property becomes more difficult if it is registered to an overseas company whose ultimate beneficiaries are hidden from view. And that means it's harder to uncover money stolen from abroad as it's laundered through the British property market. Let's take the case of the first successful Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). That's a legal tool that allows the National Crime Agency (NCA) to go to court to seize a property if there's no apparent legitimate source of the wealth behind the purchase. Zamira Hajiyeva: Denied wrongdoing UWOs are designed to take on incredibly rich people believed to have been associated with international corruption, organised criminals and their helpers. The first target was Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of an Azerbaijan banker. Her husband was jailed for embezzling millions from the state - Mrs Hajiyeva herself denies wrongdoing. Woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods revealed How to spend Â£16m in Harrods She was living in a Â£15m home near Harrods, where she spent millions over a decade. The Land Registry showed the owner wasn't her, but a mystery company in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), a tax haven. The Land Registry record showing who owned the home Zamira Hajiyeva lived in (some information redacted by the BBC for privacy law reasons) It was only with the help of BVI investigators that the NCA could legally link Mrs Hajiyeva to the home and force her to explain in court how she could afford it. When a lawyer typically registers ownership of land and property, they will have to declare in public records who ultimately benefits from it. That means corrupt politicians hiding wealth in British mansions, office blocks and luxury apartments, may at long last, become visible. The registry will apply to any property bought in the last 20 years, or since 2014 in Scotland. If the person registering the property fails to identify the beneficiary, the property will be, in effect, frozen - the owner won't be able lease it, sell it or raise a mortgage. Dirty money campaigners are delighted, but still have concerns. One fear is that it may be too difficult to prosecute lawyers or company agents who fail to reveal beneficiaries - because a court would have to be sure they had acted knowingly or recklessly. Another concern is that the package has too many loopholes to ensure that ultimate beneficial owners become known. For instance, if someone uses a front company, registered in Panama, to legally own property on their behalf - and there's no shareholder who owns more than a quarter of that company, then the register won't reveal their identity. ""For the sufficiently determined owner of a UK property who wants to remain anonymous, we think the Act leaves loopholes,"" says George Crozier, spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Taxation. Dr Susan Hawley of Spotlight on Corruption, an expert campaign group on dirty money, warns the law won't ""unpack the Russian doll'. Others predict that suspects - such as people who may be holding property for President Putin - could spirit wealth out of the country before the law is in force. The government abandoned its original proposal to give overseas entities 18 months to comply with the disclosure rules, by changing the deadline to six months. Labour had proposed 28 days - but that was defeated. ""I imagine that a lot of people in Kensington [one of London's most expensive areas] will be sticking property on Rightmove,"" says Helena Wood, a financial crime expert at the Rusi think tank. ""Practically speaking, these measures were never going to deal with [current] dodgy Russian assets. But they will mean it will be less likely that someone will want to hide money in the UK."" UWOs, created in 2017, are trumpeted by ministers as an incredibly powerful weapon - but they have in fact only been used against four targets. High Court: NCA has to allocate huge legal resources to fighting money laundering cases That's because the NCA lost one of its test cases in 2020, which not only exposed flaws in the power, but left the taxpayer with a near Â£1m legal bill. When the Intelligence and Security Committeeinvestigated Russia's role in the UK,external, Lynne Owens, the then head of the NCA, bluntly admitted that using UWOs to pursue the richest and most powerful targets carried huge financial risks. And so critics of the government say the agency hasn't the financial clout or legal powers to make UWOs workable. The Economic Crime Bill would permit investigators to target people who manage properties within complicated offshore arrangements, even if they're not the actual beneficiary. That will immediately widen the number of available targets. They'll also be given far more legal time to draw up a copper-bottomed case for court. But most importantly, the NCA will be protected against crippling legal costs, providing they acted reasonable and properly. Helena Wood at Rusi says the government could do more to financially protect the NCA across all its asset recovery powers - and failing to do so defeats the whole point of Parliament creating laws to investigate super-rich suspects. Dr Susan Hawley says the government must seize the opportunity. ""The NCA needs one big properly-funded anti-corruption unit - from looking at professional ""enablers"", like accountants and lawyers, through to people involved in busting sanctions,"" she says. ""Without a significant boost in resources none of these measures are going to work.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Starmer says the 'baton has passed' after Birmingham Erdington by-election win Sir Keir Starmer has hailed Paulette Hamilton's victory in the Birmingham Erdington by-election as the passing of a ""baton"" from one ""great champion of working people"" to another. The former nurse polled 9,413 votes, 55% of ballots cast, as Labour increased its vote share. She has become Birmingham's first black MP and revealed her father died just as her campaign started. The by-election was held following the sudden death of Jack Dromey. The veteran MP died in January aged 73 and had held the seat since 2010. Speaking on a visit to Birmingham following the win, the Labour leader said: ""Jack would be smiling this morning... looking down seeing that baton being passed to Paulette, a champion of working people for Erdington."" Addressing Ms Hamilton, he said: ""You will be a fantastic champion for them, bringing them what they want most - the security of knowing they've got a champion for them in Parliament, the prosperity that they want for themselves, their businesses, their communities, and the respect that they so richly deserve."" Sir Keir, who had earliertweeted,externalthat Ms Hamilton had ""made history"", added her swearing in as an MP on Monday would be a ""special moment"". This video can not be played Labour's Paulette Hamilton celebrates becoming Birmingham's newest MP Following her win, she said: ""I never thought I'd be running to be an MP, but the fact that I am now not only the MP for Erdington but the first black woman - the first woman to ever get the position - I am delighted and I am still pinching myself."" She said after talking to residents during the campaign, she believed the regeneration of the high street was a priority, along with crime and housing. But she said: ""The big hidden one which keeps coming up is the economic issues around the economic crisis - the issues around gas and electricity bills. ""People are really concerned about will they be able to eat or pay their bills."" Twelve candidates stood in the election and the turnout was 27%, compared with 50.3% in the 2019 general election. Robert Alden, Conservative leader at the city council, had been vying to become the first Tory MP for the constituency since 1936. He won 6,147, or 36% of votes, giving Ms Hamilton a majority of 3,266. Jack Dromey, 73, had held the Erdington seat since 2010 In her victory speech, Ms Hamilton said she was ""exhausted but delighted"". ""But I'd also like to say a special thank you to Keir Starmer for his endless support - even when my dad died, they were there, they wrapped me in cotton wool and they supported me, and my dad isn't even buried yet but they were there when I was crying."" Thanking her family and campaign team, she also gave thanks to police and council staff for the ""smooth running"" of the count operation. ""I know it's a lot of work that often goes unmentioned, so thank you for your endless professionalism and commitment to the democratic process,"" she added. ""Something I think we all treasure even more following the events in Europe."" Prior to the election, Conservative MPs Tom Hunt and Gary Sambrookhad called on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to suspend Ms Hamilton, following comments she made at an event titled ""The Ballot or the Bullet - Does your vote count?"" in 2015 about increasing ethnic minorities' representation in politics. Mr Hunt added she should have the party whip withdrawn if she was elected. Voter turnout was 27% with 17,016 ballots cast in the election A Labour spokesman said: ""In Paulette, the people of Birmingham Erdington have elected a great local champion. ""We're delighted that this campaign has seen the first black MP elected from a Birmingham constituency."" Some 17,016 ballots were cast in the election, in an electorate of 62,996. Buki Hannaway said Ms Hamilton would be representing the wider black community in the city Some in the local black community said they were surprised the city had not had a black MP before. Shopkeeper Buki Hannaway said it was ""shocking"" and ""really quite sad"". But she welcomed the development and said: ""It's positive change for me personally as a local resident and as someone who works in the area as well."" She also believes Ms Hamilton will feel the pressure of being the first and said: ""It's with anything, across society. If you're the first, you're carrying everybody with you and their expectations."" Labour increased their vote share from the 2019 general election This was a by-election which started with the background of investigations into parties at Downing Street and ended overshadowed by war in Ukraine. It's a case of as you were for the two main parties, though Labour's vote share increased and the Conservatives' reduced slightly. The Lib Dems meanwhile were beaten down to sixth behind the Trade Unionist Socialist Coalition, Reform Party and the Greens. This result may not tell us a huge amount about the standing of the two parties with voters, but it is a landmark moment, as Paulette Hamilton becomes the first black MP to represent a Birmingham constituency. Mr Alden said the low turnout was a reflection Labour was not ""ready to govern"". ""This is a seat that has been Labour over the last 85 years... the fact the majority is so small here today is really a damning indictment where the Labour party is nationally,"" he added. Conservative candidate Robert Alden said the result was a ""damning indictment"" of Labour nationally Mr Dromey, a shadow minister married to fellow Labour MP Harriet Harman, made his name in politics through the union movement, as a leading figure in the Transport and General Workers' Union, which later became Unite. In the 2019 general election he won the seat with 17,720 of votes cast. A by-election is held when a seat becomes vacant when an MP resigns or dies, is declared bankrupt, takes a seat in the House of Lords or is convicted of a serious criminal offence.

"Jack Ritchie took his own life in Vietnam in 2017 after years of gambling addiction A teacher with a gambling addiction who took his own life was failed by ""woefully inadequate"" warnings and treatments, a coroner has said. Jack Ritchie's disorder had ""spiralled out of control"" before his death aged 24, but the help available did not meet his needs, an inquest heard. The resulting ""feelings of shame and hopelessness"" had made him feel suicidal, coroner David Urpeth said. Mr Ritchie's parents said gambling was ""the root and trigger of Jack's death"". Speaking on the steps of Sheffield Town Hall, where the inquest was held, his mother Liz Ritchie said: ""Jack was abused by parasites who inflict life-threatening illness for profit and then blame the victims, making them feel that everything is their fault and that they are better off dead. ""As his family, we know that Jack was not the problem and in our grief we are also victims of predatory companies and a collusive government."" Man's gambling addiction began as teen Parents hope inquest will spur gambling law change Jack's father, Charles Ritchie said: ""The government accepted that our frontline NHS staff - our GPs, our nurses - had no training to be able to recognise, diagnose or treat gambling disorders. ""It must now be clear we need a statutory levy for the NHS to remove any gambling industry influence over information and treatment."" The two-week inquest heard Mr Ritchie, from Sheffield, had become hooked in his late teens when he would use fixed-odds terminals in betting shops. He spent the subsequent years battling with his addiction, but died while working in Vietnam in November 2017. Charles and Liz Ritchie set up the charity Gambling with Lives following the death of their son In a narrative conclusion, South Yorkshire senior coroner Mr Urpeth said gambling had been a factor in Mr Ritchie's death, which was a ""stark reminder of the terrible consequences that can flow from an addiction"". He said information about the dangers and associated treatments available at the time was ""woefully inadequate and failed to meet Jack's needs"". ""Jack did not understand that being addicted to gambling was not his fault,"" Mr Urpeth said. ""That lack of understanding led to feelings of shame and hopelessness which, in time, led to him feeling suicidal."" The coroner said he would be writing to a number of government departments with warnings about how future deaths could be prevented and particularly highlighted the need for more training for GPs about gambling disorders. He told the hearing that ""evidence showed there were still significant gaps"" in provision for gambling disorders and warnings about the dangers. Mr Ritchie's parents believe that failures on the part of UK authorities to address gambling issues contributed to their son's death. Mr Urpeth praised the couple for their campaigning, saying they had ""channelled their terrible loss into a tireless battle"" for reform, and that he believed they had done all they could to help their son. Mr and Mrs Ritchie believe the hearing is the first so-called Article 2 inquest in a case relating to suicide following gambling. This means its scope included an examination of whether any arm of the state breached its duty to protect their son's right to life. Following the inquest, a Gambling Commission spokesman said: ""Jack's death was a tragedy and we have met and spoken with Jack's parents on several occasions to understand and agree how we can learn from their experience to inform the way we work. ""These conversations, along with those of others who have experienced harm, strengthens our commitment to protect consumers and make Britain's gambling market fairer and safer.""

Prior to the election, Conservative MPs Tom Hunt and Gary Sambrookhad called on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to suspend Ms Hamilton, following comments she made at an event titled ""The Ballot or the Bullet - Does your vote count?"" in 2015 about increasing ethnic minorities' representation in politics. Mr Hunt added she should have the party whip withdrawn if she was elected. Voter turnout was 27% with 17,016 ballots cast in the election A Labour spokesman said: ""In Paulette, the people of Birmingham Erdington have elected a great local champion. ""We're delighted that this campaign has seen the first black MP elected from a Birmingham constituency."" Some 17,016 ballots were cast in the election, in an electorate of 62,996. Buki Hannaway said Ms Hamilton would be representing the wider black community in the city Some in the local black community said they were surprised the city had not had a black MP before. Shopkeeper Buki Hannaway said it was ""shocking"" and ""really quite sad"". But she welcomed the development and said: ""It's positive change for me personally as a local resident and as someone who works in the area as well."" She also believes Ms Hamilton will feel the pressure of being the first and said: ""It's with anything, across society. If you're the first, you're carrying everybody with you and their expectations."" Labour increased their vote share from the 2019 general election This was a by-election which started with the background of investigations into parties at Downing Street and ended overshadowed by war in Ukraine. It's a case of as you were for the two main parties, though Labour's vote share increased and the Conservatives' reduced slightly. The Lib Dems meanwhile were beaten down to sixth behind the Trade Unionist Socialist Coalition, Reform Party and the Greens. This result may not tell us a huge amount about the standing of the two parties with voters, but it is a landmark moment, as Paulette Hamilton becomes the first black MP to represent a Birmingham constituency. Mr Alden said the low turnout was a reflection Labour was not ""ready to govern"". ""This is a seat that has been Labour over the last 85 years... the fact the majority is so small here today is really a damning indictment where the Labour party is nationally,"" he added. Conservative candidate Robert Alden said the result was a ""damning indictment"" of Labour nationally Mr Dromey, a shadow minister married to fellow Labour MP Harriet Harman, made his name in politics through the union movement, as a leading figure in the Transport and General Workers' Union, which later became Unite. In the 2019 general election he won the seat with 17,720 of votes cast. A by-election is held when a seat becomes vacant when an MP resigns or dies, is declared bankrupt, takes a seat in the House of Lords or is convicted of a serious criminal offence.

"Living in the basement - Rustam, Liana, Vera, and Tyson the cat Seven days which sparked a burning patriotic resolve in Ukraine, which propelled people the world over, from presidents and prime ministers, bankers and business leaders, football stars to figure skaters, artists and activists, to stand up and be counted to condemn Russia's aggression. The Russian rouble collapsed, the UN General Assembly called on Moscow to pull out; Russian leaders denounced this ""Russiaphobic frenzy"". And, on the ground, swathes of Europe's second-largest country were reduced to smoking ruins, a harrowing echo of Russia's blistering campaigns in Grozny and Aleppo. In the days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv was a European city of golden-domed cathedrals gleaming in the night, brightly-lit restaurants serving steaming bowls of borsch, corner kiosks pouring coffee behind frosty winter windows. And the world was a place where many thought a blitzkrieg across a border was only history's business. At the Munich Security Conference, many a government minister quietly told me ""I just don't think it will happen"". And, of course, not against the capital. But in her home in Kyiv, 37-year-old Liana was ready with bags packed, including some books; clothes ironed, enough money from an ATM to last a while. Her mother Vera refused to do the same. Her friends poked fun at her. But Liana's son Rustam, a bespectacled 13-year-old wired to his smartphone, was ready too. In the dead of night on Thursday 24 February, in a city which couldn't sleep, rumours and reports electrified social media and exploded in chat groups. This snippet ""Russian action will begin at 4am"" shot through cyberspace with the kind of chilling precision Western intelligence reports had used for weeks to warn of ""an imminent invasion"" by nearly 200,000 Russian troops and heavy weaponry now massed along the borders. Local flights kept cancelling, parents wondered if they should take their children to school in the morning, journalists started asking each other if they were staying. By 05:00, posts cascaded across the internet - ""hearing thuds"" in Kyiv, Kramatorsk, Melitopol, Chernobyl, Odessa. The list was long. At 05:58, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted ""Putin has launched a full-scale invasion"". Hours earlier, President Vladimir Putin had announced the start of a ""special military operation"" in eastern Ukraine. At 06:00 Liana called her mother. ""I told you so. Are you packed?"" By nightfall, roads out of Kyiv were gridlocked. Homes were emptied of energy as a city went underground, to basements and bomb shelters, to subway stations with marble stairways and magnificent mosaics built deep below in the 1960s to also double as Cold War bunkers. It was a day which ended the tidy life of Liana, who runs a small office supply company, and terrified her mammoth Maine Coon cat, who found he couldn't live up to his namesake - the US professional boxer Mike Tyson known as Iron Mike. I met them all in a cavernous basement in the city centre, two floors below ground, where our BBC team also took shelter. A tight-knit family, including mother Vera with a shock of red hair and an even warmer smile, took up residence on thin mats on the hard floor next to ours. Lyse broadcasting from the basement ""It was a difficult night,"" declared champion boxer-turned-mayor Vitali Klitschko as the day dawned on Saturday with news that Russian forces were now advancing on Ukrainian cities from the north, east, and south. ""Russian troops are not in our city,"" he reassured ""Kyivians"" who woke - if they slept at all - asking that very question. His rallying cry was amplified hours later, on that day, and every day after, by the comedian-turned-president-in-a-suit-turned-wartime-leader-in-olive-green-attire. ""We won't lay down our arms,' President Volodmyr Zelensky declared, rebuffing ""fake news"" that he'd done the opposite. ""Are you worried?"" I asked Liana. ""I can't be sad, I must be hopeful to support our president,"" she exclaimed in her own act of resistance underground. Tyson, however, was hiding upstairs, under a bed. And Liana worried about her father living north of the capital, in a village close to Chernobyl, now occupied by Russian forces. He'd crept out of his home last night, crawling through fields under cover of darkness, to see Russian troops throwing tarpaulin over heavy weaponry to hide them from view. In Kyiv, air raid sirens were now blaring day and night, a chilling soundtrack of the city. A weekend curfew came in force. We discreetly rigged up a smartphone to broadcast from the basement where at least five dogs, including Kurt a puffy white Pomeranian named after the American singer-songwriter, and Andrew, a trembling Yorkshire terrier, never seemed to bark. On Sunday, Liana and Vera rushed pell-mell toward me. ""What happened?"" I asked, trying to suppress a note of worry. ""Thank you, thank you!"" they shouted excitedly, words tumbling over the other. Their friends in the US, Britain, and the UAE had sent them screenshots of our BBC broadcast. There they were, in the corner of the screen, quietly sitting along the wall. ""Now they know we're safe!"" they gushed, reflecting that surge of anxiety worldwide in the large Ukrainian diaspora as the invasion intensified. But news from Liana's father was ominous. He could hear Russian tanks rumbling past, heading south towards Kyiv. His electricity was now cut; he cooked potato soup outside, on an open fire in sub-zero temperatures, all the while trying to hide the flame. By Monday, when the weekend curfew lifted, satellite images shared by Maxar technology revealed a massive Russian armoured column, stretching along 40 miles (64km) of road, stopped just 20 miles from Kyiv. The plight of other cities was even more foreboding. Residential areas of Kharkiv, the second largest city to the west, were being pounded - so was Chernihiv to the north. Sleeping quarters Thin mats have been replaced by mattresses in this new subterranean world - Ukraine beds down and digs in. All through the night, smartphones glow under covers.  Liana, like everyone else, connects incessantly with friends and family across Ukraine and beyond. A Russian missile has slammed into her father's vegetable garden, smashing his sustenance for the long run. Rustam, intense at the best of times, is now an extension of his phone saturated by everything Ukraine. Sometimes Tyson the cat emerges from under his bed above ground for a comforting cuddle. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has vowed to continue the offensive until ""its goals are achieved"". It's been a week of war. Unparalleled sanctions imposed on Russia are being described as economic war. A war crimes investigation has already been launched, and everyone everywhere is taking a stand. Even the International Feline Federation (FIFe) has banned the import of any Russian breeds of cats. The southern city of Kherson has fallen. Mariupol is encircled by Russian forces, without electricity, running water, or enough food. The armoured convoy north of Kyiv still hasn't made its move. And Liana is in a flood of tears. ""Eight Russian soldiers barged into my father's house last night looking for cigarettes, and they've taken over his house,"" she wails. She hears a story about a family who tried to flee and was shot dead on the spot. They're looking for young men able to fight. She says her elderly father sits in a chair and doesn't dare move. In some areas, whole neighbourhoods have been obliterated by Russian firepower or seem to be under its sway. Now it's the second week. More than a million Ukrainians have fled. Many are staying to pick up guns to fight. ""We are the nation that broke the plans of the enemy in the first week,"" boasts President Zelensky in his latest video message, still dressed in olive-green. President Putin announces his ""special military operation is going according to plan"", vowing to ""destroy this anti-Russia created by the West"". Last night Kyiv was rocked by explosions, coming ever closer to city centre, which painted the sky orange. When the night curfew lifts, Liana and her mother Vera make a dash to the shops to check for supplies - including cat food - on fast-emptying shelves. Then she settles in to try to read the tome she packed for what could be a long and anxious haul.

"David Malpass says ""it's too early to say"" if the war in Ukraine will lead to a global recession The war in Ukraine is ""a catastrophe"" for the world which will cut global economic growth, the president of the World Bank has told the BBC. ""The war in Ukraine comes at a bad time for the world because inflation was already rising,"" said David Malpass. He stressed his biggest concern is ""about the pure human loss of lives"" that is occurring. Thousands of civilians and soldiers are thought to have been killed by the fighting. Mr Malpass said the economic impact of the war stretches beyond Ukraine's borders, and the rises in global energy prices in particular ""hit the poor the most, as does inflation"". Food prices have also been pushed up by the war, and ""are a very real consideration and problem for people in poor countries"". Why the Ukraine conflict could push up prices Don't buy Russian oil, says Ukraine energy giant Why the world is waging economic war on Russia Mr Malpass points out that both Russia and Ukraine are big food producers. Ukraine is the world's biggest producer of sunflower oil, with Russia number two, according to S&P Global Platts. Between them they account for 60% of global production. The two countries also account for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan. Wheat prices on the Chicago future exchange have been trading at 14-year highs. Ukraine is the world's biggest producer of sunflower oil but the war has stopped exports Russian supplies of these commodities are being restricted because of the widespread sanctions which make it hard for the rest of the world to buy its products. Ukrainian supplies have been stopped because fighting has closed the country's ports. ""There's no way to adjust quickly enough to the loss of supply from Ukraine and from Russia, and so that adds to prices,"" said Mr Malpass. He says the same is true of Russian energy supplies, and it is particularly damaging for western Europe, where governments have ""neglected other aspects of how to have enough electricity"". About 39% of the EU's electricity comes from power stations that burn fossil fuels, andRussia is the biggest source of that oil and gas. As the EU looks to accelerate its transition to other energy sources, Vladimir Putin's government ""may permanently lose some of their markets"", said Mr Malpass. Such a loss of income is just one way this war will dent living standards in Russia, so too will thefall in the value of the roubleand the inflation that brings. The war in Ukraine will cause more problems for a global economy, David Malpass says The World Bank has committed $7.9bn to help develop Ukraine's economy since the 2014 revolution. That money has helped the country institute wide-ranging economic reforms including privatisations in the energy and banking sectors, as well as efforts to make its farmland more productive. Less than a month before the Russian invasion Ukraine's independent central bank forecast that the $180bn economy would grow 3.4% this year, after the difficulties of the pandemic. However, war means ""a catastrophic impact for our economy, for the region overall"", according to Alexander Rodnyansky, who is an economic adviser to President Zelensky. He adds: ""We've already seen massive destructions of roads and bridges and infrastructure. So that is something that will have to be rebuilt over the years when the war is over. ""It's hard to put a number on that right now, but we can already see that we've given up percentages and GDP growth just because of what happened already."" With hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the country or joining the fight against Russia the workforce has shrunk dramatically, which is making it difficult to keep the wartime economy going. ""Production is just collapsing"", says Mr Rodnyansky, who says there are disruptions to vital food and energy supplies. War is having ""a catastrophic impact"" on Ukraine's economy, says Alexander Rodnyansky Big western companies, such as food manufacturer Nestle and brewer Carlsberg, have big operations in Ukraine that have been disrupted by the war. A surge of foreign investment in recent years helped to reshape the Ukrainian economy amid a corruption crackdown that was part of a deal for development support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia 'I can't pay' - Russians feel the pain of sanctions Mr Rodnyansky said that shift ""absolutely reflects the people's desire in Ukraine to integrate with the European Union, to be part of the European family, and to just have a democratic, strong, economically free country that's flourishing"". He says there has been a drive to digitisation that has made it easier to do business in the country: ""It stands in stark contrast to what happens in Russiaâ¦ and that's perhaps another reason why the Russian leader just so blatantly hates everything about Ukraine and what Ukraine stands for."" This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on Russian gas and oil Mr Malpass is concerned that the war will do long term damage to those changes that Ukraine's economy and people have benefited from. A desire to stop them unravelling is one reason why the World Bank is in the process of putting together a $350m aid package for Ukraine which is expected to be approved within the next few days. ""It will help fund the budget of Ukraine,"" said Mr Malpass. With tax revenues collapsing because of the war it will help pay for things such as government salaries, social welfare and emergency supplies. He is conscious that as well as the risk to the lives of millions of Ukrainian, the war could ""be a lasting [economic] setback, where Russia pulls them toward Russia, under the ideas, the goals of an individual leader"". ""Their per capita income has fallen below China's because in part because of economic mismanagement, and because they really have maintained such a centralised system of decision making under Putin for now, ever since 2000."" He adds: ""The risk is that Ukraine is controlled by that."" The warnings by Mr Malpass came as the British Chambers of Commerceâ¯(BCC) cut its growth forecast for the UK's economy, amid soaring inflation, tax rises, and global shocks including Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The BCC predicts the UK will grow by 3.6% this year, down from its previous forecast of 4.2%, with consumer spending expected to slow as household incomes come under pressure from rising inflation. The new estimate is less than half the 7.5% growth rate seen last year, when the UK's economy rebounded from the Covid-induced slump in 2020.

"This video can not be played Watch: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant appears on fire after shelling (3 March 22) Russia has taken control of Europe's largest nuclear power station in Ukraine after it was hit by shelling. A fire started at the Zaporizhzhia  plant after it was shelled by Russian troops, Ukrainian officials say. The UN's nuclear watchdog said radiation levels and the safety of reactors were not affected. World leaders have accused Russia of endangering the safety of an entire continent, and Ukraine's president accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"". US President Joe Biden urged Moscow to stop its military activities around the site, while Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the ""horrific attacks"" from Russia ""must cease immediately"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the ""reckless"" attack could ""directly threaten the safety of all of Europe"". All three leaders spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone. Mr Zelensky, meanwhile, said the attack could have caused destruction equal to six Chernobyls, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986. ""If there is an explosion, it is the end of everything. The end of Europe,"" he said. Russia's defence ministry blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a ""monstrous provocation"" without providing evidence. A video feed from the nuclear plant showed blasts lighting up the night sky and sending up plumes of smoke. A building within the plant site was set on fire after being hit by a projectile but was not part of the reactors, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi. He said safety systems at the plant were not affected by the fire and that there has been no release of radioactive material. He described the situation at Zaporizhzhia as ""normal abnormality"", meaning operations are normal but nothing else is. Earlier, the IAEA said it was in ""full 24/7 response mode"" due to the ""serious situation"" at the power station. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA:Watching the war on TV UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict One resident who lives nearby said he saw the Russian military attacking the site. ""It is just terrorism... It is worrying not just for our region, but for Ukraine and for the world,"" Kirill Dovzhik told the BBC. Ukrainian emergency services said they were initially blocked from getting to the scene of the blaze, prompting President Biden to publicly call on Russia to allow firefighters into the site. Boris Johnson said he would seek an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday over the attack. Nuclear experts watching the events at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant say this is a very risky situation. ""For the first time this morning, I'm frightened,"" Sheffield University nuclear materials expert Professor Claire Corkhill tells me. It appears that only one of six reactors at the plant is now operating. Corkhill says the reactors are being taken ""offline"" which means ""they're shutting down the nuclear reaction and putting them into a safe and stable state"". She adds this might have been Russia's intention. ""If you want to target their power supply, you attack a building close to the power plant and force operators to shut it down,"" she says. Corkhill adds that a ""worst-case scenario"" would be that the plant's electricity supply were damaged as ""we could be looking at a scenario similar to what happened at Fukushima in 2011, where a loss of power led to a loss of cooling, which caused a meltdown of three of its nuclear reactors"". The plant, located around 550km (342 miles) south-east of the capital Kyiv, generates around 20% of all electricity in Ukraine. It lies on the river Dnieper, north-east of the city of Kherson which is said to have been occupied by Russian forces. The Russian military has alsoseized control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history. News of the latest incident at Zaporizhzhia causedshare prices in Asia to fall sharply. In other developments: In the port city ofMariupolin southern Ukraine,residents are without power and water suppliesbecause of relentless Russian shelling In the north, the cities ofChernihivandKharkivhave again come under fire, while there are reports that the city of Sumy has been surrounded by Russian troops The BBC's Russian Servicehas been partially blocked in Russiaafter the country's parliament passed a law making it an offence to spread ""false information"" about the war in Ukraine. A BBC spokesperson said: ""Access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia."" More than one million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began last week. Despite punishing international sanctions, Russia's President Vladimir Putin said his offensive was going ""strictly according to schedule, according to plan"". He hasput his nuclear forces on high alertbecause of ""aggressive statements"" by the West. Western ministers will hold crisis talks in Brussels on Friday as they seek to show their support for Ukraine. UK Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss called it ""one of the biggest days of diplomacy""with allies prepared to ""tighten the vice around Putin's war machine"" by targeting the Russian economy with more sanctions.

War is having ""a catastrophic impact"" on Ukraine's economy, says Alexander Rodnyansky Big western companies, such as food manufacturer Nestle and brewer Carlsberg, have big operations in Ukraine that have been disrupted by the war. A surge of foreign investment in recent years helped to reshape the Ukrainian economy amid a corruption crackdown that was part of a deal for development support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia 'I can't pay' - Russians feel the pain of sanctions Mr Rodnyansky said that shift ""absolutely reflects the people's desire in Ukraine to integrate with the European Union, to be part of the European family, and to just have a democratic, strong, economically free country that's flourishing"". He says there has been a drive to digitisation that has made it easier to do business in the country: ""It stands in stark contrast to what happens in Russiaâ¦ and that's perhaps another reason why the Russian leader just so blatantly hates everything about Ukraine and what Ukraine stands for.""

A desire to stop them unravelling is one reason why the World Bank is in the process of putting together a $350m aid package for Ukraine which is expected to be approved within the next few days. ""It will help fund the budget of Ukraine,"" said Mr Malpass. With tax revenues collapsing because of the war it will help pay for things such as government salaries, social welfare and emergency supplies. He is conscious that as well as the risk to the lives of millions of Ukrainian, the war could ""be a lasting [economic] setback, where Russia pulls them toward Russia, under the ideas, the goals of an individual leader"". ""Their per capita income has fallen below China's because in part because of economic mismanagement, and because they really have maintained such a centralised system of decision making under Putin for now, ever since 2000."" He adds: ""The risk is that Ukraine is controlled by that."" The warnings by Mr Malpass came as the British Chambers of Commerceâ¯(BCC) cut its growth forecast for the UK's economy, amid soaring inflation, tax rises, and global shocks including Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The BCC predicts the UK will grow by 3.6% this year, down from its previous forecast of 4.2%, with consumer spending expected to slow as household incomes come under pressure from rising inflation. The new estimate is less than half the 7.5% growth rate seen last year, when the UK's economy rebounded from the Covid-induced slump in 2020.

"A jump in the price of gas amid the Ukraine conflict has added to worries that annual UK household energy bills could reach Â£3,000. The cost of gas in Europe and the UK has hit record levels as fears persist that Russian supplies could be reduced. Higher costs for aluminium and copper also means UK shoppers are likely to face further price rises, the head of the London Metal Exchange has said. Economists have warned inflation, which tracks the cost of living, may hit 10%. Wholesale markets are where UK energy suppliers buy their gas to sell on to consumers. On Friday, wholesale gas prices for delivery to UK supplier jumped to 508p per therm. If prices remain high for long periods it will push up household bills, adding to cost of living pressures. Over the past few days, gas prices have been extremely volatile, but the trend has been upwards. On Thursday, an industry body warned thatUK household energy bills could reach as high as Â£3,000 a year. In addition, the recent surge in the cost of metals is also likely to push up the prices of some goods. Copper prices are at five-year highs, and other commodities have jumped in price since the Ukraine conflict began. Matthew Chamberlain, who leads the London Metal Exchange, told the BBC's Today programme that prices for canned goods and copper wiring may rise. ""We've seen aluminium and nickel up 30% since the beginning of the year, and that will ultimately be passed on to consumers when you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure."" Why are prices rising so quickly? Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Panmure Gordon economist Simon French told the BBC that the UK's inflation rate could now hit 10%. Sarah Hewin, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, agreed, warning that with rising gas prices feeding into higher energy bills, and increasing petrol and food prices, it was ""entirely feasible"" that inflation could move beyond the 7.5% rate that the Bank of England has predicted for April. ""Russia and Ukraine are important grain producers so we're likely to food prices rising here in the UK as well,"" she said. ""Overall, food, energy and transport account for around 25% of consumer prices. It's possible, if the crisis continues in the coming weeks, and even months, that inflation could move up to double digits in the UK"". UK petrol prices have hit another record, with the average price of a litre of petrol reaching Â£1.53 a litre, while diesel reached Â£1.57 a litre. This week, the price of Brent crude - the global oil benchmark - surged to more than $119 a barrel at one point, the highest since May 2012. On Friday, it was trading at around $114 a barrel. Stock markets across Europe tumbled on Friday following sharp falls in Asia after a fire broke out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the largest in Europe. London's FTSE 100 closed 3.5% down while France's CAC-40 index dropped 5% and Germany's Dax also fell 4.4%. Reflecting the sharp rise in commodity prices, Anglo-Russian gold producer Polymetal saw its share price in London jump by more than 25%. Evraz, the Russian steel-maker which counts oligarch Roman Abramovich as a major shareholder, also saw its share price jump by 23%. The fire at the Ukraine nuclear power plant happened after Russia troops shelled the site. Some investor concerns were eased after officials said the plant's safety was ""secured"". The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later said that it had spoken to Ukraine's leadership and had been told important equipment at the plant was still working. The shelling has drawn international condemnation, with the US President Joe Biden joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in urging Russia to cease the shelling and allow firefighters to access the site. In recent days, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent shockwaves through the global financial and energy markets, as investors try to understand the implications of sanctions and supply chain disruptions. The price of gold, which is regarded as a safer asset in times of uncertainty, has increased by 7.3% in a month to $1,938 per ounce. The Russian rouble has hit a record low against the US dollar as countries around the world impose tough sanctions on the country. Meanwhile, more British executives are bowing to pressure to quit Russian companies. James Rutherford on Thursday became the latest UK national to step down from a Russian company's board, resigning from the Roman Abramovich-backed steel firm Evraz. It came after the business group the Institute of Directors called on Britons to resign from the boards of Russian companies, due to the invasion of Ukraine.

"Liz Truss wants allies to agree on more restrictions targeting Russia's oil and gas exports UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is seeking agreement from the international community to step up support for Ukraine, in the face of continuing attacks from Russian forces. Foreign ministers from across the West have gathered in Brussels to consider how to maintain pressure on Russia. Ms Truss said she wanted allies to agree to do more to restrict Russian oil and gas exports. But she also said theexisting sanctionsregime is damaging Russia. She told the BBC: ""You can see that on the Russian stock markets, the Russian money markets, the fact that people are having to queue for the bank or the metro station."" Ms Truss added that the West needed to do more on sanctions, particularly around fossil fuel exports to Europe, to ""cut off and cripple"" the Russian economy. Around half of the European Union's gas and one quarter of its oil importscome from Russia. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel has travelled to Poland to launch a new family scheme for Ukrainian refugees. Under the extended scheme,which was announced earlier this week, British nationals and anyone settled in the UK will be able to apply to bring their parents, grandparents and siblings to the country. The UK's initial visa offer was restricted to immediate family, including children and partners. Will new legal powers find Putin's loot? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Is the UK doing enough to help refugees? What sanctions could West still impose on Russia? In Brussels, the foreign secretary has urged her counterparts from Nato, the G7 and EU to ""embrace reliable partners rather than be dependant and beholden on any one country"" for oil or gas. Ms Truss, who described it ""one of the biggest days of diplomacy"", said co-operation between the UK and EU was ""essential to defend European security"". ""We will work with fellow freedom-loving democracies to tighten the vice around Putin's war machine and signal our strong support for Ukraine's territorial integrity,"" she added. Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted the war in Ukraine is ""going to plan"", despite taking only one major city - Kherson in the south. Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"" after itbombarded a large nuclear power station,causing a fire. The authorities say the Zaporizhzhya plant - which is the biggest of its kind in Europe - is secure and radiation levels are normal. It comes after President Zelensky asked Mr Putin for one-to-one talks, saying it was the only way to end the war. He has also appealed to Nato to supply warplanes. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? INNER CIRCLE:Who's in Putin's entourage, running the war? UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict While defensive weapons have been sent to Ukraine, the West has largely responded to the invasion witheconomic sanctions against Russian individuals, businesses and banks. On Thursday the UK announced sanctions on two more Russian oligarchs- Alisher Usmanov, a billionaire whose company previously had links with Arsenal football club - and Igor Shuvalov, a former deputy prime minister to Mr Putin. But there have been calls for swifter clampdowns on oligarchs, with the UK accused of being slower than its European neighbours - claims rejected by Downing Street. There are fears that oligarchs will sell property and move money and assets out of the UK before they are targeted. Ministers have set up a taskforce to look into individual cases. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he would support seizing property in the UK owned by wealthy Russians with links to Mr Putin, as long as the government has ""the evidence and there is the legal basis"" to do so. Mr Raab also confirmed he would support housing Ukrainian refugees in any seized properties, a move called for by the Liberal Democrats. He also said the government is looking at ways to stop lawsuits being used by wealthy individuals to intimidate journalists and organisations looking into sources of their wealth. Mr Raab said wealthy people connected to the Russian president were abusing libel laws to intimidate individuals and organisations highlighting corruption in Russia. Alisher Usmanov (right) with President Putin at the Kremlin in November 2018 Meanwhile on Friday, the home secretary has met Ukrainians applying for the UK's family scheme in Medyka, near the border with Ukraine. Ms Patel said the UK was ""standing in solidarity"" with Ukrainian refugees and the Polish people. During her visit, Ms Patel told reporters that Ukrainians seeking safety in Poland were fleeing ""the most atrocious set of circumstances where they are being persecuted by President Putin"". She said: ""We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine but also with our dear friends here in Poland, who are working really night and day, we can all see this, under incredible circumstances."" Under the scheme, normal requirements for salary or language tests will be waived and checks will be accelerated to process applications as quickly as possible, the Home Office said. It added that ""essential security checks"" would still take place ""given the malign action being taken by the Russian state to infiltrate Ukraine"". It said the family scheme would be followed up by another for Ukrainians with no ties to the UK - with further details to be set out ""in due course"" However, Labour called for the creation of a simple emergency visa, valid for 12 months, allowing anyone fleeing the conflict to come to the UK, with normal visa conditions other than biometrics and security checks lifted. More than one million Ukrainians have fled the country since the invasion began last week, according to the United Nations, with most heading for neighbouring countries. So far, the UK has sent three planes with 320,000 medical items to help - and theUK's Disasters Emergency Committee has launched an appeal.

"A group of MPs say they are ""ashamed"" at the support offered to aid workers in Afghanistan, following the UK's withdrawal from the country last year. A report by the Commons International Development Committee,externalfound ministers were too slow to provide help to humanitarian workers and Afghans. The committee also warned some of the same mistakes were being repeated in the current crisis in Ukraine. The government said it had evacuated thousands of people from Afghanistan. In August last year, the Taliban seized control of the country, after foreign troops pulled out. The withdrawal of British and other Western troops brought an end to their 20-year military involvement in Afghanistan. Whistleblower describes 'chaos' of UK Afghan exit How many people did the UK get out of Afghanistan? 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind The International Development Committee acknowledged the scale of the humanitarian response required after the militant group's rapid takeover was ""unprecedented"". However, its report said some Afghan aid workers - who were at risk of reprisals from the Taliban for working with the West or advocating the freedoms of women and minority groups - felt ""abandoned"" by the UK government. It added that UK schemes ""do not adequately support"" those who wanted to come to the UK. The report called on the government to accelerate its Afghan resettlement scheme and ensure aid workers were explicitly recognised and prioritised. While the committee said ministers had pledged ""significant sums of aid"" since the UK's withdrawal, it said the way it had been released had been ""excruciatingly slow"". The committee's chairwomen, Labour MP Sarah Champion, said: ""We are deeply grateful to aid workers - be they British, Afghan or of other nationalities - for all they have done for the people of Afghanistan. The work that they do is phenomenal. ""But we are ashamed that the government did not give them the support that they needed during the UK's withdrawal, or now, during the complex task of delivering an aid programme under Taliban rule."" The committee says mistakes are being repeated in response to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine The committee also warned the government was making some of the same mistakes in its response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It said this included being ""inflexible"" and ""begrudging"" in its approach, by only making limited concessions on pre-existing UK immigration routes and failing to provide sufficient clarity on what routes were available. It also accused the government of ""dragging its feet"" in setting up new or variations on existing routes for people who wanted to come to the UK. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said the government had distributed Â£261m in aid in Afghanistan this financial year and had already announced Â£220m in aid for Ukraine. ""We evacuated more than 15,000 people from Afghanistan within a fortnight and have already announced an immigration programme for Ukrainians to come to the UK,"" the spokesperson added. The governmenthas faced some criticism for not doing enough to help Ukrainian refugees. Labour has called for anyone fleeing the conflict to be able to come to the UK on an emergency visa, with normal conditions - other than biometrics and security checks - lifted. More than one million Ukrainians have now fled the country since Russia's invasion began last week, according to the United Nations, with most heading for neighbouring countries.

"The US has announced fresh sanctions on Russian oligarchs - the latest attempt to squeeze President Vladimir Putin as his invasion of Ukraine continues. The new penalties will target members of the Russian elite, their families and close associates, cutting them off from the US financial system. ""The goal is to maximise the impact on Putin,"" US President Joe Biden said. Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin's press secretary, is among those targeted in the latest blockade. Mr Peskov, 54, is already sanctioned by the European Union, and now joins a list of eight oligarchs and nearly two dozen of their family members and associates whose assets in the US will be frozen, and have their American properties blocked from use. Another 19 oligarchs - including Putin ally Alisher Burhanovich - and 47 of their family members will face US visa restrictions. ""These individuals have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people,"" the White House said on Thursday. ""We will continue to work with our allies and partners to hold accountable the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who are profiting from this violent regime."" Follow the latest: Zelensky asks Putin for talks Earlier this week, Mr Biden had promised to go after Russian oligarchs who have ""bilked [stolen] billions of dollars off this violent regime"" when speaking of the Ukraine crisis at his State of the Union address. On Thursday, Mr Biden said the existing sanctions carried out with Western allies, such as blocking Moscow from the Swift international payments system and restrictions against the Russian central bank, were already having a ""profound"" impact. ""Our interest is maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history and I think we're well on the way to doing that,"" he said. The UK also announced further sanctions against two Russian oligarchs on Thursday. What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

"A planned mass evacuation of civilians from Mariupol is aborted as Russia continues shelling the key southern city People hoping to escape are forced back to their shelters after a planned ceasefire fails to materialise Civilians have also been unable to leave the nearby city of Volnovakha Heavy bombardments have been reported in Irpin - a town on the north-western outskirts of Kyiv Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin has warned the West he would regard any no-fly zone over Ukraine as an act of war Ukraine's president has repeated his call for a no-fly zone. Western leaders say they don't want to make the situation worse Edited by Jessica Murphy For technical reasons, we will be switching out live coverage to a new webpage. You can continue to follow our around the clock coverage of the war in Ukraineat this link here. US President Joe Biden has said his administration is
working closely with Congress to secure additional funding for Ukraine. Biden made the statement during a phone call with his Ukrainian
counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday. The US president reiterated his support for
Ukraine and praised the skill and bravery of its citizens and troops. A White House readout from the call made no mention of Zelensky's repeated requests for assistance in setting up a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The US and other Nato nations have rejected such
requests over concerns it could escalate the conflict. Instead they have focused on imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia and some
of its wealthiest people. They have also been providing military, medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. From Rome to Munich to London, people gathered today to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's the second weekend in a row that people have protested in cities around the world to show their support for Ukraine. Watch to see where the demonstrations took place.  This video can not be played Canada's foreign ministry is urging Canadians to avoid all travel to Russia, and has told Canadian citizens there that they ""should leave while commercial means are still available"". It told citizens that if they stayed, they could face ""shortages of essential products and services"" and ""may not be able to use your banking cards for payment or to withdraw funds"". It also warned that those who remain in Russia should  ""not depend on the Government of Canada to help you leave the country"". Earlier today, the US State Department issued a similar advisory, telling citizens there to depart immediately. The UK Foreign Office has also told  Britons whose presence in Russia is ""not essential"" that they are strongly advised to consider leaving by currently available commercial routes. The mayor
of Mariupol says Russian forces have intensified shelling in the Ukrainian city. Vadym
Boychenko said the port city was in âa very, very difficult state of siegeâ. âRelentless
shelling of residential blocks is ongoing, airplanes have been dropping bombs
on residential areas,â the AP news agency quoted him as saying. He added
that residents, including women and children, came under fire as they tried to
leave the city. The port
city has been witnessing intense shelling for days as Russian troops have been
trying to cut Ukraine off from this strategically important sea link. Russian forces have continued to shell Mariupol despite agreeing to a ceasefire, throwing an attempted mass evacuation of civilians into chaos. You can read more about that here Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with US President Joe Biden today. ""As part of the constant dialogue, I had another conversation with @POTUS,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""The agenda included the issues of security, financial support for Ukraine and the continuation of sanctions against Russia."" Zelensky also spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, shortly after Bennett's three-hour meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Although Israel is a key ally of the US, Bennett has tried to preserve a good relationship with Russia. Israel, at the request of Zelensky, has offered to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In the Black Sea port of Kherson - the only large city to have fallen to the Russian army so far - people have been protesting the Russian invasion. On Friday, some residents snubbed Moscow's distribution of humanitarian aim, chanting patriotic slogans and waving Ukrainian flags. ""It was thousands of people, not hundreds,"" one man who attended the protests told the BBC. The BBC has withheld his name for security reasons. ""We chanted that Kherson is Ukraine,"" he told BBC's Newshour. ""People shouted at Russia's military, 'Go home, we don't want you here. We want to live in Ukraine, we want to live with Europe, not with Russia.'"" The man confirmed reports that Russian shoulders fired guns into the air to deter protesters. He said residents do currently have electricity and limited internet. ""We are just living from day-to-day,"" the man said. ""It's still some scary times."" Hospitals across Ukraine are facing threats of supply shortages as the number of wounded grows, said Alex Wade, an emergency co-ordinator with MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) to the BBC. ""The situation is incredibly worrying and is certainly getting more worrying by the day,"" Wade said on BBC's Newshour earlier today. ""There are ruptures in what hospitals need to support their patients."" In some cases medical aid has been stymied by the advancing Russian invasion. Some towns - like port city Mariupol - have been cut off from both power and critical interventions from aid agencies like MSF. ""We are no longer able to communicate with the hospital [in Mariupol],"" Wade said. ""And we're very concerned we will lose access to supplying more hospitals in the coming days.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a renewed effort among world leaders to ensure that Russia's invasion of Ukraine fails. Writing in the New York Times, Johnson set out a six-point plan, including rapidly strengthening defences in Nato countries. ""Putin must fail and must be seen to fail in this act of aggression,"" he wrote. ""It is not future historians but the people of Ukraine who will be our judge."" The UK's Labour Party has criticised the prime minister for not acting more quickly with sanctions. Johnson is expected to repeat his pitch to fellow Western leaders this week. He will be meeting withCanadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauandDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutteon Monday and hosting leaders from theCzech Republic, Hungary, PolandandSlovakiathe following day. Read more about Johnson's plea for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskiy said today that he had spoken to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and announced the country will receive more of its Starlink satellite internet terminals this coming week. ""Talked to @elonmusk,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""Iâm grateful to him for supporting Ukraine with words and deeds. Next week we will receive another batch of Starlink systems for destroyed cities. Discussed possible space projects. But Iâll talk about this after the war."" Starlink provides high-speed internet from space with satellites flying in low Earth orbit. Musk said on
Thursday that the system was the only non-Russian communications
system still working in some parts of Ukraine in the wake of
Russia's invasion. Meanwhile, in an address to the Ukrainian people on Saturday night, Zelensky urged citizens in Russian occupied areas of the country to fight back against Vladimir Putin's military. âUkrainians! In all of our cities, where the enemy invaded, go on the offensive. Go out on the streets. We need to fight every time we have an opportunity,â he said. Tim FranksBBC Newshour, Lviv Fourteen-year-old Mariana is
about to add herself to the more than one million people whoâve fled over the border. Sheâs at Lviv station in Ukraine with her younger sister and aunt, hoping to board a
train to Poland. Itâs been an exhausting two-day trek from her home in
Kharkiv, in the north-east. Sheâs left her parents and her grandparents
behind. And Mariana can barely speak for the tears. âIâm
scared,â she sobs. âMy parents stayed. I really want to see them. I donât want to go to Poland.â Her grandparents were too frail to
leave home. But that home has become unrecognisable. Which is why
Marianaâs mother and father made their agonising decision to part from their
children. Theyâd spent days cowering, hungry and terrified in a basement
as the bombardment closed in. âI donât want this,â Mariana pleads. âPlease stop this. Why should we die?â A US ban on Russian oil will be the first priority for lawmakers, Congressman Mike Quigley told CNN a short while ago. ""The first thing you'll see Congress push for is an embargo,"" he said, noting that around 8% of US oil imports are from Russia. An embargo would be ""traumatic for our European allies"", who are more dependent, the Illinois Democrat said. ""So that's going to take quite a bit of diplomacy."" His comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with Quigley and more than 300 of his colleagues, calling for a bar on the import of Russian oil. A ban on Russian oil has provided a rare moment of bipartisan co-operation in the US Congress - both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have publicly pressured the Biden administration to implement an embargo. The US is one of the world's biggest oil producers, whereas the EU relies on imports to meet 61% of its energy needs. Shell said today that it made the ""difficult decision"" to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to ensure a continued supply of energy to the European market. ""Cargos from alternative sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply,"" the oil giant said in a statement. It said the firm is facing challenges in shifting from Russian oil ""because of how significant [it] is to global supply"". Shell said it would commit profits from its ""limited amount of Russian oil"" to a dedicated fund going towards humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Shell said earlier this week it will end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It said it will also sell its 50% stake in two Siberian oilfield projects. Russian oil exports account for about 8% of global supply. There has been a growing push in recent days for countries to shun Russian oil and gas - a move currently being considered by the United States. Allow Twitter content?

The payments giants Mastercard and Visa have announced that they are suspending their operations in Russia in protest over the invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, Mastercard said that Russian banks would no longer be supported
by its network and any card issued by the company outside of
country would not work at Russian merchants or ATMs. The company said it had listened to representations from partners and taken its decision due to the ""unprecedented nature of the current conflict and the uncertain economic environment"". Meanwhile, Visa said that it would work to cease all transactions in the country in the coming days, adding that Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia would also stop working in the country' territory. Al Kelly, Visa's CEO and chairman, said the company had been ""compelled to act following Russiaâs unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed"". âWe regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values,â he concluded. Taking a step away from the developments on the battlefield in Ukraine for moment, let's look briefly at some news from the football pitch. Head coach of Premiere League football club Chelsea, Thomas Tuchel, has criticised the club's supporters who sang owner Roman Abramovich's name during a minute's applause for Ukraine before their 4-0 win over Burnley today. On WednesdayAbramovich announced his decision to sell the clubamid heavy scrutiny following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He's alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. Some Chelsea fans chanted Russian Abramovich's name throughout the game, and were booed by Burnley fans. ""It's not the moment to do this,"" Chelsea manager Tuchel said. ""If we show solidarity we show solidarity and we should do it together.""

David WillisBBC News, Washington Pro-Ukraine supporters have been gathering outside the White House Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeated a call for a no-fly zone over his country in a video-link address to nearly 300 US lawmakers. He also called for a ban on imports of Russian oil and pleaded for Russian-made fighter jets, which his countryâs pilots know how to fly, to help fight the enemy advance in his country. In response, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said he'd help the Biden administration to facilitate their transfer from Eastern Europe Zelensky also underscored the need for additional military support and humanitarian aid, but two of his other requests have already been rejected by the US. Firstly, the no-fly zone which, while cutting off Russian air support, would also risk drawing Nato allies into the conflict. And secondly, the ban on the import of Russian oil which the Biden administration fears could further inflate the price of petrol. The Italian fashion group Prada says it is suspending all retail operations in Russia As we've been reporting, a number of global brands have said they will stop sales in Russia. Luxury brand Prada has now joined them. Other companiessuch as LVMH, Hermes, Kering and Chanel have already confirmed they will shut their shops in the country. Earlier the Spanish-owned business Inditex said it wouldclose all 502 Russian stores of its eight brands, including Zara, Bershka and Stradivarius, from Sunday. Sebastian UsherBBC Arab Affairs Editor Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett travelled to Moscow to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin earlier. The urgency of Bennett's visit was underlined by the fact that the Israeli prime minister - who's an Orthodox Jew - broke Shabbat (the Jewish day of rest) in order to fly to Moscow. Exceptions can only be made under Jewish law in situations in which life is threatened. Bennett's trip was also kept under wraps until he was already in the Kremlin holding some two-and-a-half hours of talks with President Putin. The two men have met several times before and appear to have a good relationship. The Ukrainian President Vlolodymyr Zelensky had earlier called on the Israeli prime minister to mediate in the current conflict. Among those accompanying Bennett was the Housing Minister Zeev Elkin, who has long served as a Russian translator for Israeli leaders.  He was born in Kharkiv and has relatives still in Ukraine. Following the talks, PM Bennett travelled onto Germany where he is set to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. As we've been reporting, the Russian authorities have restricted access to BBC websites in Russian and English, as well as other international and independent media, accusing them of circulating ""false information"" about what is happening in Ukraine. In response, the BBC said ""access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week"". Record numbers of people have read the BBC's Russian language news website since the invasion.

"This video can not be played Watch: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant appears on fire after shelling (3 March 22) Russia has taken control of Europe's largest nuclear power station in Ukraine after it was hit by shelling. A fire started at the Zaporizhzhia  plant after it was shelled by Russian troops, Ukrainian officials say. The UN's nuclear watchdog said radiation levels and the safety of reactors were not affected. World leaders have accused Russia of endangering the safety of an entire continent, and Ukraine's president accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"". US President Joe Biden urged Moscow to stop its military activities around the site, while Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the ""horrific attacks"" from Russia ""must cease immediately"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the ""reckless"" attack could ""directly threaten the safety of all of Europe"". All three leaders spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone. Mr Zelensky, meanwhile, said the attack could have caused destruction equal to six Chernobyls, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986. ""If there is an explosion, it is the end of everything. The end of Europe,"" he said. Russia's defence ministry blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a ""monstrous provocation"" without providing evidence. A video feed from the nuclear plant showed blasts lighting up the night sky and sending up plumes of smoke. A building within the plant site was set on fire after being hit by a projectile but was not part of the reactors, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi. He said safety systems at the plant were not affected by the fire and that there has been no release of radioactive material. He described the situation at Zaporizhzhia as ""normal abnormality"", meaning operations are normal but nothing else is. Earlier, the IAEA said it was in ""full 24/7 response mode"" due to the ""serious situation"" at the power station. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA:Watching the war on TV UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict One resident who lives nearby said he saw the Russian military attacking the site. ""It is just terrorism... It is worrying not just for our region, but for Ukraine and for the world,"" Kirill Dovzhik told the BBC. Ukrainian emergency services said they were initially blocked from getting to the scene of the blaze, prompting President Biden to publicly call on Russia to allow firefighters into the site. Boris Johnson said he would seek an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday over the attack. Nuclear experts watching the events at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant say this is a very risky situation. ""For the first time this morning, I'm frightened,"" Sheffield University nuclear materials expert Professor Claire Corkhill tells me. It appears that only one of six reactors at the plant is now operating. Corkhill says the reactors are being taken ""offline"" which means ""they're shutting down the nuclear reaction and putting them into a safe and stable state"". She adds this might have been Russia's intention. ""If you want to target their power supply, you attack a building close to the power plant and force operators to shut it down,"" she says. Corkhill adds that a ""worst-case scenario"" would be that the plant's electricity supply were damaged as ""we could be looking at a scenario similar to what happened at Fukushima in 2011, where a loss of power led to a loss of cooling, which caused a meltdown of three of its nuclear reactors"". The plant, located around 550km (342 miles) south-east of the capital Kyiv, generates around 20% of all electricity in Ukraine. It lies on the river Dnieper, north-east of the city of Kherson which is said to have been occupied by Russian forces. The Russian military has alsoseized control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history. News of the latest incident at Zaporizhzhia causedshare prices in Asia to fall sharply. In other developments: In the port city ofMariupolin southern Ukraine,residents are without power and water suppliesbecause of relentless Russian shelling In the north, the cities ofChernihivandKharkivhave again come under fire, while there are reports that the city of Sumy has been surrounded by Russian troops The BBC's Russian Servicehas been partially blocked in Russiaafter the country's parliament passed a law making it an offence to spread ""false information"" about the war in Ukraine. A BBC spokesperson said: ""Access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia."" More than one million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began last week. Despite punishing international sanctions, Russia's President Vladimir Putin said his offensive was going ""strictly according to schedule, according to plan"". He hasput his nuclear forces on high alertbecause of ""aggressive statements"" by the West. Western ministers will hold crisis talks in Brussels on Friday as they seek to show their support for Ukraine. UK Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss called it ""one of the biggest days of diplomacy""with allies prepared to ""tighten the vice around Putin's war machine"" by targeting the Russian economy with more sanctions.

"The Russian rouble dropped precipitously last week A raft of actions by the West is aimed at choking Russia's economy and banking system, and punishing Vladimir Putin's inner circle. What more sanctions could they impose? In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US, UK, EU and more than two dozen other nations retaliated with economic measures that have sent the Russian rouble tumbling, cut major Russian banks from the global financial system and hurt state-owned firms and oligarchs, including Mr Putin himself. The US says its actions hit 80% of banking assets in Russia; and the EU 70%. The allies have also taken steps to limit Russia's access to key technology, such as microchips and lasers; and moved against cryptocurrencies. Together, they represent the toughest sanctions Mr Putin's Russia has ever faced. And analysts expect policymakers to continue tightening - for example, by adding more kinds of technology and new companies to blacklists. The most recent action by the US, on Wednesday, targeted oil refining equipment, among other steps. ""We are at a seven or eight out of 10 on the escalation ladder right now,"" said Emily Kilcrease, senior fellow and director of the Energy, Economics and Security Program at the Washington think tank, the Center for New American Security. ""There is definitely still room to go with tightening."" Many Western companies, including BP, Apple and others have responded to the situation by taking steps to halt services or exit the country. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? 'I can't pay' - Russians feel the pain of sanctions Russian oligarch warns sanctions will not stop war But for now, trade can still flow - not least key exports like oil and gas, for which Russia is a major global supplier. Western policymakers have been reluctant to hit energy, in part for fear of causing a spike in energy prices that would cause economic damage at home as well - especially in Europe, which relies on Russia for roughly 40% of its gas imports and roughly 30% of its oil imports. But as the violence in Ukraine has escalated, there is growing pressure on the US and Europe to act. Will the West target Russian oil and gas exports for sanctions? ""My sense is that it's going to become politically untenable to say we'll keep paying Russia for oil, gas and coal,"" says Christopher Miller, professor at Tufts University's Fletcher School and an expert on the Russian economy. ""That's already been politically tough for Western leaders to stand by and I think it's going to become even tougher as the Russian military escalates its use of force."" It's a tricky calculus. While oil and gas transactions are key to preventing the Russian economy from going ""off a cliff"", cutting off that lifeline risks provoking more extreme reaction by Russia, says Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. ""The level of economic pressure now is severe. If you go for the economic jugular, Putin may respond with cyber and military action that will only make the suffering worse,"" he says. What's more the commitment, announced by Western allies this week, to release a 60m barrels of oil from strategic national reserves - half of which will come from the US - will only act to soften a temporary spike in prices. Russia may be able to withstand the loss of Western buyers, if it can sell less on the global markets at a higher price, says Ms Kilcrease. ""People I think want to see something there... but you have to think about the effect of what cutting off those sales would actually be. Will it hurt Russia? It's not actually clear,"" she says. The sanctions have already caused economic havoc in Russia. Before closing this week, the two major Moscow stock indexes plunged more than 20%. The rouble has dropped to record lows against the dollar, hurting the purchasing power of Russian families at a time when rising prices and deteriorating standard of living were already concerns. The war has sparked protests in Russia, which has also seen the standard of living slide in recent years The consultancy Capital Economics recently estimated that the sanctions could shrink Russia's economy by 15% this year. Nor has the pain been limited to Russia. Global oil prices have already risen more than 10% since the start of February amid the tensions - and analysts expect they will remain elevated due to uncertainty from the conflict. Ukraine and Russia also supply nearly 30% of the world's wheat, 19% of its corn and 80% of its sunflower oil. Currencies in countries with close ties to Russia, like Kazakhstan, have also been hit. ""That's the problem with sanctions - they never just end up targeting only one place,"" says Kristy Ironside, professor of Russian and Soviet history at McGill University. ""They tend to have other knock-on effects so anything [policymakers] do next, they have to consider very carefully in light of that.""

RUSSIA:Watching the war on TV UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Nor is it clear how economic destabilisation will affect Mr Putin's standing at home - or if they will make him willing to negotiate a political end to the violence in Ukraine. After all, Russians have endured economic isolation before and the ability to afford international travel and imported cheese may not matter much to his base. ""As long as pensions keep getting paid and people can enjoy a relatively reasonable standard of living... I think there's some leeway,"" Prof Ironside says. ""If this is sustained... I don't know."" Prof Miller says he is not optimistic that the sanctions will force Mr Putin to negotiate over Ukraine. But if sustained, he says, they may curb his power. ""Anything that touches the financial system is going to get more complicated and expensive as a result of this,"" Prof Miller says. ""That will have a ripple effect throughout the Russian economy."" ""It will make Russia's economic outlook over the next couple of years substantially dimmer and therefore make it harder for the Russian government to keep its domestic political situation under control while simultaneously waging a set of wars abroad."" ""This is the goal,"" he adds. ""To create this medium to longer term degradation of Russia's abilities."" What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

"A Ukrainian woman fleeing Russian invasion hugs a child at a temporary camp in Przemysl, Poland As a humanitarian crisis unfolds in Ukraine following its invasion by Russia, many people in the UK are looking for ways they can help. From using donations to help people in the warzone or fleeing bombs, to enabling refugees to resettle in the UK, here are some of the groups offering support in the crisis. Global charities operating in the UK and Ukraine are appealing for funds to offer aid in the humanitarian crisis. Sean Ryan, media director of Save the Children, said: ""The best way to help is to make a cash donation."" He said collecting supplies like blankets or infant formula means transporting heavy goods hundreds of miles, whereas cash can reach people quickly to buy what is needed. Among the organisations collecting funds for Ukraine are include: The British Red Cross, which has launched an appeal to help the Ukrainian Red Cross to provide food, medicine, clothing and shelter, as well as first aid training in bomb shelters and, in the last few days, 15,000 litres of drinking water to villages in eastern Ukraine The UNHCR refugee agency, which is funding emergency shelters, repairs for homes damaged by shelling, emergency cash assistance, psychological support and warm clothing Unicef, the UN's children's charity, which is helping to ensure families have clean water and food and that child health and protection services continue Save the Children, which is providing cash assistance, food and other support to refugees crossing into Romanian and Lithuania, as well as in Ukraine itself. The Disasters Emergency Committee, an umbrella group for 15 of the UK's leading aid charities,is also running an appeal, donations to which will be doubled by the government up to a total of Â£20m. The Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, the largest representative body for Ukrainians in the UK, has raised more than Â£1.1m, which it said would fund medicine, food and other essentials. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said donating money through the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK was one way of helping. The embassy has set up a special fund called With Ukraine for people to send funds via PayPal or bank transfers. The money will be spent on providing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and to purchase medical and military supplies for Ukraine's army, the embassy said. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled the country to neighbouring Poland with little more than they can carry As well as large organisations, individuals with connections to Ukraine are collecting money independently. One Ukrainian mother, Inna Schorr, who lives in London, has raised thousands of pounds. Ms Schorr told the BBC many of her family and friends are still in Ukraine and her husband has travelled to Poland to help. The family were originally asking for private donations before realising a crowdfunding page would be more effective. She added that she felt inspired to help the mothers and children by collecting money for activities or support in the refugee camps. ""It is as a support from mums to mums,"" she said. With all financial contributions online, it is worth making sure you know where your money is going first - double check the organisation is real and is being shared by a trustworthy source. As well as financial donations, grassroot groups are collecting items such as clothing, bedding, and sanitary items: A family in Staffordshire wholaunched an appealfor essential items have told the BBC they have been ""inundated"" and ""overwhelmed"" by the response. In Northern Ireland, a group of Polish peoplehave organiseda collection point at a Belfast warehouse for supplies. The Women of Newport community group in Wales has been accepting donations for refugees, asking people to only bring brand new toiletries and clothes or shoes that in good condition. People intending to make a donation with any community group are advised to check which items are most needed and if they are still accepting donations. Some UK businesses have offered support, like chef Damian Wawrzyniak,who wrote on Twitter,externalthat he would pay for work visas and flights of two Ukrainian chefs looking for work in Britain. Mr Wawrzyniak also said he could help with accommodation. Currently temporary visa concessions for the family members of British nationals have been introduced. Labour has said the failure to further relax visa restrictions is ""immoral"". The Refugee Council told the BBC people living in the UK can help by volunteering with its organisation to support refugees and people seeking asylum and supporting its call on the government to ""create more safe routes"". The UNHCR, meanwhile, has urged the government to automatically extend the visas of all Ukrainians with limited leave to remain in the UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: ""We think the best way we can help Ukraine right now is by ensuring Putin fails. ""There are a number of ways Brits can show their support for that, and the Ukrainian embassy in London is putting out information about how British people can support."" It was not immediately clear what information, other than its crowdfunding page, had been published by the Ukrainian embassy.

"David Malpass says ""it's too early to say"" if the war in Ukraine will lead to a global recession The war in Ukraine is ""a catastrophe"" for the world which will cut global economic growth, the president of the World Bank has told the BBC. ""The war in Ukraine comes at a bad time for the world because inflation was already rising,"" said David Malpass. He stressed his biggest concern is ""about the pure human loss of lives"" that is occurring. Thousands of civilians and soldiers are thought to have been killed by the fighting. Mr Malpass said the economic impact of the war stretches beyond Ukraine's borders, and the rises in global energy prices in particular ""hit the poor the most, as does inflation"". Food prices have also been pushed up by the war, and ""are a very real consideration and problem for people in poor countries"". Why the Ukraine conflict could push up prices Don't buy Russian oil, says Ukraine energy giant Why the world is waging economic war on Russia Mr Malpass points out that both Russia and Ukraine are big food producers. Ukraine is the world's biggest producer of sunflower oil, with Russia number two, according to S&P Global Platts. Between them they account for 60% of global production. The two countries also account for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan. Wheat prices on the Chicago future exchange have been trading at 14-year highs. Ukraine is the world's biggest producer of sunflower oil but the war has stopped exports Russian supplies of these commodities are being restricted because of the widespread sanctions which make it hard for the rest of the world to buy its products. Ukrainian supplies have been stopped because fighting has closed the country's ports. ""There's no way to adjust quickly enough to the loss of supply from Ukraine and from Russia, and so that adds to prices,"" said Mr Malpass. He says the same is true of Russian energy supplies, and it is particularly damaging for western Europe, where governments have ""neglected other aspects of how to have enough electricity"". About 39% of the EU's electricity comes from power stations that burn fossil fuels, andRussia is the biggest source of that oil and gas. As the EU looks to accelerate its transition to other energy sources, Vladimir Putin's government ""may permanently lose some of their markets"", said Mr Malpass. Such a loss of income is just one way this war will dent living standards in Russia, so too will thefall in the value of the roubleand the inflation that brings. The war in Ukraine will cause more problems for a global economy, David Malpass says The World Bank has committed $7.9bn to help develop Ukraine's economy since the 2014 revolution. That money has helped the country institute wide-ranging economic reforms including privatisations in the energy and banking sectors, as well as efforts to make its farmland more productive. Less than a month before the Russian invasion Ukraine's independent central bank forecast that the $180bn economy would grow 3.4% this year, after the difficulties of the pandemic. However, war means ""a catastrophic impact for our economy, for the region overall"", according to Alexander Rodnyansky, who is an economic adviser to President Zelensky. He adds: ""We've already seen massive destructions of roads and bridges and infrastructure. So that is something that will have to be rebuilt over the years when the war is over. ""It's hard to put a number on that right now, but we can already see that we've given up percentages and GDP growth just because of what happened already."" With hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the country or joining the fight against Russia the workforce has shrunk dramatically, which is making it difficult to keep the wartime economy going. ""Production is just collapsing"", says Mr Rodnyansky, who says there are disruptions to vital food and energy supplies. War is having ""a catastrophic impact"" on Ukraine's economy, says Alexander Rodnyansky Big western companies, such as food manufacturer Nestle and brewer Carlsberg, have big operations in Ukraine that have been disrupted by the war. A surge of foreign investment in recent years helped to reshape the Ukrainian economy amid a corruption crackdown that was part of a deal for development support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia 'I can't pay' - Russians feel the pain of sanctions Mr Rodnyansky said that shift ""absolutely reflects the people's desire in Ukraine to integrate with the European Union, to be part of the European family, and to just have a democratic, strong, economically free country that's flourishing"". He says there has been a drive to digitisation that has made it easier to do business in the country: ""It stands in stark contrast to what happens in Russiaâ¦ and that's perhaps another reason why the Russian leader just so blatantly hates everything about Ukraine and what Ukraine stands for."" This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on Russian gas and oil Mr Malpass is concerned that the war will do long term damage to those changes that Ukraine's economy and people have benefited from. A desire to stop them unravelling is one reason why the World Bank is in the process of putting together a $350m aid package for Ukraine which is expected to be approved within the next few days. ""It will help fund the budget of Ukraine,"" said Mr Malpass. With tax revenues collapsing because of the war it will help pay for things such as government salaries, social welfare and emergency supplies. He is conscious that as well as the risk to the lives of millions of Ukrainian, the war could ""be a lasting [economic] setback, where Russia pulls them toward Russia, under the ideas, the goals of an individual leader"". ""Their per capita income has fallen below China's because in part because of economic mismanagement, and because they really have maintained such a centralised system of decision making under Putin for now, ever since 2000."" He adds: ""The risk is that Ukraine is controlled by that."" The warnings by Mr Malpass came as the British Chambers of Commerceâ¯(BCC) cut its growth forecast for the UK's economy, amid soaring inflation, tax rises, and global shocks including Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The BCC predicts the UK will grow by 3.6% this year, down from its previous forecast of 4.2%, with consumer spending expected to slow as household incomes come under pressure from rising inflation. The new estimate is less than half the 7.5% growth rate seen last year, when the UK's economy rebounded from the Covid-induced slump in 2020.

"Ukraine's President Zelensky has asked Vladimir Putin for one-to-one talks, saying this is the only way to end the war He also appealed to the West to ""give me planes"" to fight invasion Russian and Ukrainian negotiators agree to organise humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians Meanwhile Putin insists the war is ""going to plan"", despite taking only one major city The UK has imposed sanctions on two more Russian oligarchs In Mariupol, a southern port near Ukraine's border with Russia, civilians are trapped by intense shelling If Russia captures more southern cities, Ukrainian forces could be cut off from the sea Kyiv remains in government control and a large Russian armoured convoy is some distance away More than one million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began Edited by Jessica Murphy For technical reasons weâre switching our live coverage to a different webpage. To continue to follow our around-the-clock live coverage,please click here  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said it is in contact with Ukrainian authorities over the reports of shelling at the the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. A spokesperson for the plant has also taken to social media asking that Russian forces ""stop the heavy weapons fire"". âThere is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe,â Andriy Tuz said in a video on Telegram, according to the Associated Press. Tuz said the plant is under direct attack from Russian shelling and firefighters are not able to go near the fire that had broken out. He added the reactor that is on fire was under renovation and is not currently operational, but it contains nuclear fuel. Zaporizhzhia reportedly accounts for some 25% of the country's power. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says Russian troops are ""firing from all sides"" at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest plant in Europe. As we just reported, local officials say that a fire has broken out in the plant because of these attacks. ""Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!"" he wrote on Twitter. Laura Rockwood, the director of the Open Nuclear Network non-profit, earlier told the BBC's Radio 4 that the war could have an impact on Ukraine's electricity grid, which depends on nuclear power. She said military activity around a plant poses two direct risks to nuclear instillations - potential damage to a plant's infrastructure and harm to its personnel, or much more serious damage that affects a plant's operational abilities that could cause a meltdown. A fire has reportedly broken out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It appears to have been caused by ""continuous enemy shelling of [the plant's] buildings and units"", according to Mayor Dmytro Orlov of nearby Enerhodar. Orlov had previously reported intense fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces on the outskirts of his city, which is in the southeast. Russian troops had tried to enter the city in tanks and seize the plant, but residents and workers were seen congregating around the plant and its surrounding roads on Wednesday. Ukraine has four active nuclear plants including Zaporizhzhia. It also deals with nuclear waste at sites like Chernobyl, now under Russian control. The International Atomic Energy Agency said earlier today that it is consulting with Ukraine ""and others with a view to provide maximum possible assistance to the country as it seeks to maintain nuclear safety and security in the current difficult circumstances"". OneWeb, the satellite company part-owned by the UK government, says it is suspending all launches from the Russian-operated Baikonur spaceport. The firm had hoped to send up 36 spacecraft on a Soyuz rocket from the Kazakhstan cosmodrome, but the mission has become embroiled in the fall-out over the invasion of Ukraine. Russia had sought a guarantee that armed forces would not use the satellites. It also wanted the UK government to divest itself of OneWeb shares, an ultimatum rejected by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. Read morehere. Enerhodar's nuclear cooling towers, pictured before the war Wladimir Klitschko, the champion boxer and brother of the Kyiv mayor, has said that Ukraine's nuclear plants are being threatened by the Russian invasion, warning of a potential repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Earlier, we reported fierce shelling in Enerhodar, in south-eastern Ukraine, the home of one of Europe's largest nuclear plants. The local mayor has already warned that there is no water supply or electricity in the town, due to the onslaught. Klitschko tweeted today: ""Ukraine has 4 nuclear power plants and Russian army is shooting rockets and bombing right next to it. Donât look away, STOP  Russian invasion NOW!!!"" The International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi in a statement today called on all the military forces operating around Enerhodar to refrain from violence near the plant. On Wednesday, he said the countryâs nuclear power plants ""must be able to continue operating without any safety or security threats. Any accident caused as a result of the military conflict could have extremely serious consequences for people and the environment, in Ukraine and beyond"". Russian forces seized control of the shuttered Chernobyl nuclear power plant about a week ago. Ukrainian officials reported radiation levels had been ""exceeded"" in a number of places in the area at the time, but Russia said that was not the case. The producer is accused of working with sanctioned oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev (pictured) A former TV producer for Fox News was arrested in London last month at the request of the US, and American officials are now seeking to extradite him. American John ""Jack"" Hanik, 71, is accused of violating sanctions imposed in 2014 after Russia's invasion of Crimea. Prosecutors say he worked with a sanctioned Russian businessman to set up pro-Kremlin TV channels in Europe. Hanik is accused of working with oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev, who the US Justice Department says ""is closely tied to Russian aggression in Ukraine"". Malofeyev, the US says, was ""one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea,"" and has provided material and financial assistance to separatists in Donetsk. ""The defendant Hanick knowingly chose to help Malofeyev spread his destabilising messages by establishing, or attempting to establish, TV networks in Russia, Bulgaria, and Greece, in violation of those sanctions,â the US statement adds. Yellowknife is a city in the Northwest Territories of Canada Canadian transport officials have grounded a charter plane carrying two Russian citizens who appeared to be headed to the Arctic to conduct an expedition. ""A charter aircraft that carried Russian foreign nationals has been held at the Yellowknife airport,"" Canada's transport minister tweeted on Thursday. ""We will continue to hold Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine."" The plane will be held until officials complete an assessment to determine if the flight violated the new ban on Russian planes in Canada's airspace. It's unclear what is happening to the Russians passengers aboard the plane. Ukrainian nationals present in the US as of this past Tuesday will be allowed to remain in the country under a special non-immigrant category. US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas announced the move on Thursday evening, saying the government would extend the 'Temporary Protected Status' (TPS) to Ukrainians. Homeland Security typically designates nationalities under TPS due to ongoing armed conflict, natural disasters, epidemics or ""other extraordinary and temporary conditions"" that prevent people from safely returning to their home countries. Nationals from 12 countries are already protected under TPS. They include Burma, Haiti, Syria and Yemen. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin Residents of Odesa fill construction bags with sand to defend the city As
Russian troops move along the coast, there are fears for Ukraineâs biggest
port, the magnificent city of Odesa. Russian
naval ships are reportedly approaching. Sandbags are piled up in front of the Baroque opera house, and armed soldiers patrol leafy 19th-century boulevards. Until
recently many hoped that Odesa would escape the worst of the conflict. On
Friday when I spoke to my friend Natalia Polupanova, a teacher and grandmother,
she told me she was staying in Odesa, hopeful talks would stop the war. But
when I called her again today she had fled to Moldova with her daughter-in-law
and three grandchildren. The youngest is nine-months old. The men stayed behind. âItâs
become a war against civilians"", Natalia said.They
couldnât sleep for the sound of sirens and rocket fire. âWe didnât want to
leave, itâs hard to leave your home,â Natalia said, but the children couldnât
stop crying. âThey kept saying: we donât want to die, we want to live.â Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told the leaders of Russia and Ukraine he is ""ready to make efforts to mediate between all parties"". In separate phone conversations with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, he expressed support for ""a political solution"" to their conflict. He told Zelensky that the kingdom will extend the visas of Ukrainian tourists and residents that are due to expire by three more months. According to Saudi Arabian media, it was Putin who called the Crown Prince, who then ""clarified the kingdom's stated position"" on the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin, in its own readout of the call, said both leaders discussed energy concerns and ""will continue to coordinate their approaches"" on oil production, as key partners in the OPEC+ alliance. ""Taking into account the anti-Russian sanctions imposed by a number of Western countries, Vladimir Putin emphasised the inadmissibility of politicising the issues of global energy supply,"" it said.

Good evening to those of you just joining us, here's a round-up of today's main events on day eight of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  You can read more on today's developmentshere. Duncan KennedyBBC News Correspondent President Biden was
pretty blunt in announcing thenew package of sanctions on Russia. He said its oligarchs were lining their pockets with the Russian peopleâs money while Ukraine
and its people were hiding in subways to protect themselves from Russian
missiles. Biden added that sanctions against President Putin and those
around him were already having a âprofound impactâ. The additional list of eight
names of those to be sanctioned by the US is interesting. They include former friends of Putin during his time in the KGB
in East Germany and one of his former judo training partners. They
also include the Kremlin press secretary who, the Americans say, is a ""top purveyor of Putinâs propaganda"". And weâre told a lot of these Russians have
houses and other major assets in the US. Earlier on Thursday, the White House also told us that President Biden had no plans to talk to, or meet, President Putin
to discuss ways of halting the invasion. The Russian rouble has hit record lows in recent days Ratings agency S&P has cut Russia's credit rating from ""BB+"" to ""CCC-"". ""The downgrade follows the imposition of measures that we believe will likely substantially increase the risk of default,"" the agency said on Thursday. It comes less than a week after S&P's last downgrade of Russian debt. On Wednesday, Moodyâs Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also downgraded Russia's rating by several notches. Both indicated further downgrades were likely. It means Russian debt is now considered sub-investment grade, or in ""junk"" territory, by all three of the world's major ratings companies. The Russian rouble has hit record lows in the wake of heavy sanctions. Nada TawfikNorth America correspondent, BBC News The war in Ukraine has put international arts
organisations in a difficult position, and many have chosen to take a principled
stance. The Metropolitan Opera, based in New York, just announced that their superstar Russian
soprano, Anna Netrebko, will no longer perform this season or next after she
failed to comply with their demand that she repudiates her support for Vladimir
Putin. General manager Peter Gelb said the loss of Netrebko â one of the best singers in Met Opera history â was a great artistic
loss. But, he said: ""With Putin killing
innocent victims in Ukraine, there was no way forward."" The soprano will be replaced by a Ukrainian, Liudmyla Monastyrska, who
made her debut in the opera house in 2012. Increasingly, it looks like Russiaâs isolation internationally will be felt for
some time: a Met official said it would be hard to imagine a scenario where Netrebko would be able to return to the opera house. Billionaire Alisher Usmanov will be among those sanctioned by the US The Biden administration has announced a fresh round of sanctions against Russian oligarchs. Eight wealthy elites will be cut off by the US financial system and see their assets frozen, including billionaire Alisher Usmanov, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov and oil executive Nikolai Tokarev. In addition, 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and closest associates will be banned from traveling to America. The White House also said it will sanction seven Russian entities and 26 individuals for their role in spreading ""false narratives that advance Russian strategic objectives and falsely justify the Kremlinâs activities"". President Joe Biden noted on Thursday that sanctions already in place have ""had a profound impact"". Now, he said, Western allies are headed toward ""the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history"". Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tells the BBC the ""whole nation is beating Putin"", as he urges his fellow citizens to never give up. ""He can switch off the lights, he can switch off the supply of the warmth, but he cannot kill Ukrainian soul,"" he says.

Ukraine and praised the skill and bravery of its citizens and troops. A White House readout from the call made no mention of Zelensky's repeated requests for assistance in setting up a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The US and other Nato nations have rejected such
requests over concerns it could escalate the conflict. Instead they have focused on imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia and some
of its wealthiest people. They have also been providing military, medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. From Rome to Munich to London, people gathered today to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's the second weekend in a row that people have protested in cities around the world to show their support for Ukraine. Watch to see where the demonstrations took place.  This video can not be played Canada's foreign ministry is urging Canadians to avoid all travel to Russia, and has told Canadian citizens there that they ""should leave while commercial means are still available"". It told citizens that if they stayed, they could face ""shortages of essential products and services"" and ""may not be able to use your banking cards for payment or to withdraw funds"". It also warned that those who remain in Russia should  ""not depend on the Government of Canada to help you leave the country"". Earlier today, the US State Department issued a similar advisory, telling citizens there to depart immediately. The UK Foreign Office has also told  Britons whose presence in Russia is ""not essential"" that they are strongly advised to consider leaving by currently available commercial routes. The mayor
of Mariupol says Russian forces have intensified shelling in the Ukrainian city. Vadym
Boychenko said the port city was in âa very, very difficult state of siegeâ. âRelentless
shelling of residential blocks is ongoing, airplanes have been dropping bombs
on residential areas,â the AP news agency quoted him as saying. He added
that residents, including women and children, came under fire as they tried to
leave the city. The port
city has been witnessing intense shelling for days as Russian troops have been
trying to cut Ukraine off from this strategically important sea link. Russian forces have continued to shell Mariupol despite agreeing to a ceasefire, throwing an attempted mass evacuation of civilians into chaos.

""As part of the constant dialogue, I had another conversation with @POTUS,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""The agenda included the issues of security, financial support for Ukraine and the continuation of sanctions against Russia."" Zelensky also spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, shortly after Bennett's three-hour meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Although Israel is a key ally of the US, Bennett has tried to preserve a good relationship with Russia. Israel, at the request of Zelensky, has offered to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In the Black Sea port of Kherson - the only large city to have fallen to the Russian army so far - people have been protesting the Russian invasion. On Friday, some residents snubbed Moscow's distribution of humanitarian aim, chanting patriotic slogans and waving Ukrainian flags. ""It was thousands of people, not hundreds,"" one man who attended the protests told the BBC. The BBC has withheld his name for security reasons. ""We chanted that Kherson is Ukraine,"" he told BBC's Newshour. ""People shouted at Russia's military, 'Go home, we don't want you here. We want to live in Ukraine, we want to live with Europe, not with Russia.'"" The man confirmed reports that Russian shoulders fired guns into the air to deter protesters. He said residents do currently have electricity and limited internet. ""We are just living from day-to-day,"" the man said. ""It's still some scary times."" Hospitals across Ukraine are facing threats of supply shortages as the number of wounded grows, said Alex Wade, an emergency co-ordinator with MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) to the BBC. ""The situation is incredibly worrying and is certainly getting more worrying by the day,"" Wade said on BBC's Newshour earlier today. ""There are ruptures in what hospitals need to support their patients."" In some cases medical aid has been stymied by the advancing Russian invasion. Some towns - like port city Mariupol - have been cut off from both power and critical interventions from aid agencies like MSF. ""We are no longer able to communicate with the hospital [in Mariupol],"" Wade said. ""And we're very concerned we will lose access to supplying more hospitals in the coming days.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a renewed effort among world leaders to ensure that Russia's invasion of Ukraine fails. Writing in the New York Times, Johnson set out a six-point plan, including rapidly strengthening defences in Nato countries. ""Putin must fail and must be seen to fail in this act of aggression,"" he wrote. ""It is not future historians but the people of Ukraine who will be our judge."" The UK's Labour Party has criticised the prime minister for not acting more quickly with sanctions. Johnson is expected to repeat his pitch to fellow Western leaders this week. He will be meeting withCanadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauandDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutteon Monday and hosting leaders from theCzech Republic, Hungary, PolandandSlovakiathe following day. Read more about Johnson's plea for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskiy said today that he had spoken to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and announced the country will receive more of its Starlink satellite internet terminals this coming week. ""Talked to @elonmusk,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""Iâm grateful to him for supporting Ukraine with words and deeds. Next week we will receive another batch of Starlink systems for destroyed cities. Discussed possible space projects. But Iâll talk about this after the war."" Starlink provides high-speed internet from space with satellites flying in low Earth orbit. Musk said on
Thursday that the system was the only non-Russian communications
system still working in some parts of Ukraine in the wake of
Russia's invasion. Meanwhile, in an address to the Ukrainian people on Saturday night, Zelensky urged citizens in Russian occupied areas of the country to fight back against Vladimir Putin's military. âUkrainians! In all of our cities, where the enemy invaded, go on the offensive. Go out on the streets. We need to fight every time we have an opportunity,â he said. Tim FranksBBC Newshour, Lviv Fourteen-year-old Mariana is
about to add herself to the more than one million people whoâve fled over the border. Sheâs at Lviv station in Ukraine with her younger sister and aunt, hoping to board a
train to Poland. Itâs been an exhausting two-day trek from her home in
Kharkiv, in the north-east. Sheâs left her parents and her grandparents
behind. And Mariana can barely speak for the tears. âIâm
scared,â she sobs. âMy parents stayed. I really want to see them. I donât want to go to Poland.â Her grandparents were too frail to
leave home. But that home has become unrecognisable. Which is why
Marianaâs mother and father made their agonising decision to part from their
children. Theyâd spent days cowering, hungry and terrified in a basement
as the bombardment closed in. âI donât want this,â Mariana pleads. âPlease stop this. Why should we die?â A US ban on Russian oil will be the first priority for lawmakers, Congressman Mike Quigley told CNN a short while ago. ""The first thing you'll see Congress push for is an embargo,"" he said, noting that around 8% of US oil imports are from Russia. An embargo would be ""traumatic for our European allies"", who are more dependent, the Illinois Democrat said. ""So that's going to take quite a bit of diplomacy."" His comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with Quigley and more than 300 of his colleagues, calling for a bar on the import of Russian oil. A ban on Russian oil has provided a rare moment of bipartisan co-operation in the US Congress - both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have publicly pressured the Biden administration to implement an embargo. The US is one of the world's biggest oil producers, whereas the EU relies on imports to meet 61% of its energy needs. Shell said today that it made the ""difficult decision"" to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to ensure a continued supply of energy to the European market. ""Cargos from alternative sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply,"" the oil giant said in a statement. It said the firm is facing challenges in shifting from Russian oil ""because of how significant [it] is to global supply"". Shell said it would commit profits from its ""limited amount of Russian oil"" to a dedicated fund going towards humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Shell said earlier this week it will end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It said it will also sell its 50% stake in two Siberian oilfield projects. Russian oil exports account for about 8% of global supply. There has been a growing push in recent days for countries to shun Russian oil and gas - a move currently being considered by the United States. Allow Twitter content?

The payments giants Mastercard and Visa have announced that they are suspending their operations in Russia in protest over the invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, Mastercard said that Russian banks would no longer be supported
by its network and any card issued by the company outside of
country would not work at Russian merchants or ATMs. The company said it had listened to representations from partners and taken its decision due to the ""unprecedented nature of the current conflict and the uncertain economic environment"". Meanwhile, Visa said that it would work to cease all transactions in the country in the coming days, adding that Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia would also stop working in the country' territory. Al Kelly, Visa's CEO and chairman, said the company had been ""compelled to act following Russiaâs unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed"". âWe regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values,â he concluded. Taking a step away from the developments on the battlefield in Ukraine for moment, let's look briefly at some news from the football pitch. Head coach of Premiere League football club Chelsea, Thomas Tuchel, has criticised the club's supporters who sang owner Roman Abramovich's name during a minute's applause for Ukraine before their 4-0 win over Burnley today. On WednesdayAbramovich announced his decision to sell the clubamid heavy scrutiny following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He's alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. Some Chelsea fans chanted Russian Abramovich's name throughout the game, and were booed by Burnley fans. ""It's not the moment to do this,"" Chelsea manager Tuchel said. ""If we show solidarity we show solidarity and we should do it together.""

David WillisBBC News, Washington Pro-Ukraine supporters have been gathering outside the White House Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeated a call for a no-fly zone over his country in a video-link address to nearly 300 US lawmakers. He also called for a ban on imports of Russian oil and pleaded for Russian-made fighter jets, which his countryâs pilots know how to fly, to help fight the enemy advance in his country. In response, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said he'd help the Biden administration to facilitate their transfer from Eastern Europe Zelensky also underscored the need for additional military support and humanitarian aid, but two of his other requests have already been rejected by the US. Firstly, the no-fly zone which, while cutting off Russian air support, would also risk drawing Nato allies into the conflict. And secondly, the ban on the import of Russian oil which the Biden administration fears could further inflate the price of petrol. The Italian fashion group Prada says it is suspending all retail operations in Russia As we've been reporting, a number of global brands have said they will stop sales in Russia. Luxury brand Prada has now joined them. Other companiessuch as LVMH, Hermes, Kering and Chanel have already confirmed they will shut their shops in the country. Earlier the Spanish-owned business Inditex said it wouldclose all 502 Russian stores of its eight brands, including Zara, Bershka and Stradivarius, from Sunday. Sebastian UsherBBC Arab Affairs Editor Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett travelled to Moscow to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin earlier. The urgency of Bennett's visit was underlined by the fact that the Israeli prime minister - who's an Orthodox Jew - broke Shabbat (the Jewish day of rest) in order to fly to Moscow. Exceptions can only be made under Jewish law in situations in which life is threatened. Bennett's trip was also kept under wraps until he was already in the Kremlin holding some two-and-a-half hours of talks with President Putin. The two men have met several times before and appear to have a good relationship. The Ukrainian President Vlolodymyr Zelensky had earlier called on the Israeli prime minister to mediate in the current conflict. Among those accompanying Bennett was the Housing Minister Zeev Elkin, who has long served as a Russian translator for Israeli leaders.  He was born in Kharkiv and has relatives still in Ukraine. Following the talks, PM Bennett travelled onto Germany where he is set to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. As we've been reporting, the Russian authorities have restricted access to BBC websites in Russian and English, as well as other international and independent media, accusing them of circulating ""false information"" about what is happening in Ukraine. In response, the BBC said ""access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week"". Record numbers of people have read the BBC's Russian language news website since the invasion. Here's a reminder of how to get around the BBC ban in Russia:  The BBC has also launched two new shortwave frequencies broadcasting World Service English news for four hours a day to Ukraine and parts of Russia: Â© 2025 BBC.

"Denise Coates was appointed CBE for services to the community and business in 2012 Bet365 boss Denise Coates took home about Â£300m during its last financial year - Â£170m down on the previous year - as growth stalled. The billionaire founder of the online gambling firm received Â£250m in salary and a share of the company's pay-out of Â£97.5m in dividends. Ms Coates, one of Britain's wealthiest women and a major philanthropist, has received a total of about Â£1.3bn from the business in the past five years. Bet365 was created 21 years ago. Ms Coates and her brother John took over a betting shop business run by their father, spotting that online gambling could revolutionise the industry. She now owns about half of the company. Bet365's latest accounts filed at Companies House show revenues were broadly flat at Â£2.82bn in the first year of the pandemic, compared with Â£2.81bn in the previous year. Although not named in the accounts, Ms Coates has always been regarded as the person referred to as ""highest paid director"". She is thought to be Britain's biggest individual tax payer. It's unclear why the pay fell so much, although Bet365's earnings from sports betting was hit as the pandemic caused chaos to sporting schedules. A rise in betting via online slot machines and casinos helped offset the loss. Bet365 said: ""At the start of the period we experienced the almost complete cessation of sporting events. However by the end of the first half of the year, we saw the resumption of sports with the vast majority of European football leagues managing to conclude their domestic seasons."" Meanwhile, operating profit increased by 47% year-on-year to Â£285.5m, a gain the firm said was driven in large part by reduced pay packets for directors. Bet365 made charitable donations, mostly to the Denise Coates Foundation, of Â£103m, up from almost Â£90m the year before. Ms Coates achieved a first-class degree in econometrics and later trained as an accountant within the family firm. The company owns Stoke City football club, and is based in Stoke-on-Trent.
