"This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite Thousands of people who arrived in the UK as children in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration face being threatened with deportation. They have lived and worked in the UK for decades but many are now being told they are here illegally. A new petition on the government's website calling on the Home Office to grant them an amnesty has attracted more than 23,000 signatures. The Home Office said it would handle applications to stay ""sensitively"". A slap in the face for the Windrush generation? The problem arises from the fact that under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain - but the right to free movement between Commonwealth nations was ended from that date onwards. However, the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for the individuals to now prove they are in the UK legally. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University estimates there are 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971. ""This is a slap in the face for the Windrush generation,"" said Patrick Vernon, who started the petition, a reference to the Empire Windrush, which brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. People who had ""worked hard, paid their taxes, raised children and see Britain as their home"" were being ""threatened and harassed"" by the Home Office in what he described as ""an historic injustice"". It was particularly ironic, he added, because 2018 was the 70th anniversary of the Empire Windrush's arrival at Tilbury docks, in Essex. He said his aim was to gain the 100,000 signatures needed to trigger a debate in Parliament and force the government to stop deportations, establish an amnesty and pay compensation to those who had suffered ""loss and hurt"". Labour MP David Lammy, who is backing the campaign, tweeted: ""We invited people as citizens, Home Office treating them like criminals."" Allow Twitter content?

People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parent's passports without their own ID documents. Many have never applied for a passport in their own name or had their immigration status formalised, as they regarded themselves as British. TheGuardian newspaper has highlighted a number of cases,externalof such people being threatened with deportation. Earlier this year, the Labour peer Lord Faulkner raised the case of Paulette Wilson, a former cook at the House of Commons, who had come to Britain from Jamaica in 1968. One woman was sent to Yarl's Wood immigration removals centre ""(She) had never applied for a passport because she assumed she would not need one if she did not intend to travel abroad,"" he told the House of Lords. ""One day, she got a letter from the Home Office telling her to register each month at the Solihull immigration centre. ""While she was there on a visit, officials declared that she was an illegal immigrant, had her carted off to the appalling Yarl's Wood immigration removal complex and told her that she would be deported - presumably back to Jamaica, which she had not visited since she left as a child almost 50 years before,"" he added. She was saved from deportation by the intervention of her MP, Emma Reynolds, and the Refugee and Migrant Centre in Wolverhampton. She has now been given leave to remain, said Lord Faulkner, ""although she has lost benefits for the past two years, as well as her flat, and has to rely on financial support from her daughter"". He said there were ""many others"" like Mrs Wilson - and he blamed measures introduced by then Home Secretary Theresa May in 2013 to make the UK a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants, restricting access to jobs, driving licences, benefits, health care and accommodation. He said this had ""clearly led to overzealous interventions by officials"". A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We value the contribution made by former Commonwealth citizens who have made a life in the UK. ""We want to assure individuals who have resided in the UK for an extended period but feel they may not have the correct documentation confirming their status that there are existing solutions available. ""They should take legal advice and submit the appropriate application with correct evidence so we can progress the case. ""We have no intention of making people leave who have the right to remain here,"" the Home Office added. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said there were cases of Australian, Canadian and South African, Indian and Pakistan-born citizens facing the same problem. But it was ""not as likely you will be asked to demonstrate your immigration status"" by landlords or officials if you were ""white and of European origin"", JCWI chief executive, Satbir Singh, told BBC News. The JCWI is calling for Commonwealth citizens who arrived before 1971 to be given the same status as EU citizens living in the UK, who will face a much lower burden of proof of residence than the Commonwealth citizens after Brexit. The final details have yet to be confirmed but EU citizens may be able to produce things like school registration paperwork or library cards to prove residence, something that would not be accepted from Commonwealth citizens, the campaign group said.

"The lakes lie beneath the Devon ice cap in the Canadian Arctic Researchers have found lakes that may shed new light on icy worlds in our Solar System. High in the Canadian Arctic, two subglacial bodies of water have been spotted beneath over 500 metres of ice. The water has an estimated maximum temperature of -10.5C, and would need to be very salty to avoid freezing. There are thought to be similar cold, saline conditions in the subsurface ocean of Jupiter's moon Europa, yet also the potential to host life. The findings, from a team led by the University of Alberta, have been published inScience Advances,external. At 1,200m - 1,700m above sea level, the lakes sit in long basins in a mountain range The two lakes appeared in a radar survey of the Devon Ice Cap, which sits on Devon Island, in Canada's northern Nunavut territory. ""I was super surprised, and a little bit puzzled,"" Anja Rutishauser, the study's lead author, said of the discovery. ""I was definitely not looking for subglacial lakes."" Although water systems beneath large ice sheets are being found to be increasingly common, Devon Island's ice cap was thought to be frozen to the bedrock beneath. These are the first subglacial lakes to be observed in the Canadian Arctic, and are estimated to cover areas of five and eight square kilometres respectively. ""It's an amazing finding, and one that I really wasn't expecting from the geophysical survey of this small ice cap,"" commented Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study. ""To my knowledge, this is a unique lake system. Of the [more than] 400 subglacial lakes in Antarctica, all of them are thought to comprise fresh water. Hence, whatever might be living in it may also be unique,"" he added. Surveys were conducted using radar antennae, mounted to the wings of an aircraft The water in the lakes is estimated to be five times as salty as seawater, allowing its freezing point to be lowered below that of fresh water. Other subglacial lakes in Greenland and Antarctica contain fresh water, generated by melting at the base of the ice. Geothermal heat rises from the underlying rock, and is insulated by the thick ice sheet above. The Canadian ice sheet is not thick enough to provide this insulation Salt-rich water has been studied beneath Taylor Glacier in Antarctica's McMurdo Dry Valleys, but this is supplied by an ancient marine water basin. The mountainous location of these lakes places them above previous sea levels, and their salinity is derived from the high salt content of surrounding rock. ""It is interesting,"" notes Prof Jemma Wadham from the University of Bristol, ""that the more places we look, the more subglacial lakes we find. Just like in non-glacial environments, there could be a huge diversity of lake types and life habitat conditions, and one size does not fit all."" Radar readings were taken across four years There are many answers researchers want to search for next. There may be an entire network of lakes in this region, beyond the two so far observed, and their size has yet to be determined. However the potential for these environments to host life is a pressing question, as they may represent a largely isolated microbial habitat. The study's authors suggest the lakes may have been sealed off from surrounding environments for up to 120,000 years. ""The probability of life to exist in these systems is high, though the modelled temperatures might suggest that the biological activity would be severely limited due to the low temperature,"" Dr Alison Murray of Nevada's Desert Research Institute told BBC News. View from the cockpit of a research flight They may also provide a window to life beyond Earth. Dr Claire Cousins from the University of St Andrews explains: ""While the chemistry of these lakes may be somewhat different to ocean environments on icy moons such as Europa, their otherwise extreme conditions will help us understand the habitability of hypersaline sub-ice environments."" While further radar surveys are next on the list, Anja Rutishauser and her colleagues hope to be able to drill into the lakes' waters one day, to better understand any ecosystem within. Such work could, Dr Murray says, provide ""a key to understanding the life-supporting nature of such systems which may occur in the icy and ocean worlds of the Solar System and beyond.""

"The circulation system plays a ""significant role"" in regulating the Earth's climate by distributing heat around the globe. A significant shift in the system of ocean currents that helps keep parts of Europe warm could send temperatures in the UK lower, scientists have found. They say the Atlantic Ocean circulation system is weaker now than it has been for more than 1,000 years - and has changed significantly in the past 150. The study, in the journal Nature, says it may be a response to increased melting ice and is likely to continue. Researchers say that could have an impact on Atlantic ecosystems. Scientists involved in the Atlas project - the largest study of deep Atlantic ecosystems ever undertaken - say the impact will not be of the order played out in the 2004 Hollywood blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow. But they say changes to the conveyor-belt-like system - also known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) - could cool the North Atlantic and north-west Europe and transform some deep-ocean ecosystems. That could also affect temperature-sensitive species like coral, and even Atlantic cod. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) was the basis of the a 2004 science fiction blockbuster Scientists believe the pattern is a response to fresh water from melting ice sheets being added to surface ocean water, meaning those surface waters ""can't get very dense and sink"". ""That puts a spanner in this whole system,"" lead researcher Dr David Thornalley, from University College London, explained. The concept of this system ""shutting down"" was featured in The Day After Tomorrow. ""Obviously that was a sensationalised version,"" said Dr Thornally. ""But much of the underlying science was correct, and there would be significant changes to climate it if did undergo a catastrophic collapse - although the film made those effects much more catastrophic, and happening much more quickly - than would actually be the case."" Nonetheless, a change to the system could cool the North Atlantic and north-west Europe and transform some deep-ocean ecosystems. That is why its measurement has been a key part of the Atlas project. Scientists say understanding what is happening to Amoc will help them make much more accurate forecasts of our future climate. Prof Murray Roberts, who co-ordinates the Atlas project at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC News: ""The changes we're seeing now in deep Atlantic currents could have massive effects on ocean ecosystems. ""The deep Atlantic contains some of the world's oldest and most spectacular cold-water coral reef and deep-sea sponge grounds. ""These delicate ecosystems rely on ocean currents to supply their food and disperse their offspring. Ocean currents are like highways spreading larvae throughout the ocean and we know these ecosystems have been really sensitive to past changes in the Earth's climate."" This video can not be played Biggest ever deep Atlantic exploration mission launched by UK scientists. To measure how the system has shifted over long timescales, researchers collected long cores of sediment from the sea floor. The sediment was laid down by past ocean currents, so the size of the sediment grains in different layers provided a measure of the current's strength over time. The results were also backed up by another study published in the same issue of Nature, led by researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. This work looked at climate model data to confirm that sea-surface temperature patterns can be used as an indicator of Amoc's strength and revealing that it has been weakening even more rapidly since 1950 in response to recent global warming. The scientists want to continue to study patterns in this crucial temperature-regulating system, to understand whether as ice sheets continue to melt, this could drive further slowdown - or even a shutdown of a system that regulates our climate.

"This video can not be played Footage of the crash was broadcast on Algerian TV An Algerian military plane has crashed near the capital killing 257 people on board, officials say. The aircraft came down just after taking off from Boufarik military airport, west of Algiers. An inquiry is under way into the cause of the crash - Algeria's worst-ever air disaster. The government has declared three days of national mourning. Most of the dead are army personnel and their families, the defence ministry says. Ten crew members also died. Passengers from Western Sahara, a disputed territory annexed by Morocco after Spain withdrew in 1975, were among the fatalities. The Polisario Front, which is seeking independence for the territory and is backed by Algeria, says 30 Western Saharans, including women and children, died. A senior member of Algeria's ruling FLN party said those killed included 26 Polisario members. The plane, an Ilyushin Il-76, was travelling to Bechar and Tindouf in the south-west of the country. The Tindouf region, which borders Western Sahara, is home to refugee camps and serves as a base for the Polisario Front. Country profile Rana Jawad, North Africa correspondent As one might expect in the immediate aftermath of such incidents, there are more questions than answers over this latest deadly plane crash in Algeria. For now, it is not known whether the cause was due to safety or mechanical problems, pilot error or interference - but these are elements that will likely be examined during the course of the investigation. The country's maintenance record of both military and commercial aircraft will also likely come under close scrutiny in the coming days. But for Algeria, and its military institution, the loss of life is a tragedy on a scale not seen before in its modern aviation history. Witnesses say they saw a wing catch fire as the plane took off. It then went down, avoiding a highway and crashing into a field. A military aviation observer told the BBC that, based on how intact portions of the plane were, they believed the pilot had tried to crash-land. Dozens of firefighters and rescuers worked around the smouldering wreckage. One eyewitness told local television: ""We saw bodies burned. It is a real disaster"". Officials are quoted as saying some survivors were taken to hospital, but it is unclear how many there were or what their current condition is. Wednesday's plane crash is the deadliest in the world since July 2014, when all 298 people on board Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 died when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine. It is also the second-deadliest plane crash since 2003.

"Yulia Skripal was treated in hospital for more than a month after exposure to a nerve agent Yulia Skripal, the poisoned daughter of Russian ex-spy Sergei, has rejected Russian embassy help ""at the moment"". The 33-year-old, who was discharged from hospital on Monday, said her father is ""still seriously ill"". In a statement issued through police, she said she was not yet strong enough to give a full media interview but ""no-one speaks for me, or for my father"". The Russian embassy said it doubted the statement ""really belongs to Yulia"" and said it raised new questions. Ms Skripal and her 66-year-old father, who were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury on 4 March, were exposed to the toxic nerve agent Novichok. Mr Skripal remains at Salisbury District Hospital. In her statement, Ms Skripal said she found herself in ""a totally different life than the ordinary one I left just over a month ago"". What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Poisoned ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital Who is Sergei Skripal? Ms Skripal, who has been taken to a secure location, added: ""I have specially-trained officers available to me, who are helping to take care of me and to explain the investigative processes that are being undertaken. ""I have access to friends and family, and I have been made aware of my specific contacts at the Russian embassy who have kindly offered me their assistance in any way they can. ""At the moment I do not wish to avail myself of their services, but, if I change my mind I know how to contact them."" The Russian embassy said the statement ""only strengthens suspicions that we are dealing with a forcible isolation of the Russian citizen"" and called on UK authorities to ""urgently provide tangible evidence"" that Ms Skripal was not deprived of her freedom. ""With no possibility to verify it, the publication by the Metropolitan Police raises new questions rather than gives answers,"" it said. ""As before, we would like to make sure that the statement really belongs to Yulia. So far, we doubt it much. ""The text has been composed in a special way so as to support official statements made by British authorities and at the same time to exclude every possibility of Yulia's contacts with the outer world - consuls, journalists, and even relatives."" Yulia and Sergei Skripal were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury The UK government says Russia was behind the poisoning, which has led to a diplomatic crisis between Moscow and the West. The Russian government has denied any involvement and accused the British of inventing a ""fake story"". More than 20 countries are expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. Tests on the nerve agent used on the Skripals have been conducted by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). A report from the OPCW has been received by the Cabinet Office and an executive summary will be published on Thursday. Viktoria Skripal has spoken to the BBC and Russian media since her relatives were poisoned While Yulia and Sergei were both being treated in hospital, her cousin Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, gave interviews to Russian news agencies and international outlets. Following Ms Skripal's discharge from Salisbury District Hospital on Monday, her cousin told Russian news agency Interfax that Ms Skripal planned to ask for political asylum - although she did not know in which country. But in her most recent statement, Ms Skripal clarified that Viktoria's ""opinions and assertions are not mine and they are not my father's"". She said: ""I am not yet strong enough to give a full interview to the media, as I one day hope to do. Until that time, I want to stress that no-one speaks for me, or for my father, but ourselves. ""I thank my cousin Viktoria for her concern for us, but ask that she does not visit me or try to contact me for the time being."" Ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital What happened to the Skripals?

"In his opening remarks Mr Zuckerberg said that Facebook was an ""idealistic"" company Facebook's chief executive has revealed that his data was among that harvested in a privacy scandal. Mark Zuckerberg made the disclosure during his second day of being questioned in Washington. In a related development, the political consultancy at the heart of the affair has announced its acting chief executive is stepping down. He also revealed that his firm was exploring whether to take action against the University of Cambridge. The institution is where the researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who had collected and sold personal data to Cambridge Analytica, was based. ""What we found now is that there's a whole programme associated with Cambridge University where... there were a number of other researchers building similar apps,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""So, we do need to understand whether there was something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger reaction from us."" The university has reacted by saying it would be ""surprised"" if Mr Zuckerberg was only now aware of the work. ""Our researchers have been publishing such research since 2013 in major peer-reviewed scientific journals, and these studies have been reported widely in international media,"" it added. ""These have included one study in 2015 led by Dr Aleksandr Spectre (Kogan) and co-authored by two Facebook employees.

Mr Zuckerberg's four hour appearance before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce followed a five hour session in front of two Senate committees yesterday. During a testy early exchange, he declined to give a commitment to change all users' default privacy settings to collect the minimum amount of personal information. ""This is a complex issue,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""That's disappointing to me,"" responded Democratic congressman Frank Pallone. Elsewhere in the hearing, Mr Zuckerberg acknowledged that he believed it was ""inevitable"" that the internet would need new regulations. ""My position is not that there should be no regulation, but I also think you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place,"" he said. The Facebook chief also faced fresh accusations from Republican congressman Steve Scalise that the News Feed's algorithm was discriminating against conservative news and content in favour of liberal posts. ""There is absolutely no directive in any of the changes that we make to have a bias,"" responded Mr Zuckerberg. ""To the contrary our goal is to be a platform for all ideas."" Another Republican pulled a surprise by displaying photos of illegal adverts for opioid drugs that he said had been live on Facebook yesterday. ""Facebook is actually enabling an illegal activity and in so doing you are hurting people,"" said congressman David McKinley. This screenshot showing adverts for Oxycodone and Buprenorphine was shown to the Facebook chief ""There are a number of areas of content that we need to do a better job of policing,"" Mr Zuckerberg replied, adding that he believed artificial intelligence tools would make this possible in the future. However, several of the politicians urged Facebook to be more proactive about the matter. Mr Zuckerberg also faced questions about the illegal trade of ivory in closed Facebook groups. In another combative exchange, the business leader was questioned about the data his firm collected on people who had never signed up to his service. Mr Zuckerberg said this was done for security purposes. But he professed not to be familiar with the term ""shadow profiles""despite it having been used widely,externalby the media during a past Facebook data privacy controversy. And he was unable to say how many types of data were being gathered about non-members. ""You said everyone controls their data,"" said Democratic congressman Ben Ray Lujan.

"Alfie has been treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital since December 2016 A date to switch off the life support for a seriously ill Merseyside toddler at the centre of a legal battle has been set by a High Court judge. In February, the High Court ruled Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpoolcould stop treating now 23-month-old Alfie Evans. The details of when it will happen cannot be reported for legal reasons. Alfie's parents' legal fight against the decision ultimately ended in March when theEuropean Court of Human Rights rejected their case. The toddler has been at Alder Hey since December 2016 with an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease. His parents, Kate James and Tom Evans, from Bootle, wanted doctors to take him to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital in Rome for diagnosis and possible treatment. Mr Justice Hayden said that when he made his High Court ruling in February, he accepted medical evidence that showed further treatment was ""futile"". He said the ""terrible reality"" of what had happened to Alfie was ""profoundly unfair"", but his ""need now is for good quality palliative care"". He added that during his legal fight, Mr Evans had been ""at times hot-headed and impetuous, but he delights in his son"" and had ""encountered an unfairness about which he can do nothing"". ""His frustration at that has been palpable,"" the judge added. The Christian Legal Centre's barrister Paul Diamond represented Alfie's parents in the latest hearing at the High Court Family Division in London. After the hearing the legal organisation which defends Christians said: ""We are obviously disappointed with today's outcome. ""We are discussing with the family any other legal remedies available. ""While hope looks dim, we nonetheless celebrate Alfie's life. The impact his short life has made ultimately shows the world the precariousness of human life. ""My thoughts and prayers are with Kate and Tom this evening."" In a statement on its website, Alder Hey Children's Hospital said: ""We understand this is a difficult time for Alfie's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected.

"This video can not be played What Paul Ryan quitting could really mean US House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan will not run for re-election this year, in a big blow to Republicans with mid-term elections looming. Congress' most powerful lawmaker said he would not stand for another term in his Wisconsin district this November. Republicans already face a tough challenge from Democrats to keep control of the lower chamber. Mr Ryan joins nearly 30 House Republicans who have announced this year they are retiring outright. Democrats need 20 or so seats to take over the House. In a Wednesday morning news conference, Mr Ryan said the decision was family-related. ""You all know that I did not seek this job,"" he said. ""I took it reluctantly. ""But I have given this job everything. I have no regrets whatsoever for having accepted this responsibility."" He continued: ""But the truth is it's easy for it to take over everything in your life and you can't just let that happen."" The 48-year-old father-of-three said he did not want to be known by his children as ""only a weekend dad"". Profile: House Speaker Paul Ryan Mr Ryan said he would retire in January after finishing his congressional term. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Paul Ryan had to be coaxed into taking the speaker's gavel in 2015 and never seemed to relish the job. Rumours had been swirling in conservative circles for months that he was eyeing the exits. The speaker will frame his decision as one of putting family first - and, with young children, the fundraising and legislative duties of the office are burdensome - but it's impossible not to view the move in a larger political context. He's had frequent clashes with Donald Trump, and their differences - in temperament and policy - continue to be stark. A mid-term election looms, and there are at least even odds that a Democrat could be speaker next year. Even if Republicans prevail, their majority will certainly be diminished, making the job of passing legislation through a party already torn between moderates and ideological hardliners all the more difficult. Rather than go down with the ship - or perhaps suffer the same fate as Tom Foley in 1994, the last sitting speaker to lose a re-election race - Mr Ryan is reserving his seat on a lifeboat. He's not the first congressional Republican to do so, and with the top man leading the way, more are sure to follow. Mr Ryan - with his wife, Janna, and daughter, Liza, by his side - was re-elected comfortably in 2016 According to Axios,external, which broke the story, he has found his job frustrating, partly because of President Donald Trump. US House speaker deletes tax cuts tweet Mr Trump praised the speaker on Twitter as ""a truly good man"". In an interview with CNN, Mr Ryan explained that he and Mr Trump are ""very different people"". ""I'm from the upper Midwest. I'm not from New York, we're from a different generation. So we have different styles,"" Mr Ryan said. He added that despite having ""had a lot of friction in our relationship,"" the two men have a ""common agenda to agree on"". ""I'm not going to run for president"", he said, concluding: ""The last thing I'm thinking about is running for something."" The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Mr Ryan's departure was an ominous sign for Republicans, months away from nationwide elections. Allow Twitter content?

""Stay tuned for more retirements as Republicans increasingly realise that their midterm prospects are doomed,"" the fundraising committee added. Mr Ryan's seat in Wisconsin's first district could now fall into Democratic hands, according to analysts at the Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball. All 435 House lawmakers and 35 senators will face the voters this November, in what will amount to a referendum on Republican control of Congress and the White House. The resignation of Mr Ryan - whose role as House speaker places him second-in-line to the president after Vice-President Mike Pence - will spark speculation about whether he could one day mount a White House campaign. The clean-cut conservative, who has served in the House since 1999, was the Republican vice-presidential running mate for Mitt Romney in 2012. Allow Twitter content?

In December Mr Ryan achieved his cherished goal of overhauling the US tax code, and according to Axios, regarded it as the capstone of his legislative career. Republican congressman Steve Scalise and former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus are among those being touted as possible successors. Meanwhile, the House speaker whom Mr Ryan replaced - John Boehner - announced on Twitter he is joining the board of a legal cannabis corporation ""because my thinking on cannabis has evolved"". The Ohio Republican, who retired from politics in 2015, once said he was ""unalterably opposed"" to legalising marijuana.

"This video can not be played Suspected chemical attack is 'barbaric' - May Theresa May looks ready to join military action against the Assad regime in Syria without first seeking parliamentary consent, well-placed sources have told the BBC. The prime minister is said by government insiders to see the need for a response as urgent. She wants to prevent a repeat of the apparent chemical attack near Damascus, which she described as ""abhorrent"". Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has warned that bombing could escalate the situation. Mrs May is understood to be reluctant to ask US President Donald Trump to hold off any action until she has the opportunity to consult MPs at Westminster. Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Trump says missiles 'will be coming' Corbyn warns against US-Russia 'hot war' Formally, she has yet to unequivocally point the finger of blame at the Assad government, the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar said. She has spoken of the need for action ""if"" the regime is found to bear responsibility, he added, but the strong assumption in Downing Street and Whitehall is the attack will be attributed to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. Action is thought likely to follow within days. Mrs May earlier described the use of chemical weapons as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" that ""cannot go unchallenged"". She did not comment on Donald Trump's tweet warning Russia to ""get ready"" for missiles being fired at its ally Syria. By the BBC's Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar The prime minister's instinct is to chew carefully on the decision of whether and how Britain should support action in response to the apparent chemical attack in Syria. She still speaks of the need to act ""if"" not ""as"" the Assad regime is responsible. But the uncomfortable truth is the form of action is beyond her control. Read John's full blog Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC that Parliament ""should always be given a say on any military action"". ""We don't want bombardment which leads to escalation and a hot war between the US and Russia over the skies of Syria,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable did not rule out backing military but he said Parliament would have to give its approval and there would have to be ""some strong conditions around it"". Medical sources say dozens of people were killed, including children, during the alleged toxic bombing of the formerly rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Russia has described the reports of the chemical attack as a ""provocation"" designed to justify Western intervention against the Syrian regime. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Military action risks escalating Syria crisis Mrs May described the alleged chemical attack as a ""shocking, barbaric act"" and said she was ""appalled but not surprised"" at Russia, which vetoed a US-drafted UN resolution proposing a new inquiry to establish who was to blame. She said investigations were continuing but that ""all the indications"" were that the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad, which denies mounting a chemical attack, was responsible. The UK and its allies were looking at ways to ""prevent and deter"" the use of chemical weapons, she added. On Tuesday she spoke on the phone with US President Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, agreeing their three countries would work together to take action to ""uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons"". The SNP called for action against the Syria government, including blocking its ""purchasing and importing abilities"" and sanctions against key people and companies. The party's defence spokesman Stewart McDonald said that while the case for action was clear, air strikes ""will not provide the long term solutions needed to end the war"". The fallout from the attack has sparked a war of words on who was responsible and what the response should be. On Twitter, President Trump responded to a warning from Alexander Zasypkin, Moscow's ambassador to Lebanon, that missiles would be shot down and their launch sites targeted if they threatened the lives of Russian personnel. ""Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,"" he wrote. Why is there a war in Syria? ""Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'"" On Tuesday President Macron said that if military action was taken, it would target ""the regime's chemical capabilities"", and not the forces of its allies, Russia or Iran. Speaking in Paris, he said he did ""not want an escalation"" and that a decision would be made in the coming days. The information that France had showed ""chemical weapons were indeed used and that the regime could clearly be held responsible"", Mr Macron added. On Tuesday the UN Security Council failed to approve moves to set up an inquiry into the alleged attack on Douma. As permanent members of the council, Russia and the US vetoed each other's proposals to set up independent investigations. The US-drafted resolution would have allowed investigators to apportion blame for the suspected attack, while Russia's version would have left that to the Security Council. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had said earlier that inspectors would travel to the town to investigate.

They agreed that the use of chemical weapons must not ""go unchallenged"". But Transport Minister Jo Johnson later stressed: ""There has been no decision to take military action at this point."" No details of UK involvement in any military action in Syria were mentioned in the Downing Street statement.

President Trump is expected to speak to French President Emmanuel Macron about what form action could take, with the White House saying ""no final decision has been made"".

Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It would be outrageous for the government not to bring military action in Syria to Parliament - for Parliament to have a vote... ""The reason they're not doing it is they are frightened they'll lose the vote."" Mrs May has said ""all the indications"" are that the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad, which denies mounting a chemical attack, was responsible for the alleged attack in the formerly rebel-held town of Douma.

This video can not be played Should Parliament have a vote on Syria strikes? By Chris Buckler, BBC US correspondent Theresa May and Donald Trump spoke on the phone late on Thursday The diplomatic discussions are starting to feel like part of a waiting game. The White House insists that final decisions have still to be made. However, in their phone call, President Trump and Mrs May agreed it was vital action was taken to deter President Assad's forces from using chemical weapons. Evidence is still being gathered, but US officials are understood to have results from blood and urine samples that indicate chlorine and a nerve agent were used in the Syrian town of Douma. But they privately admit they can't be 100% sure. And with Russia threatening retaliation - and warning of the risk of some kind of conflict with the US - there is pressure to develop a wider strategy, alongside any plan for military strikes. Downing Street said the cabinet had ""agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged"" and ""on the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress and to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime"". ""Cabinet agreed the prime minister should continue to work with allies in the United States and France to coordinate an international response,"" the statement added.

"The circulation system plays a ""significant role"" in regulating the Earth's climate by distributing heat around the globe. A significant shift in the system of ocean currents that helps keep parts of Europe warm could send temperatures in the UK lower, scientists have found. They say the Atlantic Ocean circulation system is weaker now than it has been for more than 1,000 years - and has changed significantly in the past 150. The study, in the journal Nature, says it may be a response to increased melting ice and is likely to continue. Researchers say that could have an impact on Atlantic ecosystems. Scientists involved in the Atlas project - the largest study of deep Atlantic ecosystems ever undertaken - say the impact will not be of the order played out in the 2004 Hollywood blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow. But they say changes to the conveyor-belt-like system - also known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) - could cool the North Atlantic and north-west Europe and transform some deep-ocean ecosystems. That could also affect temperature-sensitive species like coral, and even Atlantic cod. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) was the basis of the a 2004 science fiction blockbuster Scientists believe the pattern is a response to fresh water from melting ice sheets being added to surface ocean water, meaning those surface waters ""can't get very dense and sink"". ""That puts a spanner in this whole system,"" lead researcher Dr David Thornalley, from University College London, explained. The concept of this system ""shutting down"" was featured in The Day After Tomorrow. ""Obviously that was a sensationalised version,"" said Dr Thornally. ""But much of the underlying science was correct, and there would be significant changes to climate it if did undergo a catastrophic collapse - although the film made those effects much more catastrophic, and happening much more quickly - than would actually be the case."" Nonetheless, a change to the system could cool the North Atlantic and north-west Europe and transform some deep-ocean ecosystems. That is why its measurement has been a key part of the Atlas project. Scientists say understanding what is happening to Amoc will help them make much more accurate forecasts of our future climate. Prof Murray Roberts, who co-ordinates the Atlas project at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC News: ""The changes we're seeing now in deep Atlantic currents could have massive effects on ocean ecosystems. ""The deep Atlantic contains some of the world's oldest and most spectacular cold-water coral reef and deep-sea sponge grounds. ""These delicate ecosystems rely on ocean currents to supply their food and disperse their offspring. Ocean currents are like highways spreading larvae throughout the ocean and we know these ecosystems have been really sensitive to past changes in the Earth's climate."" This video can not be played Biggest ever deep Atlantic exploration mission launched by UK scientists. To measure how the system has shifted over long timescales, researchers collected long cores of sediment from the sea floor. The sediment was laid down by past ocean currents, so the size of the sediment grains in different layers provided a measure of the current's strength over time. The results were also backed up by another study published in the same issue of Nature, led by researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. This work looked at climate model data to confirm that sea-surface temperature patterns can be used as an indicator of Amoc's strength and revealing that it has been weakening even more rapidly since 1950 in response to recent global warming. The scientists want to continue to study patterns in this crucial temperature-regulating system, to understand whether as ice sheets continue to melt, this could drive further slowdown - or even a shutdown of a system that regulates our climate.

"The inquest is looking at whether Alexander Perepilichnyy died of natural causes or was unlawfully killed A Russian whistleblower who died in mysterious circumstances seemed nervous the day before his death, his secret lover has told an inquest. Elmira Medynska also said Alexander Perepilichnyy was sick on their last night in Paris a day before he collapsed near his Surrey home. An inquest is trying to decide if he died of natural causes or was murdered. The Old Bailey also heard that no traces of several poisons were found in his system. Coroner Nicholas Hilliard QChas already heard no plant toxins were foundin the whistleblower following claims he had been poisoned. Elmira Medynska (pictured next to a French lawyer) appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from Paris Ms Medynska, a 28-year-old Ukrainian fashion designer, said Mr Perepilichnyy, 44, contacted her through a dating website in March 2012. She said he used a false name and she did not know he was married with children until reading media reports after his death in November of that year. The couple first met in Kiev in May 2012 with Ms Medynska saying he made a ""very good impression as a nice and educated man"". They met again in Nice in June before their two-night ""romantic holiday"" to Paris on 8 November 2012. Ms Medynska, who spoke to the court via video link from Paris, said he appeared ""very stressed"" about his work and was ""on another planet"" when they went shopping to buy her a Prada bag and Louboutin shoes. Elmira Medynska was contacted by Alexander Perepilichnyy on a dating website The night before his death they went to Buddha Bar, a luxury restaurant in Paris, where he took the best seat at the table so he could see around the room, the coroner was told. He also sent back a dish believed to be either tempura prawns or vegetables which he said tasted bad. When they returned to their five-star hotel, Mr Perepilichnyy locked himself in the bathroom for about an hour and Ms Medysnak said she heard him vomit three times. The next morning he seemed in a ""good mood"" and had a ""good appetite"" for their breakfast before they went to the airport to return home, him to Weybridge and her to Kiev. Alexander Perepilichnyy was found lying in the road near his home in Weybridge Ms Medynska said he seemed happy when they parted and was already planning their next trip to Switzerland in December. Unbeknown to her, later on 10 November 2012, Mr Perepilichnyy collapsed and died while out jogging near his home in Weybridge. Two days later she received a phone call from a British number from someone purporting to be the emergency services telling her Mr Perepilichnyy had been in a ""car accident"" and asking her what her relationship was to him. She got another phone call the following day but her questions about how and where he was were not answered, she said. Mr Medynska heard no more about her Russian lover until New Year's Eve 2012 when she read on the internet that he had died. Those media reports also detailed his involvement in exposing a $230m (Â£150m) money-laundering scheme in Russia and suggestions he may have been murdered. She said the reports about him ""scared"" her because she had only known a ""very nice person"" but ""in fact I knew nothing about this man"". Ms Medynska said she also received an email from Mr Perepilichnyy's address after his death saying she would ""die soon from Aids"". Peter Skelton, counsel to the coroner, asked if the email could have been sent by Mr Perepilichnyy's widow. She said: ""Maybe. I don't know."" The inquest also heard from Dr Stuart Black who had tested Mr Perepilichnyy's hair and urine for traces of heavy metal poisons, such as arsenic, or anion poisons, like cyanide. He said the tests showed Mr Perepilichnyy ""was not poisoned"" with anything from either group. The inquest continues.

"Alfie has been treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital since December 2016 A date to switch off the life support for a seriously ill Merseyside toddler at the centre of a legal battle has been set by a High Court judge. In February, the High Court ruled Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpoolcould stop treating now 23-month-old Alfie Evans. The details of when it will happen cannot be reported for legal reasons. Alfie's parents' legal fight against the decision ultimately ended in March when theEuropean Court of Human Rights rejected their case. The toddler has been at Alder Hey since December 2016 with an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease. His parents, Kate James and Tom Evans, from Bootle, wanted doctors to take him to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital in Rome for diagnosis and possible treatment. Mr Justice Hayden said that when he made his High Court ruling in February, he accepted medical evidence that showed further treatment was ""futile"". He said the ""terrible reality"" of what had happened to Alfie was ""profoundly unfair"", but his ""need now is for good quality palliative care"". He added that during his legal fight, Mr Evans had been ""at times hot-headed and impetuous, but he delights in his son"" and had ""encountered an unfairness about which he can do nothing"". ""His frustration at that has been palpable,"" the judge added. The Christian Legal Centre's barrister Paul Diamond represented Alfie's parents in the latest hearing at the High Court Family Division in London. After the hearing the legal organisation which defends Christians said: ""We are obviously disappointed with today's outcome. ""We are discussing with the family any other legal remedies available. ""While hope looks dim, we nonetheless celebrate Alfie's life. The impact his short life has made ultimately shows the world the precariousness of human life. ""My thoughts and prayers are with Kate and Tom this evening."" In a statement on its website, Alder Hey Children's Hospital said: ""We understand this is a difficult time for Alfie's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected. ""The trust will not be issuing any further comment at this point.""

"Stephen Lawrence was murdered in 1993 The investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence is ""unlikely to progress further"" without new information, police have said. Mr Lawrence, 18, was killed in a racially-motivated attack in Eltham, south-east London on 22 April 1993. The Met said despite rigorous efforts, its inquiry was ""unlikely to progress."" Two men were jailed for his murder in 2012 and Mr Lawrence's motherpreviously called for the policeto ""be honest"" about any further convictions. Stephen Lawrence murder timeline Profile of Stephen Lawrence Stephen Lawrence inquiry probe delayed Doreen Lawrence told theDaily Mail,externalshe believed detectives had run out of lines of inquiry but were worried about her reaction if they closed the case. ""Despite previous public appeals, rigorous pursuit of all remaining lines of enquiry, numerous reviews and every possible advance in forensic techniques, the Met investigation team is now at a stage where without new information the investigation is unlikely to progress further"", the Met said. ""This was explained to the family earlier this year."" Gary Dobson and David Norris were each told they would serve more than 14 years in jail In 2012, Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of Mr Lawrence's murder and jailed for life. Stephen's father Neville Lawrence told BBC News he would accept the inquiry being scaled back but believed it should not be completely closed. ""Something should be left in case of something coming in so they can reopen it if that's the case,"" he said. Dr Lawrence added that he remained hopeful that, with the publicity around the 25th anniversary of his son's death and a BBC documentary to be shown over three nights next week,Stephen: The Murder That Changed A Nation, someone would come forward. ""The threat of anything happening to them now isn't as great as it was in the early days... It would be nice if we could have absolutely full justice."" Senior investigator Chris Le Pere said: ""With the approaching anniversary and airing of the documentary... there is still the opportunity for someone who knows what happened that night, to have a conscience and come forward.

"Online retailer Shop Direct will close three warehouses in Greater Manchester, putting nearly 2,000 jobs at risk. The group, which owns Very.co.uk and Littlewoods.com, said it would close its sites in Shaw, Little Hulton and Chadderton. It plans to build a new warehouse in the East Midlands employing 500 people, but said redundancies were likely. Derek Harding, Shop Direct interim chief executive, said it was a ""tough day for the business"". ""However, these proposals are necessary for our future and to enable us to continue to grow and meet rising customer expectations."" Headquartered in Liverpool, Shop Direct is one of the UK's biggest online retailers and traces its roots to a variety of mail order companies in northern England. The firm, which also owns fashion portal Very Exclusive, is owned by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, the billionaire brothers who also own the Daily Telegraph newspaper titles. Shop Direct said it would close the warehouses from mid-2020 onwards and start operating in the East Midlands in 2021. The site will be fully automated, which Shop Direct said would allow it to respond more quickly to changing consumer demand. The move puts the jobs of 1,177 Shop Direct employees and 815 agency workers in doubt. All of the affected Shop Direct employees are consulting with the firm about the changes, with the Usdaw union supporting staff. Despite a recent slowdown on the High Street driven by weaker consumer confidence, online retail sales have proven resilient. According to Shop Direct, its sales climbed 5.6% last year to Â£1.93bn. Explaining its decision, the firm said the new site would allow it to process more orders and reduce the time it takes to get products to customers. Who are the Barclay brothers?

"Syrian Army soldiers gather near the town of Douma, where the suspected chemical attack happened Russia has urged the US to avoid taking military action in response to an alleged chemical attack in Syria. ""I would once again beseech you to refrain from the plans that you're currently developing,"" Moscow's UN envoy Vasily Nebenzia said on Tuesday. He warned Washington that it will ""bear responsibility"" for any ""illegal military adventure"" it carries out. But Western leaders say they have agreed to work together to target those responsible for the attack in Douma. French President Emmanuel Macron said any strikes would target Syrian government chemical facilities. US President Donald Trump has promised a ""forceful"" response, and he and his Defence Secretary, James Mattis, have cancelled travel plans this week. UK agrees Syria action with US and France Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Why is there a war in Syria? Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say dozens of people died in a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. President Bashar al-Assad's government - which receives military backing from Russia - denies being behind any chemical attack. The warning from Moscow came during a divided meeting of the UN Security Council which failed to pass any measures to set up an inquiry into the alleged attack. As permanent members of the council, Russia and the US both have  the power to veto. They both blocked each other's proposals to set up independent investigations. The US-drafted resolution would have allowed investigators to apportion blame for the suspected attack, while Russia's version would have left that to the Security Council. A team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),externalis due to deploy to Syria ""shortly"" to determine whether banned weapons were used in Douma. But the OPCW will not seek to establish who was responsible for the attack. US ambassador Nikki Haley and Russia ambassador Vasily Nebenzia clashed at the UN The UN session was the latest in a series of showdowns between Russia and the US and saw harsh words exchanged between the countries. Mr Nebenzia accused the US of ""planting this resolution"" as a ""pretext"" to justify military action. ""We could find ourselves on the threshold of some very sad and serious events,"" he said.

"Footage from Douma in the aftermath of the attack appeared to show people using water to counteract the effects The World Health Organization (WHO) has demanded ""unhindered access"" to Douma in Syria to check reports from its partners that 500 people were affected by a chemical attack there.

"Val was first diagnosed with cancer in January 2015 A woman who lost her jaw to cancer has had it regrown from her own skin and bone. Val had the bottom of her mouth and chin destroyed by cancer more than two years ago. The 55-year-old was left unable to eat, drink and talk, taking early retirement from her job as a postwoman. Using new treatment, surgeons from Nottingham and Wolverhampton have reconstructed her jaw by ""stretching"" her own tissue and bone around a frame. Dilip Srinivasan was part of the team that carried out the operation Known as distraction osteogenesis, the process has been around for a number of years but never been used in this way before, Dilip Srinivasan, maxillofacial surgeon at Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, said. East Midlands Live: Police force breeds first puppies; Complaints over repeated flooding A frame built at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham has acted as ""scaffolding"", and since an operation in January the jaw has grown 9cm. It is hoped the final surgery to remove the frame will take place in May. A frame has been used to help Val's jaw grow The operation was carried out in January Val, from Wolverhampton, first found a lump underneath her tongue in January 2015 and following diagnosis has had glands, chin, lower lip and part of her tongue removed. After two previous attempts to reconstruct her jaw using skin grafts failed, and with her being unable to use a prosthetic replacement, she hopes the procedure will improve her life. ""Having lived like this for two years I'd begun to accept that this is how life was going to be, but now I'm so much more hopeful for a different future,"" she said. Val said she hopes the operation will improve her quality of life Mr Srinivasan said: ""We have been able to achieve this in a few operations before, but we'd never attempted it on a patient missing bone, skin and muscles. ""When there's no jaw, there's no shape to follow, and if there's no shape to follow everything will grow in a straight line.""

"This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite Thousands of people who arrived in the UK as children in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration face being threatened with deportation. They have lived and worked in the UK for decades but many are now being told they are here illegally. A new petition on the government's website calling on the Home Office to grant them an amnesty has attracted more than 23,000 signatures. The Home Office said it would handle applications to stay ""sensitively"". A slap in the face for the Windrush generation? The problem arises from the fact that under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain - but the right to free movement between Commonwealth nations was ended from that date onwards. However, the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for the individuals to now prove they are in the UK legally. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University estimates there are 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971. ""This is a slap in the face for the Windrush generation,"" said Patrick Vernon, who started the petition, a reference to the Empire Windrush, which brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. People who had ""worked hard, paid their taxes, raised children and see Britain as their home"" were being ""threatened and harassed"" by the Home Office in what he described as ""an historic injustice"". It was particularly ironic, he added, because 2018 was the 70th anniversary of the Empire Windrush's arrival at Tilbury docks, in Essex. He said his aim was to gain the 100,000 signatures needed to trigger a debate in Parliament and force the government to stop deportations, establish an amnesty and pay compensation to those who had suffered ""loss and hurt"". Labour MP David Lammy, who is backing the campaign, tweeted: ""We invited people as citizens, Home Office treating them like criminals."" Allow Twitter content?

People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parent's passports without their own ID documents. Many have never applied for a passport in their own name or had their immigration status formalised, as they regarded themselves as British. TheGuardian newspaper has highlighted a number of cases,externalof such people being threatened with deportation. Earlier this year, the Labour peer Lord Faulkner raised the case of Paulette Wilson, a former cook at the House of Commons, who had come to Britain from Jamaica in 1968. One woman was sent to Yarl's Wood immigration removals centre ""(She) had never applied for a passport because she assumed she would not need one if she did not intend to travel abroad,"" he told the House of Lords. ""One day, she got a letter from the Home Office telling her to register each month at the Solihull immigration centre. ""While she was there on a visit, officials declared that she was an illegal immigrant, had her carted off to the appalling Yarl's Wood immigration removal complex and told her that she would be deported - presumably back to Jamaica, which she had not visited since she left as a child almost 50 years before,"" he added. She was saved from deportation by the intervention of her MP, Emma Reynolds, and the Refugee and Migrant Centre in Wolverhampton. She has now been given leave to remain, said Lord Faulkner, ""although she has lost benefits for the past two years, as well as her flat, and has to rely on financial support from her daughter"". He said there were ""many others"" like Mrs Wilson - and he blamed measures introduced by then Home Secretary Theresa May in 2013 to make the UK a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants, restricting access to jobs, driving licences, benefits, health care and accommodation. He said this had ""clearly led to overzealous interventions by officials"". A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We value the contribution made by former Commonwealth citizens who have made a life in the UK. ""We want to assure individuals who have resided in the UK for an extended period but feel they may not have the correct documentation confirming their status that there are existing solutions available. ""They should take legal advice and submit the appropriate application with correct evidence so we can progress the case. ""We have no intention of making people leave who have the right to remain here,"" the Home Office added. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said there were cases of Australian, Canadian and South African, Indian and Pakistan-born citizens facing the same problem. But it was ""not as likely you will be asked to demonstrate your immigration status"" by landlords or officials if you were ""white and of European origin"", JCWI chief executive, Satbir Singh, told BBC News. The JCWI is calling for Commonwealth citizens who arrived before 1971 to be given the same status as EU citizens living in the UK, who will face a much lower burden of proof of residence than the Commonwealth citizens after Brexit. The final details have yet to be confirmed but EU citizens may be able to produce things like school registration paperwork or library cards to prove residence, something that would not be accepted from Commonwealth citizens, the campaign group said.

"Alfie has been treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital since December 2016 A date to switch off the life support for a seriously ill Merseyside toddler at the centre of a legal battle has been set by a High Court judge. In February, the High Court ruled Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpoolcould stop treating now 23-month-old Alfie Evans. The details of when it will happen cannot be reported for legal reasons. Alfie's parents' legal fight against the decision ultimately ended in March when theEuropean Court of Human Rights rejected their case. The toddler has been at Alder Hey since December 2016 with an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease. His parents, Kate James and Tom Evans, from Bootle, wanted doctors to take him to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital in Rome for diagnosis and possible treatment. Mr Justice Hayden said that when he made his High Court ruling in February, he accepted medical evidence that showed further treatment was ""futile"". He said the ""terrible reality"" of what had happened to Alfie was ""profoundly unfair"", but his ""need now is for good quality palliative care"". He added that during his legal fight, Mr Evans had been ""at times hot-headed and impetuous, but he delights in his son"" and had ""encountered an unfairness about which he can do nothing"". ""His frustration at that has been palpable,"" the judge added. The Christian Legal Centre's barrister Paul Diamond represented Alfie's parents in the latest hearing at the High Court Family Division in London. After the hearing the legal organisation which defends Christians said: ""We are obviously disappointed with today's outcome. ""We are discussing with the family any other legal remedies available. ""While hope looks dim, we nonetheless celebrate Alfie's life. The impact his short life has made ultimately shows the world the precariousness of human life. ""My thoughts and prayers are with Kate and Tom this evening."" In a statement on its website, Alder Hey Children's Hospital said: ""We understand this is a difficult time for Alfie's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected. ""The trust will not be issuing any further comment at this point.""

"Karl-Erivan Haub has been head of the Tengelmann retail empire since 2000 Rescue teams are searching for one of Germany's richest men, who has gone missing while skiing in the Swiss Alps.

"GWR says that its customers' payment card details were protected by encryption A British rail operator has reset more than a million customer accounts after discovering hackers had successfully breached a small percentage of them. Great Western Railway said that about 1,000 of its passengers' details had been exposed. The business - which runs trains between London, Penzance and Worcester - is part of the transport operator FirstGroup. It said all bank information had been protected by encryption. ""We have identified unauthorised automated attempts to access a small number of GWR.com accounts over the past week,"" a spokesman told the BBC. ""While we were able to shut this activity down quickly and contact those affected, a small proportion of accounts were successfully accessed. ""The success rate of the automated logins was extremely low, suggesting any passwords used were likely harvested elsewhere,"" the company added. Account holders have been sent emails to notify them of the breach The firm added that the decision to reset all customer accounts had been taken as a precautionary step. Some recipients of the alert had questioned if it was real, as the email address it had been sent from seemed unusual. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Suspected chemical attack is 'barbaric' - May Theresa May looks ready to join military action against the Assad regime in Syria without first seeking parliamentary consent, well-placed sources have told the BBC. The prime minister is said by government insiders to see the need for a response as urgent. She wants to prevent a repeat of the apparent chemical attack near Damascus, which she described as ""abhorrent"". Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has warned that bombing could escalate the situation. Mrs May is understood to be reluctant to ask US President Donald Trump to hold off any action until she has the opportunity to consult MPs at Westminster. Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Trump says missiles 'will be coming' Corbyn warns against US-Russia 'hot war' Formally, she has yet to unequivocally point the finger of blame at the Assad government, the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar said. She has spoken of the need for action ""if"" the regime is found to bear responsibility, he added, but the strong assumption in Downing Street and Whitehall is the attack will be attributed to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. Action is thought likely to follow within days. Mrs May earlier described the use of chemical weapons as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" that ""cannot go unchallenged"". She did not comment on Donald Trump's tweet warning Russia to ""get ready"" for missiles being fired at its ally Syria. By the BBC's Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar The prime minister's instinct is to chew carefully on the decision of whether and how Britain should support action in response to the apparent chemical attack in Syria. She still speaks of the need to act ""if"" not ""as"" the Assad regime is responsible. But the uncomfortable truth is the form of action is beyond her control. Read John's full blog Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC that Parliament ""should always be given a say on any military action"". ""We don't want bombardment which leads to escalation and a hot war between the US and Russia over the skies of Syria,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable did not rule out backing military but he said Parliament would have to give its approval and there would have to be ""some strong conditions around it"". Medical sources say dozens of people were killed, including children, during the alleged toxic bombing of the formerly rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Russia has described the reports of the chemical attack as a ""provocation"" designed to justify Western intervention against the Syrian regime. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Military action risks escalating Syria crisis Mrs May described the alleged chemical attack as a ""shocking, barbaric act"" and said she was ""appalled but not surprised"" at Russia, which vetoed a US-drafted UN resolution proposing a new inquiry to establish who was to blame. She said investigations were continuing but that ""all the indications"" were that the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad, which denies mounting a chemical attack, was responsible. The UK and its allies were looking at ways to ""prevent and deter"" the use of chemical weapons, she added. On Tuesday she spoke on the phone with US President Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, agreeing their three countries would work together to take action to ""uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons"". The SNP called for action against the Syria government, including blocking its ""purchasing and importing abilities"" and sanctions against key people and companies. The party's defence spokesman Stewart McDonald said that while the case for action was clear, air strikes ""will not provide the long term solutions needed to end the war"". The fallout from the attack has sparked a war of words on who was responsible and what the response should be. On Twitter, President Trump responded to a warning from Alexander Zasypkin, Moscow's ambassador to Lebanon, that missiles would be shot down and their launch sites targeted if they threatened the lives of Russian personnel. ""Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,"" he wrote. Why is there a war in Syria? ""Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'"" On Tuesday President Macron said that if military action was taken, it would target ""the regime's chemical capabilities"", and not the forces of its allies, Russia or Iran. Speaking in Paris, he said he did ""not want an escalation"" and that a decision would be made in the coming days. The information that France had showed ""chemical weapons were indeed used and that the regime could clearly be held responsible"", Mr Macron added. On Tuesday the UN Security Council failed to approve moves to set up an inquiry into the alleged attack on Douma. As permanent members of the council, Russia and the US vetoed each other's proposals to set up independent investigations. The US-drafted resolution would have allowed investigators to apportion blame for the suspected attack, while Russia's version would have left that to the Security Council. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had said earlier that inspectors would travel to the town to investigate.

"Father Moore was jailed for nine years A Catholic priest has been jailed for nine years for sexually abusing three children and a student priest in crimes spanning more than 20 years. Father Paul Moore, 82, committed the crimes in various locations in Ayrshire between 1977 and 1996. The court heard how he abused one boy at a school, another at a leisure centre and a third on the beach at Irvine in the 1970s. He was also found guilty of indecently assaulting a student priest in 1995. Priest convicted of abuse 20 years after confession Paedophile priest poisoned my life The judge Lady Rae told Moore he was guilty of despicable crimes and a gross breach of trust. She also said the victims had shown considerable courage in coming forward. This video can not be played Judge Lady Rae said Moore took advantage of his position The youngest was just five when the priest abused him in his primary school. The court heard that the priest groomed some of his victims by taking them swimming or out for meals before sexually abusing them. A BBC Scotland investigation revealed five years ago that Moore confessed his abuse to his bishop in 1996. Bishop Maurice Taylor, 91, gave evidence in the trial and told the court Moore admitted he had ""an attraction to young boys"" and had ""a desire to abuse minors"". The bishop sent him to a treatment centre in Toronto and to Fort Augustus Abbey in the Highlands. Moore was removed from the pastoral ministry after his admission but continued to live in a house purchased by the church. The priest, who was identified in court as Francis Moore but was known as Father Paul, was found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Father Moore was sent to Fort Augustus after allegedly admitting child abuse to a bishop The Catholic Church in Scotland said it wished to ""sincerely renew"" its apologies to victims. Bishop William Nolan, the Bishop of Galloway said: ""All allegations of abuse are taken seriously and are reported to the police. It is hoped that publicity from a case like this will encourage survivors to come forward knowing that they will be heard and that justice can be achieved. ""I hope that the sentencing of the individual responsible will bring some comfort to those who have suffered, although it can never undo the harm they have experienced or the long wait for justice they have had to endure. ""I sincerely renew the apologies previously made for the abuse suffered by anyone in the care of those ministering or working on behalf of the Church.

Richard Osborn-Brooks, 78, was initially held on suspicion of murder, but released with no further action. The Met has asked members of the public to ""respect the wishes"" of those leaving tributes in the area. Scotland Yard said it was liaising with Lewisham Council on an ""appropriate management of the floral tributes"". Flowers left for burglar 'an insult' Hither Green burglary suspect hunted by Met Police What are your rights in tackling burglars? In a statement, Ch Supt Simon Dobinson said: ""We would also request those placing tributes or visiting the area to behave in a responsible manner so as not to disrupt the local community. ""I do not want anyone to feel intimidated or that they are not being allowed to respond in a dignified way to a tragic death."" A police presence was maintained in the area ""to provide reassurance to the public"", following mounted patrols on Tuesday. This video can not be played A man was seen stamping on flowers and balloons left in tribute of Henry Vincent Mr Vincent, 37, along with Bill Jeeves are suspected of burgling Mr Osborn-Brooks' home, which remained cordoned off by police on 4 April. Floral tributes to Mr Vincent, understood to be part of the travelling community, were put back up on the fence opposite the home earlier but have already been pulled down. Local resident Iain Gordon, who said he was from the Fair Society group, pulled down the flowers saying: ""If you don't know why I pulled the flowers down then you aren't a human being."" Mr Vincent's family had argued the fence was ""the best place"" for a tribute. Local residents have expressed concerns of ""intimidation"". On Tuesday, Elvina Lee, who said she was Mr Vincent's cousin, defended him, saying he ""wasn't a murderer, he wasn't a rapist - they're putting him as a monster"".

"Willie John McBride said the two players should be allowed to get on with their careers An Irish rugby legend has said that Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding should be allowed to get back to their sporting careers. Former Ulster and Ireland captain Willie John McBride was speaking following the Belfast rape trial in which both men were acquitted. ""At the end of the day, they were not guilty,"" Mr McBride told the BBC. In a separate development, a newspaper advert has called on Ulster and Irish rugby to reinstate ""innocent men"". Advert calls for players to be dropped Gilroy sorry for inappropriate message Jackson apology over 'degrading' Whatsapp chat The full-page advert in Wednesday's Belfast Telegraph was signed by ""real fans standing up for the Ulster men"". Mr McBride told the BBC that the two men should be allowed to play for their province and country again. ""I hope that the Ulster authorities and the Irish authorities allow these guys to do what they do best - and that's playing rugby,"" he said. Mr McBride said he was ""sorry to see that there are some people who want to deny them the opportunity and take away their livelihood"". This was ""very sad and wrong,"" he said. ""I know Ulster Branch and the Irish Rugby Union are having a review of the situation. I think they should obviously be reprimanded. They have apologised and have issued their regrets for everything that happened,"" he said. Stuart Olding and Paddy Jackson were cleared of rape charges after a nine-week trial in Belfast ""But I think there are all sorts of things involved in their professional world now like sponsors and people like that. I think they should apologise to them. ""I think they have huge regrets about what happened and I don't think this will happen again."" No names are mentioned in the Belfast Telegraph advert, but Ulster players Stuart Olding, Paddy Jackson and Craig Gilroy are currently relieved of their duties. Rugby officials are investigating their conduct following the recent rape trial involving Mr Olding and Mr Jackson. Both men were found not guilty of the charges they faced. They had been accused of raping the same woman in June 2016 andtheir acquittal came after a nine-week trial. An internal review of the player's conduct by the IRFU (Irish Rugby Football Union) could not begin until the rape trial was concluded: Both players are suspended until that review is completed. The men's teammate Craig Gilroy has also been made unavailable for selection after an offensive message he sent to Mr Olding was referenced in the trial. The latest advert claims ""the extent of the social media backlash aimed at incriminating men unanimously acquitted of any crime"" was ""reprehensible"". ""We are fed up with this cyber-persecution,"" it states, alluding to the fallout from the trial with some people on social media demanding that neither Mr Olding nor Mr Jackson be allowed to play for Ireland or Ulster again. The advert calls for the players to be ""rightly allowed to resume their roles for both club and country"". ""The IRFU should take note of the silent majority and not bow to the court of social media,"" it says. ""We do not expect an answer to this letter, but we do expect them to play.""

""What we found now is that there's a whole programme associated with Cambridge University where... there were a number of other researchers building similar apps,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""So, we do need to understand whether there was something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger reaction from us."" The university has reacted by saying it would be ""surprised"" if Mr Zuckerberg was only now aware of the work. ""Our researchers have been publishing such research since 2013 in major peer-reviewed scientific journals, and these studies have been reported widely in international media,"" it added. ""These have included one study in 2015 led by Dr Aleksandr Spectre (Kogan) and co-authored by two Facebook employees. ""We have found no evidence that University researchers are improperly gathering personal data."" Zuckerberg: Facebook is in 'arms race' with Russia Facebook and Google 'must be paid for' Facebook: Data contained private messages Mr Zuckerberghad earlier apologised,externalfor having failed to check in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had deleted information gathered about millions of Facebook users. Instead Facebook let the political consultancy self-certify that it had destroyed the records, which it said had been acquired in violation of the social network's rules. Allow YouTube content?

Mr Zuckerberg's four hour appearance before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce followed a five hour session in front of two Senate committees yesterday. During a testy early exchange, he declined to give a commitment to change all users' default privacy settings to collect the minimum amount of personal information. ""This is a complex issue,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""That's disappointing to me,"" responded Democratic congressman Frank Pallone. Elsewhere in the hearing, Mr Zuckerberg acknowledged that he believed it was ""inevitable"" that the internet would need new regulations. ""My position is not that there should be no regulation, but I also think you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place,"" he said. The Facebook chief also faced fresh accusations from Republican congressman Steve Scalise that the News Feed's algorithm was discriminating against conservative news and content in favour of liberal posts. ""There is absolutely no directive in any of the changes that we make to have a bias,"" responded Mr Zuckerberg. ""To the contrary our goal is to be a platform for all ideas."" Another Republican pulled a surprise by displaying photos of illegal adverts for opioid drugs that he said had been live on Facebook yesterday. ""Facebook is actually enabling an illegal activity and in so doing you are hurting people,"" said congressman David McKinley. This screenshot showing adverts for Oxycodone and Buprenorphine was shown to the Facebook chief ""There are a number of areas of content that we need to do a better job of policing,"" Mr Zuckerberg replied, adding that he believed artificial intelligence tools would make this possible in the future. However, several of the politicians urged Facebook to be more proactive about the matter. Mr Zuckerberg also faced questions about the illegal trade of ivory in closed Facebook groups. In another combative exchange, the business leader was questioned about the data his firm collected on people who had never signed up to his service. Mr Zuckerberg said this was done for security purposes. But he professed not to be familiar with the term ""shadow profiles""despite it having been used widely,externalby the media during a past Facebook data privacy controversy. And he was unable to say how many types of data were being gathered about non-members. ""You said everyone controls their data,"" said Democratic congressman Ben Ray Lujan. Congressman Lujan raised the issue of shadow profiles ""But you are collecting data on people that are not even Facebook users, that have never signed a consent or privacy agreement. ""When you go to Facebook's 'I don't have a Facebook account page and would like to request all my personal data stored by Facebook', it takes you to a form that says go to your Facebook page and then on your account settings you can download your data.

"The Grenfell Tower fire has prompted an investigation into incomplete records of gas pipes in high-rise buildings. Cadent Gas, which operates and maintains local pipes in four regions of England, said some blocks were omitted from its 10-year survey. The company alerted energy regulator Ofgem, which is now investigating. The incomplete records emerged after Cadent received an information request from a council in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Information given by Cadent to Ofgem suggested that 1,000 premises were missed off the records, but Grenfell Tower was not one of them. Cadent Gas, previously known as National Grid Gas Distribution, is one of four companies that oversee the final leg of piping gas into people's homes, known as distribution. Reality Check: Why does Labour want to control National Grid? It has a responsibility to keep records of its network, including risers - the gas pipe arrangement of a building that is more than two floors above ground level and has more than two meter points. The company owns four of England's eight regional distribution networks - north London, the West Midlands, the North West of England, and the East of England. It said it received a request from one council which highlighted an issue with its records. ""Between January and February 2018, Cadent identified that just some of our records regarding high-rise buildings - building of six storeys and above - were not contained on our digitised records and were therefore not part of our regular 10-yearly survey programme,"" a spokeswoman for the company said. ""As a consequence, we informed Ofgem at the earliest opportunity in early February and have continued regular progress briefings to date. ""Alongside this, we immediately implemented a survey recovery programme to resolve the issue as quickly and effectively as possible. This programme of work will be substantially completed in July 2018."" Ofgem said it was now investigating whether Cadent kept and maintained records for all of its risers, whether it has the appropriate systems in place to do so and whether it maintains an efficient and economical pipeline system.

"Profits at Tesco have soared as the UK's biggest supermarket continues its revival under boss Dave Lewis. The groupreported pre-tax profits of Â£1.3bn,externalfor the year to 24 February, up from Â£145m for the previous year, as UK like-for-like sales rose 2.2%. The jump follows years of disappointing results for Tesco after an accounting scandal and overambitious expansion. The retailer said the grocery market remained challenging due to ongoing pressure on costs. Shares rosenearly 6% to 222.4p, valuing the company at Â£21.7bn. Mr Lewis said it had been a year of strong progress, with the ninth consecutive quarter of growth. ""Tesco is growing again, recovering profitability and generating significant cash,"" he said. ""Whilst we take some comfort from what it is we have done, we are very clear that there's more to do. It's definitely not job done."" Aldi tops supermarket satisfaction survey Tesco faces record Â£4bn equal pay claim Tesco's performance has gradually improved since 2014, when it reported the worst results in its history with a record pre-tax loss of Â£6.4bn. You have to hand it to Dave Lewis. When he took over as chief executive in late 2014, Tesco was in a mess. A three-year turnaround plan was launched to completely reboot the business. Assets were swiftly disposed of, including its South Korean business, to reduce debt as the focus turned to reviving the struggling UK grocery division. Tesco also started to fix the basics by improving stores, ranges and prices. Its Farm Brands range offering cheaper fresh products has proved hugely successful. But it has also axed thousands of jobs to cut costs. There is still much work to do, especially since its takeover of Booker, Britain's biggest grocery wholesaler. For some this is a costly distraction, but others think it could be a game-changer for Tesco - if it can pull it off. It has faced an intensely competitive retail environment in which German discounters Aldi and Lidl have won market share from the bigger supermarkets. It was also fined Â£250m last year for overstating its profits in 2014. Tesco said that it won 260,000 more shoppers last year and that sales of fresh food, its own-brand products and clothing had performed well. The group also announced its first final dividend for four years, giving shareholders a total payout of 3p a share for 2017. Mr Lewis also said the group was on track to save at least Â£200m a year aftercompleting its takeover of wholesaler Booker Grouplast month. Booker is the UK's largest cash-and-carry operator, supplying everything from baked beans to teabags to thousands of convenience stores, grocers, pubs and restaurants. Boss Dave Lewis says Tesco has enjoyed a year of strong progress Bryan Roberts of TCC Global said Tesco was ""back on track"". ""Suppliers, colleagues and shoppers are all back on side assumingly, and sales and profits are both growing very strongly, and of course the Booker deal has been completed and they can grow on that too,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Perhaps what the future will hold will be the store in Cambridgeshire, which also has a small Booker cash-and-carry in it."" He said Tesco was also likely to start selling its own-brand goods through Booker-owned convenience store chains such as Londis and Budgens. The fall in the pound since the Brexit vote has increased the cost of imported food, driving up costs for retailers and prices for consumers. However, Tesco still increased its margins significantly last year. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said inflationary pressures were starting to ease, but competition in the grocery market remained fierce. ""It's also hard not to glance at the periphery of the market, and see Amazon limbering up with the purchase of Whole Foods and online grocery trials in selected UK postcodes,"" he said.

"Weightlifter Arcangeline Fouodji Sonkbou is among the missing athletes, Cameroon officials say Eight Cameroonian athletes have gone missing from their accommodation at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, team officials have confirmed. Press attache Simon Molombe told the BBC officials viewed it as ""desertion"" and that the missing athletes had been reported to Australian police. The three weightlifters and five boxers were last seen at different times on Monday and Tuesday, he said. Cameroon said the group had valid Australian visas until 15 May. Officials named the missing athletes as weightlifters Olivier Matam Matam, Arcangeline Fouodji Sonkbou and Petit Minkoumba, and boxers Christian Ndzie Tsoye, Simplice Fotsala, Arsene Fokou, Ulrich Yombo and Christelle Ndiang. ""The authorities are very disappointed with the deserters - some did not even compete,"" Mr Molombe said. ""The pious hope is that they come back to the village and travel home with the others."" The Australian government has warned athletes against overstaying their visas. The Commonwealth Games Federation said it would monitor the situation but athletes had ""the right to travel freely"" on their visas. The Australian Federal Police has been notified of the development, according to Kate Jones, a Queensland state government minister. In 2012,seven Cameroonian athletes disappeared while in London for the Olympics.

"This video can not be played What Paul Ryan quitting could really mean US House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan will not run for re-election this year, in a big blow to Republicans with mid-term elections looming. Congress' most powerful lawmaker said he would not stand for another term in his Wisconsin district this November. Republicans already face a tough challenge from Democrats to keep control of the lower chamber. Mr Ryan joins nearly 30 House Republicans who have announced this year they are retiring outright. Democrats need 20 or so seats to take over the House. In a Wednesday morning news conference, Mr Ryan said the decision was family-related. ""You all know that I did not seek this job,"" he said. ""I took it reluctantly. ""But I have given this job everything. I have no regrets whatsoever for having accepted this responsibility."" He continued: ""But the truth is it's easy for it to take over everything in your life and you can't just let that happen."" The 48-year-old father-of-three said he did not want to be known by his children as ""only a weekend dad"". Profile: House Speaker Paul Ryan Mr Ryan said he would retire in January after finishing his congressional term. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Paul Ryan had to be coaxed into taking the speaker's gavel in 2015 and never seemed to relish the job. Rumours had been swirling in conservative circles for months that he was eyeing the exits. The speaker will frame his decision as one of putting family first - and, with young children, the fundraising and legislative duties of the office are burdensome - but it's impossible not to view the move in a larger political context. He's had frequent clashes with Donald Trump, and their differences - in temperament and policy - continue to be stark. A mid-term election looms, and there are at least even odds that a Democrat could be speaker next year. Even if Republicans prevail, their majority will certainly be diminished, making the job of passing legislation through a party already torn between moderates and ideological hardliners all the more difficult. Rather than go down with the ship - or perhaps suffer the same fate as Tom Foley in 1994, the last sitting speaker to lose a re-election race - Mr Ryan is reserving his seat on a lifeboat. He's not the first congressional Republican to do so, and with the top man leading the way, more are sure to follow. Mr Ryan - with his wife, Janna, and daughter, Liza, by his side - was re-elected comfortably in 2016 According to Axios,external, which broke the story, he has found his job frustrating, partly because of President Donald Trump.

In an interview with CNN, Mr Ryan explained that he and Mr Trump are ""very different people"". ""I'm from the upper Midwest. I'm not from New York, we're from a different generation.

"This video can not be played Gay men told bar 'for mixed-sex couples' only A gay couple were refused entry to a bar when bouncers told them they let in ""mixed-sex couples"" only. Patrick Hannon, 30, and Jake Archer, 25, had enjoyed a meal before heading to Jake's Bar in Leeds for a drink at about 22:00 BST on 24 March. The couple, from Newcastle, were left ""speechless"" when they were not allowed in because they were both men. The venue said it ""never discriminates"" and is investigating the incident with its ""externally supplied"" door team.

The couple said the incident was ""discrimination"" The pair, who have been together for two-and-a-half years, said they were too shocked to argue with the doormen and went elsewhere. Mr Hannon, a police officer, said: ""If we were drunk or in a large group then you would understand. ""They need to think about how it makes them look - as a bar they are not very open minded.""

Jake's Bar is in Call Lane which runs parallel to Leeds' gay village and is in the heart of the city's nightlife. Manager Paul Lane said it has a ""strict equality and diversity policy"" and would ""never discriminate"" against anyone. It has launched an investigation into what happened on the night with the ""external door team"". Jake's Bar, on Call Lane, has been open for nearly 14 years He said: ""We have many customers who identify with LGBTQIA+ communities who frequent the bar regularly."" The BBC does not know the name of the security firm involved, but it has been contacted for comment by the bar. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said the incident ""would certainly appear to be unlawful discrimination, which we would condemn"". Leeds City Council said it was ""seeking assurances from the owners of these premises that their door policy is reflective of national equality legislation"". The Equality Act of 2010,externalsays it is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of sexual orientation. The act provides protection from discrimination as a consumer, when using public services and as a member or guest of a private club or association. If you feel that you have been unfairly discriminated against then you can seek help from theEquality Advisory Support Service.,external You may be able to take them to court and claim damages. Source: Gov.uk A spokesman for LGBT rights charity Stonewall said: ""It's against the law to discriminate against someone because of their sexual orientation in any circumstance, including entry to a bar. ""It's unacceptable that one in six LGBT people (17%) who visited a cafÃ©, restaurant, bar or nightclub in the last 12 months have been discriminated against based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity in Britain."" Similar claims have been made about the bar in reviews on travel review website TripAdvisor. Thomas B said he was ""outraged"" by a ""homophobic bouncer"" in May last year. He wrote: ""I was with my partner and we were refused entry for not being in a mixed couple."" Brett T also advised in March 2016: ""Avoid if you're male. Their new policy that won't let a group in [four people] unless it includes women is a joke."" Paul contacted the BBC to say he and his husband and experienced a similar situation at the bar a few years ago. He said: ""When we tried to enter with our (mixed sex couple) friends we were told they were only allowing couples entry. ""When we politely explained that we were both couples (and indeed that we were arguably more so than our unmarried friends given that we were in a civil partnership and wearing the matching rings to prove it) they still refused us entry. ""We've never tried to go back again after that. ""This area of Leeds does have an issue with large groups of intoxicated revellers, however [it] would appear that this venue also has an issue with understanding that adopting a 'couples only' policy doesn't always equate to a man and woman."" Jake's Bar was asked to respond similar claims and whether they have a policy to only let in groups containing females.

"Willie John McBride said the two players should be allowed to get on with their careers An Irish rugby legend has said that Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding should be allowed to get back to their sporting careers. Former Ulster and Ireland captain Willie John McBride was speaking following the Belfast rape trial in which both men were acquitted. ""At the end of the day, they were not guilty,"" Mr McBride told the BBC. In a separate development, a newspaper advert has called on Ulster and Irish rugby to reinstate ""innocent men"". Advert calls for players to be dropped Gilroy sorry for inappropriate message Jackson apology over 'degrading' Whatsapp chat The full-page advert in Wednesday's Belfast Telegraph was signed by ""real fans standing up for the Ulster men"". Mr McBride told the BBC that the two men should be allowed to play for their province and country again. ""I hope that the Ulster authorities and the Irish authorities allow these guys to do what they do best - and that's playing rugby,"" he said. Mr McBride said he was ""sorry to see that there are some people who want to deny them the opportunity and take away their livelihood"". This was ""very sad and wrong,"" he said. ""I know Ulster Branch and the Irish Rugby Union are having a review of the situation. I think they should obviously be reprimanded. They have apologised and have issued their regrets for everything that happened,"" he said. Stuart Olding and Paddy Jackson were cleared of rape charges after a nine-week trial in Belfast ""But I think there are all sorts of things involved in their professional world now like sponsors and people like that. I think they should apologise to them. ""I think they have huge regrets about what happened and I don't think this will happen again."" No names are mentioned in the Belfast Telegraph advert, but Ulster players Stuart Olding, Paddy Jackson and Craig Gilroy are currently relieved of their duties. Rugby officials are investigating their conduct following the recent rape trial involving Mr Olding and Mr Jackson. Both men were found not guilty of the charges they faced. They had been accused of raping the same woman in June 2016 andtheir acquittal came after a nine-week trial. An internal review of the player's conduct by the IRFU (Irish Rugby Football Union) could not begin until the rape trial was concluded: Both players are suspended until that review is completed. The men's teammate Craig Gilroy has also been made unavailable for selection after an offensive message he sent to Mr Olding was referenced in the trial. The latest advert claims ""the extent of the social media backlash aimed at incriminating men unanimously acquitted of any crime"" was ""reprehensible"". ""We are fed up with this cyber-persecution,"" it states, alluding to the fallout from the trial with some people on social media demanding that neither Mr Olding nor Mr Jackson be allowed to play for Ireland or Ulster again. The advert calls for the players to be ""rightly allowed to resume their roles for both club and country"". ""The IRFU should take note of the silent majority and not bow to the court of social media,"" it says. ""We do not expect an answer to this letter, but we do expect them to play.""

"Medical and rescue organisations say most of the victims were children and women Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed on 7 April in a suspected chemical attack on Douma, which was the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says initial tests on samples from two sites detected ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"", along with explosive residues. However, no nerve agents were detected. The Syrian government denies ever using chemical weapons, and its ally Russia says it has evidence that the incident was staged with the help of the UK. In February, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad launched an assault on the Eastern Ghouta that reportedly left more than 1,700 civilians dead. In March, troops split the region into three pockets - the largest of which was around Douma, home to between 80,000 and 150,000 people. Facing defeat, rebel groups in the other two pockets agreed to be evacuated to northern Syria. But the group controlling Douma, Jaysh al-Islam, continued to hold out. On 6 April, after negotiations with the government stalled, air strikes resumed. The bombardment continued for a second day, with dozens of people reportedly killed or injured by conventional munitions before the suspected chemical attack. Activists from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC), which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, reportedtwo separate incidents of bombs believed to contain toxic substances being dropped by the Syrian Air Force,external. The first occurred at approximately 16:00 (13:00 GMT) and saw the Saada bakery on Omar Ibn Al-Khattab street in north-western Douma targeted, the VDC said. Activists say Douma came under intense aerial bombardment on Saturday It cited a member of the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets, as saying he smelt chlorine in the air after the strike, but that he could not determine its source. The VDC said the second incident took place not far to the east, near Martyrs' Square, at approximately 19:30. At 19:45, more than 500 patients - most of them women and children - were brought to medical facilities with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,external, according to the Syria Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in rebel-held areas. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The patients showed signs of ""respiratory distress, central cyanosis [blue skin or lips], excessive oral foaming, corneal burns, and the emission of chlorine-like odour"", a joint statement issued on Sunday said. One woman who died had convulsions and pinpoint pupils. Rescue workers searching homes in the affected area also found the bodies of people with oral foaming, cyanosis, and corneal burns, the statement added. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria, also saidit received reports of two incidents,external. Patients were hosed down with water to remove any chemicals on their skin People were treated for breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes following the first, the UOSSM said. After the second, patients were brought to hospital smelling strongly of a chlorine-like substance and presenting symptoms that included cyanosis, foaming of the mouth, and cornea irritation, it added. A medical student working at a hospital told the BBC he had treated a man who died,external. ""His pupils were dilated and he had foam in his mouth. His heart was very slow. Then he coughed blood into his mouth as well,"" he said. Two videos circulated by the opposition activist group Douma Revolution showed what it said werethe bodies of children, women and men found in one block of flats,external, which is believed to be located south-west of Martyrs' Square. Some had foam coming out of their mouths and noses. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Activists also posted avideo which they said showed a yellow industrial gas cylinder on the balcony of the same block of flats,external. One end of the cylinder was lying in a crater-like opening in the reinforced concrete floor. A second gas cylinder was filmed on the bed of a top-floor flat,externalto the south-west, below a crater-like opening in the concrete roof. The World Health Organization said on 11 April that it had received reports from its local ""health cluster partners"" of43 deaths related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals"",external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said rescue workers found 42 people dead in their homes. One person was declared dead on arrival at a hospital, and another six died while receiving treatment, they added. An earlier, now deleted tweet by the Syria Civil Defence put the number dead at more than 150. The UOSSM initially reported that 70 people were confirmed dead. On 9 April,it revised down the figure to at least 42,external. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said air strikes on 6 and 7 April killed almost 100 people. It said they included 21 who died as a result of suffocation, but that it was unable to identify the cause. The British investigative journalism website, Bellingcat, said it had counted at least 34 bodies,externalin the two videos circulated by Douma Revolution. Bellingcat also assessed that the block of flats near Martyrs' Square where the bodies were filmed wasvisited by Russian military personnel on 9 April,external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said the day after the incident that they believed those who died suffocated as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals, most likely an organophosphate - a compound grouping associated with pesticides and nerve agents, such as Sarin. The UOSSM also concluded that the symptoms of the casualties were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, possibly one mixed with chlorine. On 13 April, the US said itassessed ""with confidence that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons"",external. The conclusion was ""based on descriptions of the attack in multiple media sources, the reported symptoms experienced by victims, videos and images showing two assessed barrel bombs from the attack, and reliable information indicating co-ordination between Syrian military officials before the attack"". It added: ""A significant body of information points to the regime using chlorine in its bombardment of Douma, while some additional information points to the regime also using the nerve agent Sarin."" A fact-finding team from the OPCW has travelled to Damascus to investigate the allegations The OPCW, which oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention, dispatched experts from its Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) to Damascus five days after the attack. But they were unable to visit any of the sites of interest until 21 April because of an attack on a UN security team conducting a reconnaissance mission. The FFM team interviewed witnesses and collected environmental samples and data from three locations:the hospital where victims were allegedly treated for chemical exposure,external;the block of flats with the cylinder on the balcony,external(referred to as ""Location 2"");the flat with the cylinder on the bed,external(""Location 4""). The team also gathered or received samples and interviewed witnesses, including alleged casualties, in a neighbouring country. On 6 July, a preliminary report issued by the OPCW said ""no organophosphorus nerve agents or their degradation products were detected,external, either in the environmental samples or in plasma samples from the alleged casualties"".  However, it added, ""various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from Locations 2 and 4, along with residues of explosive"". The OPCW said the FFM team was now working to establish the significance of the results. It is also assessing the association of the two gas cylinders with the incident, the relative damage to the cylinders and the roofs, and how the cylinders arrived at their respective locations. The chlorinated compounds included those used to treat drinking water, as a disinfectant, a wood preservative, or a flame retardant. However, the same compounds were detected at other sites in Syria where the OPCW has concluded that chlorine was likely used as a weapon, includingSaraqeb,externalandLatamina,external. President Assad has accused the US, UK and France of ""staging"" the incident in Douma,externalwith the help of the Syria Civil Defence, which receives funding from Western governments. ""It was a lie. After we liberated that area our information confirmed the attack did not take place,"" he told the Daily Mail on 9 June. ""The British government should prove with evidence that the attack happened, and then they should prove who is responsible. This did not happen."" Syrian government ground forces advanced towards Douma on Saturday Russian permanent representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on 9 April thatRussian military specialists had visited Douma and taken soil samples that showed no presence of nerve agents or substances containing chlorine,external. He also said no-one with symptoms of exposure to sarin or chlorine had been admitted to Douma's hospital, nor any bodies found. Four days later, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had ""irrefutable evidence that this was yet another attack, staged with the participation of special services of one state that is striving to be at the forefront of the Russophobic campaign"". This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media A British diplomat called the allegation ""bizarre"" and a ""blatant lie"". On 26 April, Russian and Syrian diplomats presented to a briefing at the OPCW's headquarters in The Hague more than a dozen people from Douma who said they had not seen any evidence of chemical weapons being used there. They included Hasan Diab,an 11-year-old boy who was seen being doused in water,externalin a video widely circulated online after the alleged attack. ""We heard cries on the street that we should go to the hospital. We got scared. We went to the hospital through the tunnel,""he told reporters,external. ""They started pouring water on me at the hospital. I don't know why."" Hasan Diab, 11, appeared at a briefing organised by Russian and Syrian diplomats in The Hague Western nations dismissed the event as ""nothing more than a crude propaganda exercise"",externaland an ""obscene masquerade"". The US said it had no information to suggest Jaysh al-Islam had ever used chemical weapons,external, and that it was unlikely that the opposition could have fabricated the number of reports that came from Douma on 7 April and ""deceived multiple media outlets while evading our detection"". United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was outraged by the reports from Douma,externaland warned that ""any confirmed use of chemical weapons, by any party to the conflict and under any circumstances, is abhorrent and a clear violation of international law"". Hours before the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission team arrived in Damascus on 14 April, the US, UK and France carried out missile strikes on three sites they said were ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded The US military said warships and jets launched 105 missiles,externalthat hit a branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) in the capital's Barzeh district, the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility west of the city of Homs, and a nearby chemical weapons bunker. US President Donald Trump said he wanted ""to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons"",external. The Syrian foreign ministry denounced ""the barbaric aggression"". In August 2013, rockets containing Sarin were fired at several opposition-held suburbs in the Eastern and Western Ghouta, killing hundreds of people.UN experts confirmed that Sarin was used in the attack,external, but they were not asked to ascribe any blame. Western powers said only Syrian government forces could have carried out the attack. President Assad denied the allegation, but he did agree to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. Experts from a joint UN-OPCW mission also said they were confident that government forces used Sarin in an attack in April 2017 on the rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun,external, which reportedly killed more than 80 people. President Assad dismissed the attack as a fabrication, but the US carried a cruise missile strike on a Syrian airbase in retaliation. The UN-OPCW mission also found that government forces used chlorine as a weapon on at least three occasions during the civil war.

"The Charity Commission is to investigate how Save the Children dealt with allegations of misconduct and harassment against its staff. It said it was concerned whether the charity had ""adequately reported the full extent and nature"" of claims. Save the Children came under scrutiny last month after it disclosed evidence of ""unsafe behaviour"" towards staff. An ex-chief executive apologised after three female staff made claims of inappropriate behaviour. Earlier this year, Save the Childrenmade public two reviews - both prompted by staff complaints - about its workplace culturewith evidence of ""significant omissions and failures"" in how the charity responded to harassment allegations. The charity acted after the BBCrevealed an internal reportadmitting it had failed to deal adequately with complaints of inappropriate behaviour. A new review was announced to assess whether previous recommendations had been fully acted upon. The Charity Commission said that, as a result of recent dialogue with Save the Children, it became concerned about the handling of various complaints in 2012 and 2015 - and the decisions the charity made since last February ""on its public position regarding these allegations"". It will investigate: How the charity handled the allegations about senior staff members Whether the charity carried out appropriate standards of workplace conduct and staff safeguarding How appropriate its decisions were on reputation management while under scrutiny this year Whether serious incidents were disclosed ""fully, frankly and accurately"" to the Commission The inquiry will not examine the charity's work with its beneficiaries. In 2015/16, a serious incident involving a senior staff member was flagged up to the Commission alongside an anonymous complaint about Save the Children's response to other allegations. The watchdog said it received ""direct assurance"" from charity trustees that recommendations of an independent review had been accepted and ""urgently"" implemented. Michelle Russell, director of investigations and enforcement at the Commission, said: ""Opening a formal investigation does not necessarily mean that we have concluded that there has been wrongdoing by the trustees of The Save the Children Fund. ""However, we do have questions that must be answered, and we need to hold the charity formally accountable for providing them in a clear and timely manner.""

"Hanna Dickenson (R) falsely claimed to have cancer, a court heard An Australian woman who faked having terminal cancer before scamming money from friends of her family has been jailed for three months. Hanna Dickenson, 24, accepted A$42,000 (Â£22,000; $31,000) after telling her parents that she needed medical treatment overseas. Her parents had received donations from their friends, a court was told. It heard Dickenson spent much of the money on holidays and socialising. A judge called the scam ""despicable"". Dickenson had pleaded guilty in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court to seven charges of obtaining property by deception. In sentencing, magistrate David Starvaggi said Dickenson had ""engaged in conduct that tears at the very heartstrings of human nature"". ""People's desire to assist and social trust has been breached. These are people who worked hard and dug into their own pockets,"" he said. The court was told one person donated A$10,000 to Dickenson after being discharged from hospital following his own cancer treatment. Another person gave money on four separate occasions. The ruse was uncovered when another donor raised suspicions with police after seeing pictures of Dickenson on Facebook. Dickenson's lawyer, Beverley Lindsay, argued that her client should be spared jail because she had ""turned her life around"". She also compared the deception to one involving an Australian celebrity blogger,Belle Gibson, who was fined A$410,000 last yearafter falsely claiming to have beaten brain cancer. Ms Lindsay argued that her client's offending was less severe than Gibson's. However Mr Starvaggi said the cases were not directly comparable, and that the court needed to deter others from engaging in similar conduct. Ms Lindsay said her client was likely to appeal the sentence.

"Some of the failings that allowed rogue surgeon Ian Paterson to harm patients have been found to be widespread across private hospitals, inspectors say. The Care Quality Commission said it was concerned about the ""old-fashioned"" approach to consultants which led to a lack of monitoring and checks. The regulator said it meant there was a ""real danger"" poor practices were not being picked up or challenged. Private hospitals said they were responding quickly to the findings. The CQC looked at 206 private hospitals in what was the first comprehensive review of the sector. These sites treat both private patients and those the NHS pays for to be seen by private hospitals. The CQC rated 70% as good or excellent. But it said there was a ""significant concern"" relating to governance and safety. In particular, it highlighted the lack of proper checks and monitoring of senior doctors, mainly surgeons, to ensure they were only undertaking treatments they were qualified to do or carrying them out in a safe way. It likened the failures to those found in the Paterson case,the breast surgeon who was found guilty of 17 counts of wounding with intent last yearand sentenced to 20 years in jail. He carried out botched operations on patients at private hospitals in the West Midlands. The surgeon's trial heard he had wildly exaggerated his patients' cancer symptoms, leading them to have several needless operations which left them scarred for life physically and emotionally. Breast surgeon Ian Paterson was found guilty of wounding with intent last year Chief inspector of hospitals Prof Ted Baker described the approach to consultants as ""old-fashioned"" as it relied on informal systems and people knowing each other. ""Too often, safety was viewed as the responsibility of individual clinicians, rather than a corporate responsibility supported by formal governance processes. ""Where we found failings, we have been clear that improvements must be made, using our enforcement powers where needed to protect people."" Dr Howard Freeman, of the NHS Partners Network, which represents private providers, said providing safe and high-quality care was a ""top priority"". He said where inspectors had highlighted problems hospitals were being ""quick to respond"". The Royal College of Surgeons said there was ""no room for complacency"".

"This video can not be played Footage of the crash was broadcast on Algerian TV An Algerian military plane has crashed near the capital killing 257 people on board, officials say. The aircraft came down just after taking off from Boufarik military airport, west of Algiers. An inquiry is under way into the cause of the crash - Algeria's worst-ever air disaster. The government has declared three days of national mourning. Most of the dead are army personnel and their families, the defence ministry says. Ten crew members also died. Passengers from Western Sahara, a disputed territory annexed by Morocco after Spain withdrew in 1975, were among the fatalities. The Polisario Front, which is seeking independence for the territory and is backed by Algeria, says 30 Western Saharans, including women and children, died. A senior member of Algeria's ruling FLN party said those killed included 26 Polisario members. The plane, an Ilyushin Il-76, was travelling to Bechar and Tindouf in the south-west of the country. The Tindouf region, which borders Western Sahara, is home to refugee camps and serves as a base for the Polisario Front. Country profile Rana Jawad, North Africa correspondent As one might expect in the immediate aftermath of such incidents, there are more questions than answers over this latest deadly plane crash in Algeria. For now, it is not known whether the cause was due to safety or mechanical problems, pilot error or interference - but these are elements that will likely be examined during the course of the investigation. The country's maintenance record of both military and commercial aircraft will also likely come under close scrutiny in the coming days. But for Algeria, and its military institution, the loss of life is a tragedy on a scale not seen before in its modern aviation history. Witnesses say they saw a wing catch fire as the plane took off. It then went down, avoiding a highway and crashing into a field. A military aviation observer told the BBC that, based on how intact portions of the plane were, they believed the pilot had tried to crash-land. Dozens of firefighters and rescuers worked around the smouldering wreckage. One eyewitness told local television: ""We saw bodies burned. It is a real disaster"". Officials are quoted as saying some survivors were taken to hospital, but it is unclear how many there were or what their current condition is. Wednesday's plane crash is the deadliest in the world since July 2014, when all 298 people on board Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 died when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine. It is also the second-deadliest plane crash since 2003.

"Heidi Thomas told the retrial Mr Cosby allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted her. US comic Bill Cosby served actress Heidi Thomas spiked wine that made her drowsy for four days in 1984, she has told his trial. Ms Thomas testified that she woke up to the sight of a naked Mr Cosby attempting to force himself on her. She is one of 50 women who have accused him of sexual molestation. Mr Cosby, who is being retried on charges of sexually assaulting ex-basketball player Andrea Constand in 2004, denies the charges against him. Ms Thomas, an aspiring actress at the time of the alleged assault on her in 1984, said that she met Mr Cosby for career coaching. She told the court that Mr Cosby asked her to read a monologue of a character who was drunk, persuading her to drink white wine. She said she recalled ""only snapshots"" of the next four days. ""The next thing, I remember waking up on a bed. I have clothes on, he did not. I was lying down. He was forcing himself in my mouth,"" Ms Thomas said. From trailblazer to alleged assaulter Cosby's diehard fans stick by fallen idol Mr Cosby has been charged with aggravated indecent assault of Ms Constand, which could carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years. He says that any contact between himself and his accusers was consensual. All but Ms Constand's allegations are too old to be prosecuted. The case involves former basketball player Andrea Constand Mr Cosby's lawyer launched a blistering attack on Ms Constand in the defence's opening remarks, describing the Canadian former basketball player as a ""con artist"". Thomas Mesereau said that Ms Constand ""was madly in love with [Mr Cosby's] fame and money"". ""She's now a multimillionaire because she pulled it off,"" Mr Mesereau told the court. Mr Cosby has long been considered a Hollywood trailblazer for African Americans Mr Cosby first went on trial in 2017 for allegedly molesting Ms Constand, howeverthe jury failed to reach a verdict, with the judge declaring a mistrial. In a 2006 civil lawsuit, Ms Constand won a $3.4m settlement from Mr Cosby. The existence of the civil settlement between Mr Cosby and Ms Constand was known about at the time of the first trial. However Judge Steven O'Neill ruled that the amount, previously kept confidential, could be revealed to the jury in the course of the new trial. The retrial takes place in the light of the #MeToo movement. The campaign has raised awareness of alleged sexual misconduct by a number of powerful media figures.

"Profits at Tesco have soared as the UK's biggest supermarket continues its revival under boss Dave Lewis. The groupreported pre-tax profits of Â£1.3bn,externalfor the year to 24 February, up from Â£145m for the previous year, as UK like-for-like sales rose 2.2%. The jump follows years of disappointing results for Tesco after an accounting scandal and overambitious expansion. The retailer said the grocery market remained challenging due to ongoing pressure on costs. Shares rosenearly 6% to 222.4p, valuing the company at Â£21.7bn. Mr Lewis said it had been a year of strong progress, with the ninth consecutive quarter of growth. ""Tesco is growing again, recovering profitability and generating significant cash,"" he said. ""Whilst we take some comfort from what it is we have done, we are very clear that there's more to do. It's definitely not job done."" Aldi tops supermarket satisfaction survey Tesco faces record Â£4bn equal pay claim Tesco's performance has gradually improved since 2014, when it reported the worst results in its history with a record pre-tax loss of Â£6.4bn. You have to hand it to Dave Lewis. When he took over as chief executive in late 2014, Tesco was in a mess. A three-year turnaround plan was launched to completely reboot the business. Assets were swiftly disposed of, including its South Korean business, to reduce debt as the focus turned to reviving the struggling UK grocery division. Tesco also started to fix the basics by improving stores, ranges and prices. Its Farm Brands range offering cheaper fresh products has proved hugely successful. But it has also axed thousands of jobs to cut costs. There is still much work to do, especially since its takeover of Booker, Britain's biggest grocery wholesaler. For some this is a costly distraction, but others think it could be a game-changer for Tesco - if it can pull it off. It has faced an intensely competitive retail environment in which German discounters Aldi and Lidl have won market share from the bigger supermarkets. It was also fined Â£250m last year for overstating its profits in 2014. Tesco said that it won 260,000 more shoppers last year and that sales of fresh food, its own-brand products and clothing had performed well. The group also announced its first final dividend for four years, giving shareholders a total payout of 3p a share for 2017. Mr Lewis also said the group was on track to save at least Â£200m a year aftercompleting its takeover of wholesaler Booker Grouplast month. Booker is the UK's largest cash-and-carry operator, supplying everything from baked beans to teabags to thousands of convenience stores, grocers, pubs and restaurants. Boss Dave Lewis says Tesco has enjoyed a year of strong progress Bryan Roberts of TCC Global said Tesco was ""back on track"". ""Suppliers, colleagues and shoppers are all back on side assumingly, and sales and profits are both growing very strongly, and of course the Booker deal has been completed and they can grow on that too,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Perhaps what the future will hold will be the store in Cambridgeshire, which also has a small Booker cash-and-carry in it."" He said Tesco was also likely to start selling its own-brand goods through Booker-owned convenience store chains such as Londis and Budgens. The fall in the pound since the Brexit vote has increased the cost of imported food, driving up costs for retailers and prices for consumers. However, Tesco still increased its margins significantly last year. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said inflationary pressures were starting to ease, but competition in the grocery market remained fierce. ""It's also hard not to glance at the periphery of the market, and see Amazon limbering up with the purchase of Whole Foods and online grocery trials in selected UK postcodes,"" he said.

"Profits at Tesco have soared as the UK's biggest supermarket continues its revival under boss Dave Lewis. The groupreported pre-tax profits of Â£1.3bn,externalfor the year to 24 February, up from Â£145m for the previous year, as UK like-for-like sales rose 2.2%. The jump follows years of disappointing results for Tesco after an accounting scandal and overambitious expansion. The retailer said the grocery market remained challenging due to ongoing pressure on costs. Shares rosenearly 6% to 222.4p, valuing the company at Â£21.7bn. Mr Lewis said it had been a year of strong progress, with the ninth consecutive quarter of growth. ""Tesco is growing again, recovering profitability and generating significant cash,"" he said. ""Whilst we take some comfort from what it is we have done, we are very clear that there's more to do. It's definitely not job done."" Aldi tops supermarket satisfaction survey Tesco faces record Â£4bn equal pay claim Tesco's performance has gradually improved since 2014, when it reported the worst results in its history with a record pre-tax loss of Â£6.4bn. You have to hand it to Dave Lewis. When he took over as chief executive in late 2014, Tesco was in a mess. A three-year turnaround plan was launched to completely reboot the business. Assets were swiftly disposed of, including its South Korean business, to reduce debt as the focus turned to reviving the struggling UK grocery division. Tesco also started to fix the basics by improving stores, ranges and prices. Its Farm Brands range offering cheaper fresh products has proved hugely successful. But it has also axed thousands of jobs to cut costs. There is still much work to do, especially since its takeover of Booker, Britain's biggest grocery wholesaler. For some this is a costly distraction, but others think it could be a game-changer for Tesco - if it can pull it off. It has faced an intensely competitive retail environment in which German discounters Aldi and Lidl have won market share from the bigger supermarkets. It was also fined Â£250m last year for overstating its profits in 2014. Tesco said that it won 260,000 more shoppers last year and that sales of fresh food, its own-brand products and clothing had performed well. The group also announced its first final dividend for four years, giving shareholders a total payout of 3p a share for 2017. Mr Lewis also said the group was on track to save at least Â£200m a year aftercompleting its takeover of wholesaler Booker Grouplast month. Booker is the UK's largest cash-and-carry operator, supplying everything from baked beans to teabags to thousands of convenience stores, grocers, pubs and restaurants. Boss Dave Lewis says Tesco has enjoyed a year of strong progress Bryan Roberts of TCC Global said Tesco was ""back on track"". ""Suppliers, colleagues and shoppers are all back on side assumingly, and sales and profits are both growing very strongly, and of course the Booker deal has been completed and they can grow on that too,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Perhaps what the future will hold will be the store in Cambridgeshire, which also has a small Booker cash-and-carry in it."" He said Tesco was also likely to start selling its own-brand goods through Booker-owned convenience store chains such as Londis and Budgens. The fall in the pound since the Brexit vote has increased the cost of imported food, driving up costs for retailers and prices for consumers. However, Tesco still increased its margins significantly last year. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said inflationary pressures were starting to ease, but competition in the grocery market remained fierce. ""It's also hard not to glance at the periphery of the market, and see Amazon limbering up with the purchase of Whole Foods and online grocery trials in selected UK postcodes,"" he said.

Prof Reich said his team currently had three working hypotheses to explain the result. While the Beakers replaced around 90% of the ancestry in Britain, it's possible that a pocket (or pockets) of Neolithic farmers held out in isolation somewhere for hundreds of years. During the Iron Age (which began around 3,000 years ago), they mixed back in with the general population, diluting the Beakers' genetic background with a type of ancestry that's now stronger around the Mediterranean than in Northern or Central Europe. Alternatively, the genetic data may be hinting at a separate migration from continental Europe during the Iron Age - perhaps one that brought Celtic languages into Britain. The third possibility is that scholars have simply underestimated the genetic impact of the Roman occupation, which lasted in Britain from AD 43 until 410. Roman settlers from the Italian peninsula would have traced a large proportion of their ancestry to Neolithic farmers like those that inhabited Britain before the arrival of the Beaker people.

"This video can not be played CBI boss Carolyn Fairbairn says British business does not want a bonfire of regulations after Brexit Diverging from European Union rules after Brexit will mean more costs than benefits for British business, a report by the CBI employers' group says. In a survey of 23 industry sectors, the vast majority preferred continued close alignment with EU regulations. Agriculture, shipping and tourism might benefit, but this was ""vastly outweighed"" by the impact on other sectors, the CBI said. However, critics said the report just promoted the interests of big business. The report, called Smooth Operations, suggests the UK could still exert influence over important regulatory decisions through continued membership of the many EU agencies - such as the ones governing aerospace and chemicals - in which other non-EU nations like Turkey currently participate. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was no appetite on the part of business for a bonfire of regulations, and called on the government to prioritise evidence over ideology in the negotiations over a future trade deal. ondon's financial centre has big concerns about diverging from EU regulations She said: ""It's vitally important that negotiators understand the complexity of rules and the effects that even the smallest of changes can have. ""Deviation from rules in one sector will have a knock-on effect on businesses in others, and divergence from rules in one part of a production process will have consequences for market access throughout entire supply chains. ""Put simply, for the majority of businesses, diverging from EU rules and regulations will make them less globally competitive, and so should only be done where the evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the costs."" But pro-Brexit groups dismissed the report for ignoring the benefits to vast sections of Britain's economy. Richard Tice, co-chair of Leave Means Leave, said: ""This report from the CBI protects the vested interests of global multi-nationals at the expense of the approximately 90% of the UK economy that does not export to the EU. Brexit: It's going to be a complicated year Vauxhall chief warns over Brexit Growth 'more important than Brexit' ""It is quite extraordinary that this business lobby group wants to keep a load of unnecessary EU regulations that stifle growth and innovation, which will thus reduce wage growth potential for UK workers."" However, worries among some businesses about post-Brexit trade rules were underlined in interviews for the BBC's Today programme being broadcast on Wednesday. One of Europe's most senior bankers has warned the City of London that it needs to be ready for a ""cliff edge"" exit from the EU next year. Andreas Dombret, director of the German central bank, the Bundesbank, said a transition deal, though positive, was not 100% certain and it was correct for a cautious regulator to ensure there was a plan in place should it fail to happen. Meanwhile, Ian Robertson, special adviser to BMW's board, told the BBC that it was vital for carmakers across Europe that there was ""seamless flow"" of goods across borders. He said the car giant, whose brands include Mini, was already spending money on planning for new paperwork and technical requirements once Britain leaves the EU.

"This video can not be played Gay men told bar 'for mixed-sex couples' only A gay couple were refused entry to a bar when bouncers told them they let in ""mixed-sex couples"" only. Patrick Hannon, 30, and Jake Archer, 25, had enjoyed a meal before heading to Jake's Bar in Leeds for a drink at about 22:00 BST on 24 March. The couple, from Newcastle, were left ""speechless"" when they were not allowed in because they were both men. The venue said it ""never discriminates"" and is investigating the incident with its ""externally supplied"" door team. Woman's jaw regrown by 9cm after cancer Man made football mascot in stag do prank Stadium to get Â£70m revamp for Games Public sector worker Mr Archer said there was no queue outside the bar and neither he nor his partner were drunk. ""We were a bit taken aback to say anything,"" he said. ""I was just thinking that if Paddy was my girlfriend then we would have been allowed in. It's discrimination."" The couple said the incident was ""discrimination"" The pair, who have been together for two-and-a-half years, said they were too shocked to argue with the doormen and went elsewhere. Mr Hannon, a police officer, said: ""If we were drunk or in a large group then you would understand. ""They need to think about how it makes them look - as a bar they are not very open minded."" Mr Archer tweeted the bar about the incident, but did not receive a response. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jake's Bar is in Call Lane which runs parallel to Leeds' gay village and is in the heart of the city's nightlife. Manager Paul Lane said it has a ""strict equality and diversity policy"" and would ""never discriminate"" against anyone. It has launched an investigation into what happened on the night with the ""external door team"". Jake's Bar, on Call Lane, has been open for nearly 14 years He said: ""We have many customers who identify with LGBTQIA+ communities who frequent the bar regularly."" The BBC does not know the name of the security firm involved, but it has been contacted for comment by the bar. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said the incident ""would certainly appear to be unlawful discrimination, which we would condemn"". Leeds City Council said it was ""seeking assurances from the owners of these premises that their door policy is reflective of national equality legislation"". The Equality Act of 2010,externalsays it is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of sexual orientation. The act provides protection from discrimination as a consumer, when using public services and as a member or guest of a private club or association. If you feel that you have been unfairly discriminated against then you can seek help from theEquality Advisory Support Service.,external You may be able to take them to court and claim damages. Source: Gov.uk A spokesman for LGBT rights charity Stonewall said: ""It's against the law to discriminate against someone because of their sexual orientation in any circumstance, including entry to a bar. ""It's unacceptable that one in six LGBT people (17%) who visited a cafÃ©, restaurant, bar or nightclub in the last 12 months have been discriminated against based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity in Britain."" Similar claims have been made about the bar in reviews on travel review website TripAdvisor. Thomas B said he was ""outraged"" by a ""homophobic bouncer"" in May last year. He wrote: ""I was with my partner and we were refused entry for not being in a mixed couple."" Brett T also advised in March 2016: ""Avoid if you're male. Their new policy that won't let a group in [four people] unless it includes women is a joke."" Paul contacted the BBC to say he and his husband and experienced a similar situation at the bar a few years ago. He said: ""When we tried to enter with our (mixed sex couple) friends we were told they were only allowing couples entry. ""When we politely explained that we were both couples (and indeed that we were arguably more so than our unmarried friends given that we were in a civil partnership and wearing the matching rings to prove it) they still refused us entry. ""We've never tried to go back again after that. ""This area of Leeds does have an issue with large groups of intoxicated revellers, however [it] would appear that this venue also has an issue with understanding that adopting a 'couples only' policy doesn't always equate to a man and woman.""

"Weightlifter Arcangeline Fouodji Sonkbou is among the missing athletes, Cameroon officials say Eight Cameroonian athletes have gone missing from their accommodation at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, team officials have confirmed. Press attache Simon Molombe told the BBC officials viewed it as ""desertion"" and that the missing athletes had been reported to Australian police. The three weightlifters and five boxers were last seen at different times on Monday and Tuesday, he said. Cameroon said the group had valid Australian visas until 15 May. Officials named the missing athletes as weightlifters Olivier Matam Matam, Arcangeline Fouodji Sonkbou and Petit Minkoumba, and boxers Christian Ndzie Tsoye, Simplice Fotsala, Arsene Fokou, Ulrich Yombo and Christelle Ndiang. ""The authorities are very disappointed with the deserters - some did not even compete,"" Mr Molombe said. ""The pious hope is that they come back to the village and travel home with the others."" The Australian government has warned athletes against overstaying their visas. The Commonwealth Games Federation said it would monitor the situation but athletes had ""the right to travel freely"" on their visas. The Australian Federal Police has been notified of the development, according to Kate Jones, a Queensland state government minister. In 2012,seven Cameroonian athletes disappeared while in London for the Olympics.

Floral tributes and balloons for Henry Vincent, 37, have been repeatedly attached and then removed from a fence opposite a home in Hither Green, south-east London, where he was killed. Richard Osborn-Brooks, 78, was initially held on suspicion of murder, but released with no further action. Mr Vincent's family said the fence was ""the best place"" for a tribute. One resident fears the actions to tear down the tributes could ""cause a rumpus"" The bouquets have been repeatedly taken down by a man who called it an ""insult"" to Mr Osborn-Brooks. A man indentifying himself as Cecil Coley said he first removed the flowers overnight on Monday after becoming ""infuriated"" by the tributes. He said: ""It was a residential area they were placing flowers on. It was inappropriate, and the guy deserves no tribute."" Cecil Coley is also the name of a72-year-old florist who was arrested on suspicion of murderafter he stabbed an armed intruder to death in 2011. He was later released without charge. Friends and family of Henry Vincent returned to tie floral tributes to the fence on Tuesday Elvina Lee, who said she was Mr Vincent's first cousin, said: ""I don't know what's wrong with these people [who took them down]. ""He wasn't a murderer, he wasn't a rapist, they're putting him as a monster."" She was one of three women who arrived and re-fastened 20 bouquets and balloons to the fence on Tuesday afternoon.

I do not appreciate it. ""If it is a normal person it is different - it could have been my house [that was burgled]."" Henry Vincent was under investigation over a separate burglary involving an elderly victim Mr Vincent's cousin Phoebe Smith, 34, said whoever had torn down the flowers ""should be ashamed of themselves"". ""It's terrible - they don't understand that it's somebody's child. They're a memory of a son and a friend,"" she said. A coroner returned Mr Vincent's body to his family during an inquest opening at Southwark Coroner's Court on Tuesday. Assistant coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe told two of his female relatives: ""I know you are having a dreadful time."" Floral tributes to Henry Vincent have been repeatedly removed from a fence A 33-year-old neighbour, who did not want to be named, told the BBC he felt ""intimidated"". ""I think that it's really sad that someone's died and I think it's not their fault that he's died and it's up to them to grieve for him however they want to do it. ""It is quite stark and you can't help but feel it looks a bit confrontational. ""It's a massive, massive display right in front of the house. If the family want to lay flowers that's fine but it feels weird. ""It feels a bit aggressive to be honest."" The tributes are on a fence opposite Richard Osborn-Brooks's home which has been partially boarded up Many residents in Hither Green have interpreted the large tribute to Mr Vincent as an aggressive act. One neighbour said they saw a car circling the block while the tribute was being erected, which they believe was an attempt to intimidate locals. If intimidation was the aim, it appears to have worked. Most neighbours are reluctant to talk publicly for fear of being drawn into a dispute that may not be over. While those living on South Park Crescent have all been quick to offer condolences to Mr Vincent, they argue his is not the only life that has been ruined. Mr Osborn-Brooks and his family have not returned to their house since the burglary and their windows have now been boarded up for fear of reprisals. Another neighbour, Theresa Webb, described the tributes as ""inappropriate"" and of ""poor taste"". Speaking about Mr Osborn-Brooks, she added: ""One minute he is in his house and the next his life is turned upside down. ""Everyone around here sends their best wishes to him."" Richard Osborn-Brooks was held on suspicion of murder, but released with no further action Police had been called to Mr Osborn-Brooks's property at about 00:45 BST on 4 April over reports of a burglary when they found Mr Vincent collapsed in nearby Further Green Road. A witness said an accomplice dragged Mr Vincent toward a van before leaving him for dead. On Monday, the Met Police said 28-year-old Billy Jeeves was wanted in connection with the burglary. Emotional messages from Henry Vincent's children were part of the tributes Mr Jeeves's white Vauxhall Astra van was found burnt out and destroyed in Star Lane in Orpington, Bromley, on Saturday evening. Detectives want to hear from anybody who may have seen the van - with the registration GU52 AXT - in the days and hours before and after the burglary.

Alternatively, the genetic data may be hinting at a separate migration from continental Europe during the Iron Age - perhaps one that brought Celtic languages into Britain. The third possibility is that scholars have simply underestimated the genetic impact of the Roman occupation, which lasted in Britain from AD 43 until 410. Roman settlers from the Italian peninsula would have traced a large proportion of their ancestry to Neolithic farmers like those that inhabited Britain before the arrival of the Beaker people.

"This video can not be played Suspected chemical attack is 'barbaric' - May Theresa May looks ready to join military action against the Assad regime in Syria without first seeking parliamentary consent, well-placed sources have told the BBC. The prime minister is said by government insiders to see the need for a response as urgent. She wants to prevent a repeat of the apparent chemical attack near Damascus, which she described as ""abhorrent"". Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has warned that bombing could escalate the situation. Mrs May is understood to be reluctant to ask US President Donald Trump to hold off any action until she has the opportunity to consult MPs at Westminster. Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Trump says missiles 'will be coming' Corbyn warns against US-Russia 'hot war' Formally, she has yet to unequivocally point the finger of blame at the Assad government, the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar said. She has spoken of the need for action ""if"" the regime is found to bear responsibility, he added, but the strong assumption in Downing Street and Whitehall is the attack will be attributed to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. Action is thought likely to follow within days. Mrs May earlier described the use of chemical weapons as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" that ""cannot go unchallenged"". She did not comment on Donald Trump's tweet warning Russia to ""get ready"" for missiles being fired at its ally Syria. By the BBC's Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar The prime minister's instinct is to chew carefully on the decision of whether and how Britain should support action in response to the apparent chemical attack in Syria. She still speaks of the need to act ""if"" not ""as"" the Assad regime is responsible. But the uncomfortable truth is the form of action is beyond her control. Read John's full blog Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC that Parliament ""should always be given a say on any military action"". ""We don't want bombardment which leads to escalation and a hot war between the US and Russia over the skies of Syria,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable did not rule out backing military but he said Parliament would have to give its approval and there would have to be ""some strong conditions around it"". Medical sources say dozens of people were killed, including children, during the alleged toxic bombing of the formerly rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Russia has described the reports of the chemical attack as a ""provocation"" designed to justify Western intervention against the Syrian regime. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Military action risks escalating Syria crisis Mrs May described the alleged chemical attack as a ""shocking, barbaric act"" and said she was ""appalled but not surprised"" at Russia, which vetoed a US-drafted UN resolution proposing a new inquiry to establish who was to blame. She said investigations were continuing but that ""all the indications"" were that the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad, which denies mounting a chemical attack, was responsible. The UK and its allies were looking at ways to ""prevent and deter"" the use of chemical weapons, she added. On Tuesday she spoke on the phone with US President Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, agreeing their three countries would work together to take action to ""uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons"". The SNP called for action against the Syria government, including blocking its ""purchasing and importing abilities"" and sanctions against key people and companies. The party's defence spokesman Stewart McDonald said that while the case for action was clear, air strikes ""will not provide the long term solutions needed to end the war"". The fallout from the attack has sparked a war of words on who was responsible and what the response should be. On Twitter, President Trump responded to a warning from Alexander Zasypkin, Moscow's ambassador to Lebanon, that missiles would be shot down and their launch sites targeted if they threatened the lives of Russian personnel. ""Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,"" he wrote. Why is there a war in Syria? ""Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'"" On Tuesday President Macron said that if military action was taken, it would target ""the regime's chemical capabilities"", and not the forces of its allies, Russia or Iran. Speaking in Paris, he said he did ""not want an escalation"" and that a decision would be made in the coming days. The information that France had showed ""chemical weapons were indeed used and that the regime could clearly be held responsible"", Mr Macron added. On Tuesday the UN Security Council failed to approve moves to set up an inquiry into the alleged attack on Douma. As permanent members of the council, Russia and the US vetoed each other's proposals to set up independent investigations. The US-drafted resolution would have allowed investigators to apportion blame for the suspected attack, while Russia's version would have left that to the Security Council. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had said earlier that inspectors would travel to the town to investigate.

"Some of the failings that allowed rogue surgeon Ian Paterson to harm patients have been found to be widespread across private hospitals, inspectors say. The Care Quality Commission said it was concerned about the ""old-fashioned"" approach to consultants which led to a lack of monitoring and checks. The regulator said it meant there was a ""real danger"" poor practices were not being picked up or challenged. Private hospitals said they were responding quickly to the findings. The CQC looked at 206 private hospitals in what was the first comprehensive review of the sector. These sites treat both private patients and those the NHS pays for to be seen by private hospitals. The CQC rated 70% as good or excellent. But it said there was a ""significant concern"" relating to governance and safety. In particular, it highlighted the lack of proper checks and monitoring of senior doctors, mainly surgeons, to ensure they were only undertaking treatments they were qualified to do or carrying them out in a safe way. It likened the failures to those found in the Paterson case,the breast surgeon who was found guilty of 17 counts of wounding with intent last yearand sentenced to 20 years in jail. He carried out botched operations on patients at private hospitals in the West Midlands. The surgeon's trial heard he had wildly exaggerated his patients' cancer symptoms, leading them to have several needless operations which left them scarred for life physically and emotionally. Breast surgeon Ian Paterson was found guilty of wounding with intent last year Chief inspector of hospitals Prof Ted Baker described the approach to consultants as ""old-fashioned"" as it relied on informal systems and people knowing each other. ""Too often, safety was viewed as the responsibility of individual clinicians, rather than a corporate responsibility supported by formal governance processes. ""Where we found failings, we have been clear that improvements must be made, using our enforcement powers where needed to protect people."" Dr Howard Freeman, of the NHS Partners Network, which represents private providers, said providing safe and high-quality care was a ""top priority"". He said where inspectors had highlighted problems hospitals were being ""quick to respond"". The Royal College of Surgeons said there was ""no room for complacency"".

"The entrance of the Santa Izabel prison complex A number of inmates at a jail in the northern Brazilian city of Belem have died during an attempted mass breakout. They were aided by an armed group outside the jail which used explosives against one of the prison walls. One guard died, as well as 19 prisoners and those helping them from outside. The fighting at the Santa Izabel Prison Complex outside Para's state capital had been as intense as in warfare, the state security service said in a statement. Four other guards were injured, including one seriously. The security service said the prison guards took on attackers from both inside and outside the prison. The authorities are now trying to determine if any of the prisoners managed to escape. Last year 56 people were killed in an uprising in a prison in the city of Manaus in Brazil's Amazon region. Prison guards took on attackers from both inside and outside the prison. Dozens on run after deadly prison riot Brazil jail riot drug lord arrested Inmates beheaded at Brazil jail.
