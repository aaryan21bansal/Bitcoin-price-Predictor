"This video can not be played Dominic Cummings leaves Number 10 The departure of the prime minister's chief adviser Dominic Cummings is a chance to ""reset government"", a senior Tory MP has said. Mr Cummings left Downing Street for the last time on Friday following internal battles about his role. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said Boris Johnson had taken ""decisive action"" in removing his aide. The PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson was not distracted by the row and was ""focused"" on tackling coronavirus. Mr Cummings and director of communications Lee Cain,who resigned on Thursday, will work out their notices at home following tensions within No 10. Mr Davis said Mr Cummings had a ""very confrontational-style"" which had turned people in Downing Street against him. He said: ""Lots of my colleagues are hoping for a new relationship - with more openness and interaction with Parliament - and I am told the cabinet is hoping to get more say, as it were, in events."" 7 highlights of his career What led to Cummings' departure? Dominic Cummings: The campaigner in No 10 Another Conservative MP, Sir Charles Walker, said Tory MPs had felt like they were ""losing"" the prime minister, and there had been an ""iron curtain"" around Mr Johnson which stopped MPs seeing him to raise concerns. He told the BBC the changes in No 10 were a sign of the PM's ""determination to rebuild relationships"" and was a chance to address the ""significant and growing gap"" between Downing Street and the Conservative Party. The departure of Mr Cummings and Mr Cain comes as the government grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, and as trade talks between the UK and the EU on their future relationshipreach a ""make or break"" point. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was ""scandalous"" that in a week when the UK's coronavirus death toll passed 50,000,redundancies rose to a record highand the country was negotiating ""the most significant trade deal for 50 years"", that the ""people in No 10 round the prime minister are arguing and jockeying for position"". Labour said the PM could ""rearrange the deckchairs all he wants... but the responsibility for this government's incompetence still lies firmly at Boris Johnson's door"". ""The fact there is no plan and no focus in the government's response to Covid is entirely down to him,"" a party source said. Mr Cummings had a notoriously difficult relationship with Conservative MPs, some of whom have said it is time for things to be done differently in Downing Street. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smithwrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat Mr Cummings' influence had led to ""a ramshackle operation in the hands of one man"". Lord Gavin Barwell, who was former Prime Minister Theresa May's chief of staff, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was an opportunity for Mr Johnson to rebuild relations with Conservative MPs and ""set a less confrontational and more unifying tone that is maybe more in tune with his natural instincts"". And former Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, said: ""Both Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were pretty dismissive of backbenchers and sometimes ministers and secretaries of state, and I don't think that was helpful."" Lee Cain worked with Dominic Cummings on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum Both Mr Cummings, 48, and Mr Cain, 39, are veterans of the Vote Leave campaign and worked closely with Mr Johnson to deliver the Brexit vote during the 2016 EU referendum. Lord Edward Lister, who was Mr Johnson's chief of staff when he was Mayor of London, will become interim chief of staff pending a wide-ranging shake-up of the prime minister's team. Mr Cain will be replaced by James Slack, who is currently the prime minister's official spokesman. Allies of the two men who've departed Downing Street insist it was entirely amicable, despite the enduring war of words. They may have been eyeing an exit before too long in any case, although it's hard to see that this is how anyone wanted it to happen. But in the end, whether Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were forced out in anger or reluctantly let go doesn't matter too much. The fact is the tussle for control in No 10 had become such a distraction that something needed to give. As many have said, their departure is an opportunity for the prime minister to make a fresh start. So what now? With Downing Street in something of a state of limbo, decisions in the coming days may prove very revealing about the prime minister and his priorities. Mr Cummings prompted controversy this summer after it emerged he made a 260-mile trip from London to County Durham with his family at the height of the UK's first coronavirus lockdown. The adviser later said the journey was intended to secure childcare, but he was mocked for claiming a subsequent outing to the picturesque town of Barnard Castlewas to help test his eyesight. Bronwen Maddox, director of the Institute for Government, said she thought Mr Cummings' departure ""went beyond just this week's events"", pointing to his trip to Barnard Castle which she said had given public trust in the government ""a battering"". ""I think in a way this has been brewing since then and the kind of restlessness amongst Conservative MPs on the backbenches shows how strained some of the government's key relationships have been,"" she said. Jill Rutter, senior research fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, said Mr Cummings had been ""disproportionately influential"" but it was ultimately up to the prime minister who to appoint as his advisers. ""You have to assume that what Dominic Cummings was doing was what the prime minister wanted him to do, up until he didn't which is what appears to have happened yesterday,"" she said. Dominic Cummings left Downing Street with a cardboard box on Friday night Mr Cain is said to have left Downing Street through a discreet exit on Friday evening. But Mr Cummings walked through the black front door of No 10 with a cardboard box and was later seen arriving home with a bottle of champagne. Mr Davis said his exit from Downing Street holding a cardboard box was ""entirely deliberate"" as he wanted to leave an ""image"". Dominic Cummings: How does he now earn a living?

"Vienna imposed a partial lockdown at the start of November, including an overnight curfew Austria is moving from a night curfew and partial shutdown to a second national lockdown that will be in place for at least two and a half weeks. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has urged Austrians not to meet anyone from outside their household in an attempt to curb a rapid rise in Covid cases. He said schools would close and students would learn from home when new measures come into force on Tuesday. Austria reported a record number of 9,586 new daily infections on Friday. That figure was nine times higher than at the peak of the initial wave earlier this year. The country has recorded more than 191,000 cases since the start of the pandemic, and 1,661 Covid-related deaths. The new lockdown measures, which will see all non-essential shops and services - including hairdressers - close, will remain in place until 6 December. People have been told to work at home wherever possible. Too early for Christmas plans, Europeans warned How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Austria's Health Minister Rudolf Anschober said it was the last chance to stop the health service from collapsing under the pressure of new infections. He said Austrians had already done it once and they could do it again. Austria had its first nationwide lockdown in March, during the first wave of the pandemic. Amid rising numbers, the capital Vienna had already imposed a partial lockdown, including a curfew from 20:00 to 06:00, at the start of November. Countries across Europe are experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases, with some - such as Sweden - warning that it is too early to plan for Christmas travel. In Italy, more regions have been added to the list of coronavirus high-risk ""red zones"". Campania and Tuscany will join other regions placed under the strictest lockdown measures from Sunday. Authorities in Campania, which includes Naples, have warned that the health system there is close to collapse. Italy passed one million confirmed cases earlier this week and there have been more than 44,000 deaths in the country. Restaurant workers in Rome protested against the latest restrictions on Friday A quarter of the new cases are in Lombardy, which includes Milan. It was the worst-hit area in Italy's first outbreak and it was Europe's first coronavirus hotspot. Campania, however, has shot straight from the yellow zone to red as a spike in cases threatened to overwhelm hospitals. SMS request to go out, red zones - Europe lockdown Regions are divided into three zones - red for the highest risk, then orange and yellow. In the red zone at the moment are Lombardy, Bolzano, Piedmont and Aosta Valley in the north, and Calabria in the south. In these areas, which cover about 16.5 million people in a population of 60 million, residents can only leave home for work, health reasons, essential shopping or emergencies. All non-essential shops are closed. Bars and restaurants are also shut but people can exercise near their homes if they wear masks. Hairdressers can remain open. Greece has announced that primary schools, kindergartens and day-care centres must close, as it tackles a death rate that has quadrupled since late October. Since Friday night, a curfew from 21:00 to 05:00 is in place nationwide. Lockdowns and other measures are in force in several European countries experiencing a second wave of the virus. In other developments: Portugalhas significantly expanded its overnight curfew. From Monday, three-quarters of the country will be under the government's toughest restrictions. On Saturday, hundreds of bar and restaurant staff took over a main square in Lisbon to demonstrate against the closure of businesses Germanyreported a new record of 23,542 daily infections on Friday, dampening hopes that a national partial lockdown might be lifted soon Ukrainehas also registered a record number of new Covid-19 cases.

"Emergency laws to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content online should be introduced, Labour has said. The party is calling for financial and criminal penalties for social media firms that do not remove false scare stories about vaccines. It follows news of progress on the first effective coronavirus vaccine. The government said it took the issue ""extremely seriously"" with ""a major commitment"" from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle anti-vaccine content. Many social media platforms label false content as misleading or disputed - and all remove posts that contravene terms of service. But Labour said a commitment by platforms to remove content flagged by the government was not enough. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said such content was ""exploiting people's fears, their mistrust of institutions and governments and spreading poison and harm"". He told BBC Breakfast his party wanted to work with the government on a cross-party basis to build trust and help promote take-up of the vaccine. Microchips, 'altered DNA' and other false vaccine rumours He said people would have legitimate questions about what the vaccine means for them, levels of immunity and whether the vaccine was appropriate for those with chronic health conditions. ""There's nothing wrong with asking those questions and strong public health messaging from the government, reinforced by us, will allay those fears,"" he said. Baseless conspiracy theories about a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the latest vaccine news rekindled these pre-existing narratives online. These includes false claims that the vaccine is a means of inserting microchips into the population, altering our DNA, or are even a weapon of genocide. Within hours of news breaking about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, comments and memes suggesting it will deliberately harm us were popping up in local Facebook groups, parent chats and on Instagram. This kind of disinformation is worlds away from legitimate concerns that a vaccine is safe and properly tested. Despite commitments to tackle falsehoods from social media sites and the government, a constant bubbling of conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective vaccine. The anti-vax movement, which pre-dates the pandemic, is not the only thing responsible for the spread of this disinformation online. Pseudoscience figures with large online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking coronavirus to 5G or suggesting the pandemic is a hoax - have also turned their attention to vaccines. There is no truth to the false and harmful claims they make - but that hasn't stopped them spilling into the average social media feed for weeks and impacting those who come across them. Meanwhile, a member of the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, has criticised ministers' strategy of ""flip-flopping"" between encouraging people to socialise and spend money - and tough lockdown restrictions in England. Professor John Edmunds said: ""We need to take a long-term view and be sensible and realise that we're going to have to have restrictions in place for some time. ""Yes, we can lift them when it's safe to do so, which will be primarily when large numbers of people have been vaccinated. ""But flip-flopping between encouraging people to mix socially, which is what you're doing by encouraging people to go to restaurants and bars, versus then immediately closing them again, isn't a very sensible way to run the epidemic."" How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? The national lockdown in England is currently due to end on 2 December, with a return to the tiered system of local restrictions. Prof Edmunds also criticised that system of lower to higher restrictions, saying it was not ""very well thought through"". Scotland has moved to a five-tier system of coronavirus restrictions. Wales has now ended a ""circuit breaker"" while Northern Ireland has extended its own temporary lockdown. A further 26,860 UK coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday and 462 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported. Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines themselves. But in recent years, the anti-vaccination - or ""anti-vax""- movement has gained traction online. Social media has been blamed for allowing unfounded claims about vaccines to spread more easily. In 2019, the UKlost its measles-free statusdesignated by the World Health Organization - and there has been a marked decline in vaccination rates for all 13 diseases covered in jabs for children. Since the pandemic, anti-vaccination campaigners have moved their focus to the coronavirus. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means In the letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, Labour said there were dedicated anti-vaccination groups online with hundreds of thousands of followers who were ""churning out disinformation"" on the issue. Last week,the government announced,externalthat social media companies had agreed a package of measures - including that no company should be profiting from Covid vaccine fake news. But Labour warned that the measures do not go far enough and has questioned why anti-vax groups are not being closed down. ""The announced collaboration with social media companies last week was welcome but feels grossly inadequate with a promise by them to remove only the content which is flagged by government and which generates profit,"" Labour said. Labour called for emergency legislation that would see financial and criminal penalties for a continued failure to act, and said they would vote for it. This video can not be played Research shows a number of young people may choose not to have a Covid-19 vaccination On Monday, news of a potential vaccine made headlines after preliminary results from Pfizer and BioNTech showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from catching Covid. The vaccine is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. Pfizer and BioNTech companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November and a limited number of people may be given the vaccine this year. The UK has bought enough doses for 20 million people. But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the MHRA - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Thehead of the MHRA said this weekit will not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a Covid vaccine quickly. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âAnti-vax is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" Earlier this year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called people who oppose vaccinations ""nuts"". And this week, he said he had ""no inhibitions"" about getting one, adding: ""Anti-vax is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" A government spokesperson said: ""Letting vaccine disinformation spread unchecked could cost British lives. ""We take this issue extremely seriously andhave secured a major commitment,externalfrom Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle it by not profiting from such material, and by responding to flagged content more swiftly.

"An Evergreen ship was told it could be waiting 10 days to unload its cargo at Felixstowe Retailers, shipping and haulage companies have complained of ""chaos"" at Felixstowe Port in Suffolk, affecting goods in the run-up to Christmas. One ship due to be unloaded at the port last week was redirected to Rotterdam because of ""unacceptable"" delays. The owner, Hutchison Ports, blames pre-Brexit stockpiling and the pandemic. Freight manager Matt Hudson warned that ""if the chaos continues, increased shipping prices will be passed on to consumers"". Mr Hudson, whose company distributes goods picked up at the port, said containers were being left on the quayside because haulage companies could not book a slot to enter the site. ""It's delaying freight going into shops for consumers to buy,"" he said. ""Shops are struggling anyway at the moment because of the impact from the coronavirus. ""If retail outlets can't sell what is actually en-route at the moment in time for Christmas, potentially they could lose even more money than they have done already this year."" Part of the problem is a shipment of 11,000 containers of PPE ordered by the government that is clogging up the port. Last week, Taiwanese shipping firm Evergreen directed one of its ships to bypass Felixstowe because of ""serious port congestion"". The ship's cargo was unloaded in Rotterdam instead and ferried back to the UK via London's Thamesport. An Evergreen spokesman said the firm had been told by Felixstowe's owner that a berthing slot - where cargo is unloaded - would not be available for up to 10 days after the ship's scheduled arrival. ""Such a delay is totally unacceptable,"" he said. Freight companies say containers are being left on the quay while lorry drivers wait for access to the port In a statement, Hutchison Ports UK said: ""The imbalance in UK trade and Brexit stockpiling exacerbate current operational challenges and we are working with our customers and stakeholders to get through the current congestion. ""Performance at the port remains under pressure due to the Covid pandemic, high levels of import traffic, the large number of empty containers and a large amount of unusually long-stay containers held at the port."" But in an operational note posted on its website, the company said delays at Felixstowe would continue ""at least into December and possibly through into the New Year"" - potentially causing havoc for firms still waiting on pre-Christmas stock. In a sign of the company's woes, Hutchison Ports UK recently reinstalled its former boss Chris Lewis as chief executive. He came out of retirement to take up the role for a second time, having last led the firm in 2010. Felixstowe is the UK's busiest container port, handling 100,000 units a week For months, hauliers have complained about Felixstowe's Vehicle Booking System (VBS) which lorry drivers must use to gain ticketed entry to the port. Freight manager Mr Hudson says in recent weeks, the situation has become worse. ""There are more containers waiting on the port while all trucking companies are logging on trying to get a slot. Sometimes the port cancels some of the VBS [slots] when drivers are actually on port waiting,"" he said. ""We need to see improvement quickly. It's ruining a lot of people's businesses."" A spokesman for Hutchison Ports UK disputed the claims about the VBS, pointing out that in recent days, empty slots have been available and that improvements to the system are under way. Boldcube Scooters says it has five containers of stock on ships waiting to be unloaded at Felixstowe Mona Kalantar runs Boldcube Scooters, which imports scooters for children. She currently has five containers of stock on ships that are waiting to dock at Felixstowe. She says it's incredibly frustrating because one of the ships has been waiting to unload its cargo for three weeks and she's turning away potential customers who want to buy Christmas presents for their kids. ""Effectively we are out of stock of our best-selling products and we've not been able to run the promotions we'd like to run because we're not going to be able to meet the demand in the lead up to Christmas,"" she said. ""We've done everything we needed to do, we ordered in plenty of time - but we can't access the stock because it can't get into the port."" She said she keeps getting messages from the shipping companies telling her 'Sorry, it's going to be another week's delay'. Logistics UK, the trade association representing supply chain firms, said there had been a huge spike recently in the volume of cargo entering the UK. Part of that dates back to the summer, when the UK's first lockdown eased and firms increased stock orders as the economy started to pick up. More recently, businesses have been looking ahead to 1 January and preparing for uncertainty at the end of the Brexit transition period. ""We are worried about the situation but we understand the port are working on solutions now,"" said Logistics UK policy manager Zoe McLernon. ""With the end of the transition period coming, we've got to make sure that our ports can take the goods we need."" Pre-Brexit stockpiling has increased congestion at Felixstowe Port Two months ago, theformer Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was hired to advise the port's parent companyHutchison Ports Europe, which is based in London. The register of MPs' financial interests shows he's being paid Â£100,000 for ""around seven hours"" of work per week. The Department for Transport says it's aware of the issues at Felixstowe Port and, while it stressed this is a commercial matter for industry to resolve, it said it would continue to monitor the situation for any impact on wider supply chains.

"The Prince of Wales has spoken of the ""enduring connections"" between the UK and Germany as negotiators prepare for post-Brexit trade talks to continue. Prince Charles said though politicians were discussing the ""shape"" of the countries' relationship, their ""fundamental bond"" would remain strong. His wife, Camilla, has joined him on their first official overseas visit since the start of the Covid pandemic. Earlier, they attended a wreath-laying ceremony at a memorial in Berlin. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are the first members of the Royal Family to attend the ceremony at the Bundestag, the German parliament, in Berlin, marking the country's National Day of Mourning for victims of war. The prince told those gathered: ""The United Kingdom has chosen a future outside the European Union, and the relationship between our countries is evolving once again. ""Its shape is a matter negotiated between our governments and its essence is defined by the enduring connections between our people. ""It is, therefore, my heartfelt belief that the fundamental bond between us will remain strong: we will always be friends, partners and allies. ""As our countries begin this new chapter in our long history, let us reaffirm our bond for the years ahead."" The speech comes 75 years after the end of World War Two and as post-Brexit trade talksare reaching their crucial final stages. This video can not be played Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are visiting Berlin to commemorate Germanyâs National Day of Mourning Referring to the English poet John Donne, who wrote that ""no man is an island"", the heir to the throne said: ""One might equally submit that no country is really an island either, other than in the wholly literal sense. ""Our histories bind us tightly together and our destinies, although each our own to forge, are interdependent to a considerable degree."" Earlier on Sunday, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were welcomed to Germany by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Budenbender on the steps of the Bellevue Palace in Berlin. The four then travelled to the Neue Wache Central Memorial, dedicated to victims of war and tyranny, where a wreath had been laid on behalf of the prince in front of a sculpture titled Mother With Her Dead Son. The sculpture was designed by German artist Kathe Kollwitz in memory of her own son who died in World War One.

The largely peaceful demonstration saw some violence later in the evening, as Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed in several skirmishes. Joe Biden won the 3 November election.

He now has 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to choose its president - which far exceeds the 270 threshold to win. US Election results in full The 'dead voters' who are still alive How will this endless US election end? However, Mr Trump has so far refused to concede. He has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and made unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud - but his efforts have so far been unsuccessful. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters think of a Biden presidency? Mr Trump's supporters kicked off the demonstrations at about noon local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday near Freedom Plaza, just east of the White House, and later headed towards the Supreme Court. As well as more mainstream Trump supporters, members of the far-right Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia group were among the marchers. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones addressed the crowd. Who are Proud Boys? Members of far-right, anti-immigrant group Proud Boys marched through downtown Washington Mr Trump's motorcade passed the gathering demonstrators on Saturday morning and did a circuit of nearby Freedom Plaza, but he carried on to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia without addressing the crowds. He laterretweeted video of protesters, posted by White House official Dan Scavino, vowing ""We will WIN!,external"" While the daytime event was largely orderly, Trump supporters clashed with counter-demonstrators in the night. Video footage posted on social media showed fights breaking out. Officials said 20 people had been arrested on a variety of charges, including assault and weapons possession. One stabbing was reported. Two police officers were also injured. At the scene - Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC A gradual stream of pro-Trump supporters made its way towards Freedom Plaza, adorned with T-shirts and carrying placards which read ""Stop the Steal"" and ""Trump 2020"". The demonstrators were also identifiable by their lack of face-masks as many participants rejected measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. In that regard alone, this pro-Trump rally was seen by its critics as reckless and irresponsible. It took place with the United States grappling with some of its worst Covid-19 infection rates since the pandemic began, with more than 180,000 new cases and 1,400 deaths recorded in the country over the past 24 hours. None of that appeared to matter much to the participants who excitedly greeted President Trump's motorcade as it made an impromptu pass around the plaza. They are desperate to see this election result overturned and fully back his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and his refusal to concede. Still, although they may deny it, there is a growing sense of a fight losing its energy and that - like it or not - these supporters will see President-elect Joe Biden in the White House in January. The president continues to dispute the election result. In a slew of tweets on Saturday, he said checks on ballots in Georgia were a ""waste of time"", alleging problems with signatures but without giving evidence. A manual recount is to be carried out in Georgia because of the narrow margin between the two candidates, but this is not expected to change the results there. On Friday,election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"", the most direct rebuttal from federal and state authorities of the president's claims. This video can not be played President Trump: ""Who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell"" On Friday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News: ""President Trump believes he will be President Trump, have a second term."" However, Mr Trump's efforts to overturn the result suffered three setbacks on Friday: In Arizona, his team dropped a lawsuit seeking a review of ballots cast on Election Day after it became clear his rival's lead was unassailable. The challenge was based on a claim that some legal votes had been rejected In Michigan, a judge rejected a request by two Republican poll watchers - who had alleged fraud in Wayne County - to block the certification of election results in Detroit In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign's requests to invalidate several batches of mail-in ballots were rejected This video can not be played Obama: Claims of election fraud are ""delegitimising"" democracy Pressure is growing on Mr Trump to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory and help prepare the transition from one administration to another. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. The Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki said this lack of access could affect Mr Biden's ability to govern. ""You need real-time information to deal with crises of the moment,"" she said, highlighting the impact of the pandemic. ""It's imperative that our team and our experts have that access."" Adding his voice to those calls, President Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, said the delay in starting the transition was hurting national security.""It's not a process where you go from zero to 1,000 miles per hour,"",externalhe told Politico. A small but growing number of Republicans are also backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. What happens now?

"The blaze on Saturday evening ripped through the intensive care unit at the hospital At least 10 people have been killed and several others seriously injured in a fire at a hospital treating coronavirus patients in Romania, officials say. The blaze broke out in the intensive care unit of the public hospital in the north-eastern city of Piatra Neamt. One doctor who tried to rescue patients is said to be in a critical condition after suffering serious burns. Romania's Health Minister Nelu Tataru told local media the fire was ""most likely triggered by a short circuit"". Austria locks down as new wave grips Europe How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Mr Tataru said that other Covid patients being treated at the hospital were being transferred to another facility in the city of Iasi. The injured doctor, who is said to have suffered severe burning to most of his body, was being transferred to the capital, Bucharest, by a military plane, local media report. ""There are other medical staff who suffered burns, not only the doctor on duty,"" Mr Tataru said, adding that he was heading to Piatra Neamt following the incident at the hospital on Saturday evening. Eight of the victims were reportedly killed in the room where the fire broke out on the second floor, and two others in a room next to it. All were said have been receiving treatment for coronavirus. Many in the ward were on ventilators. The fire was believed to have spread quickly after it was fed oxygen by the supplies used to intubate patients, the health ministry said. Romania has reported more than 350,000 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and 8,813 deaths.

"The Lake District is one of England's 10 existing national parks A further Â£40m is to be ploughed into green spaces in England as part of a plan to restore species and combat climate change. The government says the cash will fund thousands of jobs in conservation. The prime minister also promised new national parks and greater protections for Englandâs iconic landscapes. Environmentalists welcomed the investment but said it was a fraction of what is needed to restore Britainâs depleted wildlife. PM promises to protect 30% of UK's land by 2030 What's in Boris Johnson's climate in tray? Can coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? Where are England's 10 national parks? Boris Johnson said the scheme was part of his 10-point plan for combating climate change, which Downing Street said would be unveiled this week. The plan has been widely leaked and it is thought to include a commitment to: energy efficiency and heat for homes and business offshore wind the power system nuclear â including small modular reactors carbon capture/storage hydrogen innovation funding for net-zero transport green financing natural environment investment The natural environment funding will go to environmental charities creating or restoring important habitats like peatland and wetland; preventing or cleaning up pollution; creating woodland; and helping people connect with nature. Mr Johnson said this will in turn create and retain skilled and unskilled jobs, such as ecologists, project managers, tree planters and teams to carry out nature restoration. The projects could give a home to species that flourished in similar initiatives across the country, including the curlew, nightingale, horseshoe bat, pine marten, red squirrel and wild orchids. Mr Johnson said: âBritainâs iconic landscapes are part of the fabric of our national identity - sustaining our communities, driving local economies and inspiring people across the ages. âThatâs why, with the natural world under threat, itâs more important than ever that we act now to enhance our natural environment and protect our precious wildlife and biodiversity.â There are currently10 national parks in England- including the South Downs, Lake District and Peak District - as well as 34 areas of outstanding national beauty (AONB). The government says the process for designating new national parks and AONB will start next year. And 10 long-term ""landscape recovery"" projects will be initiated between 2022 and 2024 to restore wilder landscapes. Craig Bennett, from the Wildlife Trusts, said:  ""Of course this is welcome, but itâs a tiny amount compared with whatâs needed. âA previous promise of Â£40mwas over-subscribed seven times over,external. âThe government has pledged to protect 30% of the countryside by 2030, but at the moment only 5% is protected for wildlife. We need Â£1bn every year for this enormous task."" Tony Juniper, head of government agency Natural England, said: ""I warmly welcome this as part of the delivery of the National Nature Recovery Network - and Iâm really pleased to have all this coming from the PM.â The government has slashed funding for his organisation and earlier this week he told MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee that its current funding is below the level required to carry out  statutory duties to a good standard. Mr Juniper said taking action to protect species at risk of extinction, ceasing management duties forNational Nature Reserves,externaland engaging only a small number of planning authorities to support landscape and biodiversity activities are some of the areas where Natural England has had to scale back support.

"Celebrations on Leicester's Golden Mile are said to be the largest outside of India Every year, Leicester's Golden Mile - the city's length of road famous for its South Asian connections - becomes a noisy, joyous mass of colour and light as residents and visitors from around the world celebrate Diwali. But this year's lockdown means festivities will look very different. For years the city has played host to one of the biggest celebrations of the festival of light outside India, with Hindus, Sikhs and Jains catching up, dressing in their finest clothes, cooking feasts and exchanging gifts. For two nights of the year the road attracts 40-50,000 people for the lights switch-on and an evening of music and dancing. Joshna (left) said she had missed the atmosphere on the Golden Mile Joshna Ramji, 62, who lives in nearby Oadby, said she loved the ""buzz of the Golden Mile"" during Diwaili but this year felt very strange. ""Normally all the shops have decorations and signs up in their windows,"" she said. ""[The Golden Mile] is full of people buying gifts, food, new clothes or getting their hair done. ""But this year nobody is doing that and it is very, very quiet as businesses are closed. The atmosphere is very different."" Leicester is the only British city to have beenliving under coronavirus restrictions continuously since March, meaning even though its usual celebrations have been severely curtailed, the urge to enjoy the festivities has for many people in the city been stronger than ever. Diwali for Joshna usually includes a big meal with family and friends ""Diwali is all about light over darkness and good over evil, which is even more important this year,"" said Mrs Ramji. ""It will bring a lot of pleasure to everybody at a time some people are feeling isolated and alone."" Instead of the usual week-long of celebrations with friends and family, Mrs Ramji will just be cooking for herself and her husband at home. ""Normally we wake up early for prayers, light up candles and then have a lavish, lavish Indian meal at my sister's house and have fireworks,"" she said. ""This year it will just be us, but I'm going to put candles at the front of the house, inside, the back of the house and in the garden, just to make it feel as special as possible. ""It is a bit sad but we have to try and keep the Diwali spirit however we can otherwise it would be miserable."" Owners of businesses on the Golden Mile who had hoped to rely on Diwali to make up for their losses this year described the road as ""very eerie"". Dharmesh Lakhani, who owns Bobby's restaurant, said: ""The lights are up, the decorations are up but there are only a few people shopping for food and groceries. ""This festival is like our Christmas. So this is our Christmas gone."" Mr Lakhani said takings around the festival would be 15% of the usual trade. ""Businesses all down the road would be gearing up for this period with their new clothing designs and making all the sweets and we would have bookings of families meeting up for dinner,"" he said. ""Usually our shop is really busy, the road is busy and it's something celebrated by not just Hindus and Sikhs, but the whole city."" The crowds will be absent from Leicester's Diwali celebrations this year Karan Modha, who owns clothes shop Anokhi Sarees, said people would usually be buying new clothes for their Diwali celebrations or to give as gifts. ""People who are furloughed or lost their jobs are not going to be thinking about buying new outfits this year,"" he said. ""If they are doing a Zoom, they will just put some make up on, do their hair and wear something old."" Diwali celebrations 'will be difficult' - Sunak Making the most of a lockdown Diwali Diwali celebrations for Wales 'different' in 2020 This year will be the first time the shop has not hosted an in-store party for the celebration since the 1970s. ""It's going to be sad sitting at home instead, not knowing what to do with myself,"" added Mr Modha. ""The whole street feels weird at the moment. It doesn't feel like Diwali. There's not that jolly, vibrant feel. ""We are known for our window display at Diwali and we did it anyway because we wanted to still keep that tradition. ""This year I included a statue of Ganesh to spread some luck and joy, not just for ourselves and the other businesses on the street, but for everybody. ""We all need some kind of luck this year."" Anokhi Sarees hopes their Diwali window display will bring luck and joy to the city Praful Bhatt, who runs meals on wheels charity Jalaram Sadvrat Leicester, has been delivering Diwali goody bags to elderly people to lift their spirits. ""This time has been pretty bad for the elderly and the vulnerable,"" he said. ""We've put together some bags with special Diwali foods - ghughra, chakli, mathia and Indian sweets barfi and halwa."" Mr Bhatt, who has been delivering food to elderly people since March, said it would be a very different festival. ""This time it'll be staying home as opposed to going out to celebrate but people are still upbeat about it,"" he said. Praful Bhatt has been delivering Diwali goody bags across Leicestershire to cheer up the elderly Despite the lockdown restrictions, the city council said it wanted people to enjoy Diwali from their own homes with a virtual celebration. Councillor Piara Singh Clair said a video including messages from community leaders, as well as religious, musical and cultural elements, would be available on theVisit Leicester,externalwebsite from 19:00 GMT on Saturday. He said his ""heart went out"" to businesses on the Golden Mile. ""It was a big day they were looking forward to,"" he said. Mr Singh Clair said he was disappointed so many key celebrations for the city had been disrupted this year but hoped one positive of the virtual Diwali event was that it would be shared with families worldwide. Nima will be holding prayers at home with her husband and two children Indeed, there have been hopes the quieter tone of this year's celebrations could bring other aspects of Diwali to the fore. Nima Suchak, a volunteer at the Hare Krishna Temple in Granby Street, has been taking part in virtual meditation and prayers every evening this month, which she said had been ""comforting"" during lockdown. ""In one sense it takes away all the external stuff of Diwali that people do get caught up in - the food, the gifts,"" said the 43-year-old from Knighton. ""Diwali is the pinnacle of the year for us, of bringing light into our lives, and there are opportunities that have come with lockdown that have meant personal reflection. ""Covid has impacted us all, so in one sense we might not be celebrating in a big way but we can take this time to look after ourselves and each other. ""We are going to be thinking about those less fortunate and see Diwali, just like Christmas, as a time that's not just about eating and drinking, but about thinking of others.""

"Yorke Beach, near Stanley, has been closed since the 1982 Falklands conflict Falkland Islanders have been celebrating the day their beaches and coves have been declared free of landmines - after almost 40 years. The British overseas territory was peppered with an estimated 13,000 mines by Argentine forcesin the 1982 conflict. On hand for the mine-free declaration day was Welsh-born doctor Barry Elsby. He is one of the islanders who has never walked on the last beach to be cleared, Yorke Beach near Stanley. He moved to the Falklands with his wife for a two-year medical contract in 1990, and never left. He is now one of the islands' eight members of the legislative assembly governing the 2,500 population. ""I have friends who were born here after the 1982 conflict, and have never been able to stroll along this beach,"" he said.

"This video can not be played ''We fled from death and murder'' The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated. The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray. Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusationsin a tweet,external. But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians. How Ethiopia's conflict could destabilise its neighbours Marooned by conflict: 'My little brother needs medicine' Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago. But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated. Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead. On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region. On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet. Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days. The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there. On Sunday,in a tweet,external, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"". But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true. By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region. But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed  became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki. Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead. International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan. Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week. Human rights groupAmnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera),externalon Monday. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict Read more about life in Tigray Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms. Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.

"Mr Harper has been described as ""one of the bravest men"" on the Titanic A letter written by a Titanic hero who sacrificed his life to save others has sold at auction for Â£42,000. Baptist preacher John Harper gave his lifejacket to another passenger and went down with the doomed ocean liner in April 1912. His last letter was sold at an online auction of Titanic memorabilia in Wiltshire on Saturday. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: ""John Harper was probably one of the bravest men on that boat."" Written on Titanic stationery on April 11, 1912 to a fellow clergyman, the letter was posted at Cobh in Ireland, which was known as Queenstown when the Titanic stopped at the port before setting out across the Atlantic. Pastor Harper, 39, was the pastor of Walworth Road Baptist Church, in London. He was a widower and was travelling with his daughter Annie Jessie and his sister Jessie W. Leitch to Chicago to preach at the Moody Church. John Harper's daughter Annie Jessie went on to be the longest living Scottish Titanic survivor. Herefused a seat in a lifeboat alongside his daughter and sister, instead staying on board to offer words of comfort to passengers. He then gave his lifejacket to another passenger who survived, with other survivors reporting he continued to preach the Gospel as the ship sank. The letter talks about life on board the ship and thanks his friend and colleague for a recent kindness. Originally from Glasgow, Pastor Harper first preached at the Paisley Road Baptist Church which would later be renamed the Harper Memorial Church in 1921. The letter begins: ""I am penning you this line just before we get to Queenstown to assure you that I have not forgotten you and especially all your kindness while we were north."" His daughter Annie Jessie went to be the longest-living Scottish Titanic survivor and died in 1986. Mr Aldridge, from Henry Aldridge and Sons auctioneers in Devizes, Wiltshire, said: ""His actions epitomised that British generation in times of adversity. ""The condition of the letter is superb, it has been owned by a private collector for the last 25 years who has decided to pass the baton on to the next generation."" My Dear Brother Young. I am penning you this line just before we get to Queenstown to assure you that I have not forgotten you and especially all your kindness while we were north. I intended sending on Mrs Pratt's train fares just before I left but in the rush, which was exceptional having had 11 or 12 services for the week-end, I was unable to get it done. I will send it on from Chicago. We had a great season of blessing during the last few days in Walworth. I don't know how I am to thank dear Aunty Mary and yourself for all your kindness. The Lord will repay you for it all. Trust things are going well at Paisley Road. The warriors are with me here and are doing well so far on the journey. Very kindest love, your loving auld Pastor, John Harper. Guide: How did the Titanic sink?

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have wished Prince Charles a very happy birthday on their official social media accounts, as he turns 72. The message, posted on Twitter andInstagram,external, appears alongside a picture of a smiling Charles. Normally, the heir to the throne's birthday is celebrated with gun salutes in Green Park, the Tower of London and in other parts of the country. However, ceremonial gunfire has been suspended amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The prince's birthday comes near the end of an eventful year. In March, he contracted coronavirus and travelled to Scotland to self-isolate for seven days after displaying mild symptoms. At the time, the Duchess of Cornwall tested negative for the virus and self-isolated for 14 days. The Prince of Wales later saidhe ""got away with it quite lightly"".Earlier this month, palace sources told the BBC Prince William had also tested positive for Covid-19 at a similar time to his father.

"This video can not be played ''We fled from death and murder'' The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated. The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray. Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusationsin a tweet,external. But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians. How Ethiopia's conflict could destabilise its neighbours Marooned by conflict: 'My little brother needs medicine' Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago. But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated. Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead. On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region. On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet. Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days. The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there. On Sunday,in a tweet,external, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"". But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true. By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region. But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed  became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki. Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead. International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan. Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week. Human rights groupAmnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera),externalon Monday. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict Read more about life in Tigray Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms. Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.

"Restaurants and cafes are closed except for takeaway in England until 2 December The next two weeks will be ""absolutely crucial"" if England's lockdown is to end as planned on 2 December, a government scientific adviser has said. Prof Susan Michie said the public must resist breaking the rules in order to ""be in a position"" to spend the festive period with loved ones. News of a potential vaccine would make ""no difference"" to the current wave but could lead to complacency, she added. The prime ministerhas said the current restrictions will ""expire""next month. Prof Michie, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was too early to know what should replace the measures when they end, with the coming fortnight being key. She said: ""They're going to be a very challenging two weeks, partly because of the weather, partly because, I think, the promise of a vaccine may be making people feel complacent."" But she said data showed adherence to lockdown rules had been ""pretty steady since the summer"".

Pubs, bars and restaurants as well as non-essential shops have been forced to closeduring the four-week lockdownin England. Boris Johnson has previously insisted the measures will end as scheduled but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove hassaid measures could last beyond 2 December. Prof Michie said people had to ""get their resolve together"" and resist any urge to break the rules, in order to maximise the chance of leaving lockdown. However, she said she was ""quite hopeful"" after tough measures in Wales and Northern Ireland brought transmission rates down. Walesfinished its 17-day firebreak lockdown restrictionson Monday. Much of Northern Ireland's economy was placed under tight measures on 16 October. Scotland introduced a four-tier system on 2 November after ending national curbs on the hospitality industry.

On Friday, Sage said thatthe R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - for the UK had fallento 1-1.2, with experts believing it is already below 1 in some places. If the R number is lower than one then the disease will eventually stop spreading Dame Anne Johnson, professor of epidemiology at University College London, said the evidence suggested tier three restrictions had brought the R value down but it was not clear if they would get it under 1.

"He's spent nearly two decades working with Conservative politicians in the upper reaches of government - but many of us hadn't heard of Dominic Cummings until his infamous lockdown trip to Barnard Castle earlier this year. Now thatthe prime minister's chief adviser is leaving Downing Street, we look back at some memorable moments in his career. Mr Cummings became a household name after he defended his 260-mile drive from his home in London to his parents' farm in County Durham during the UK's national coronavirus lockdown in March. Following pressure from all political sides to explain why he went against the government's ""stay at home"" messaging, Mr Cummings said he made the journey for childcare reasons after his wife developed coronavirus symptoms. But a subsequent outing, this time from the cottage on his parents' farm to the historic market town of Barnard Castle, was the trip thatgave fuel to meme-makers across the country,external. Mr Cummings said the reason for that trip was to test his eyesight and his readiness to drive back to London. Cummings: I don't regret what I did Timeline: Did Cummings break the rules? Coronavirus: Can it affect eyesight? This video can not be played Dominic Cummings' full statement on lockdown row The success of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum no doubt helped to secure Mr Cummings' job in Downing Street, as it was his role during that which cemented his strong bond with Boris Johnson. Mr Cummings, the campaign's director, was credited with the ""take back control"" slogan that appeared to strike a chord with so many referendum voters, as well as the claim that Britain could save Â£350m a week by leaving the EU. The politics behind the Â£350m figure Boris Johnson became prime minister after his part in the successful campaign for the UK to leave the European Union In addition to his snappy slogans, Mr Cummings has also hurled some infamous insults at politicians - often through the medium of his personal blog. For example, he has said: Brexit Secretary David Davis is""thick as mince"",externaland as ""lazy as a toad"" Computer-animated superhero team PJ Maskswould do a better job than the cabinet MPs who want to disrespect the EU referendum result are""pirates"",external Some MPs who wanted to leave the EU were ""idiots"" andshould be treated like a ""tumour"",external This video can not be played Cummings: ""We need PJ Masks on the job"" Mr Cummings' blog also drew headlines when he used it to tout his ideas to shake up the civil service. In a blog post in January this year,external, he said the civil service lacked people with ""deep expertise in specific fields"" and called for ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to get in touch with him via a private Gmail address if they wanted to work in government. The post stoked tensions, with the civil servants' union saying staff were recruited on merit and ""because of what you can do, not what you believe"". PM's aide Cummings calls for civil service changes The departure of civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill (pictured welcoming Boris Johnson to Downing Street, with Mr Cummings on the right) sped up Mr Cummings' ideas for Whitehall reform, our political editor Laura Kuenssberg said The clashes with other civil servants reached new heights after a special adviser was sacked and escorted out of Downing Street by police, following a confrontation with Mr Cummings. No reason was given for Sonia Khan's dismissal in August 2019, but it's thought she had been accused by Mr Cummings of leaking details of a no-deal Brexit exercise to the media. Her then-boss (and then-chancellor) Sajid Javid ""voiced his anger"" with the PM over her treatment, later resigning when Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides. Labour said Mr Javid's departure showed Mr Cummings had ""won the battle to take absolute control of the Treasury"". Ex-Treasury adviser settles unfair dismissal claim Sajid Javid quits as chancellor This video can not be played Sajid Javid: I had no option but to resign This is perhaps a lesser-known highlight, but it's a highlight all the same. According to Buzzfeed News, Mr Cummings was greatly frustrated by the prime minister's rejection of his proposal to change Downing Street's office layout. The top aide wanted to knock walls through and put desks in circles around both him and Mr Johnson, who would sit in the centre,the Buzzfeed report claims.,external The news site claims the plans were rejected as unworkable - in part as a result of No 10's status as a Grade One listed building.

"After the euphoria of a vaccine breakthrough, it did not take long for the virus to provide a reality check. Within days of the news that an effective vaccine may have been found, it was being announced the UK was the first European country to pass the grim milestone of 50,000 deaths. This was quickly followed by a record rise in new caseswith 33,400 reported on Thursday. Both are a clear reminder, if we needed one, that there are many more difficult days to come. So what's in store? Health Secretary Matt Hancock has promised the NHS will be ready to start rolling out the vaccine from 1 December if its passes its final regulatory hurdles. But that doesn't mean the epidemic will be brought to a sudden halt. There is a huge logistical exercise in vaccinating large numbers of people - the UK has bought enough for 20 million people. And don't forget, unlike the flu vaccine, this one requires two doses. Health and care workers along with older age groups will be prioritised. But given it takes a month from the first dose for an individual to get the full protection and the fact there are 12 million over 65s - nine in 10 deaths have been in this age group - winter is likely to be well gone by the time significant numbers are protected. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was unequivocal this week when he said he didn't see the vaccine ""making any difference"" this winter. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths In the meantime infection rates remain high. Despite seeing over 30,000 cases on Thursday, the UK is averaging over 20,000 confirmed infections a day. However, estimates from the government's surveillance run by the Office for National Statisticssuggests the true figure may be double that,external. The situation has left hospitals dangerously close to capacity in the most hard-hit regions. NHS trusts in Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Nottingham and Bradford have all announced the cancellation of non-urgent work to free up beds. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, warns staff are ""exhausted"" and ""traumatised"". If hospital cases keep rising it will quickly begin to affect non-Covid work even more, he says. We were always warned lockdown, which is under way in England, would take time to have an impact. The good news is that cases had started to stabilise before it came in, with strong evidence the regional tiers had begun to have an impact. If the rise in cases on Thursday is a blip - there are suggestions it may be linked to a last bout of socialising before lockdown came in - the expectation is the number of infections will soon start to drop. Friday's figures were 6,000 cases down on the day before, Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Covid Symptom Study, an app which one million people use, believes the crucial R number - the measure of how many people an infected person passes the virus on to on average - is now below one. This would mean the epidemic should start to shrink. But no-one knows exactly what sort of impact lockdown will have. There have been suggestions the number of infections could be reduced by three-quarters. But the early evidence from Wales' 17-day fire-break is that it stemmed the rise in cases rather than significantly shrinking it. There could be a delayed impact and England's lockdown is longer, but clearly nothing is guaranteed. Northern Ireland, meanwhile, has just extended some of its national restrictions because of concern about infection levels. And the problem is that once lockdown is lifted in England, cases are likely to take off again. It is, after all, winter, when respiratory viruses tend to thrive. Does that mean another lockdown in a few months? This is the nagging fear. Ministers are just ""deferring the problem"", says Prof Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases at Edinburgh University, who sits on the government's committee on modelling. Even if we had had the lockdown earlier, as some scientists had argued, we would have already been talking about the next one. Those backing lockdown argued it could be used to fix the test-and-trace system, which identifies close contacts of infected individuals and asks them to isolate. Each nation runs its own tracing service, but all have faced the same problem - such high rates of infection make test-and-trace more difficult and less effective. In England, councils are working hard to set up local teams to support the national system. But most of these are in their infancy and will take some time to bed in. The government has started piloting mass testing in the hope it could be a way of containing the virus given significant numbers of infected people show very mild, or even no, symptoms. The first pilot in Liverpool has been followed by others being set up inmore than 60 local authority areas. Soldiers have been brought in to help with the mass testing programme in Liverpool But some question how effective this approach will be. The rapid tests being used are ""not fit for purpose"" says Prof John Deeks, an expert in testing at Birmingham University. He points to evidence suggesting they may miss up to half of Covid cases. He also says identifying previously undetected cases only works if those that test positive isolate. Evidence on those going through the standard testing process is that they are not always doing this. A need to work and earn money is, understandably, a key issue. This brings us back to vaccination. While the breakthrough is great news, the jury is still out as to how much impact it will have. For example, we don't know how well it works in the elderly, whether it stops people passing it on or simply stops them getting ill or how long immunity lasts. Even with the vaccine the virus is ""not going away"", says Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Sage advisory group. It is, he says, now part of humanity and here to stay. Instead, the most we can hope for is providing some protection to those who are most at risk. The sad reality is that, despite the vaccine breakthrough, we are still going to have to learn to live with Covid this winter - and beyond.

"Pictures of Mr Cummings leaving No 10 dominated newspaper front pages Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year. But the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times. Rarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister. His critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10. Mr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. Cummings: I discussed ousting PM after 2019 election PM resisted lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Agree with him or not, Cummings's words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings He left his Downing Street rolefollowing an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare. In his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a Â£40,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. There was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, theUK's new ""high risk"" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects. But he appears to have a different career path in mind. In February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm,according to Companies House,external, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. But in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government. The BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg. And he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal. But he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter. He plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but ""more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc"" will only be available to subscribers who pay Â£10 a month. He is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that ""slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project"". This new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. But he adds: ""It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments. ""Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation. ""Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules."" There are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however. Little was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April. After being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April. As well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make aseries of accusations against the PMand questioned his ""competence and integrity"". The following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson ""unfit for the job"", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns. He also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying. This sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations. It thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time sincehis now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year. This video can not be played Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham While staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London. This revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out ""Do I feel OK driving?"" He also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London. Asked why he had given a story that was ""not the 100% truth"" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that ""the way we handled the whole thing was wrong"". This video can not be played Cummings says he drove to Barnard Castle to test vision Boris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis. Cummings accuses government of Covid secrecy Kuenssberg: What led to Cummings' departure? Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Some said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election. This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends his senior adviser Dominic Cummings in May 2020 But it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project. The two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. The combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. Mr Cummings was credited with formulating the ""take back control"" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history. Yet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way. It proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a ""Get Brexit Done"" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. Many of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them. ""Levelling up"" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system. The team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched ""elite"". Lee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did. Mr Cummings watches the PM in action at a coronavirus briefing There had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style. There were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state. None of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers. Mr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order. But he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs. A longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates. He grabbed headlines when heposted an advert on his personal blogfor ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked ""deep expertise"" in many policy areas. Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law during referendum Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' Review: Brexit - The Uncivil War starring Benedict Cumberbatch The Vote Leave bus was one of its most notable campaign tactics Mr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. He is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat isChillingam Castle,external, in Northumberland. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East. In what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public. He is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world. Mr Cummings facing questions from the media outside his home He re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. The pair would rail against what they called ""the blob"" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. He left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party. He once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as ""thick as mince"" and as ""lazy as a toad"" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a ""career psychopath"". Benedict Cumberbatch was widely praised for his portrayal of Dominic Cummings in Brexit: The Uncivil War His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy. Vote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. Like most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides. All that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government.

"The events of the past 48 hours feel like a political explosion, with Dominic Cummings now departing from Downing Street. But while it's tempting to see this is as a dramatic and sudden eruption, it has been a longer-term burn. The prime minister's chief adviser stepped back somewhat from some of the brutal day-to-day politics he had helped create after the election. He had been spending more time focusing on trying to rewire Whitehall - trying to increase the importance of science and data in government - hoping to be less involved in the moment-by-moment political rush. But given his profile, and his nature, was that ever a realistic plan? Cummings to leave No 10 role by Christmas Profile: Dominic Cummings Ex-Treasury adviser settles unfair dismissal claim Since the summer, there have been conversations about shifting some of the senior roles around to make No 10 run more smoothly - including, perhaps, a total exit for Mr Cummings or a different, more specific role. But in the Conservative Party, the adviser - who is not a Tory member, which rubs party people up the wrong way in itself - has been a lightning rod for irritation for years, and he became a focus for public rage too after he ignored lockdown rules anddrove to Durham. As the government's handling of the pandemic came under increasing attack, MPs became more convinced day-by-day that there needed to be change in No 10 - with Mr Cummings at the top of the list - and they grew more determined in making that case to Boris Johnson. Even those who reviled the PM's most senior adviser would acknowledge his strategy - forcing conflicts to win and drawing sharp divides between Leavers and Remainers - was effective. But as soon as the prime minister had his general election majority, there were concerns that the campaigning style was just too toxic to run a Downing Street operation with different pressures. Campaigns have to win, governments have to lead and persuade. What's burst into the open this week, with all the bitter briefings, is an acceleration of a change that was already coming. But what it won't change is the personality of the one person, the prime minister, who is meant to be in charge. Dominic Cummings' many foes absolve the PM of responsibility if they pin all the mistakes and mess on him. It's up to Boris Johnson now to build a new and more stable team, and shape what happens next.

"Mr Harper has been described as ""one of the bravest men"" on the Titanic A letter written by a Titanic hero who sacrificed his life to save others has sold at auction for Â£42,000. Baptist preacher John Harper gave his lifejacket to another passenger and went down with the doomed ocean liner in April 1912. His last letter was sold at an online auction of Titanic memorabilia in Wiltshire on Saturday. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: ""John Harper was probably one of the bravest men on that boat."" Written on Titanic stationery on April 11, 1912 to a fellow clergyman, the letter was posted at Cobh in Ireland, which was known as Queenstown when the Titanic stopped at the port before setting out across the Atlantic. Pastor Harper, 39, was the pastor of Walworth Road Baptist Church, in London. He was a widower and was travelling with his daughter Annie Jessie and his sister Jessie W. Leitch to Chicago to preach at the Moody Church. John Harper's daughter Annie Jessie went on to be the longest living Scottish Titanic survivor. Herefused a seat in a lifeboat alongside his daughter and sister, instead staying on board to offer words of comfort to passengers. He then gave his lifejacket to another passenger who survived, with other survivors reporting he continued to preach the Gospel as the ship sank. The letter talks about life on board the ship and thanks his friend and colleague for a recent kindness. Originally from Glasgow, Pastor Harper first preached at the Paisley Road Baptist Church which would later be renamed the Harper Memorial Church in 1921. The letter begins: ""I am penning you this line just before we get to Queenstown to assure you that I have not forgotten you and especially all your kindness while we were north."" His daughter Annie Jessie went to be the longest-living Scottish Titanic survivor and died in 1986. Mr Aldridge, from Henry Aldridge and Sons auctioneers in Devizes, Wiltshire, said: ""His actions epitomised that British generation in times of adversity. ""The condition of the letter is superb, it has been owned by a private collector for the last 25 years who has decided to pass the baton on to the next generation."" My Dear Brother Young. I am penning you this line just before we get to Queenstown to assure you that I have not forgotten you and especially all your kindness while we were north. I intended sending on Mrs Pratt's train fares just before I left but in the rush, which was exceptional having had 11 or 12 services for the week-end, I was unable to get it done. I will send it on from Chicago. We had a great season of blessing during the last few days in Walworth. I don't know how I am to thank dear Aunty Mary and yourself for all your kindness. The Lord will repay you for it all. Trust things are going well at Paisley Road. The warriors are with me here and are doing well so far on the journey. Very kindest love, your loving auld Pastor, John Harper. Guide: How did the Titanic sink?

"Police asked residents to report the driver of the red Nissan Navara (stock image) if he annoys residents again A driver who repeatedly shouted ""wakey wakey"" from his car in the early hours has been given a police warning. Hampshire Police said it received ""many complaints"" about a man and his passengers shouting ""at the top of their voices"" in the Brockhurst and Elson areas of Gosport. The red Nissan Navara driver was also seen turning off his lights and shouting ""you can't call the police because you can't see us"". The force said: ""How wrong he was."" Residents in Brockhurst Road (pictured) and Elson received unwelcome wake-up calls Resident Karen O'Brien, who runs Brockhurst Cafe, told the BBC at about 01:40 GMT on Tuesday or Wednesday she heard ""somebody on a megaphone shouting wakey wakey"". ""They did it twice and went up and down the road,"" she said. ""It was pretty loud, and it happened a couple of days later and woke my husband up. ""I spoke to my son and he heard it once, but he couldn't actually see anything out the window. Neither could I."" Officers eventually caught up with the 21-year-old driver, from Fareham, and issued him with a warning. The warning means the driver's car can be seized if he gives residents further unwelcome wake-up calls in the next 12 months.

"Vienna imposed a partial lockdown at the start of November, including an overnight curfew Austria is moving from a night curfew and partial shutdown to a second national lockdown that will be in place for at least two and a half weeks. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has urged Austrians not to meet anyone from outside their household in an attempt to curb a rapid rise in Covid cases. He said schools would close and students would learn from home when new measures come into force on Tuesday. Austria reported a record number of 9,586 new daily infections on Friday. That figure was nine times higher than at the peak of the initial wave earlier this year. The country has recorded more than 191,000 cases since the start of the pandemic, and 1,661 Covid-related deaths. The new lockdown measures, which will see all non-essential shops and services - including hairdressers - close, will remain in place until 6 December. People have been told to work at home wherever possible. Too early for Christmas plans, Europeans warned How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Austria's Health Minister Rudolf Anschober said it was the last chance to stop the health service from collapsing under the pressure of new infections. He said Austrians had already done it once and they could do it again. Austria had its first nationwide lockdown in March, during the first wave of the pandemic. Amid rising numbers, the capital Vienna had already imposed a partial lockdown, including a curfew from 20:00 to 06:00, at the start of November. Countries across Europe are experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases, with some - such as Sweden - warning that it is too early to plan for Christmas travel. In Italy, more regions have been added to the list of coronavirus high-risk ""red zones"". Campania and Tuscany will join other regions placed under the strictest lockdown measures from Sunday. Authorities in Campania, which includes Naples, have warned that the health system there is close to collapse. Italy passed one million confirmed cases earlier this week and there have been more than 44,000 deaths in the country. Restaurant workers in Rome protested against the latest restrictions on Friday A quarter of the new cases are in Lombardy, which includes Milan. It was the worst-hit area in Italy's first outbreak and it was Europe's first coronavirus hotspot. Campania, however, has shot straight from the yellow zone to red as a spike in cases threatened to overwhelm hospitals. SMS request to go out, red zones - Europe lockdown Regions are divided into three zones - red for the highest risk, then orange and yellow. In the red zone at the moment are Lombardy, Bolzano, Piedmont and Aosta Valley in the north, and Calabria in the south. In these areas, which cover about 16.5 million people in a population of 60 million, residents can only leave home for work, health reasons, essential shopping or emergencies. All non-essential shops are closed. Bars and restaurants are also shut but people can exercise near their homes if they wear masks. Hairdressers can remain open. Greece has announced that primary schools, kindergartens and day-care centres must close, as it tackles a death rate that has quadrupled since late October. Since Friday night, a curfew from 21:00 to 05:00 is in place nationwide. Lockdowns and other measures are in force in several European countries experiencing a second wave of the virus. In other developments: Portugalhas significantly expanded its overnight curfew. From Monday, three-quarters of the country will be under the government's toughest restrictions. On Saturday, hundreds of bar and restaurant staff took over a main square in Lisbon to demonstrate against the closure of businesses Germanyreported a new record of 23,542 daily infections on Friday, dampening hopes that a national partial lockdown might be lifted soon Ukrainehas also registered a record number of new Covid-19 cases.

"The firm said it was ""saddened"" at the jobs losses as many staff had worked for the firm for years Greggs is to cut more than 800 jobs because of a sales slump due to the coronavirus pandemic. Chief executive Roger Whiteside said the Newcastle-based chain would not be ""profitable"" if action was not taken.

England and France will face off at Twickenham next week, but today was all about the Red Roses. You can read our match reporthere. But don't worry, there is still plenty of rugby to keep you busy this afternoon. Head over to our live text commentary of England's men's game with Georgiahere. Until next time... FT: France 10-33 England BBC Two England captain Emily Scarratt said:""The girls put in a real shift. We had a lot of youngsters out there today. There is no crowd but this is a really tough place to come and play. It was a real squad effort."" Asked her secret to individual success, Scarratt said:""Being part of a good team is the secret. We are a very proud rugby nation and we go about our business in a  way that we want to be the best we can be."" #bbcrugby Kevin:Great game to watch if you're an England rugby fan. #1 ranked team That Emily Scarratt penalty is the final act as England begin their autumn schedule with victory in Le Crunch. Emily Scarratt Never in doubt. Emily Scarratt maintains her 100% kicking record for the afternoon as England nudge even further ahead. France 10-30 England The clock ticks into the red and England have the penalty. There's a bit of chat about what to do - but Emily Scarratt grabs the ball and points to the posts. The visitors will have a shot at the posts with the final act of the game. France 10-30 England Kat Merchant2014 England World Cup winner on BBC Two It's not been the most clinical at times, but they have dug deep, shown some energy and it was perfect to be challenged in the first 40 minutes. France 10-30 England Nothing has gone their way in the second half. France are penalised for not throwing the ball straight at the line-out and England have the chance to clear. France 10-30 England The game is just beginning to peter out as we tick towards full-time. There are a lot of tired bodies out there now. Can France close the gap or will England add try number four? France 10-30 England France 10-30 England Time for a bit of aerial ping-pong as both sides trade a couple of kicks from deep. France opt to run the ball first but the pass is thrown straight into touch. That was a tired pass by Coumba Tombe Diallo. Emily Scarratt Was it ever in doubt? England captain Emily Scarratt nudges the ball over the posts from straight in front, as the visitors tick past 30 points. France 10-27 England The ball is indeed knocked on but we'll come back for the England penalty as France are penalised for being offside. Emily Scarratt points to the posts. France 10-27 England England roll through the phases close to the French line as they search for try number four.

France 10-27 England France 10-27 England Kat Merchant2014 England World Cup winner on BBC Two France are going to have to dig deep, make sure their heads don't go down and throw everything at it with everything in their locker. Emily Scarratt The England captain has been a colossus off the tee this afternoon as she adds another penalty to edge England further clear. That's five from five for Emily Scarratt today. France 10-24 England Kat Merchant2014 England World Cup winner on BBC Two Normally France play better in the second half, but England are playing beautifully. These flat passes are what they do so well. France 10-24 England She must have felt that. Abigail Dow is hit hard by two French defenders but she shows great strength to stay on her feet. There are more tries on offer here, but Emily Scarratt opts for the three as England win the penalty in midfield. France 10-24 England England are full of confidence now as they start to throw the ball through the hands. But France win the penalty inside their own half as England hold on in the ruck.

"Police asked residents to report the driver of the red Nissan Navara (stock image) if he annoys residents again A driver who repeatedly shouted ""wakey wakey"" from his car in the early hours has been given a police warning. Hampshire Police said it received ""many complaints"" about a man and his passengers shouting ""at the top of their voices"" in the Brockhurst and Elson areas of Gosport. The red Nissan Navara driver was also seen turning off his lights and shouting ""you can't call the police because you can't see us"". The force said: ""How wrong he was."" Residents in Brockhurst Road (pictured) and Elson received unwelcome wake-up calls Resident Karen O'Brien, who runs Brockhurst Cafe, told the BBC at about 01:40 GMT on Tuesday or Wednesday she heard ""somebody on a megaphone shouting wakey wakey"". ""They did it twice and went up and down the road,"" she said. ""It was pretty loud, and it happened a couple of days later and woke my husband up. ""I spoke to my son and he heard it once, but he couldn't actually see anything out the window. Neither could I."" Officers eventually caught up with the 21-year-old driver, from Fareham, and issued him with a warning. The warning means the driver's car can be seized if he gives residents further unwelcome wake-up calls in the next 12 months.

"Unknown future for Port Talbot's steelworks There has been a call to ""resist dealing in speculation"" over the future of steel production at Tata's plant in Wales. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the firm ""want to make steel in Wales, and that's a good place to be starting this debate from"". It followed an announcement that Tata is looking to sell part of its European arm. About 4,000 people work at its Port Talbot steel making plant. Tata announced on Friday that Swedish firm SSAB had initiated talks over the acquisition of its Netherlands-based operations. The move would separate the UK and Dutch parts of Tata's business, which merged back in 1999, then as British Steel and Koninklijke Hoogovens. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates said the news was""extremely worrying""for Tata's 8,000 workers across the UK. Stephen Kinnock, MP for Port Talbot's Aberavon constituency, said it was ""time for a partnership"" between Tata Steel and the government. He toldBBC Radio Walesthat Tata's decision ""puts the spotlight very firmly on the UK government that has to now step up and provide support to the British steel industry"". He added: ""It is about the UK government now stepping up to the plate and saying 'okay, this is a British business, we need it for decarbonisation, for climate change objectives, we need it to build sovereign capacity after Brexit'."" 'Thousands' of jobs fears over reported Tata plans Tata Steel in government talks amid bailout reports Tom Hoyles, of the GMB Wales union, said public ownership and UK government support ""should be on the table"" if necessary. ""Those are two options we think they should look at,"" he said. ""Port Talbot and steel go together like fish and chips. ""It's not just the jobs that are there that will be affected but supply lines... the smaller businesses and families who live in the town as well who will be worried."" Tata wants to make steel in Wales, says the UK government's Welsh Secretary Simon Hart The UK government has also said it""will continue to work with Tata Steel and other stakeholders""as the company shapes its business strategy for the future. The Welsh Secretary said the UK government and Tata had agreed to ""work together"" to protect the industry. Mr Hart said it was a positive sign that Tata had made a commitment to a ""sustainable steel manufacturing presence"" in Wales. Asked whether the UK government would step in and protect jobs at Tata, he said it needed to see what Tata planned for Port Talbot. He added: ""We stepped in and saved Celsa Steel in Cardiff at the beginning of lockdown. ""We have a good track record in Wales of where the arguments add up, of stepping in and helping. We saved 800 jobs in Cardiff.""

"With England in lockdown again, and many others parts of the UK enduring severe restrictions, people are looking to film, books, music, online art, podcasts and more for their cultural kicks. Here, BBC presenters and journalists share their lockdown picks. It's an eclectic list of suggestions for where to look next if you fancy some inspiration. Veteran broadcaster Mark Radcliffe presentsBBC Radio 2's Folk Showand 6 Music's weekend chat and music showRadcliffe and Maconie. The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. I like a courtroom drama, I must say. For people who don't know the Chicago 7, they were students and hippies and anti-Vietnam protesters who picketed at the 1968 Democratic Party Convention and were arrested for inciting riots. If you remember that year, it was a really highly-charged time. Martin Luther King was assassinated in April, and then Bobby Kennedy in June - so this is an extraordinary snapshot of those times. It still has a resonance, particularly in how the one black defendant is treated. In the time of Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd protests, it reminds you that not everything has changed, by a long way. Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart (Picador books) This is set in the time of Thatcherism, and it's a tragic tale of this young lad Shuggie Bain, who is protecting and caring for an alcoholic mother, living in extreme poverty. It's rather Thomas Hardy-esque, in that you know everyone is doomed to disappointment or death, but it feels very real. And like the film, one suspects life hasn't changed very much for a lot of people. The novel is nominated for the Booker Prize, although I don't generally take that as a massive recommendation. I have certainly bought Booker-winning novels and thought they were dreadful. The Queen's Gambit (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Anya Taylor-Joy plays Beth Harman, who's in an orphanage at the beginning of the film, and is intrigued by the janitor who plays chess. He gradually agrees to teach her and it turns out she's an absolute prodigy. It's based on a novel by someone called Walter Tevis but it feels like it ought to be true. It's about the connections you make as an orphan - friendships and connections and adoption. And there's a lot of chess. In fact, we started playing chess at home, inspired by it, and my wife is miles better than me and she can see several moves ahead. We don't play anymore. It got too annoying. The Asian Network presenter has hosted itsbreakfast showsince 2017, having joined the station in 2015 from community radio. Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One, iPlayer) Watching my next door neighbour Clara [Amfo] absolutely bossing it on screen is amazing. I'm a huge fan of BBC One'sStrictly Come Dancinganyway, but seeing Clara shine like a Queen is great. Rooting for her no doubt. And I usually find anything music or dance related to be therapeutic for me. It's fun, an easy watch and it's a great way to wind down. Grab some munchies and sit on the sofa while having your own party. It's perfect. Made In Heaven (Amazon Prime) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

I've also just finished watching season one ofMade In Heaven,external. A couple of colleagues have been meaning to get me into it and now I'm hooked. It's more of a drama series, but it's so good and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode. Can't wait to start the second season. Sister Sister (Netflix) And thirdly, I'm watchingSister Sister,external, a 1990s US sitcom about twins Tia and Tamera who were separated at birth and reunite 14 years later. It's brought back my youth. And you can never get enough. If you grew up watching Tia and Tamera, you already know how good it is. If you fancy a giggle, put them on."" DJ Friction has been on the BBC airwaves since 2002, and is now presentingthe Asian Network's evening show. Space videos (YouTube) It's the biggest kind of escapism - forget pandemics, let's talk about 1,000-year journeys to other galaxies. He devours YouTube series by scientists and futuristsJohn Michael Godier,externalandIsaac Arthur,external, who use science fact to examine what might actually be possible beyond Earth. They'll swing between stuff that's happening in our solar system to real mad stuff like, what will the universe look like a trillion years from now? And then they'll break it down using real physics and real science. The Real Housewives of America (Sky, ITV Be, Amazon Prime Video) Allow YouTube content?

I don't watch much TV or reality shows,"" says Friction. ""But I fell into this hole of watchingThe Real Housewives of Atlanta,externalandThe Real Housewives of Potomac,external. It wasn't until the summer that I went, 'Wait a minute, they're the only two reality shows from that franchise that feature black women. Every other show features white women. I'm subconsciously dealing with Black Lives Matter, race and everything that's happening this year via these reality shows. Believe me, I've fallen so deep into them. Anyone who asks a question about the seasons or the episodes, I have the answer. The Beatles Friction has been rediscoveringThe Beatles,externalby listening to all their albums back-to-back again. ""I just got back into it and thought, my God, how did these guys write nearly every genre of music that we're still listening to? And you're telling me they released The White Album and Yellow Submarine and Sgt Pepper within the space of 18 months? It's ridiculous."" Will Gompertz has been arts editor for BBC News since 2009 and before that was a director at the Tate Gallery. What I Love (podcast) I'm loving this podcast, presented by the award-winning theatre director Ian Rickson. It has a simple format: one guest with whom Rickson has worked selects three things he or she loves. Chiwetel Ejiofor included a Michael Kiwanuka song, Kae Tempest picked a book by William Blake. Good listening. Strata: William Smith's Geological Maps (Thames & Hudson) Some books are beautiful, others are enlightening. Strata is both. Packed with exquisite illustrations, it presents the work of William Smith, a 17th Century geologist, who was the first person to comprehensively map the earth beneath our feet. It's the best non-fiction book I've read in a long time. Call My Agent (Netflix) French TV doesn't get that much attention for some reason - but they produce some great programmes. Spiral is the best police procedural on telly, while Call My Agent is the perfect lockdown escape: uptight actor's agents dealing with uptight actors in a Paris office where they end up either bickering or sleeping with each other. Or both. Tres bon! Musician Hannah Peel presents late-nightRadio 3 show Night Tracks, which ranges from classical to contemporary music.

This is a documentary about the writer John Hull, who went blind just before the birth of his son and started to make a diary of audio cassettes. In the film you hear all the actual recording, and it's just incredible. You're immersed in a world of sound, instead of being totally bombarded with visual information. It sounds like it should be a podcast, but it really works as a film - delving into the mind and the body and dreams and memory. I think it's a masterpiece. Bandcamp (Independent music store) I'm Bandcamp all the way, for everything. They do an amazing thing once a month called Bandcamp Friday, where every artist gets 100% of the profit on their merchandise or downloads or CD sales. It's the only place that does that in the music industry. The last thing I bought was a compilation by a wonderful little indie label calledSalmon Universe,external, who put out a lot of ambient, electronic music. I like compilations because you're led to artists from all across the world, from Ohio to Japan. It's amazing. Islands (RTÃ podcast) This is made by the world-renowned sound recordist Chris Watson, who's teamed up with the writer/presenter Luke Clancy to take a journey across the atlas of remote islands, from Ross Island to the Galapagos to the possibly mythical isle of HyBrasil. It's full of stories and sounds, and it's beautiful. I just like the way you can use podcasts to express something emotional, rather than factual. So you get a sense of ethereal escapism within that. Mark has been the BBC's music reporter since 2015, and presented6 Music's History of Video Game Musiclast year. Ted Lasso (Apple TV) Allow YouTube content?

After Schitt's Creek ended, I was desperately searching for a TV show that hit the same sweet spot of belly-laughs and heart-warming humour. This is that show. Starring Jason Sudeikis, it tells the story of an American Football coach who comes to London to oversee a fictional Premiership team, despite knowing nothing about football. Unbeknownst to him, the club's owner (played with delicious relish by Hannah Waddingham) is trying to get the team relegated to spite her adulterous husband. I won't spoil the plot, but the show's relentlessly optimistic tone is just what I needed in lockdown. Pikmin 3 Deluxe (Nintendo) Pikmin isn't as well-known as Nintendo's bigger franchises, like Mario and Zelda, but it's been made with just as much care and attention to detail. You play as a crew of astronauts, stranded on a hostile planet, who have to enlist a crop of plant-like creatures to help them find the missing parts of their spaceship. You command up to 100 of the little Pikmin, each of whom have different abilities (some are fighters, some are swimmers, others are impervious to electricity) to solve a bunch of increasingly tricky puzzles against a time limit. It's simultaneously relaxing and panic-inducing; but I've been focusing on completing the less stressful challenge mode with my 10-year-old, who just likes throwing the Pikmin around and laughing at their cute noises.

Rush-released at the start of the first lockdown, this is still my favourite record of the year. A sweat-glistened hymn to the dancefloor, it never fails to lift my mood. The album is getting the live treatment later this month, with avirtual gig,externalthat's been dubbed Studio 2054 - with Dua promising (deep breath) ""a kaledioscopic, rocket-fuelled, journey through time, space, mirrorballs, roller discos, bucket hats, belting beats, throbbing basslines and an absolute slam-dunk of the best times in global club culture"". See you there. Hotpants optional. The BBC Radio 3 broadcaster presents late-night showUnclassified, which showcases music by composers who might have a classical background but also draw from pop, rock, jazz, and experimental music. Ms Ice Sandwich by Mieko Kawakami (Pushkin Press) The Japanese author'snovella,externalis evocative but breezy, conversational and unsentimental. She's dealing with the difficulties and complexity of human life but in a really relatable, warm and humorous way. It's about the relationship between an adolescent and their mother. It's a coming-of-age tale and about the anxieties of being a teenager, but you get to see it from both sides. You can sense what the mother's feeling as well. She's a fortune teller and their grandma's ill upstairs. It's a family tale about female identity in Japan. Fat Out Fest (YouTube) The annual music festival from Salford-based underground and alternative promoters, Fat Out Fest happened live online this year, and they are now putting setson YouTube,externalevery Friday over the next month. They really do take it to the edge. On 20 November they're broadcasting Lone Taxidermist - her shows are wild. It's performance art as well as music. Her new show Marra starts with her singing along to a cattle market. An actual cattle market. Her voice is synced with the auctioneer and Maxine Peake is in the video. It's out there. Radiophrenia (Streaming) Radiophrenia,externalis a Glasgow sound art radio station that's streaming 24/7 until 22 November. I was listening to an Italian sound artist called Tobia Bandini. He'd interviewed all these people asking for their response to the apocalypse and then he'd mix their stories - they're all in Italian - with electronic soundscapes. If you want to tune out of the news then this is a really nice place to escape to. There's all sorts in there, and a lot of it is just really pleasing and quite hypnotic. The 1Xtra broadcaster started hosting its Drivetime show at the end of September, having joined the station in 2016. Billions (Sky, Amazon Prime) During lockdown I have started an obsession with the TV series Billions already watching three seasons! I think throughout the first lockdown, many of us found new interests and hobbies - for me one of those was trying to learn more about stocks. Billions is pretty much the ideal programme for being more of a nerd around finance! Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

It covers so many different past philosophers as well as different debate topics. It's really nice to just put it on play and binge listen. Aspire (William Morrow) I've started reading Aspire by Kevin Hall - an incredible read! It's very self-helpy (which is very me) but it's such a great read, it focuses on the power of words and how they make a real impact in our lives.

"This video can not be played Friday night in Cardiff: ""There's a lot of people out - it's Covid central"" Pub customers are asked to ""enjoy themselves sensibly"" as this weekend marks the first since Wales' firebreak lockdown was lifted. Groups of up to four are able to book ahead for pubs, cafes and restaurants under Wales' rules. Greg Mulholland, from the Campaign for Pubs which represents publicans across the UK, said it could help ensure they are allowed to stay open for Christmas. An economist said it was a ""crucial"" time for businesses. On Friday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething called on people to""stay in one place but don't stay out for a long time"". He said people needed to look at their own actions in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus and urged them not to ""bend the rules"" by moving tables together in the pub. People enjoying a drink on the first Friday night after the firebreak lockdown Mr Mulholland said it was vital that pubs now remained open over the festive period. While it was welcome news when businesses were allowed to reopen on 9 November, he said the restrictions still in place meant it was still ""very difficult"" for pubs to make a profit. 'Stop bending the Covid rules', minister pleads How many deaths and Covid cases in Wales? He toldBBC Radio Walesthat publicans took their responsibilities ""very seriously"" in ensuring people follow the rules, such as sitting further apart. ""Community pubs show they are part of the solution in helping people in Wales enjoy themselves sensibly,"" he said. Cardiff city centre was busy with shoppers on Saturday Joe Hixson, manager of the Queen's Hotel in Swansea's maritime quarter, said the business was operating at about 50% of its usual turnover with a maximum of 40 people allowed in his business. And with a limit of four people per group, he is expecting just a quarter of the usual Christmas party trade in December. ""It's going to be like January - a quiet month,"" he said. A raft of new measures were imposed in Wales after the lockdown ended on 9 November Cardiff's Le Monde restaurant boss Nataniel Martinez said customers sitting up to four to a table could ""enjoy yourselves and socialise"" for up to two hours, according to revised coronavirus restrictions. ""That is very important, especially now with the winter months, the dark, the cold,"" he said. ""Coming out to enjoy a nice meal in a safe, regulated environment, I think that is very important."" In Powys, siblings Kirst and Ben Oliver-Lewis reopened the Herb Garden Cafe in Llandrindod Wells as its new owners the day Wales' firebreak lockdown lifted. The pair, who had both worked at the business previously, said Saturday had seen ""good"" breakfast trade but Monday's reopening was the busiest day this week with customers ""glad to get out"". Edward Jones, an economist at Bangor University, said: ""We have just come out of the second lockdown in Wales and we know the industries that really suffered are tourism, hospitality and retail, so it is just crucial to get money in through the door.""

"With England in lockdown again, and many others parts of the UK enduring severe restrictions, people are looking to film, books, music, online art, podcasts and more for their cultural kicks. Here, BBC presenters and journalists share their lockdown picks. It's an eclectic list of suggestions for where to look next if you fancy some inspiration. Veteran broadcaster Mark Radcliffe presentsBBC Radio 2's Folk Showand 6 Music's weekend chat and music showRadcliffe and Maconie. The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. I like a courtroom drama, I must say. For people who don't know the Chicago 7, they were students and hippies and anti-Vietnam protesters who picketed at the 1968 Democratic Party Convention and were arrested for inciting riots. If you remember that year, it was a really highly-charged time. Martin Luther King was assassinated in April, and then Bobby Kennedy in June - so this is an extraordinary snapshot of those times. It still has a resonance, particularly in how the one black defendant is treated. In the time of Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd protests, it reminds you that not everything has changed, by a long way. Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart (Picador books) This is set in the time of Thatcherism, and it's a tragic tale of this young lad Shuggie Bain, who is protecting and caring for an alcoholic mother, living in extreme poverty. It's rather Thomas Hardy-esque, in that you know everyone is doomed to disappointment or death, but it feels very real. And like the film, one suspects life hasn't changed very much for a lot of people. The novel is nominated for the Booker Prize, although I don't generally take that as a massive recommendation. I have certainly bought Booker-winning novels and thought they were dreadful. The Queen's Gambit (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Anya Taylor-Joy plays Beth Harman, who's in an orphanage at the beginning of the film, and is intrigued by the janitor who plays chess. He gradually agrees to teach her and it turns out she's an absolute prodigy. It's based on a novel by someone called Walter Tevis but it feels like it ought to be true. It's about the connections you make as an orphan - friendships and connections and adoption. And there's a lot of chess. In fact, we started playing chess at home, inspired by it, and my wife is miles better than me and she can see several moves ahead. We don't play anymore. It got too annoying. The Asian Network presenter has hosted itsbreakfast showsince 2017, having joined the station in 2015 from community radio. Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One, iPlayer) Watching my next door neighbour Clara [Amfo] absolutely bossing it on screen is amazing. I'm a huge fan of BBC One'sStrictly Come Dancinganyway, but seeing Clara shine like a Queen is great. Rooting for her no doubt. And I usually find anything music or dance related to be therapeutic for me. It's fun, an easy watch and it's a great way to wind down. Grab some munchies and sit on the sofa while having your own party. It's perfect. Made In Heaven (Amazon Prime) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. I've also just finished watching season one ofMade In Heaven,external. A couple of colleagues have been meaning to get me into it and now I'm hooked. It's more of a drama series, but it's so good and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode. Can't wait to start the second season. Sister Sister (Netflix) And thirdly, I'm watchingSister Sister,external, a 1990s US sitcom about twins Tia and Tamera who were separated at birth and reunite 14 years later. It's brought back my youth. And you can never get enough. If you grew up watching Tia and Tamera, you already know how good it is. If you fancy a giggle, put them on."" DJ Friction has been on the BBC airwaves since 2002, and is now presentingthe Asian Network's evening show. Space videos (YouTube) It's the biggest kind of escapism - forget pandemics, let's talk about 1,000-year journeys to other galaxies. He devours YouTube series by scientists and futuristsJohn Michael Godier,externalandIsaac Arthur,external, who use science fact to examine what might actually be possible beyond Earth. They'll swing between stuff that's happening in our solar system to real mad stuff like, what will the universe look like a trillion years from now? And then they'll break it down using real physics and real science. The Real Housewives of America (Sky, ITV Be, Amazon Prime Video) Allow YouTube content?

You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. I don't watch much TV or reality shows,"" says Friction. ""But I fell into this hole of watchingThe Real Housewives of Atlanta,externalandThe Real Housewives of Potomac,external. It wasn't until the summer that I went, 'Wait a minute, they're the only two reality shows from that franchise that feature black women. Every other show features white women. I'm subconsciously dealing with Black Lives Matter, race and everything that's happening this year via these reality shows. Believe me, I've fallen so deep into them. Anyone who asks a question about the seasons or the episodes, I have the answer. The Beatles Friction has been rediscoveringThe Beatles,externalby listening to all their albums back-to-back again. ""I just got back into it and thought, my God, how did these guys write nearly every genre of music that we're still listening to? And you're telling me they released The White Album and Yellow Submarine and Sgt Pepper within the space of 18 months? It's ridiculous."" Will Gompertz has been arts editor for BBC News since 2009 and before that was a director at the Tate Gallery. What I Love (podcast) I'm loving this podcast, presented by the award-winning theatre director Ian Rickson. It has a simple format: one guest with whom Rickson has worked selects three things he or she loves. Chiwetel Ejiofor included a Michael Kiwanuka song, Kae Tempest picked a book by William Blake. Good listening. Strata: William Smith's Geological Maps (Thames & Hudson) Some books are beautiful, others are enlightening. Strata is both. Packed with exquisite illustrations, it presents the work of William Smith, a 17th Century geologist, who was the first person to comprehensively map the earth beneath our feet. It's the best non-fiction book I've read in a long time. Call My Agent (Netflix) French TV doesn't get that much attention for some reason - but they produce some great programmes. Spiral is the best police procedural on telly, while Call My Agent is the perfect lockdown escape: uptight actor's agents dealing with uptight actors in a Paris office where they end up either bickering or sleeping with each other. Or both. Tres bon! Musician Hannah Peel presents late-nightRadio 3 show Night Tracks, which ranges from classical to contemporary music. She was Emmy-nominated last year for her soundtrack forHBO's Games of Thrones: The Last Watch,external. Notes On Blindness (Download, Netflix) Allow YouTube content?

This is a documentary about the writer John Hull, who went blind just before the birth of his son and started to make a diary of audio cassettes. In the film you hear all the actual recording, and it's just incredible. You're immersed in a world of sound, instead of being totally bombarded with visual information. It sounds like it should be a podcast, but it really works as a film - delving into the mind and the body and dreams and memory. I think it's a masterpiece. Bandcamp (Independent music store) I'm Bandcamp all the way, for everything. They do an amazing thing once a month called Bandcamp Friday, where every artist gets 100% of the profit on their merchandise or downloads or CD sales. It's the only place that does that in the music industry. The last thing I bought was a compilation by a wonderful little indie label calledSalmon Universe,external, who put out a lot of ambient, electronic music. I like compilations because you're led to artists from all across the world, from Ohio to Japan. It's amazing. Islands (RTÃ podcast) This is made by the world-renowned sound recordist Chris Watson, who's teamed up with the writer/presenter Luke Clancy to take a journey across the atlas of remote islands, from Ross Island to the Galapagos to the possibly mythical isle of HyBrasil. It's full of stories and sounds, and it's beautiful. I just like the way you can use podcasts to express something emotional, rather than factual. So you get a sense of ethereal escapism within that. Mark has been the BBC's music reporter since 2015, and presented6 Music's History of Video Game Musiclast year. Ted Lasso (Apple TV) Allow YouTube content?

After Schitt's Creek ended, I was desperately searching for a TV show that hit the same sweet spot of belly-laughs and heart-warming humour. This is that show. Starring Jason Sudeikis, it tells the story of an American Football coach who comes to London to oversee a fictional Premiership team, despite knowing nothing about football. Unbeknownst to him, the club's owner (played with delicious relish by Hannah Waddingham) is trying to get the team relegated to spite her adulterous husband. I won't spoil the plot, but the show's relentlessly optimistic tone is just what I needed in lockdown. Pikmin 3 Deluxe (Nintendo) Pikmin isn't as well-known as Nintendo's bigger franchises, like Mario and Zelda, but it's been made with just as much care and attention to detail. You play as a crew of astronauts, stranded on a hostile planet, who have to enlist a crop of plant-like creatures to help them find the missing parts of their spaceship. You command up to 100 of the little Pikmin, each of whom have different abilities (some are fighters, some are swimmers, others are impervious to electricity) to solve a bunch of increasingly tricky puzzles against a time limit. It's simultaneously relaxing and panic-inducing; but I've been focusing on completing the less stressful challenge mode with my 10-year-old, who just likes throwing the Pikmin around and laughing at their cute noises.

Rush-released at the start of the first lockdown, this is still my favourite record of the year. A sweat-glistened hymn to the dancefloor, it never fails to lift my mood. The album is getting the live treatment later this month, with avirtual gig,externalthat's been dubbed Studio 2054 - with Dua promising (deep breath) ""a kaledioscopic, rocket-fuelled, journey through time, space, mirrorballs, roller discos, bucket hats, belting beats, throbbing basslines and an absolute slam-dunk of the best times in global club culture"". See you there. Hotpants optional. The BBC Radio 3 broadcaster presents late-night showUnclassified, which showcases music by composers who might have a classical background but also draw from pop, rock, jazz, and experimental music. Ms Ice Sandwich by Mieko Kawakami (Pushkin Press) The Japanese author'snovella,externalis evocative but breezy, conversational and unsentimental. She's dealing with the difficulties and complexity of human life but in a really relatable, warm and humorous way. It's about the relationship between an adolescent and their mother. It's a coming-of-age tale and about the anxieties of being a teenager, but you get to see it from both sides. You can sense what the mother's feeling as well. She's a fortune teller and their grandma's ill upstairs. It's a family tale about female identity in Japan. Fat Out Fest (YouTube) The annual music festival from Salford-based underground and alternative promoters, Fat Out Fest happened live online this year, and they are now putting setson YouTube,externalevery Friday over the next month. They really do take it to the edge. On 20 November they're broadcasting Lone Taxidermist - her shows are wild. It's performance art as well as music. Her new show Marra starts with her singing along to a cattle market. An actual cattle market. Her voice is synced with the auctioneer and Maxine Peake is in the video. It's out there. Radiophrenia (Streaming) Radiophrenia,externalis a Glasgow sound art radio station that's streaming 24/7 until 22 November. I was listening to an Italian sound artist called Tobia Bandini. He'd interviewed all these people asking for their response to the apocalypse and then he'd mix their stories - they're all in Italian - with electronic soundscapes. If you want to tune out of the news then this is a really nice place to escape to. There's all sorts in there, and a lot of it is just really pleasing and quite hypnotic. The 1Xtra broadcaster started hosting its Drivetime show at the end of September, having joined the station in 2016. Billions (Sky, Amazon Prime) During lockdown I have started an obsession with the TV series Billions already watching three seasons! I think throughout the first lockdown, many of us found new interests and hobbies - for me one of those was trying to learn more about stocks. Billions is pretty much the ideal programme for being more of a nerd around finance! Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

It covers so many different past philosophers as well as different debate topics. It's really nice to just put it on play and binge listen. Aspire (William Morrow) I've started reading Aspire by Kevin Hall - an incredible read! It's very self-helpy (which is very me) but it's such a great read, it focuses on the power of words and how they make a real impact in our lives.

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have wished Prince Charles a very happy birthday on their official social media accounts, as he turns 72. The message, posted on Twitter andInstagram,external, appears alongside a picture of a smiling Charles. Normally, the heir to the throne's birthday is celebrated with gun salutes in Green Park, the Tower of London and in other parts of the country. However, ceremonial gunfire has been suspended amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The prince's birthday comes near the end of an eventful year. In March, he contracted coronavirus and travelled to Scotland to self-isolate for seven days after displaying mild symptoms. At the time, the Duchess of Cornwall tested negative for the virus and self-isolated for 14 days. The Prince of Wales later saidhe ""got away with it quite lightly"".Earlier this month, palace sources told the BBC Prince William had also tested positive for Covid-19 at a similar time to his father.

Prince Charles, who is patron of more than 400 organisations, is the eldest son of the Queen. He became heir apparent on the death of his grandfather King George VI, when his mother succeeded to the throne in 1952 - when he was just three years old. He took the title, the Prince of Wales, in July 1958 when he was nine. Prince Charles, eldest son of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, was born at Buckingham Palace on 14 November, 1948 Now 72, Prince Charles is grandfather to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's three children - George, Charlotte and Louis, as well as Archie, the young son of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who live in California.

"Yorke Beach, near Stanley, has been closed since the 1982 Falklands conflict Falkland Islanders have been celebrating the day their beaches and coves have been declared free of landmines - after almost 40 years. The British overseas territory was peppered with an estimated 13,000 mines by Argentine forcesin the 1982 conflict. On hand for the mine-free declaration day was Welsh-born doctor Barry Elsby. He is one of the islanders who has never walked on the last beach to be cleared, Yorke Beach near Stanley. He moved to the Falklands with his wife for a two-year medical contract in 1990, and never left. He is now one of the islands' eight members of the legislative assembly governing the 2,500 population. ""I have friends who were born here after the 1982 conflict, and have never been able to stroll along this beach,"" he said. ""We are looking forward to reclaiming the beach by blowing up the last mines. ""This will be another good bit of closure for people who were here when the invasion happened and lived through the horrors of that time. It was only supposed to be a two year posting to the Falkland Islands for Dr Elsby Penguins and islands' landmines Pebbles and penguins: The island up for sale Listen: Feeding the Falklands - The Food Programme ""All the mine signposts were a constant reminder of what happened but now they are all away, it's another return to normality. ""It is a very welcome development and I don't think anyone ever thought this would come about."" A programme to remove the mines has been under way since 2009 as part of the UK's obligations under theinternational anti-personnel mine ban convention,external. This video can not be played Islanders will celebrate by playing cricket on beaches which were previously out of bounds ""We never thought the islands would be completely mine free, so this is a momentous change,"" added Dr Elsby. ""More importantly, no-one has been seriously harmed doing this. It speaks volumes for the teams that have been responsible for doing this over so many years."" It also speaks volumes for the islanders, according to the doctor, and gives an insight into why he was happy to swap his former childhood home of Garden City in Flintshire, north Wales, for somewhere like the Falklands. ""We had clear plans when we came here in 1990 - we had no intention of staying,"" he said. ""But we were captivated, not just by the beauty, but also by the way of life and friendliness of the community."" 255 British servicemen died in the 1982 conflict The son of a crane driver in the Shotton steelworks, his links with Wales remain strong despite being almost 8,000 miles (12,735km) away. ""For the last eight years, I have been laying wreaths at Fitzroywhere so many Welsh Guards died and were injured, so I think those links will remain forever,"" he said. It has been a long process across four decades to rid the islands of mines The UK minister with responsibility for the Falklands, Wendy Morton said the final de-mining exercise on Saturday was a ""significant achievement"" for the Falklands and its population. ""We must pay tribute to the brilliant team of deminers who made a long-term commitment to this programme and put their lives at risk day-to-day, removing and destroying landmines to make the Falklands safe,"" she said. ""Our commitment to ridding the world of fatal landmines does not end with our territories being mine free.

"Joe Biden, who campaigned in Georgia in October, is the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since 1992 US President-elect Joe Biden has won the state of Georgia, the BBC projects, the first Democratic candidate to do so since 1992. The win solidifies Mr Biden's victory, giving him a total of 306 votes in the electoral college, the system the US uses to choose its president. President Donald Trump is projected to win North Carolina, reaching 232 votes. Mr Trump, who has not yet conceded, alluded for the first time to a possible new administration in January. Looking subdued, the president stopped short of acknowledging his defeat during a briefing of his coronavirus task force at the White House. These were his first public comments on the election since his defeat was projected by US media. As the country faces growing outbreaks of Covid-19,Mr Trump said he would not impose a lockdown to fight the virus, adding: ""Whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell."" US Election results in full The 'dead voters' who are still alive Biden has won: What happens now? How will this endless US election end? The president, who did not mention Mr Biden by name, did not take questions from reporters. Pressure is growing on Mr Trump, a Republican, to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory and help prepare the transition from one administration to another. This video can not be played President Trump: ""Who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell"" The results in Georgia and North Carolina were the last to be projected in the race for the White House. Mr Biden's electoral votes equal the tally Mr Trump achieved in his victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. At the time Mr Trump referred to it as ""a landslide"". President Trump has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and levelled unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud. But his efforts suffered three setbacks on Friday: In Arizona, his team dropped a lawsuit seeking a review of ballots cast on Election Day after it became clear his rival's lead was unassailable. The challenge was based on a claim that some legal votes had been rejected In Michigan, a judge rejected a request by two Republican poll watchers - who had alleged fraud in Wayne County - to block the certification of election results in Detroit In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign's requests to invalidate several batches of mail-in ballots were rejected A manual recount is to be carried out in Georgia because of the narrow margin between the two candidates, but the Biden team said they did not expect it to change the results there. Joe Biden did not have to win Georgia or Arizona to secure the White House. His recapturing of the ""blue wall"" northern industrial states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by themselves assured his victory. The former vice-president's success in these Sun Belt states - the first time a Democrat has won either in decades - suggests, however, that Democrats may be clearing a new path to presidential success in future elections. If so, it would make Democrats less dependent on the kind of non-college-educated white voters in those northern battlegrounds that, given Donald Trump's appeal, may be trending toward the Republicans. It was educated suburban voters, as well as traditionally Democratic ethnic minorities, that delivered Georgia and Arizona to Mr Biden. It is not all good news for the Democrats, however. Donald Trump did win North Carolina - another southern swing state - even though it was carried by Barack Obama in 2008. The electoral map is shifting, and the parties will have to adjust their strategies accordingly. In the meantime, Georgia - which has two January run-off elections that will decide control of the US Senate - will take centre stage in the months ahead.  Joe Biden's narrow victory there all but assures it will be a hotly contested battle. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the transition process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. Meanwhile, the Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki said this lack of access could affect Mr Biden's ability to govern. ""You need real-time information to deal with crises of the moment,"" she said, highlighting the impact of the pandemic. ""It's imperative that our team and our experts have that access"". This video can not be played Obama: Claims of election fraud are ""delegitimising"" democracy Adding his voice to those calls, President Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, said the delay in starting the transition was hurting national security.""It's not a process where you go from zero to 1,000 miles per hour,"",externalhe told Politico. Earlier, a group of more than 150 former national security officials urged the GSA to officially recognise Mr Biden so that they could access ""pressing national security issues"". A small but growing number of Republicans are also backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. The president continues to dispute the election result. A tweet on Saturday questioned the checks on mail-in ballots in Georgia, saying: ""Expose the crime!"" It was the latest in a slew of tweets backing his claims of widespread election fraud, although he has provided no evidence. He also suggested he might join his supporters at a rally planned in Washington on Saturday. On Friday,election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"", the most direct rebuttal from federal and state authorities of the president's claims. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" The statement from the Election Infrastructure Government Co-ordinating Council was released after Mr Trump tweeted that voting software used in 28 states had deleted millions of votes for him, but presented no evidence. The claim appeared to originate from the obscure TV network One America News (OANN) and was flagged by Twitter as disputed. On Friday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News: ""President Trump believes he will be President Trump, have a second term."" What happens now?

"This video can not be played President Trump drove through the protest on his way to his golf course Thousands of supporters of US President Donald Trump turned out in Washington DC to back his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the election. Flag-carrying demonstrators were joined by members of far-right groups including the Proud Boys, some wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests. The largely peaceful demonstration saw some violence later in the evening, as Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed in several skirmishes. Joe Biden won the 3 November election. On Friday, he solidified his victory with a projected win in the state of Georgia - making him the first Democratic candidate to take the state since 1992. He now has 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to choose its president - which far exceeds the 270 threshold to win. US Election results in full The 'dead voters' who are still alive How will this endless US election end? However, Mr Trump has so far refused to concede. He has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and made unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud - but his efforts have so far been unsuccessful. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters think of a Biden presidency? Mr Trump's supporters kicked off the demonstrations at about noon local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday near Freedom Plaza, just east of the White House, and later headed towards the Supreme Court. As well as more mainstream Trump supporters, members of the far-right Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia group were among the marchers. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones addressed the crowd. Who are Proud Boys? Members of far-right, anti-immigrant group Proud Boys marched through downtown Washington Mr Trump's motorcade passed the gathering demonstrators on Saturday morning and did a circuit of nearby Freedom Plaza, but he carried on to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia without addressing the crowds. He laterretweeted video of protesters, posted by White House official Dan Scavino, vowing ""We will WIN!,external"" While the daytime event was largely orderly, Trump supporters clashed with counter-demonstrators in the night. Video footage posted on social media showed fights breaking out. Officials said 20 people had been arrested on a variety of charges, including assault and weapons possession. One stabbing was reported. Two police officers were also injured. At the scene - Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC A gradual stream of pro-Trump supporters made its way towards Freedom Plaza, adorned with T-shirts and carrying placards which read ""Stop the Steal"" and ""Trump 2020"". The demonstrators were also identifiable by their lack of face-masks as many participants rejected measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. In that regard alone, this pro-Trump rally was seen by its critics as reckless and irresponsible. It took place with the United States grappling with some of its worst Covid-19 infection rates since the pandemic began, with more than 180,000 new cases and 1,400 deaths recorded in the country over the past 24 hours. None of that appeared to matter much to the participants who excitedly greeted President Trump's motorcade as it made an impromptu pass around the plaza. They are desperate to see this election result overturned and fully back his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and his refusal to concede. Still, although they may deny it, there is a growing sense of a fight losing its energy and that - like it or not - these supporters will see President-elect Joe Biden in the White House in January. The president continues to dispute the election result. In a slew of tweets on Saturday, he said checks on ballots in Georgia were a ""waste of time"", alleging problems with signatures but without giving evidence. A manual recount is to be carried out in Georgia because of the narrow margin between the two candidates, but this is not expected to change the results there.

"With England in lockdown again, and many others parts of the UK enduring severe restrictions, people are looking to film, books, music, online art, podcasts and more for their cultural kicks. Here, BBC presenters and journalists share their lockdown picks. It's an eclectic list of suggestions for where to look next if you fancy some inspiration. Veteran broadcaster Mark Radcliffe presentsBBC Radio 2's Folk Showand 6 Music's weekend chat and music showRadcliffe and Maconie. The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. I like a courtroom drama, I must say. For people who don't know the Chicago 7, they were students and hippies and anti-Vietnam protesters who picketed at the 1968 Democratic Party Convention and were arrested for inciting riots. If you remember that year, it was a really highly-charged time. Martin Luther King was assassinated in April, and then Bobby Kennedy in June - so this is an extraordinary snapshot of those times. It still has a resonance, particularly in how the one black defendant is treated. In the time of Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd protests, it reminds you that not everything has changed, by a long way. Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart (Picador books) This is set in the time of Thatcherism, and it's a tragic tale of this young lad Shuggie Bain, who is protecting and caring for an alcoholic mother, living in extreme poverty. It's rather Thomas Hardy-esque, in that you know everyone is doomed to disappointment or death, but it feels very real. And like the film, one suspects life hasn't changed very much for a lot of people. The novel is nominated for the Booker Prize, although I don't generally take that as a massive recommendation. I have certainly bought Booker-winning novels and thought they were dreadful. The Queen's Gambit (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Anya Taylor-Joy plays Beth Harman, who's in an orphanage at the beginning of the film, and is intrigued by the janitor who plays chess. He gradually agrees to teach her and it turns out she's an absolute prodigy. It's based on a novel by someone called Walter Tevis but it feels like it ought to be true. It's about the connections you make as an orphan - friendships and connections and adoption. And there's a lot of chess. In fact, we started playing chess at home, inspired by it, and my wife is miles better than me and she can see several moves ahead. We don't play anymore. It got too annoying. The Asian Network presenter has hosted itsbreakfast showsince 2017, having joined the station in 2015 from community radio. Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One, iPlayer) Watching my next door neighbour Clara [Amfo] absolutely bossing it on screen is amazing. I'm a huge fan of BBC One'sStrictly Come Dancinganyway, but seeing Clara shine like a Queen is great. Rooting for her no doubt. And I usually find anything music or dance related to be therapeutic for me. It's fun, an easy watch and it's a great way to wind down. Grab some munchies and sit on the sofa while having your own party. It's perfect. Made In Heaven (Amazon Prime) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

It's more of a drama series, but it's so good and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode. Can't wait to start the second season. Sister Sister (Netflix) And thirdly, I'm watchingSister Sister,external, a 1990s US sitcom about twins Tia and Tamera who were separated at birth and reunite 14 years later. It's brought back my youth. And you can never get enough. If you grew up watching Tia and Tamera, you already know how good it is. If you fancy a giggle, put them on."" DJ Friction has been on the BBC airwaves since 2002, and is now presentingthe Asian Network's evening show. Space videos (YouTube) It's the biggest kind of escapism - forget pandemics, let's talk about 1,000-year journeys to other galaxies. He devours YouTube series by scientists and futuristsJohn Michael Godier,externalandIsaac Arthur,external, who use science fact to examine what might actually be possible beyond Earth. They'll swing between stuff that's happening in our solar system to real mad stuff like, what will the universe look like a trillion years from now? And then they'll break it down using real physics and real science. The Real Housewives of America (Sky, ITV Be, Amazon Prime Video) Allow YouTube content?

I don't watch much TV or reality shows,"" says Friction. ""But I fell into this hole of watchingThe Real Housewives of Atlanta,externalandThe Real Housewives of Potomac,external. It wasn't until the summer that I went, 'Wait a minute, they're the only two reality shows from that franchise that feature black women. Every other show features white women. I'm subconsciously dealing with Black Lives Matter, race and everything that's happening this year via these reality shows. Believe me, I've fallen so deep into them. Anyone who asks a question about the seasons or the episodes, I have the answer. The Beatles Friction has been rediscoveringThe Beatles,externalby listening to all their albums back-to-back again. ""I just got back into it and thought, my God, how did these guys write nearly every genre of music that we're still listening to? And you're telling me they released The White Album and Yellow Submarine and Sgt Pepper within the space of 18 months? It's ridiculous."" Will Gompertz has been arts editor for BBC News since 2009 and before that was a director at the Tate Gallery. What I Love (podcast) I'm loving this podcast, presented by the award-winning theatre director Ian Rickson. It has a simple format: one guest with whom Rickson has worked selects three things he or she loves. Chiwetel Ejiofor included a Michael Kiwanuka song, Kae Tempest picked a book by William Blake. Good listening. Strata: William Smith's Geological Maps (Thames & Hudson) Some books are beautiful, others are enlightening. Strata is both. Packed with exquisite illustrations, it presents the work of William Smith, a 17th Century geologist, who was the first person to comprehensively map the earth beneath our feet. It's the best non-fiction book I've read in a long time. Call My Agent (Netflix) French TV doesn't get that much attention for some reason - but they produce some great programmes. Spiral is the best police procedural on telly, while Call My Agent is the perfect lockdown escape: uptight actor's agents dealing with uptight actors in a Paris office where they end up either bickering or sleeping with each other. Or both. Tres bon! Musician Hannah Peel presents late-nightRadio 3 show Night Tracks, which ranges from classical to contemporary music.

This is a documentary about the writer John Hull, who went blind just before the birth of his son and started to make a diary of audio cassettes. In the film you hear all the actual recording, and it's just incredible. You're immersed in a world of sound, instead of being totally bombarded with visual information. It sounds like it should be a podcast, but it really works as a film - delving into the mind and the body and dreams and memory. I think it's a masterpiece. Bandcamp (Independent music store) I'm Bandcamp all the way, for everything. They do an amazing thing once a month called Bandcamp Friday, where every artist gets 100% of the profit on their merchandise or downloads or CD sales. It's the only place that does that in the music industry. The last thing I bought was a compilation by a wonderful little indie label calledSalmon Universe,external, who put out a lot of ambient, electronic music. I like compilations because you're led to artists from all across the world, from Ohio to Japan. It's amazing. Islands (RTÃ podcast) This is made by the world-renowned sound recordist Chris Watson, who's teamed up with the writer/presenter Luke Clancy to take a journey across the atlas of remote islands, from Ross Island to the Galapagos to the possibly mythical isle of HyBrasil. It's full of stories and sounds, and it's beautiful. I just like the way you can use podcasts to express something emotional, rather than factual. So you get a sense of ethereal escapism within that.

After Schitt's Creek ended, I was desperately searching for a TV show that hit the same sweet spot of belly-laughs and heart-warming humour. This is that show. Starring Jason Sudeikis, it tells the story of an American Football coach who comes to London to oversee a fictional Premiership team, despite knowing nothing about football. Unbeknownst to him, the club's owner (played with delicious relish by Hannah Waddingham) is trying to get the team relegated to spite her adulterous husband. I won't spoil the plot, but the show's relentlessly optimistic tone is just what I needed in lockdown. Pikmin 3 Deluxe (Nintendo) Pikmin isn't as well-known as Nintendo's bigger franchises, like Mario and Zelda, but it's been made with just as much care and attention to detail. You play as a crew of astronauts, stranded on a hostile planet, who have to enlist a crop of plant-like creatures to help them find the missing parts of their spaceship. You command up to 100 of the little Pikmin, each of whom have different abilities (some are fighters, some are swimmers, others are impervious to electricity) to solve a bunch of increasingly tricky puzzles against a time limit. It's simultaneously relaxing and panic-inducing; but I've been focusing on completing the less stressful challenge mode with my 10-year-old, who just likes throwing the Pikmin around and laughing at their cute noises.

Rush-released at the start of the first lockdown, this is still my favourite record of the year. A sweat-glistened hymn to the dancefloor, it never fails to lift my mood. The album is getting the live treatment later this month, with avirtual gig,externalthat's been dubbed Studio 2054 - with Dua promising (deep breath) ""a kaledioscopic, rocket-fuelled, journey through time, space, mirrorballs, roller discos, bucket hats, belting beats, throbbing basslines and an absolute slam-dunk of the best times in global club culture"". See you there. Hotpants optional. The BBC Radio 3 broadcaster presents late-night showUnclassified, which showcases music by composers who might have a classical background but also draw from pop, rock, jazz, and experimental music. Ms Ice Sandwich by Mieko Kawakami (Pushkin Press) The Japanese author'snovella,externalis evocative but breezy, conversational and unsentimental. She's dealing with the difficulties and complexity of human life but in a really relatable, warm and humorous way. It's about the relationship between an adolescent and their mother. It's a coming-of-age tale and about the anxieties of being a teenager, but you get to see it from both sides. You can sense what the mother's feeling as well. She's a fortune teller and their grandma's ill upstairs. It's a family tale about female identity in Japan. Fat Out Fest (YouTube) The annual music festival from Salford-based underground and alternative promoters, Fat Out Fest happened live online this year, and they are now putting setson YouTube,externalevery Friday over the next month. They really do take it to the edge. On 20 November they're broadcasting Lone Taxidermist - her shows are wild. It's performance art as well as music. Her new show Marra starts with her singing along to a cattle market. An actual cattle market. Her voice is synced with the auctioneer and Maxine Peake is in the video. It's out there. Radiophrenia (Streaming) Radiophrenia,externalis a Glasgow sound art radio station that's streaming 24/7 until 22 November. I was listening to an Italian sound artist called Tobia Bandini. He'd interviewed all these people asking for their response to the apocalypse and then he'd mix their stories - they're all in Italian - with electronic soundscapes. If you want to tune out of the news then this is a really nice place to escape to. There's all sorts in there, and a lot of it is just really pleasing and quite hypnotic. The 1Xtra broadcaster started hosting its Drivetime show at the end of September, having joined the station in 2016. Billions (Sky, Amazon Prime) During lockdown I have started an obsession with the TV series Billions already watching three seasons! I think throughout the first lockdown, many of us found new interests and hobbies - for me one of those was trying to learn more about stocks. Billions is pretty much the ideal programme for being more of a nerd around finance! Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Aspire (William Morrow) I've started reading Aspire by Kevin Hall - an incredible read! It's very self-helpy (which is very me) but it's such a great read, it focuses on the power of words and how they make a real impact in our lives.

"Storm Vamco damaged buildings and fishing boats like this one in Quang Binh province A powerful storm pummelled Vietnam on Sunday, injuring at least five people as winds of 90km/h (56mph) uprooted trees and damaged buildings. Storm Vamco hit the Philippines earlier this week, with rescuers urgently searching for thousands of people trapped after catastrophic floods. Thousands in Vietnam were told to evacuate on Saturday and airports and beaches closed. Flooding last month killed at least 100 people in the country. Authorities warned of deadly landslides on Sunday triggered by heavy rains after 650,000 people in coastal areas were moved to higher ground. The storm weakened from Typhoon strength as it travelled westwards from the Philippines but still caused serious destruction in Vietnam. In the Philippines, search and rescue efforts are ongoing for people trapped by floodwaters In the Philippines, International Red Cross rescue teams are searching floodwaters with torches in the Cayagan valley in the island of Luzon where towns and villages are submerged. Some of the thousands of people stranded on rooftops have been rescued. The death toll has risen to at least 67 and dozens remain missing after Vamco hit on Wednesday, just one week after Goni, the most powerful typhoon seen in the country in seven years.

""I am close in prayer to the people of the Philippines who suffer from the destruction and above all from the floods caused by a strong typhoon,"" he told gathered worshippers. Typhoon Goni: 'My five-year-old was swept away' In Vietnam, a series of storms have caused severe flooding in recent weeks andmore than 100 people were killed last monthfollowing heavy rainfall. Vietnam has already been hit by serious flooding in recent weeks About 400,000 homes there have been destroyed or damaged, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The severe weather washed away roads and bridges and destroyed food supplies and crops, it added. ""There has been no respite for more than eight million people living in central Vietnam,"" said Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, Vietnam Red Cross Society President, quoted by AFP news agency. Severe flooding in the Philippines trapped people on rooftops in northeastern Luzon island ""Each time they start rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, they are pummelled by yet another storm.""

"Two attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by al-Qaeda killed hundreds in 1998 Iran has denied a report that a leader of militant group al-Qaeda was killed in its capital Tehran in August. The New York Times newspaper reported that Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, al-Qaeda's second-in-command, was shot dead in the street by Israeli agents following a request from the US. Iran said it had no al-Qaeda ""terrorists"" living in its country. Abdullah is accused of planning the deadly attacks on American embassies in Africa in 1998. Abdullah, who is more commonly known by his alias Abu Muhammad al-Masri, was gunned down along with his daughter by two assassins on a motorbike on 7 August, theNew York Times reports,external, citing anonymous US intelligence officials. The report claimed that Iran had initially sought to cover up Abdullah's death, with Iranian and Lebanese media reports describing the victims of the 7 August shooting as a Lebanese history professor and his daughter. However, Iran's foreign ministry denied the report on Saturday, saying: ""From time to time, Washington and Tel Aviv try to tie Iran to such groups by lying and leaking false information to the media in order to avoid responsibility for the criminal activities of this group and other terrorist groups in the region."" Israel's Channel 12 broadcaster, citing Western intelligence officials, later reported that Abdullah's death was the result of an operation in which ""the interests of Israel and the United States came together"" because he had been ""planning attacks against Israelis and Jews worldwide"". What's happened to al-Qaeda? Africa's Sahel becomes latest al-Qaeda battleground Abdullah was one of the founding members of the jihadist group which has wreaked devastation across the Middle East and parts of Africa and carried out the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. He was accused of being behind the bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people in 1998. He had been in Iran since 2003, initially under house arrest but later living freely, American intelligence officials quoted in the New York Times said. Any link between Iran and al-Qaeda would be highly unusual - the two sides have fought each other in conflicts, and represent the two main and sometimes opposing groups of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while al-Qaeda is a Sunni jihadist group. Abdullah still appears on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list, where a $10 million reward is offered for information leading to his arrest.

"Police asked residents to report the driver of the red Nissan Navara (stock image) if he annoys residents again A driver who repeatedly shouted ""wakey wakey"" from his car in the early hours has been given a police warning. Hampshire Police said it received ""many complaints"" about a man and his passengers shouting ""at the top of their voices"" in the Brockhurst and Elson areas of Gosport. The red Nissan Navara driver was also seen turning off his lights and shouting ""you can't call the police because you can't see us"". The force said: ""How wrong he was."" Residents in Brockhurst Road (pictured) and Elson received unwelcome wake-up calls Resident Karen O'Brien, who runs Brockhurst Cafe, told the BBC at about 01:40 GMT on Tuesday or Wednesday she heard ""somebody on a megaphone shouting wakey wakey"". ""They did it twice and went up and down the road,"" she said. ""It was pretty loud, and it happened a couple of days later and woke my husband up. ""I spoke to my son and he heard it once, but he couldn't actually see anything out the window. Neither could I."" Officers eventually caught up with the 21-year-old driver, from Fareham, and issued him with a warning. The warning means the driver's car can be seized if he gives residents further unwelcome wake-up calls in the next 12 months.

"The US has reported more than 10m cases of coronavirus The US states of Oregon and New Mexico have announced strict measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 as the country faces growing outbreaks of the disease. Officials have ordered most non-essential businesses to close and urged people to limit their social interactions. On Friday, California became the second state to hit one million Covid cases, after Texas. On average, more than 900 people a day are dying with the disease in the US. Daily cases have topped 100,000 for the last 11 days and more than 67,000 people are currently in hospital. The US has seen over 10.7 million cases and 244,000 deaths thus far, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Trump administration struck an optimistic tone on Friday, saying they hope to have two vaccines and two therapeutic treatments for Covid-19 approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks. Dr Moncef Slaoui, head of the administration's vaccine initiative, said 20 million doses could be ready to be distributed in December, and then at least 20 million doses each month after that. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said he would not put the US into lockdown. ""Lockdowns cost lives and they cost a lot of problems. The cure cannot be.... worse than the problem itself and I've said it many times,"" he said. Data shows,externalthat the majority of the country has rising ""community spread"" of the virus - situations where people get the virus without any known contact with a sick person. In recent weeks, the Midwestern US has been the centre of the outbreaks, with cases rising in states like Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois. Oregon Governor Kate Brown announced a two-week ""freeze"", limiting restaurants to take-out and shuttering gyms and recreational facilities from 18 November to 2 December. ""I'm not asking you, I am telling you, to stop your social gatherings ... and your house parties and to limit your social interactions to six and under, not more than one household,"" she said. Meanwhile, New Mexico Governor Lujan Grisham ordered a two-week shutdown of non-essential businesses such as grocery stores, farms, childcare centres, banks, factories and healthcare facilities. California and Texas - which reached the million-case milestone on 10 November - now both have viral caseloads that surpass other countries, including Mexico and Germany. The surges have prompted local officials to hit pause on reopening efforts in several states, and some are re-imposing stay-at-home directives. Eleven counties in California were told to reverse some reopening measures. Southern California is the worst hit part of the state, with substantial outbreaks. In Los Angeles, there are more than 330,000 infections. San Diego, Sacramento and Los Angeles counties are among the areas now on the lowest tier of California's reopening plan. Indoor dining and indoor religious services are prohibited. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health As the state's positivity rate - the percentage of positive tests in the population - is now at 3.6%, California Governor Gavin Newsom urged people to wear masks and distance, saying: ""Your actions could literally save lives."" President-elect Joe Biden also again renewed his call for Americans, ""regardless of where they live or who they voted for"" to ""step up and do their part"" with social distancing, mask wearing and hygiene. ""I understand it's not easy. I know people are tired. But this will not go on forever."" On Friday, it emerged that at least 30 Secret Service officers had contracted the virus in recent weeks, and dozens have been told to quarantine,the Washington Post,externalandNew York Times,externalreported. Many of the individuals had reportedly travelled to events around the US for both Mr Trump and Mr Biden. CBS News reports that 15 states saw the numbers of patients in hospital due to the virus double in the last month. Hospitals have warned that facilities could be overwhelmed if the trends continue. Colder weather has forced people indoors, and experts say pandemic fatigue is also making Americans less cautious. Republican governors inIowa,Ohio, West VirginiaandUtahhave issued mask mandates Ohio'sgovernor has also threatened to shut bars and gyms if the outbreak worsens InMinnesota, bars and restaurants must shut by 22:00 local time WisconsinandNevadaresidents have been asked to stay at home for two weeks to avoid a return to restrictions The Democratic governors ofCalifornia,OregonandWashingtonstate have issued a travel advisory, discouraging non-essential travel and requesting people to quarantine post-travel New Yorkhas ordered bars and restaurants that serve alcohol to close by 22:00 local time; gatherings are limited to 10 people; the city could also close schools on Monday The city ofChicagohas a stay-at-home advisory beginning on Monday, and non-essential businesses must close by 23:00  local time; gatherings are limited to 10 people The city ofDetroithas moved all students to remote learning due to the virus spikes Indianahas halted reopening and limited social gatherings and events Marylandhas ordered restaurants to reduce indoor capacity to 50% US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci told CBS on Friday: ""If we do the things that are simple public health measures, that soaring will level and start to come down. ""You add that to the help of a vaccine, we can turn this around. It is not futile."" Outbreaks in the spring and summer followed US schools' spring breaks and the national Labor Day holiday weekend - and now experts are concerned that as Thanksgiving approaches at the end of the month, the spikes will again worsen. That is the situation playing out across the border in Canada, where people celebrated their Thanksgiving a month ago. The country's top doctors say that the holiday is partly why cities and provinces are now seeing record-high infections. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Is the Covid vaccine safe for me? And other questions Indoor gatherings pose a large risk to spreading the virus, and as the holiday centres around eating together, wearing masks is not feasible. One analysis,externalfrom Georgia Institute of Technology researchers found the risk of having a Covid-positive individual at even a 10-person sized gathering could be close to 100% in the worst-hit parts of the US. Back in October, Dr Fauci cautioned that the ""sacred"" American tradition of gathering together at Thanksgiving ""is a risk"". ""You may have to bite the bullet and sacrifice that social gathering, unless you're pretty certain that the people that you're dealing with are not infected,"" Dr Fauci told CBS News.

"Trade talks between the UK and EU are reaching the ""make or break"" point, the two sides have said, with key differences proving hard to resolve. EU sources said there had been less progress in recent days on outstanding sticking points than they had hoped for and the ""moment of truth"" was nearing. UK sources said there were still ""quite big gaps"" between the sides. Both sides doubted that a draft deal could now be reached in the coming days, as the EU had originally hoped. The two sides are in a race against the clock to settle their future economic partnership in time for it to take effect on 1 January, when the UK will leave the EU's single market and customs union. Gove: EU's 'penny is dropping' on Brexit UK must 'knuckle down' for trade deal - Irish PM Post-Brexit migration and farming rules become law UK sources indicated there had been no breakthrough this week between the UK's negotiator David Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier, with the two ending their discussions in a similar position to how they started them. An EU source familiar with the process said one of their meetings had been ""short and brutal"". The two men are due to meet again in Brussels on Monday ahead of what is shaping up to be a critical week. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the EU would like to reach a draft agreement in the next few days, in time for the leaders of its 27 member countries to discuss it at a virtual conference on Thursday. But she said it was possible that this working deadline would be missed, with a deal now perhaps not being concluded until early December. Unresolved issues include the EU's insistence on a ""level-playing field"" in rules and regulations between British firms and those on the continent, and guarantees to prevent the lowering of standards known as ""non-regression"". Other areas of disagreement surround fishing quotas and legal mechanisms for enforcing any agreement. The UK left the EU on 31 January but is continuing to follow many of the bloc's rules until 31 December, when the 11-month post-Brexit transition period ends. UK ministers had expressed increasing optimism in recent weeks about the state of negotiations with cabinet minister Michael Gove suggesting the ""penny is dropping"" in Brussels over the UK's post-Brexit status as an independent nation. Philip Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU from 2017 to 2019, said the deal on the table was ""relatively thin"" but better than no deal. ""I've always thought a deal was more likely than no deal - but only just,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It still requires compromise on both sides,"" he added. ""It is about the balance of obligations and benefits for both sides and there are some very big decisions still to be made."" If a trade deal is not agreed, the UK will trade with the bloc on World Trade Organisation rules - leading to tariffs being introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs for businesses and consumers. Both sides say they want to avoid this outcome, but the the EU has said it will not do a deal ""at any price"", and Mr Johnson has said the UK will prosper either way. If a deal is agreed, it would need to be signed off by MPs in the UK and parliaments across the EU before the end of the transition period to come into force by 1 January.

"This video can not be played ''We fled from death and murder'' The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated. The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray. Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusationsin a tweet,external. But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians. How Ethiopia's conflict could destabilise its neighbours Marooned by conflict: 'My little brother needs medicine' Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago. But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated. Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead. On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region. On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet. Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days. The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there. On Sunday,in a tweet,external, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"". But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true. By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region. But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed  became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki. Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead. International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan. Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week. Human rights groupAmnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera),externalon Monday. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict Read more about life in Tigray Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms. Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join. This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal. Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea. The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority. Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".  He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.

"Unknown future for Port Talbot's steelworks There has been a call to ""resist dealing in speculation"" over the future of steel production at Tata's plant in Wales. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the firm ""want to make steel in Wales, and that's a good place to be starting this debate from"". It followed an announcement that Tata is looking to sell part of its European arm. About 4,000 people work at its Port Talbot steel making plant. Tata announced on Friday that Swedish firm SSAB had initiated talks over the acquisition of its Netherlands-based operations. The move would separate the UK and Dutch parts of Tata's business, which merged back in 1999, then as British Steel and Koninklijke Hoogovens. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates said the news was""extremely worrying""for Tata's 8,000 workers across the UK. Stephen Kinnock, MP for Port Talbot's Aberavon constituency, said it was ""time for a partnership"" between Tata Steel and the government. He toldBBC Radio Walesthat Tata's decision ""puts the spotlight very firmly on the UK government that has to now step up and provide support to the British steel industry"". He added: ""It is about the UK government now stepping up to the plate and saying 'okay, this is a British business, we need it for decarbonisation, for climate change objectives, we need it to build sovereign capacity after Brexit'."" 'Thousands' of jobs fears over reported Tata plans Tata Steel in government talks amid bailout reports Tom Hoyles, of the GMB Wales union, said public ownership and UK government support ""should be on the table"" if necessary. ""Those are two options we think they should look at,"" he said. ""Port Talbot and steel go together like fish and chips. ""It's not just the jobs that are there that will be affected but supply lines... the smaller businesses and families who live in the town as well who will be worried."" Tata wants to make steel in Wales, says the UK government's Welsh Secretary Simon Hart The UK government has also said it""will continue to work with Tata Steel and other stakeholders""as the company shapes its business strategy for the future. The Welsh Secretary said the UK government and Tata had agreed to ""work together"" to protect the industry. Mr Hart said it was a positive sign that Tata had made a commitment to a ""sustainable steel manufacturing presence"" in Wales. Asked whether the UK government would step in and protect jobs at Tata, he said it needed to see what Tata planned for Port Talbot. He added: ""We stepped in and saved Celsa Steel in Cardiff at the beginning of lockdown. ""We have a good track record in Wales of where the arguments add up, of stepping in and helping. We saved 800 jobs in Cardiff.""

"With England in lockdown again, and many others parts of the UK enduring severe restrictions, people are looking to film, books, music, online art, podcasts and more for their cultural kicks. Here, BBC presenters and journalists share their lockdown picks. It's an eclectic list of suggestions for where to look next if you fancy some inspiration. Veteran broadcaster Mark Radcliffe presentsBBC Radio 2's Folk Showand 6 Music's weekend chat and music showRadcliffe and Maconie. The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. I like a courtroom drama, I must say. For people who don't know the Chicago 7, they were students and hippies and anti-Vietnam protesters who picketed at the 1968 Democratic Party Convention and were arrested for inciting riots. If you remember that year, it was a really highly-charged time. Martin Luther King was assassinated in April, and then Bobby Kennedy in June - so this is an extraordinary snapshot of those times. It still has a resonance, particularly in how the one black defendant is treated. In the time of Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd protests, it reminds you that not everything has changed, by a long way. Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart (Picador books) This is set in the time of Thatcherism, and it's a tragic tale of this young lad Shuggie Bain, who is protecting and caring for an alcoholic mother, living in extreme poverty. It's rather Thomas Hardy-esque, in that you know everyone is doomed to disappointment or death, but it feels very real. And like the film, one suspects life hasn't changed very much for a lot of people. The novel is nominated for the Booker Prize, although I don't generally take that as a massive recommendation. I have certainly bought Booker-winning novels and thought they were dreadful. The Queen's Gambit (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Anya Taylor-Joy plays Beth Harman, who's in an orphanage at the beginning of the film, and is intrigued by the janitor who plays chess. He gradually agrees to teach her and it turns out she's an absolute prodigy. It's based on a novel by someone called Walter Tevis but it feels like it ought to be true. It's about the connections you make as an orphan - friendships and connections and adoption. And there's a lot of chess. In fact, we started playing chess at home, inspired by it, and my wife is miles better than me and she can see several moves ahead. We don't play anymore. It got too annoying. The Asian Network presenter has hosted itsbreakfast showsince 2017, having joined the station in 2015 from community radio. Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One, iPlayer) Watching my next door neighbour Clara [Amfo] absolutely bossing it on screen is amazing. I'm a huge fan of BBC One'sStrictly Come Dancinganyway, but seeing Clara shine like a Queen is great. Rooting for her no doubt. And I usually find anything music or dance related to be therapeutic for me. It's fun, an easy watch and it's a great way to wind down. Grab some munchies and sit on the sofa while having your own party. It's perfect. Made In Heaven (Amazon Prime) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. I've also just finished watching season one ofMade In Heaven,external. A couple of colleagues have been meaning to get me into it and now I'm hooked. It's more of a drama series, but it's so good and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode. Can't wait to start the second season. Sister Sister (Netflix) And thirdly, I'm watchingSister Sister,external, a 1990s US sitcom about twins Tia and Tamera who were separated at birth and reunite 14 years later. It's brought back my youth. And you can never get enough. If you grew up watching Tia and Tamera, you already know how good it is. If you fancy a giggle, put them on."" DJ Friction has been on the BBC airwaves since 2002, and is now presentingthe Asian Network's evening show. Space videos (YouTube) It's the biggest kind of escapism - forget pandemics, let's talk about 1,000-year journeys to other galaxies. He devours YouTube series by scientists and futuristsJohn Michael Godier,externalandIsaac Arthur,external, who use science fact to examine what might actually be possible beyond Earth. They'll swing between stuff that's happening in our solar system to real mad stuff like, what will the universe look like a trillion years from now? And then they'll break it down using real physics and real science. The Real Housewives of America (Sky, ITV Be, Amazon Prime Video) Allow YouTube content?

I don't watch much TV or reality shows,"" says Friction. ""But I fell into this hole of watchingThe Real Housewives of Atlanta,externalandThe Real Housewives of Potomac,external. It wasn't until the summer that I went, 'Wait a minute, they're the only two reality shows from that franchise that feature black women. Every other show features white women. I'm subconsciously dealing with Black Lives Matter, race and everything that's happening this year via these reality shows. Believe me, I've fallen so deep into them. Anyone who asks a question about the seasons or the episodes, I have the answer. The Beatles Friction has been rediscoveringThe Beatles,externalby listening to all their albums back-to-back again. ""I just got back into it and thought, my God, how did these guys write nearly every genre of music that we're still listening to? And you're telling me they released The White Album and Yellow Submarine and Sgt Pepper within the space of 18 months? It's ridiculous."" Will Gompertz has been arts editor for BBC News since 2009 and before that was a director at the Tate Gallery. What I Love (podcast) I'm loving this podcast, presented by the award-winning theatre director Ian Rickson. It has a simple format: one guest with whom Rickson has worked selects three things he or she loves. Chiwetel Ejiofor included a Michael Kiwanuka song, Kae Tempest picked a book by William Blake. Good listening. Strata: William Smith's Geological Maps (Thames & Hudson) Some books are beautiful, others are enlightening. Strata is both. Packed with exquisite illustrations, it presents the work of William Smith, a 17th Century geologist, who was the first person to comprehensively map the earth beneath our feet. It's the best non-fiction book I've read in a long time. Call My Agent (Netflix) French TV doesn't get that much attention for some reason - but they produce some great programmes. Spiral is the best police procedural on telly, while Call My Agent is the perfect lockdown escape: uptight actor's agents dealing with uptight actors in a Paris office where they end up either bickering or sleeping with each other. Or both. Tres bon! Musician Hannah Peel presents late-nightRadio 3 show Night Tracks, which ranges from classical to contemporary music. She was Emmy-nominated last year for her soundtrack forHBO's Games of Thrones: The Last Watch,external. Notes On Blindness (Download, Netflix) Allow YouTube content?

This is a documentary about the writer John Hull, who went blind just before the birth of his son and started to make a diary of audio cassettes. In the film you hear all the actual recording, and it's just incredible. You're immersed in a world of sound, instead of being totally bombarded with visual information. It sounds like it should be a podcast, but it really works as a film - delving into the mind and the body and dreams and memory. I think it's a masterpiece. Bandcamp (Independent music store) I'm Bandcamp all the way, for everything. They do an amazing thing once a month called Bandcamp Friday, where every artist gets 100% of the profit on their merchandise or downloads or CD sales. It's the only place that does that in the music industry. The last thing I bought was a compilation by a wonderful little indie label calledSalmon Universe,external, who put out a lot of ambient, electronic music. I like compilations because you're led to artists from all across the world, from Ohio to Japan. It's amazing. Islands (RTÃ podcast) This is made by the world-renowned sound recordist Chris Watson, who's teamed up with the writer/presenter Luke Clancy to take a journey across the atlas of remote islands, from Ross Island to the Galapagos to the possibly mythical isle of HyBrasil. It's full of stories and sounds, and it's beautiful. I just like the way you can use podcasts to express something emotional, rather than factual. So you get a sense of ethereal escapism within that. Mark has been the BBC's music reporter since 2015, and presented6 Music's History of Video Game Musiclast year. Ted Lasso (Apple TV) Allow YouTube content?

After Schitt's Creek ended, I was desperately searching for a TV show that hit the same sweet spot of belly-laughs and heart-warming humour. This is that show. Starring Jason Sudeikis, it tells the story of an American Football coach who comes to London to oversee a fictional Premiership team, despite knowing nothing about football. Unbeknownst to him, the club's owner (played with delicious relish by Hannah Waddingham) is trying to get the team relegated to spite her adulterous husband. I won't spoil the plot, but the show's relentlessly optimistic tone is just what I needed in lockdown. Pikmin 3 Deluxe (Nintendo) Pikmin isn't as well-known as Nintendo's bigger franchises, like Mario and Zelda, but it's been made with just as much care and attention to detail. You play as a crew of astronauts, stranded on a hostile planet, who have to enlist a crop of plant-like creatures to help them find the missing parts of their spaceship. You command up to 100 of the little Pikmin, each of whom have different abilities (some are fighters, some are swimmers, others are impervious to electricity) to solve a bunch of increasingly tricky puzzles against a time limit. It's simultaneously relaxing and panic-inducing; but I've been focusing on completing the less stressful challenge mode with my 10-year-old, who just likes throwing the Pikmin around and laughing at their cute noises.

Rush-released at the start of the first lockdown, this is still my favourite record of the year. A sweat-glistened hymn to the dancefloor, it never fails to lift my mood. The album is getting the live treatment later this month, with avirtual gig,externalthat's been dubbed Studio 2054 - with Dua promising (deep breath) ""a kaledioscopic, rocket-fuelled, journey through time, space, mirrorballs, roller discos, bucket hats, belting beats, throbbing basslines and an absolute slam-dunk of the best times in global club culture"". See you there. Hotpants optional. The BBC Radio 3 broadcaster presents late-night showUnclassified, which showcases music by composers who might have a classical background but also draw from pop, rock, jazz, and experimental music. Ms Ice Sandwich by Mieko Kawakami (Pushkin Press) The Japanese author'snovella,externalis evocative but breezy, conversational and unsentimental. She's dealing with the difficulties and complexity of human life but in a really relatable, warm and humorous way. It's about the relationship between an adolescent and their mother. It's a coming-of-age tale and about the anxieties of being a teenager, but you get to see it from both sides. You can sense what the mother's feeling as well. She's a fortune teller and their grandma's ill upstairs. It's a family tale about female identity in Japan. Fat Out Fest (YouTube) The annual music festival from Salford-based underground and alternative promoters, Fat Out Fest happened live online this year, and they are now putting setson YouTube,externalevery Friday over the next month. They really do take it to the edge. On 20 November they're broadcasting Lone Taxidermist - her shows are wild. It's performance art as well as music. Her new show Marra starts with her singing along to a cattle market. An actual cattle market. Her voice is synced with the auctioneer and Maxine Peake is in the video. It's out there. Radiophrenia (Streaming) Radiophrenia,externalis a Glasgow sound art radio station that's streaming 24/7 until 22 November. I was listening to an Italian sound artist called Tobia Bandini. He'd interviewed all these people asking for their response to the apocalypse and then he'd mix their stories - they're all in Italian - with electronic soundscapes. If you want to tune out of the news then this is a really nice place to escape to. There's all sorts in there, and a lot of it is just really pleasing and quite hypnotic. The 1Xtra broadcaster started hosting its Drivetime show at the end of September, having joined the station in 2016. Billions (Sky, Amazon Prime) During lockdown I have started an obsession with the TV series Billions already watching three seasons! I think throughout the first lockdown, many of us found new interests and hobbies - for me one of those was trying to learn more about stocks. Billions is pretty much the ideal programme for being more of a nerd around finance! Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

It covers so many different past philosophers as well as different debate topics. It's really nice to just put it on play and binge listen. Aspire (William Morrow) I've started reading Aspire by Kevin Hall - an incredible read! It's very self-helpy (which is very me) but it's such a great read, it focuses on the power of words and how they make a real impact in our lives. I don't think I've sold that book well, but trust me on this one, haha! Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"After the euphoria of a vaccine breakthrough, it did not take long for the virus to provide a reality check. Within days of the news that an effective vaccine may have been found, it was being announced the UK was the first European country to pass the grim milestone of 50,000 deaths. This was quickly followed by a record rise in new caseswith 33,400 reported on Thursday. Both are a clear reminder, if we needed one, that there are many more difficult days to come. So what's in store? Health Secretary Matt Hancock has promised the NHS will be ready to start rolling out the vaccine from 1 December if its passes its final regulatory hurdles. But that doesn't mean the epidemic will be brought to a sudden halt. There is a huge logistical exercise in vaccinating large numbers of people - the UK has bought enough for 20 million people. And don't forget, unlike the flu vaccine, this one requires two doses. Health and care workers along with older age groups will be prioritised. But given it takes a month from the first dose for an individual to get the full protection and the fact there are 12 million over 65s - nine in 10 deaths have been in this age group - winter is likely to be well gone by the time significant numbers are protected. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was unequivocal this week when he said he didn't see the vaccine ""making any difference"" this winter. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths In the meantime infection rates remain high. Despite seeing over 30,000 cases on Thursday, the UK is averaging over 20,000 confirmed infections a day. However, estimates from the government's surveillance run by the Office for National Statisticssuggests the true figure may be double that,external. The situation has left hospitals dangerously close to capacity in the most hard-hit regions. NHS trusts in Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Nottingham and Bradford have all announced the cancellation of non-urgent work to free up beds. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, warns staff are ""exhausted"" and ""traumatised"". If hospital cases keep rising it will quickly begin to affect non-Covid work even more, he says. We were always warned lockdown, which is under way in England, would take time to have an impact. The good news is that cases had started to stabilise before it came in, with strong evidence the regional tiers had begun to have an impact. If the rise in cases on Thursday is a blip - there are suggestions it may be linked to a last bout of socialising before lockdown came in - the expectation is the number of infections will soon start to drop. Friday's figures were 6,000 cases down on the day before, Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Covid Symptom Study, an app which one million people use, believes the crucial R number - the measure of how many people an infected person passes the virus on to on average - is now below one. This would mean the epidemic should start to shrink. But no-one knows exactly what sort of impact lockdown will have. There have been suggestions the number of infections could be reduced by three-quarters. But the early evidence from Wales' 17-day fire-break is that it stemmed the rise in cases rather than significantly shrinking it. There could be a delayed impact and England's lockdown is longer, but clearly nothing is guaranteed. Northern Ireland, meanwhile, has just extended some of its national restrictions because of concern about infection levels. And the problem is that once lockdown is lifted in England, cases are likely to take off again. It is, after all, winter, when respiratory viruses tend to thrive. Does that mean another lockdown in a few months? This is the nagging fear. Ministers are just ""deferring the problem"", says Prof Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases at Edinburgh University, who sits on the government's committee on modelling. Even if we had had the lockdown earlier, as some scientists had argued, we would have already been talking about the next one. Those backing lockdown argued it could be used to fix the test-and-trace system, which identifies close contacts of infected individuals and asks them to isolate. Each nation runs its own tracing service, but all have faced the same problem - such high rates of infection make test-and-trace more difficult and less effective. In England, councils are working hard to set up local teams to support the national system. But most of these are in their infancy and will take some time to bed in. The government has started piloting mass testing in the hope it could be a way of containing the virus given significant numbers of infected people show very mild, or even no, symptoms. The first pilot in Liverpool has been followed by others being set up inmore than 60 local authority areas. Soldiers have been brought in to help with the mass testing programme in Liverpool But some question how effective this approach will be. The rapid tests being used are ""not fit for purpose"" says Prof John Deeks, an expert in testing at Birmingham University. He points to evidence suggesting they may miss up to half of Covid cases. He also says identifying previously undetected cases only works if those that test positive isolate. Evidence on those going through the standard testing process is that they are not always doing this. A need to work and earn money is, understandably, a key issue. This brings us back to vaccination. While the breakthrough is great news, the jury is still out as to how much impact it will have. For example, we don't know how well it works in the elderly, whether it stops people passing it on or simply stops them getting ill or how long immunity lasts. Even with the vaccine the virus is ""not going away"", says Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Sage advisory group. It is, he says, now part of humanity and here to stay. Instead, the most we can hope for is providing some protection to those who are most at risk. The sad reality is that, despite the vaccine breakthrough, we are still going to have to learn to live with Covid this winter - and beyond.

"Fighting broke out after the federal government accused Tigrayan forces of seizing an army base Ethiopia's human rights commission has said it will send a team to investigate reports of mass killings of civilians in the northern Tigray state. The commission, appointed by the government but independent,said it was aware of reports of ""ethnic profiling"",externalbeing undertaken in the area. PM Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre. Its officials have denied involvement. The UN human rights chief warnedthe killings could amount to war crimes. Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera), a town in the South West Zone of Tigray. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia How Ethiopia's conflict could destabilise its neighbours What life is like in Tigray Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict There have been long-standing tensions between Ethiopia's government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. Prime Minister Abiy ordered a military operation against the TPLF earlier this month after he accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops - claims the TPLF also deny. There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray. The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp. The human rights groupAmnesty International, said it had confirmed,externalthat ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"" on 9 November. It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"". This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from. Witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"", Amnesty said. Getting independently verified information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down. Mr Abiy said that fighters backing the TPLF went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra. Some witnesses also said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi. Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"". In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings. It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident. The UN has said thatvital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopiaare at risk because of the conflict there. By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut. There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed. In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped. Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders. On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region. I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy. I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.

"This video can not be played Dominic Cummings leaves Number 10 Dominic Cummings has left Downing Street after internal battles over his role as Boris Johnson's chief adviser. The BBC understands he will continue to work from home, on issues such as mass coronavirus testing, until the middle of December. The prime minister is said to want to ""clear the air and move on"". Mr Cummings has been at the heart of a No 10 power struggle, which has also seen communications director Lee Cain leave. Several Tory MPs have welcomed the pair's departure as a chance for Mr Johnson to make a fresh start. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Cummings' departure from No 10 had been brought forward given the ""upset in the team"" in Downing Street, for which she said it had been a ""difficult week"". 7 highlights of his career What led to Cummings' departure? Dominic Cummings: The campaigner in No 10 She said there had been long-running tensions between different factions in No 10 but this ""slow burning fuse exploded fast when it finally happened"". Mr Cummings and Mr Cain are long-time colleagues, having worked together on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum. When Mr Cain's exit was announced on Wednesday, it prompted rumours that his ally would also step down. In response, Mr Cummings told the BBC ""rumours of me threatening to resign are invented"" but said his ""position hasn't changed"" since he wrote in January that he wanted to make himself ""largely redundant"" by the end of 2020. Pending what is expected to be a wide-ranging shake-up in No 10, Lord Lister - a close ally of Mr Johnson's who served as his deputy when he was London mayor - has been named interim chief of staff, a position which had been vacant. By Nicholas Watt, Newsnight Political Editor The power struggle in Downing Street may have been resolved but the feuding continues. A dramatic day ended with conflicting accounts of the denouement involving Boris Johnson and his departing aides, Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain. Newsnight has been told that relations between the trio ""went off the cliff"" in the early afternoon. The prime minister's team reportedly learnt at around 2.00pm that Mr Cummings' team had described him as indecisive. They also heard of an alleged briefing against the prime minister's partner, Carrie Symonds, who had apparently been uneasy about a plan to promote Lee Cain to chief of staff. Newsnight was told that the prime minister expressed his displeasure during a meeting with Mr Cummings and Mr Cain. He reportedly told then he knew what they were up to and they would have to leave. This account is strongly disputed by Mr Cain and Mr Cummings' side. A source said that Mr Cummings and Mr Cain held a very friendly and warm 45 minute meeting with the prime minister. Mr Johnson reportedly told them: ""I want to get the band back before the next election."" The prime minister then agreed to a request from Mr Cain to sign a pair of boxing gloves, used during the general election, emblazoned with the words: ""Get Brexit Done."" Mr Cummings left the building. But Mr Cain, the outgoing director of communications, remained for a farewell reception in the press office. That was addressed by the prime minister before Mr Cain was ""banged out"" in the style of a traditional newspaper farewell. The prime minister reportedly said that relations remain good with the two aides but that relationships can break up, at which point you no longer live together. He was keen to emphasise there was no ill will, according to this account. Mr Johnson worked with Mr Cummings on the 2016 Vote Leave campaign and hired Mr Cummings to be his senior adviser, when he became prime minister. Six months later the pair's ""Get Brexit Done"" campaign message helped Mr Johnson win a large majority in the general election. Mr Cummings became more of a public figure in the past year and was forced into holding his own news conference at Downing Street in the summer, following controversy over him making a trip to the north of England when non-essential travel was banned at the height of the coronavirus lockdown. He had a notoriously difficult relationship with Conservative MPs, several of whom have welcomed his exit and said it was time for things to be done differently in Downing Street. Lee Cain worked with Dominic Cummings on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum ""Both Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were pretty dismissive of backbenchers and sometimes ministers and secretaries of state, and I don't think that was helpful,"" said former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers. ""I do think it's important that whoever takes over has a different approach."" Sir Bernard Jenkin said it was time to restore ""respect, integrity and trust"" between No 10 and Tory MPs while veteran Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale said it was ""an opportunity to muck out the stables"". Labour said the PM could ""rearrange the deckchairs all he wants... but the responsibility for this government's incompetence still lies firmly at Boris Johnson's door"". ""The fact there is no plan and no focus in the government's response to Covid is entirely down to him,"" a party source said. The prime minister's official spokesman, James Slack, who will replace Mr Cain in the new year, insisted Mr Johnson is not being distracted from the national crisis by the row. ""What the prime minister and the government are focused upon is taking every possible step to get this country through the coronavirus pandemic,"" Mr Slack said. Dominic Cummings, 48, ran the pro-Brexit Vote Leave campaign in the EU referendum and was behind the group's ""take back control"" slogan Prior to the referendum he worked for Iain Duncan Smith when he was Conservative Party leader and Michael Gove at the Department for Education Born in Durham, Mr Cummings went to a state primary school before being privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history A longstanding Eurosceptic, he cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group and once ran a successful campaign to oppose a regionally elected assembly in north-east England At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Dominic Cummings leaves Number 10 The departure of the prime minister's chief adviser Dominic Cummings is a chance to ""reset government"", a senior Tory MP has said. Mr Cummings left Downing Street for the last time on Friday following internal battles about his role. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said Boris Johnson had taken ""decisive action"" in removing his aide. The PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson was not distracted by the row and was ""focused"" on tackling coronavirus. Mr Cummings and director of communications Lee Cain,who resigned on Thursday, will work out their notices at home following tensions within No 10. Mr Davis said Mr Cummings had a ""very confrontational-style"" which had turned people in Downing Street against him. He said: ""Lots of my colleagues are hoping for a new relationship - with more openness and interaction with Parliament - and I am told the cabinet is hoping to get more say, as it were, in events."" 7 highlights of his career What led to Cummings' departure? Dominic Cummings: The campaigner in No 10 Another Conservative MP, Sir Charles Walker, said Tory MPs had felt like they were ""losing"" the prime minister, and there had been an ""iron curtain"" around Mr Johnson which stopped MPs seeing him to raise concerns. He told the BBC the changes in No 10 were a sign of the PM's ""determination to rebuild relationships"" and was a chance to address the ""significant and growing gap"" between Downing Street and the Conservative Party. The departure of Mr Cummings and Mr Cain comes as the government grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, and as trade talks between the UK and the EU on their future relationshipreach a ""make or break"" point. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was ""scandalous"" that in a week when the UK's coronavirus death toll passed 50,000,redundancies rose to a record highand the country was negotiating ""the most significant trade deal for 50 years"", that the ""people in No 10 round the prime minister are arguing and jockeying for position"". Labour said the PM could ""rearrange the deckchairs all he wants... but the responsibility for this government's incompetence still lies firmly at Boris Johnson's door"". ""The fact there is no plan and no focus in the government's response to Covid is entirely down to him,"" a party source said. Mr Cummings had a notoriously difficult relationship with Conservative MPs, some of whom have said it is time for things to be done differently in Downing Street. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smithwrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat Mr Cummings' influence had led to ""a ramshackle operation in the hands of one man"". Lord Gavin Barwell, who was former Prime Minister Theresa May's chief of staff, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was an opportunity for Mr Johnson to rebuild relations with Conservative MPs and ""set a less confrontational and more unifying tone that is maybe more in tune with his natural instincts"". And former Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, said: ""Both Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were pretty dismissive of backbenchers and sometimes ministers and secretaries of state, and I don't think that was helpful."" Lee Cain worked with Dominic Cummings on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum Both Mr Cummings, 48, and Mr Cain, 39, are veterans of the Vote Leave campaign and worked closely with Mr Johnson to deliver the Brexit vote during the 2016 EU referendum. Lord Edward Lister, who was Mr Johnson's chief of staff when he was Mayor of London, will become interim chief of staff pending a wide-ranging shake-up of the prime minister's team. Mr Cain will be replaced by James Slack, who is currently the prime minister's official spokesman. Allies of the two men who've departed Downing Street insist it was entirely amicable, despite the enduring war of words. They may have been eyeing an exit before too long in any case, although it's hard to see that this is how anyone wanted it to happen. But in the end, whether Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were forced out in anger or reluctantly let go doesn't matter too much. The fact is the tussle for control in No 10 had become such a distraction that something needed to give. As many have said, their departure is an opportunity for the prime minister to make a fresh start. So what now? With Downing Street in something of a state of limbo, decisions in the coming days may prove very revealing about the prime minister and his priorities. Mr Cummings prompted controversy this summer after it emerged he made a 260-mile trip from London to County Durham with his family at the height of the UK's first coronavirus lockdown. The adviser later said the journey was intended to secure childcare, but he was mocked for claiming a subsequent outing to the picturesque town of Barnard Castlewas to help test his eyesight. Bronwen Maddox, director of the Institute for Government, said she thought Mr Cummings' departure ""went beyond just this week's events"", pointing to his trip to Barnard Castle which she said had given public trust in the government ""a battering"". ""I think in a way this has been brewing since then and the kind of restlessness amongst Conservative MPs on the backbenches shows how strained some of the government's key relationships have been,"" she said. Jill Rutter, senior research fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, said Mr Cummings had been ""disproportionately influential"" but it was ultimately up to the prime minister who to appoint as his advisers. ""You have to assume that what Dominic Cummings was doing was what the prime minister wanted him to do, up until he didn't which is what appears to have happened yesterday,"" she said. Dominic Cummings left Downing Street with a cardboard box on Friday night Mr Cain is said to have left Downing Street through a discreet exit on Friday evening. But Mr Cummings walked through the black front door of No 10 with a cardboard box and was later seen arriving home with a bottle of champagne. Mr Davis said his exit from Downing Street holding a cardboard box was ""entirely deliberate"" as he wanted to leave an ""image"". Dominic Cummings: How does he now earn a living?

"Waiting for the actual exam results is the fairest way of allocating places, say experts Universities in England are to switch to offering degree places on the basis of actual grades rather than predicted ones, the government has announced. In an interview with BBC Education Editor Branwen Jeffreys, Gavin Williamson said the present system held bright but disadvantaged pupils back. He said he wanted all students to be able to choose the best university they can go to once they know their grades. Universities have just backed such a change following a review. Currently, pupils are offered places from universities ahead of their results, so decisions are based on predictions made by their teachers. Universities may ditch predicted grades on offers University applications could be after A-levels Once A-level, BTEC and other exam results are issued in August, candidates then accept or refuse offers they have received. A consultation will be carried out but it is expected the change to what is known as a post-qualification admissions system will take place before the next general election. The current system relies heavily on predicted grades which puts academically high achieving pupils from poorer areas at a disadvantage. Research this year from University College London,externalfound 23% of pupils from comprehensives were under-predicted by two or more grades, compared to just 11% of grammar and private school pupils. But there are still big questions about how this would work, with universities favouring a system in which students would still apply before exams but receive offers afterwards. Others may push for the more radical option of both applications and offers being made after results, pushing the start of term back to January for first year students. This video can not be played Education Secretary Gavin Williamson: ""I want to smash through these ceilings"" Mr Williamson told the BBC: ""I want all students to look at the grades they've got and then see what is the best university that they can get to, what is the best course they can do. ""I want to smash through these ceilings that are preventing them from meeting their full potential."" He said pupils from less-affluent, non-traditional backgrounds often did not have to the confidence to aim for a highly selective university, and also often lacked advice about how to reach such goals. The move comes after years of debate over post-qualification admissions. Numerous academic studies suggest pupils from working class backgrounds, and some ethnic groups, tend to be predicted lower grades by their teachers. The university admissions system was brought into sharp focus in the summer, when exam results were cancelled, leading to thousands of students losing the places they thought they had not qualified for. Universities promised to offer as many places as they could if candidates received the grades they needed after results were re-issued. Mr Williamson said the use of predicted grades limited ""the aspirations of students before they know what they can achieve"". ""We need to radically change a system which breeds low aspiration and unfairness,"" he added. ""We're going to deliver this before next election, we're going to do an extensive consultation. ""But there's a real determination what we've seen in this pandemic, we've seen great challenges that society has had to deal with and as we move out of this pandemic we need to build back better."" Mr Williamson also criticised universities which offer inducements or conditional unconditional offers to some students to lure them on to their courses. ""What we've seen over the last few years is what I describe as a little bit of sharp practice where universities have been offering unconditional offers, more and more and creating incentives, in terms of offering laptops or cash back to those students, and that means those students aren't choosing the  course and the university that is best to meet their future potential. ""We want to move away from that."" The plan has received a warm welcome from vice-chancellors' organisation, Universities UK, who had resolved to move to post qualification admissions following an 18-months review. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: ""The current system is based on inaccurately predicted results and leads to those from less-affluent backgrounds losing out. ""Allowing students to apply after they receive their results will help level the playing field and put a stop to the chaotic clearing scramble."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""Teachers work hard and diligently to provide accurate predicted grades, but it is not an exact science and never can be. He agreed: ""Post-qualification admissions would be better and fairer.""

"With England in lockdown again, and many others parts of the UK enduring severe restrictions, people are looking to film, books, music, online art, podcasts and more for their cultural kicks. Here, BBC presenters and journalists share their lockdown picks. It's an eclectic list of suggestions for where to look next if you fancy some inspiration. Veteran broadcaster Mark Radcliffe presentsBBC Radio 2's Folk Showand 6 Music's weekend chat and music showRadcliffe and Maconie. The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. I like a courtroom drama, I must say. For people who don't know the Chicago 7, they were students and hippies and anti-Vietnam protesters who picketed at the 1968 Democratic Party Convention and were arrested for inciting riots. If you remember that year, it was a really highly-charged time. Martin Luther King was assassinated in April, and then Bobby Kennedy in June - so this is an extraordinary snapshot of those times. It still has a resonance, particularly in how the one black defendant is treated. In the time of Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd protests, it reminds you that not everything has changed, by a long way. Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart (Picador books) This is set in the time of Thatcherism, and it's a tragic tale of this young lad Shuggie Bain, who is protecting and caring for an alcoholic mother, living in extreme poverty. It's rather Thomas Hardy-esque, in that you know everyone is doomed to disappointment or death, but it feels very real. And like the film, one suspects life hasn't changed very much for a lot of people. The novel is nominated for the Booker Prize, although I don't generally take that as a massive recommendation. I have certainly bought Booker-winning novels and thought they were dreadful. The Queen's Gambit (Netflix) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Anya Taylor-Joy plays Beth Harman, who's in an orphanage at the beginning of the film, and is intrigued by the janitor who plays chess. He gradually agrees to teach her and it turns out she's an absolute prodigy. It's based on a novel by someone called Walter Tevis but it feels like it ought to be true. It's about the connections you make as an orphan - friendships and connections and adoption. And there's a lot of chess. In fact, we started playing chess at home, inspired by it, and my wife is miles better than me and she can see several moves ahead. We don't play anymore. It got too annoying. The Asian Network presenter has hosted itsbreakfast showsince 2017, having joined the station in 2015 from community radio. Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One, iPlayer) Watching my next door neighbour Clara [Amfo] absolutely bossing it on screen is amazing. I'm a huge fan of BBC One'sStrictly Come Dancinganyway, but seeing Clara shine like a Queen is great. Rooting for her no doubt. And I usually find anything music or dance related to be therapeutic for me. It's fun, an easy watch and it's a great way to wind down. Grab some munchies and sit on the sofa while having your own party. It's perfect. Made In Heaven (Amazon Prime) Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

I've also just finished watching season one ofMade In Heaven,external. A couple of colleagues have been meaning to get me into it and now I'm hooked. It's more of a drama series, but it's so good and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode. Can't wait to start the second season. Sister Sister (Netflix) And thirdly, I'm watchingSister Sister,external, a 1990s US sitcom about twins Tia and Tamera who were separated at birth and reunite 14 years later. It's brought back my youth. And you can never get enough. If you grew up watching Tia and Tamera, you already know how good it is. If you fancy a giggle, put them on."" DJ Friction has been on the BBC airwaves since 2002, and is now presentingthe Asian Network's evening show. Space videos (YouTube) It's the biggest kind of escapism - forget pandemics, let's talk about 1,000-year journeys to other galaxies. He devours YouTube series by scientists and futuristsJohn Michael Godier,externalandIsaac Arthur,external, who use science fact to examine what might actually be possible beyond Earth. They'll swing between stuff that's happening in our solar system to real mad stuff like, what will the universe look like a trillion years from now? And then they'll break it down using real physics and real science. The Real Housewives of America (Sky, ITV Be, Amazon Prime Video) Allow YouTube content?

I don't watch much TV or reality shows,"" says Friction. ""But I fell into this hole of watchingThe Real Housewives of Atlanta,externalandThe Real Housewives of Potomac,external. It wasn't until the summer that I went, 'Wait a minute, they're the only two reality shows from that franchise that feature black women. Every other show features white women. I'm subconsciously dealing with Black Lives Matter, race and everything that's happening this year via these reality shows. Believe me, I've fallen so deep into them. Anyone who asks a question about the seasons or the episodes, I have the answer. The Beatles Friction has been rediscoveringThe Beatles,externalby listening to all their albums back-to-back again. ""I just got back into it and thought, my God, how did these guys write nearly every genre of music that we're still listening to? And you're telling me they released The White Album and Yellow Submarine and Sgt Pepper within the space of 18 months? It's ridiculous."" Will Gompertz has been arts editor for BBC News since 2009 and before that was a director at the Tate Gallery. What I Love (podcast) I'm loving this podcast, presented by the award-winning theatre director Ian Rickson. It has a simple format: one guest with whom Rickson has worked selects three things he or she loves. Chiwetel Ejiofor included a Michael Kiwanuka song, Kae Tempest picked a book by William Blake. Good listening. Strata: William Smith's Geological Maps (Thames & Hudson) Some books are beautiful, others are enlightening. Strata is both. Packed with exquisite illustrations, it presents the work of William Smith, a 17th Century geologist, who was the first person to comprehensively map the earth beneath our feet. It's the best non-fiction book I've read in a long time. Call My Agent (Netflix) French TV doesn't get that much attention for some reason - but they produce some great programmes. Spiral is the best police procedural on telly, while Call My Agent is the perfect lockdown escape: uptight actor's agents dealing with uptight actors in a Paris office where they end up either bickering or sleeping with each other. Or both. Tres bon! Musician Hannah Peel presents late-nightRadio 3 show Night Tracks, which ranges from classical to contemporary music. She was Emmy-nominated last year for her soundtrack forHBO's Games of Thrones: The Last Watch,external. Notes On Blindness (Download, Netflix) Allow YouTube content?

This is a documentary about the writer John Hull, who went blind just before the birth of his son and started to make a diary of audio cassettes. In the film you hear all the actual recording, and it's just incredible. You're immersed in a world of sound, instead of being totally bombarded with visual information. It sounds like it should be a podcast, but it really works as a film - delving into the mind and the body and dreams and memory. I think it's a masterpiece. Bandcamp (Independent music store) I'm Bandcamp all the way, for everything. They do an amazing thing once a month called Bandcamp Friday, where every artist gets 100% of the profit on their merchandise or downloads or CD sales. It's the only place that does that in the music industry. The last thing I bought was a compilation by a wonderful little indie label calledSalmon Universe,external, who put out a lot of ambient, electronic music. I like compilations because you're led to artists from all across the world, from Ohio to Japan. It's amazing. Islands (RTÃ podcast) This is made by the world-renowned sound recordist Chris Watson, who's teamed up with the writer/presenter Luke Clancy to take a journey across the atlas of remote islands, from Ross Island to the Galapagos to the possibly mythical isle of HyBrasil. It's full of stories and sounds, and it's beautiful. I just like the way you can use podcasts to express something emotional, rather than factual. So you get a sense of ethereal escapism within that. Mark has been the BBC's music reporter since 2015, and presented6 Music's History of Video Game Musiclast year. Ted Lasso (Apple TV) Allow YouTube content?

After Schitt's Creek ended, I was desperately searching for a TV show that hit the same sweet spot of belly-laughs and heart-warming humour. This is that show. Starring Jason Sudeikis, it tells the story of an American Football coach who comes to London to oversee a fictional Premiership team, despite knowing nothing about football. Unbeknownst to him, the club's owner (played with delicious relish by Hannah Waddingham) is trying to get the team relegated to spite her adulterous husband. I won't spoil the plot, but the show's relentlessly optimistic tone is just what I needed in lockdown. Pikmin 3 Deluxe (Nintendo) Pikmin isn't as well-known as Nintendo's bigger franchises, like Mario and Zelda, but it's been made with just as much care and attention to detail. You play as a crew of astronauts, stranded on a hostile planet, who have to enlist a crop of plant-like creatures to help them find the missing parts of their spaceship. You command up to 100 of the little Pikmin, each of whom have different abilities (some are fighters, some are swimmers, others are impervious to electricity) to solve a bunch of increasingly tricky puzzles against a time limit. It's simultaneously relaxing and panic-inducing; but I've been focusing on completing the less stressful challenge mode with my 10-year-old, who just likes throwing the Pikmin around and laughing at their cute noises.

Rush-released at the start of the first lockdown, this is still my favourite record of the year. A sweat-glistened hymn to the dancefloor, it never fails to lift my mood. The album is getting the live treatment later this month, with avirtual gig,externalthat's been dubbed Studio 2054 - with Dua promising (deep breath) ""a kaledioscopic, rocket-fuelled, journey through time, space, mirrorballs, roller discos, bucket hats, belting beats, throbbing basslines and an absolute slam-dunk of the best times in global club culture"". See you there. Hotpants optional. The BBC Radio 3 broadcaster presents late-night showUnclassified, which showcases music by composers who might have a classical background but also draw from pop, rock, jazz, and experimental music. Ms Ice Sandwich by Mieko Kawakami (Pushkin Press) The Japanese author'snovella,externalis evocative but breezy, conversational and unsentimental. She's dealing with the difficulties and complexity of human life but in a really relatable, warm and humorous way. It's about the relationship between an adolescent and their mother. It's a coming-of-age tale and about the anxieties of being a teenager, but you get to see it from both sides. You can sense what the mother's feeling as well. She's a fortune teller and their grandma's ill upstairs. It's a family tale about female identity in Japan. Fat Out Fest (YouTube) The annual music festival from Salford-based underground and alternative promoters, Fat Out Fest happened live online this year, and they are now putting setson YouTube,externalevery Friday over the next month. They really do take it to the edge. On 20 November they're broadcasting Lone Taxidermist - her shows are wild. It's performance art as well as music. Her new show Marra starts with her singing along to a cattle market. An actual cattle market. Her voice is synced with the auctioneer and Maxine Peake is in the video. It's out there. Radiophrenia (Streaming) Radiophrenia,externalis a Glasgow sound art radio station that's streaming 24/7 until 22 November. I was listening to an Italian sound artist called Tobia Bandini. He'd interviewed all these people asking for their response to the apocalypse and then he'd mix their stories - they're all in Italian - with electronic soundscapes. If you want to tune out of the news then this is a really nice place to escape to. There's all sorts in there, and a lot of it is just really pleasing and quite hypnotic. The 1Xtra broadcaster started hosting its Drivetime show at the end of September, having joined the station in 2016. Billions (Sky, Amazon Prime) During lockdown I have started an obsession with the TV series Billions already watching three seasons! I think throughout the first lockdown, many of us found new interests and hobbies - for me one of those was trying to learn more about stocks. Billions is pretty much the ideal programme for being more of a nerd around finance! Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

It covers so many different past philosophers as well as different debate topics. It's really nice to just put it on play and binge listen. Aspire (William Morrow) I've started reading Aspire by Kevin Hall - an incredible read! It's very self-helpy (which is very me) but it's such a great read, it focuses on the power of words and how they make a real impact in our lives.

"The number of school-age children with coronavirus has risen ""significantly"" in the second wave compared with the first, according to the government's scientific advisers. Children are now more likely than adults to be the person bringing a Covid infection into a household. But families with children are at no higher risk of severe illness. The National Education Union (NEU) said it was ""troubled"" by the number of children testing positive. The exact role children play in transmitting coronavirus has long been an open question. It's clear young people as a group are at very low risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus themselves. R number for UK has fallen closer to 1 There is also some evidence younger children are less likely to even contract it in the first place. But when it comes to older children, their role in passing on the virus has been much less clear. A review presented to government and published on 13 November outlines the growing evidence older children can catch and transmit Covid-19 at similar rates to adults. From around the time schools reopened in September, a rising number of children have been testing positive for coronavirus, according to the advisory group. But the paper said the extent to which transmission was occurring in schools was ""unproven and difficult to establish"". Two major surveillance studies by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Imperial College London show infections among people aged 16-24 were increasing in September. By October increases could be seen throughout the 2-24-year-old age bracket. There were signs of rising infection in the wider population before schools went back, however. The government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has previously said reopening schools was likely to increase transmission of the virus. Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty also acknowledged this, but said trade-offs would have to be made to allow schools to remain open while controlling the virus. The 13 November advisory paper said there were ""significant educational, developmental and mental health harms from schools being closed"". Schoolchildren and young adults have experienced a much faster rise in infections than other age groups in the second wave. Prof Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh said this was ""not surprising given that schools are operating much closer to normality than most other parts of society"". The review made clear it was not possible to separate contacts in school from contacts around school including travelling to and from, and socialising afterwards. UK coronavirus cases up by 27,301 on Friday However, teachers were no more likely to test positive for coronavirus than other workers, according to ONS data. Dr Sarah Lewis, an epidemiologist at the University of Bristol, said this was ""reassuring"" and suggested ""the measures in place to reduce transmission in schools are working"". People living with secondary-school-age children were 8% more likely to catch the virus. Butresearch by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Oxfordfound that people living with under-18s had no increased risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid. The NEU said it was concerned by the ""finding that children aged 12-16 played a 'significantly higher role' in introducing infection into households in the period after schools reopened their doors to all students"". The union suggested this was down to ""the difficulty of social distancing, the absence of face masks inside classrooms, the problems of ventilation, the size of 'bubbles' and the cross mixing on school transport, as well as of secondary pupils mixing outside school"".

"Joe Biden, who campaigned in Georgia in October, is the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since 1992 US President-elect Joe Biden has won the state of Georgia, the BBC projects, the first Democratic candidate to do so since 1992. The win solidifies Mr Biden's victory, giving him a total of 306 votes in the electoral college, the system the US uses to choose its president. President Donald Trump is projected to win North Carolina, reaching 232 votes. Mr Trump, who has not yet conceded, alluded for the first time to a possible new administration in January. Looking subdued, the president stopped short of acknowledging his defeat during a briefing of his coronavirus task force at the White House. These were his first public comments on the election since his defeat was projected by US media. As the country faces growing outbreaks of Covid-19,Mr Trump said he would not impose a lockdown to fight the virus, adding: ""Whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell."" US Election results in full The 'dead voters' who are still alive Biden has won: What happens now? How will this endless US election end? The president, who did not mention Mr Biden by name, did not take questions from reporters. Pressure is growing on Mr Trump, a Republican, to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory and help prepare the transition from one administration to another. This video can not be played President Trump: ""Who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell"" The results in Georgia and North Carolina were the last to be projected in the race for the White House. Mr Biden's electoral votes equal the tally Mr Trump achieved in his victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. At the time Mr Trump referred to it as ""a landslide"". President Trump has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and levelled unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud. But his efforts suffered three setbacks on Friday: In Arizona, his team dropped a lawsuit seeking a review of ballots cast on Election Day after it became clear his rival's lead was unassailable. The challenge was based on a claim that some legal votes had been rejected In Michigan, a judge rejected a request by two Republican poll watchers - who had alleged fraud in Wayne County - to block the certification of election results in Detroit In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign's requests to invalidate several batches of mail-in ballots were rejected A manual recount is to be carried out in Georgia because of the narrow margin between the two candidates, but the Biden team said they did not expect it to change the results there. Joe Biden did not have to win Georgia or Arizona to secure the White House. His recapturing of the ""blue wall"" northern industrial states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by themselves assured his victory. The former vice-president's success in these Sun Belt states - the first time a Democrat has won either in decades - suggests, however, that Democrats may be clearing a new path to presidential success in future elections. If so, it would make Democrats less dependent on the kind of non-college-educated white voters in those northern battlegrounds that, given Donald Trump's appeal, may be trending toward the Republicans. It was educated suburban voters, as well as traditionally Democratic ethnic minorities, that delivered Georgia and Arizona to Mr Biden. It is not all good news for the Democrats, however. Donald Trump did win North Carolina - another southern swing state - even though it was carried by Barack Obama in 2008. The electoral map is shifting, and the parties will have to adjust their strategies accordingly. In the meantime, Georgia - which has two January run-off elections that will decide control of the US Senate - will take centre stage in the months ahead.  Joe Biden's narrow victory there all but assures it will be a hotly contested battle. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the transition process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. Meanwhile, the Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki said this lack of access could affect Mr Biden's ability to govern. ""You need real-time information to deal with crises of the moment,"" she said, highlighting the impact of the pandemic. ""It's imperative that our team and our experts have that access"". This video can not be played Obama: Claims of election fraud are ""delegitimising"" democracy Adding his voice to those calls, President Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, said the delay in starting the transition was hurting national security.""It's not a process where you go from zero to 1,000 miles per hour,"",externalhe told Politico. Earlier, a group of more than 150 former national security officials urged the GSA to officially recognise Mr Biden so that they could access ""pressing national security issues"". A small but growing number of Republicans are also backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. The president continues to dispute the election result. A tweet on Saturday questioned the checks on mail-in ballots in Georgia, saying: ""Expose the crime!"" It was the latest in a slew of tweets backing his claims of widespread election fraud, although he has provided no evidence. He also suggested he might join his supporters at a rally planned in Washington on Saturday. On Friday,election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"", the most direct rebuttal from federal and state authorities of the president's claims. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" The statement from the Election Infrastructure Government Co-ordinating Council was released after Mr Trump tweeted that voting software used in 28 states had deleted millions of votes for him, but presented no evidence. The claim appeared to originate from the obscure TV network One America News (OANN) and was flagged by Twitter as disputed. On Friday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News: ""President Trump believes he will be President Trump, have a second term."" What happens now?

"About 4,000 people are empolyed at the Tata Steel plant in Port Talbot Tata Steel has announced plans to make its UK business, based mainly in Port Talbot, ""self-sustaining"" while selling its Netherlands-based operations. Tata Steel said it planned to sell the European arm of its business and keep the UK business running without financial support from India. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates said the news was ""extremely worrying"" for Tata's 8,000 UK workers. Tata said it was speaking to the UK government about the business's future. The UK government said: ""This is a commercial decision forÂ Tata Steel. We will continue to work withÂ Tata Steel and other stakeholders as the company shapes its business strategy for the future.Â Â ""The UK governmentÂ remains committed to supporting a sustainable, long-term future for steel making in the UK.""Â Tata said it is ""reviewing options"" to make its UK business run without funding support from India The India-based business announced Swedish steel firm SSAB had initiated talks about the acquisition of its business in the Netherlands, including its steelworks at Ijmuiden, north-west of Amsterdam. Tata said it plans to separate the UK and Netherlands arms of the business and ""will pursue separate strategic paths for the Netherlands and UK business in the future"". It added: ""Tata Steel continues its dialogue with the UK government on potential measures to safeguard the long-term future of Tata Steel UK and is also reviewing all options to make the business self-sustaining without the need for any funding support from Tata Steel India in the future."" About half of Tata's 8,000 UK workers are based at Port Talbot, with several other sites around Wales and the rest of the UK. 'Thousands' of jobs fears over reported Tata plans Tata Steel in government talks amid bailout reports T V Narendran, CEO and managing director of Tata, said: ""We are continuing our discussions with the UK government regarding the future strategy of our UK business."" Mr Skates said: ""Today's announcement will be extremely worrying for Tata Steel workers across Wales, their families, local communities and the supply chain, but we know the steel industry has a future in Wales and the UK. ""The first minister and I spoke with Tata today and they said they are determined to find a sustainable future for operations in the UK and to safeguard the 8,000 workforce, most of which are in Wales. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates said the news would be ""extremely worrying"" for steelworkers ""The first minister is seeking urgent talks with the prime minister and I will speak to the secretary of state for BEIS (business, energy and industrial strategy) and the secretary of state for Wales to call for urgent action. ""The industry is now waiting for the UK government to take immediate action to safeguard the sector and protect jobs. Every day they are not at the table is another day lost for workers and for an industry of strategic importance."" Concerns have been issued over Tata's future several times in recent years, withAberavon MP Stephen Kinnock saying in July that a plan to shut off two blast furnaces and replace them with electric arch furnacesraised ""massive questions"" about the future of the industry. He also said the company wouldneed a Â£500m bailout to get through the coronavirus pandemic. David Rees, the Labour MS for Aberavon, said in atweet,external: ""Once again our steelworkers are facing challenging times following this news. Almost five years ago they and their families went through hell as their livelihoods came under threat with the then announcement of a proposed sale of the Tata steel plants in Wales ""Today, those concerns have been resurrected with the announcement that Tata Steel Europe is likely to be split with the Dutch components being sold to Swedish steelmaker SSAB leaving the UK element to stand alone.""

Steel industry analyst Dr Kathryn Ringwald-Wildman said she was ""not surprised"" by Tata's announcement. She said: ""The company has made no secret of the fact it's wanted to offload the European side of the business. ""Previous negotiations have fallen through and we've had the pandemic which has depressed the market. ""It's made things difficult for automotive industry - which is a major steel customer - and there's still uncertainty in the future."" Tony Brady, from the Unite union, said it was ""essential"" that Tata is able to keep trading with the EU after the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. He said: ""Today's news effectively means that Tata's European steel business will now be based solely in the UK. ""With Brexit fast approaching it is essential that Tata's UK steel business is able to continue trading effectively across the European Union. ""This means that it is crucial that the UK comes to a trade agreement with the EU in the coming weeks. The UK government have told us that Brexit will be good for Britain and British jobs, they must deliver on that promise."" Meanwhile, Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community Union, said Tata must now ""reaffirm their commitment to the UK"". He said: ""We will challenge Tata at every turn and rest assured we will protect our members' interests. Should we conclude the separation of Tata Steel UK would place our members' livelihoods at risk then we will vigorously oppose the break-up of the company. ""There is no doubt a sustainable future for Tata Steel UK depends on Tata and the government concluding a deal that will support the transition to low-carbon steelmaking. He added: ""There are many challenges ahead but we know Tata Steel UK can have a bright future. ""We take confidence from the fact our steelworkers are the best in the world. Under the right leadership, given the right tools, and the chance to compete on a level playing field, we back ourselves to compete with the world's best."" The GMB union said it was ""clear"" that ""manufacturers are expecting the UK to plot a different path from our European neighbours"".
