"Sigmar Gabriel is foreign minister in Germany's current, caretaker government A ""smart"" Brexit deal could serve as a model for the EU's future relations with other non-EU states, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel says. Turkey and Ukraine were two states that could benefit from the template, he told Germany's Funke media group. He did not see either joining the EU any time soon, so alternative forms of closer co-operation were needed. The UK's future relationship with the EU, which it is due to leave on 29 March 2019, is still being negotiated. The two sides agreed this month on the three ""divorce"" issues that took up the first phase of negotiations: how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. In June 2016, the UK voted in a referendum to leave the EU after more than four decades of membership. Brexit: All you need to know How to handle Brexit chat at Christmas ""If we can reach a smart agreement with Great Britain that outlines its relations with Europe after Brexit, then that could serve as a model for other countries,"" he said. He foresaw a ""new, closer form of customs union"" with Turkey, provided the situation in that country changed. That would appear to conflict with the UK's aim to leave the EU's customs union as well as its single market. Germany is concerned at Turkey's human rights record under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, particularly the recent arrest of several German-Turkish nationals. ""It's a good sign that several detained Germans have been released,"" Mr Gabriel said, but he added there was still great concern over imprisoned journalist Deniz Yucel. ""The Turks know how important his fate is for us,"" he said. Under a specific customs union agreed in 1995, goods may travel between the two areas without customs restrictions although it excludes unprocessed agricultural products. Turkey's President Erdogan (L) with EU chief Jean Claude Juncker in 2015 Talks on accession, however, have not moved since 2005. Turkey country profile An association agreement currently exists between Ukraine and the EU which fosters political co-operation and trade. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (L) with Mr Juncker last month Ukraine country profile Nobody yet knows but the UK is due to leave both the EU's single market and customs union. Agreement was reached on 8 December to move talks forwardon to a proposed transition period after the UK leaves, and the future relationship. Brexit Secretary David Davis has called for a free-trade deal with no tariffs, like the deal struck between Canada and the EU. But unlike the Canada deal, he also wants financial services included in the tariff-free area. One headache for negotiators is the Irish border and how to maintain the flow of trade between Northern Ireland, which is part the UK, and the Irish Republic, which is in the EU. Mr Gabriel, from Germany's social democrat SPD party, is foreign minister in the caretaker coalition government led by conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel. After the inconclusive German general election in September, when Mr Gabriel's party fared badly, Mrs Merkel failed to form a new coalition without the SPD. The SPD is now preparing for talks with Mrs Merkel on a new coalition. What happens now that a deal's been done?

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people raced into the North Sea off the Norfolk coast Boxing Day dips have attracted thousands of swimmers and spectators around the English coast. Dippers have dashed into the chilly waters off beaches in Northumberland, Tyneside, Wearside and Dorset, among others. Many were fundraising for charity dressed as Father Christmas, nuns, elves, Christmas puddings and turkeys. Sea temperatures were estimated to be about 8.9C (48F) in the north and 11.1C (52F) in the south. Some people braved the sea dressed as Redcarâs famous Lemon Tops Costumes ranged from simple swimming costumes, wetsuits and sports gear to something more... complicated Conditions were ""the roughest they have been for a number of years"" at Tynemouth Longsands, with swim time limited to 10 minutes, according to participants. Run by the North Sea Volunteer Lifeguards, the dip first took place in 1999. Swim veteran Geoff Wade said it was a ""great way to clear your head after the excesses of Christmas"". ""It felt warmer to me but it was my wife's first time and she didn't think the same,"" he said. The Tynemouth dip had a time limit, just in case anyone needed it Some brave Tynemouth dippers didn't even need fancy dress costumes to keep warm RNLI Lifeboat operations manager Dave Cocks said the Redcar dip had had ""as many spectators as we've ever seen"". The weather was ""bright but cold"" and there had been ""lots of young and old doing the dip"", he said. People might run into the water but it's slower work getting out again Jade Thirlwall, who is a member of pop band Little Mix, returned to her home town of South Shields to raise funds for a local charity at the Little Haven beach dip. ""My great-aunty Norma, she passed away last year from pancreatic cancer so it means a lot to me to do what I can,"" she said. Little Mix singer Jade Thirlwall was raising money for local charity Cancer Connections Nearly 200 people dipped at Newbiggin-by-the-Sea on the Northumberland coast, with local lifeboat volunteers and coastguard teams providing safety cover. Just as many spectators watched their efforts from the relative warmth of the beach and promenade. Speed seemed to be the trick at Newbiggin-by-the-Sea Of the annual dips one of the largest, organised by Sunderland Lions Clubs, has been held since 1974.

ITV's highest rated programme was Coronation Street with 4.8 million viewers, making it number seven on the ratings list. The Great British Bake Off on Channel Four was watched by around 2.8 million people. By Lizo Mzimba, entertainment correspondent Coming together to sit and watch the Queen's broadcast is still a traditional part of Christmas for many families, and it is one of the main reasons that year after year the programme (broadcast on multiple channels) comes top of the overnight ratings. Once Christmas catch-up viewing is taken into consideration, it is likely the Queen will be overtaken at the top by another programme. Because with so much choice on 25 December, viewers will often opt to watch some shows live, while saving others to watch later. For example, this year there was a significant overlap between three of TV's most popular programmes - Call the Midwife on BBC One, Coronation Street on ITV and the Great British Bake Off on Channel Four. Overall, figures for some individual shows do seem to be dropping slightly year on year, but that is probably inevitable with the increasing amount of choice available on traditional channels and from on-demand services like Netflix and Amazon.

The Metropolitan Police were called to the scene at 16:50 GMT and cordoned off an area around a smashed glass window at House of Fraser. The police said that a woman received ""non-life threatening injuries"" as a result of a fall. They added there was ""nothing to indicate"" that shots had been fired or a crime committed.

"Universities must protect free speech and ""open minds, not close them"", the universities minister has said in a speech in Birmingham. Jo Johnson said ""no-platforming"", the policy of banning controversial speakers, is stifling debate. From next April, a new regulator - the Office for Students - will have the power to fine universities that fail to uphold free speech. Universities UK has said it will not allow legitimate debate to be stifled. In his speech, Mr Johnson said: ""In universities in America and worryingly in the UK, we have seen examples of groups seeking to stifle those who do not agree with them. NUS 'right to have no-platform policy' Is university free speech under threat? ""We must not allow this to happen. Young people should have the resilience and confidence to challenge controversial opinions and take part in open, frank and rigorous discussions."" ""No-platforming"" is the practice of banning certain groups from taking part in a debate if their views are considered to be offensive or unacceptable. ""Safe space"" policies are intended to protect students from views and language they find offensive, including discrimination. In 2016, nearly two-thirds of university studentsbelieved the National Union of Students was right to have a ""no-platform"" policy. That approach means people or groups on a banned list for holding racist or fascist views are not given a platform to speak on student union premises. The NUS official no-platform list contains six groups including the BNP and Al-Muhajiroun, but individual unions and student groups can decide their own. At Canterbury Christ Church University, an NUS representative refused to share a platform with LGBT activist Peter Tatchell, whom she regarded as having been racist and ""transphobic"". Mr Johnson was speaking at the Limmud Festival, which celebrates Jewish learning and culture. In his speech, Mr Johnson said that the Office for Students will ensure universities promote ""freedom of speech within the law"". Proposals for the new body, which are open for consultation, could see universities being fined, suspended or deregistered, if they do not protect free speech within the law. Allow Twitter content?

Universities UK chief executive Alistair Jarvis said: ""There is already a legal duty on the higher education sector to secure free speech within the law and universities take these responsibilities very seriously."" He added that institutions also had a duty of care to the ""safety of students and staff"". Sir Anthony Seldon, the vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, agrees with Mr Johnson's plan, saying it is a ""duty"" of universities to ""open up dialogue"". But he says it is ""degrading"" that the minister has had to step in. ""The universities themselves autonomously didn't get their eggs in order, so the universities minister is having to tell us what to do,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""I think that really is quite a shame for us, and almost rather degrading that we're in that position."" The study on the ethics of the British Empire is taking place at Christ Church, Oxford Mr Johnson's speech comes as one of the UK's oldest universities has been criticised by academics for a project on the ethics of the British Empire. Up to 60 Oxford University academicshave signed a letter in opposition to ""the agenda"" of the project. The programme is led by Prof Nigel Biggar, who claimed in a recent article inThe Times,,externalthere are aspects of empire Britain can be proud of. A university spokesperson said ""arguments and differing approaches"" are to be expected, and defended Prof Biggar as an ""entirely suitable"" person to lead the ""valid evidence-led academic""  project.

"Lewis Hamilton has apologised for making ""inappropriate"" comments in a video in which he appeared to mock his nephew's princess dress. In an Instagram video, which has since been deleted, the Formula 1 driver says ""boys don't wear princess dresses"". He was criticised on social media for the clip, which was apparently filmed on Christmas Day. The 32-year-old tweeted his ""deepest apologies"", saying he loved that his nephew ""feels free to express himself"". The video, posted on his Instagram story, shows Hamilton speaking to the camera before turning it on his young relative. ""I'm so sad right now. Look at my nephew,"" he says. The camera then shows the boy wearing a pink and purple dress, while holding a toy magic wand. Hamilton asks him: ""Why are you wearing a princess dress? Is this what you got for Christmas?"" The young boy starts laughing as the British racing driver continues: ""Why did you ask for a princess dress for Christmas? Boys don't wear princess dresses."" In response to the video,founder of anti-bullying charity Ditch the Label Liam Hackett tweeted:,external""Disappointing to see somebody with such a huge platform use it to publicly shame and attempt to undermine a small child."" Meanwhile, Imraan Sathar of discrimination support charity Stay Brave UK, called for the driver to be stripped of his MBE. Hamilton later apologised for his behaviour and said it was ""really not acceptable"" to marginalise or stereotype anyone. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Ian Paterson made countless false diagnoses throughout his career Some victims of disgraced surgeon Ian Paterson ""may have been missed"", say survivors' campaigners. The Breast Friends group has called on Paterson's ex-employers Heart of England NHS Foundation (HEFT) and Spire Healthcare to contact all patients. Paterson was found guilty in April of 17 counts of wounding with intent, leaving patients at risk of cancer. HEFT said of Paterson's 1,206 patients that underwent mastectomies, 675 have since died. His employers said they will fully cooperate with a new bid to contact his former patients. Paterson, 60, worked as a consultant at Solihull Hospital from 1998 and carried out ""cleavage sparing mastectomies"". This video can not be played What is cleavage-sparing surgery? Surgeon 'psychopathic like Shipman' 'He took a pound of flesh for money' He was sentenced to 15 years in prison at Nottingham Crown Court in April.This was later increased to 20 years. The Breast Friends group said reviews to date risk missing out victims of Paterson, who underwent general procedures, such as gall bladder removal. ""He was a general surgeon as well as a breast cancer surgeon,"" said Deborah Douglas, one of Paterson's victims. ""For me, the big thing now is how many other people were affected."" This video can not be played Debbie Douglas: ""He has mutilated me"" HEFT said it had not recalled all of Paterson's patients but has reviewed more than 24,000 mastectomy procedure patients' records to see if Paterson was involved. Mrs Douglas, 59, said the new drive to contact patients will add figures from the private sector which will be ""a step forward"". She added hospital bosses will be ""missing a massive trick"" if the pathology of the deceased is not reviewed to uncover the rates of cancer recurrence. But HEFT said a review of deceased patients ""cannot repair any damage that has already been caused"" or provide ""any tangible benefit"" to survivors.

"Sigmar Gabriel is foreign minister in Germany's current, caretaker government A ""smart"" Brexit deal could serve as a model for the EU's future relations with other non-EU states, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel says. Turkey and Ukraine were two states that could benefit from the template, he told Germany's Funke media group. He did not see either joining the EU any time soon, so alternative forms of closer co-operation were needed. The UK's future relationship with the EU, which it is due to leave on 29 March 2019, is still being negotiated. The two sides agreed this month on the three ""divorce"" issues that took up the first phase of negotiations: how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. In June 2016, the UK voted in a referendum to leave the EU after more than four decades of membership. Brexit: All you need to know How to handle Brexit chat at Christmas ""If we can reach a smart agreement with Great Britain that outlines its relations with Europe after Brexit, then that could serve as a model for other countries,"" he said. He foresaw a ""new, closer form of customs union"" with Turkey, provided the situation in that country changed. That would appear to conflict with the UK's aim to leave the EU's customs union as well as its single market. Germany is concerned at Turkey's human rights record under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, particularly the recent arrest of several German-Turkish nationals. ""It's a good sign that several detained Germans have been released,"" Mr Gabriel said, but he added there was still great concern over imprisoned journalist Deniz Yucel. ""The Turks know how important his fate is for us,"" he said. Under a specific customs union agreed in 1995, goods may travel between the two areas without customs restrictions although it excludes unprocessed agricultural products. Turkey's President Erdogan (L) with EU chief Jean Claude Juncker in 2015 Talks on accession, however, have not moved since 2005. Turkey country profile An association agreement currently exists between Ukraine and the EU which fosters political co-operation and trade. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (L) with Mr Juncker last month Ukraine country profile Nobody yet knows but the UK is due to leave both the EU's single market and customs union. Agreement was reached on 8 December to move talks forwardon to a proposed transition period after the UK leaves, and the future relationship. Brexit Secretary David Davis has called for a free-trade deal with no tariffs, like the deal struck between Canada and the EU. But unlike the Canada deal, he also wants financial services included in the tariff-free area. One headache for negotiators is the Irish border and how to maintain the flow of trade between Northern Ireland, which is part the UK, and the Irish Republic, which is in the EU. Mr Gabriel, from Germany's social democrat SPD party, is foreign minister in the caretaker coalition government led by conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel. After the inconclusive German general election in September, when Mr Gabriel's party fared badly, Mrs Merkel failed to form a new coalition without the SPD. The SPD is now preparing for talks with Mrs Merkel on a new coalition. What happens now that a deal's been done?

"A white Christmas in Peebles, in the Scottish Borders It has officially been a white Christmas in the UK for some, with areas of Cumbria and the south of Scotland recording light snowfall. The Met Office confirmed the snowfall in Spadeadam, Cumbria, at about 22:00 GMT. In a tweet, the forecaster added that parts of the south of Scotland were ""also seeing rain turn to snow"". More wintry showers are expected, with the chance of up to 10cm of snow on the highest ground in Scotland. The last officially white Christmas was recorded in 2014, when parts of the Northern Isles in Scotland had some snowfall.

"Fewer people have hit the UK's Boxing Day sales this year as Black Friday discounts and savvy online shoppers lowered turnout. Shop visits dropped by 4.5% up to 5pm compared with last year, according to research group Springboard. Shopping centres and High Streets recorded the biggest declines. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said that although it had expected a downturn, ""the scale of the drop is greater than expected."" She said: ""What we have seen in the last couple of years is a structural shift in the Christmas trading period."" While Black Friday sales have changed the way people shop in the UK, Ms Wehrle said the impact was particularly felt this year, as retailers began discounting a week before 24 November and carried on right up until Christmas. ""The hotspots for Christmas trading around Boxing Day and New Year's Day are dissipating,"" she said. On the upside, Springboard said early indicators pointed to a strong rise in online shopping for the full 24-hour Boxing Day period. It expects internet transactions to surpass last year, when they rose by 6.2%. But Ms Wehrle said that people were increasingly looking online for bargains before they visited a store or deciding to ""click and collect"". As a result of this targeted shopping, there is less window-shopping and fewer spur-of-the-moment purchases. Footfall on UK High Streets fell by 5.8%, while in shopping centres, it tumbled by 4% in the first 17 hours of Boxing Day. Chris Daly, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, said: ""Gone are the days of setting the alarm at 06:00 to be first in line for the Boxing Day sales, something borne out by the footage of quiet shopping centres up and down the country."" However, Hammerson, the property group that owns a number of Britain's largest shopping centres, said that about 600 people were lining up to grab bargains at the retailer Next's store in Birmingham's Bullring. Queues began forming there at half past midnight. Over the long term, Ms Wehrle believes that shopping habits in the UK have changed for good, with people looking for more of a ""leisure experience"" when they hit the stores. ""If people go out to eat, they don't have money to spend in the shops,"" she said.

His employers said they will fully cooperate with a new bid to contact his former patients. Paterson, 60, worked as a consultant at Solihull Hospital from 1998 and carried out ""cleavage sparing mastectomies"". This video can not be played What is cleavage-sparing surgery? Surgeon 'psychopathic like Shipman' 'He took a pound of flesh for money' He was sentenced to 15 years in prison at Nottingham Crown Court in April.This was later increased to 20 years. The Breast Friends group said reviews to date risk missing out victims of Paterson, who underwent general procedures, such as gall bladder removal. ""He was a general surgeon as well as a breast cancer surgeon,"" said Deborah Douglas, one of Paterson's victims. ""For me, the big thing now is how many other people were affected."" This video can not be played Debbie Douglas: ""He has mutilated me"" HEFT said it had not recalled all of Paterson's patients but has reviewed more than 24,000 mastectomy procedure patients' records to see if Paterson was involved. Mrs Douglas, 59, said the new drive to contact patients will add figures from the private sector which will be ""a step forward"". She added hospital bosses will be ""missing a massive trick"" if the pathology of the deceased is not reviewed to uncover the rates of cancer recurrence. But HEFT said a review of deceased patients ""cannot repair any damage that has already been caused"" or provide ""any tangible benefit"" to survivors.

"Universities must protect free speech and ""open minds, not close them"", the universities minister has said in a speech in Birmingham. Jo Johnson said ""no-platforming"", the policy of banning controversial speakers, is stifling debate. From next April, a new regulator - the Office for Students - will have the power to fine universities that fail to uphold free speech. Universities UK has said it will not allow legitimate debate to be stifled. In his speech, Mr Johnson said: ""In universities in America and worryingly in the UK, we have seen examples of groups seeking to stifle those who do not agree with them. NUS 'right to have no-platform policy' Is university free speech under threat? ""We must not allow this to happen. Young people should have the resilience and confidence to challenge controversial opinions and take part in open, frank and rigorous discussions."" ""No-platforming"" is the practice of banning certain groups from taking part in a debate if their views are considered to be offensive or unacceptable. ""Safe space"" policies are intended to protect students from views and language they find offensive, including discrimination.

"Fewer people have hit the UK's Boxing Day sales this year as Black Friday discounts and savvy online shoppers lowered turnout. Shop visits dropped by 4.5% up to 5pm compared with last year, according to research group Springboard. Shopping centres and High Streets recorded the biggest declines. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said that although it had expected a downturn, ""the scale of the drop is greater than expected."" She said: ""What we have seen in the last couple of years is a structural shift in the Christmas trading period."" While Black Friday sales have changed the way people shop in the UK, Ms Wehrle said the impact was particularly felt this year, as retailers began discounting a week before 24 November and carried on right up until Christmas. ""The hotspots for Christmas trading around Boxing Day and New Year's Day are dissipating,"" she said. On the upside, Springboard said early indicators pointed to a strong rise in online shopping for the full 24-hour Boxing Day period. It expects internet transactions to surpass last year, when they rose by 6.2%. But Ms Wehrle said that people were increasingly looking online for bargains before they visited a store or deciding to ""click and collect"". As a result of this targeted shopping, there is less window-shopping and fewer spur-of-the-moment purchases. Footfall on UK High Streets fell by 5.8%, while in shopping centres, it tumbled by 4% in the first 17 hours of Boxing Day. Chris Daly, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, said: ""Gone are the days of setting the alarm at 06:00 to be first in line for the Boxing Day sales, something borne out by the footage of quiet shopping centres up and down the country."" However, Hammerson, the property group that owns a number of Britain's largest shopping centres, said that about 600 people were lining up to grab bargains at the retailer Next's store in Birmingham's Bullring. Queues began forming there at half past midnight. Over the long term, Ms Wehrle believes that shopping habits in the UK have changed for good, with people looking for more of a ""leisure experience"" when they hit the stores. ""If people go out to eat, they don't have money to spend in the shops,"" she said.

"Traditional UK Boxing Day sales will suffer owing to spending on Black Friday and the squeeze on incomes, a survey suggests. The majority of shoppers (56%) who took part in the survey for BBC Radio 4 think Boxing Day sales have lost their appeal. Only a handful said they planned to get up early for a sales bargain. Some 37% of people surveyed expect to spend less this Boxing Day owing to spending on Black Friday. Satwinder (right) and Jyoti Matoo The survey of 1,000 shoppers was carried out for Radio 4's You and Yours by consumer analysts, Savvy Marketing. It found four out of 10 of people made a purchase during the Black Friday sales this year compared with three out of 10 in 2016. Satwinder and Jyoti Matoo from Leeds go shopping together every weekend. They told You and Yours they would not be getting up early to go shopping this time. ""The sales are on every day now. You can buy sale stuff whenever you like. I have queued up before on Boxing Day and I've got some bargains, but this year I'm going to stay in bed,"" said Satwinder. Catherine Shuttleworth, from Savvy Marketing, said: ""The data shows that people spent more money this Black Friday than last year and people can't spend that money twice, so the Boxing Day sales will suffer. ""Shoppers expect things to be discounted because times are tough and family spending isn't as flexible as it has been."" Festive cheer has been in short supply for retailers this season. Consumer spending has fallen for the third month in a row, according to analysis from Visa. The credit card company predicts the UK will see its first fall in overall Christmas spending by consumers since 2012. Ms Shuttleworth said retailers needed to get as many people into their shops as possible. ""If there aren't any deals, shoppers will go elsewhere, so sales are like a drug which retailers can't get off,"" she said. Despite this apparent addiction to discounting, 62% of people surveyed thought that constant sales devalued the brand of a shop. Online retailer Jenny Parker sells 180 different brands through her website. She agreed that year-round sales were detrimental. ""If you look at the brands which are doing well, they don't have blanket discounts. They are strategic about their pricing and when they go into sale,"" she said. The British Retail Consortium said other factors such as the weather, the timing of Christmas Day or the health of consumers' incomes could affect how much was spent during post-Christmas sales. Many more people were shopping online, it added. Rachel Lund, head of retail insight and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""Our data shows that sales of non-food products in the two weeks after Christmas are typically 20% to 30% lower than the average in the weeks leading up to Christmas.""

HMS St Albans monitored the Admiral Gorsdhkov's ""activity in areas of national interest"", it said. The Admiral Gorshkov, a new guided-missile frigate, is still undergoing trials, Russian media report. The Royal Navy says there has been a recent ""upsurge in Russian units transiting UK waters"". Britain also recently warned of a new threat posed by Russia to internet cables under the sea. HMS St Albans was sent on Saturday to ""keep watch on the new Russian warship Admiral Gorshkov as it passed close to UK territorial waters"", the Royal Navy said. The UK Ministry of Defence released photos of the crew on board HMS St Albans The British frigate remained at sea on Monday, monitoring the Russian vessel, and was due to return to Portsmouth on Tuesday. ""I will not hesitate in defending our waters or tolerate any form of aggression,"" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said. ""Britain will never be intimidated when it comes to protecting our country, our people, and our national interests."" In other recent activity involving the two navies: HMS Tyne, a patrol ship, was also called to shadow a Russian intelligence-gathering ship as it sailed through the North Sea and the English Channel on Sunday while a navy helicopter was scrambled to track two other Russian vessels Last January, a British warship and three RAF Typhoons escorted Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov and a number of other ships up the English Channel The Admiral Gorshkov, the first of a new class of multi-role frigates, has still to complete missile tests before entering service with the Russian navy next year, Russian media report. It has reportedly been sailing regularly between the White Sea off Russia's northern coast and the Baltic. Rear Admiral Chris Parry, a former Royal Navy Officer and former Nato commander, describes the deployment of the war ship as ""normal"". He told the BBC: ""She's perfectly entitled to do that under international law. It's demonstrating the right of innocent passage."" Could Russian submarines cut off the internet? How much of a threat does Russia pose? Four facts about undersea cables Reports on the latest interception do not make clear in what direction the Russian ship was heading. Russian warships have used the international waters of the North Sea in recent times to sail to and from the Mediterranean for deployment off Syria. Relations between Britain and Russia have remained tense since Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014.

"Nearly two-thirds (63%) of university students believe the National Union of Students is right to have a ""no platforming"" policy, a survey suggests. The policy means people or groups on a banned list for holding racist or fascist views are not given a platform to speak on student union premises. And 54% of 1,001 students asked thought the policy should be enforced against people who could be found intimidating. The NUS said the policy allowed free speech without intimidation. ComRes interviewed 1,001 UK university students online for the survey, commissioned by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, with data weighted by course year, university type and gender. The NUS official no platform list contains six groups including the BNP and Al-Muhajiroun, but individual unions and student groups can decide their own. Find out more: TheVictoria Derbyshire programmebroadcast a special programme on the issue of no platform on Monday. If you missed it you cancatch up here. The NUS said it was proud of the policy and that the poll results showed students recognised it was important to stand up to racism and fascism. ""In the past, students have been physically harmed and tragically even killed as a result of such organisations coming on to campuses and inciting hatred. That is why no platform was introduced in the first place, to keep students safe in a very real sense,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Our policy does not limit free speech, but acts to defend it by calling out violence, hate speech, bullying and harassment, which allows debate to take place without intimidation. Students' unions are champions of debate on campus, in fact a recent survey showed zero out of 50 students' unions had banned a speaker in the past year."" In recent years, individuals believed to be sexist, transphobic or rape apologists have also been banned from speaking at universities. It is argued these speakers would threaten a ""safe space"", which is described as an accessible environment in which every student feels comfortable, safe and can get involved free from intimidation or judgment. At Canterbury Christ Church University, an NUS rep refused to share a platform with gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, whom she regarded as having been racist and ""transphobic"". Responding to the charge, he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme's debate on no platforming: ""I simply say where is the evidence for that claim? I've asked all my accusers, none of them can provide a single bit of evidence. ""This is what is particularly offensive about some aspects of student politics today - people make false, baseless allegations to try and discredit their opponents."" Feminist writer Julie Bindel was banned from speaking at Manchester University's student union last October as students said her views on transgender people could ""incite hatred towards and exclusion of our trans students"". She told the debate: ""Thirteen years ago I wrote an article which some transgender activists took offence at. Since then it's been like an anti-feminist witch-hunt against me. I am no platformed by a couple of committees within the NUS and I'm constantly described as being like Hitler. It's deeply offensive but we don't have the right not to be offended. ""I don't mind students not inviting me, but other students get really fed up with me not being invited. I get more emails each week from feminist students who want to hear me speak on how to end men's violence.""

"Students at the London School of Economics set up a Free Speech Society in January in response to what they say is increasing censorship on university campuses. Now students are voting on whether the society should be banned. What's behind the row? Universities have long been considered places for debate and for ideas to be challenged, but alongside that they are also meant to be places where minorities of all kinds can feel safe, comfortable and not sidelined in a way they may be elsewhere. These two ideals are currently causing conflict on campuses, fuelled by concepts such as ""safe space"" and ""no platforming"" - used by students with a view to gathering and having discussions without views or opinions that are deemed offensive or threatening. So how can these terms best be defined? Â·No platform asserts that no proscribed person or organisation should be given a platform to speak, nor should a union officer share a platform with them. Â·A safe space is an accessible environment in which every student feels comfortable, safe, and can get involved free from intimidation or judgment. The National Union of Students (NUS) has an official no platform list which includes the BNP and Al-Muhajiroun, but individual unions and student groups can decide their own. Some recent decisions have caused a stir. Feminist writer Julie Bindel was banned from speaking at Manchester University's student union last October asthey said her views,externalon transgender people could ""incite hatred towards and exclusion of our trans students"". Manchester University banned Julie Bindel from speaking last year And at Canterbury Christ Church University, an NUS rep refused to share a platform with gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, whom she regarded as having been racist and ""transphobic"". This decision and others are still being rowed about online -  free speech advocates calling ""censorship"", but others arguing safe spaces allow free speech for those shut down throughout history. Brendan O'Neill is one of those who think this all amounts to censorship - the editor of current affairs magazine Spiked Online held a conference last week on the issue. He first campaigned against no platform while at university two decades ago - then it was only used against racists and Zionists. ""We argued that if you censored these groups, there's nothing to stop the censorious logic from spreading and encapsulating more and more people - and that's exactly what happened. ""When you accept the idea that some thoughts are too dangerous to have in public life, there's nothing to stop other thoughts from being swallowed up."" But NUS president Megan Dunn said: ""It's simply not the case that they are banned or censored, it's just whether they are invited to a students' union to speak or not. This is about students' unions, they're democratic organisations."" The Free Speech Society was started at LSE in January in reaction to incidents including the suspension of the rugby team for handing out sexist leaflets. On Friday, in what they describe as an ironic move, students are voting on whether the society should be banned. Its head, Charlie Parker, believes freedom of expression is being stifled. ""Free speech has always been there to help and protect minorities - if you look at gay rights movements, civil rights movements, feminism, all the great progression under these movements was made possible through the use of freedom of expression,"" he said. But many students argue that safe spaces are in place to make sure all students have a voice. Rayhan Uddin,  Labour Society black and minority ethnic officer at LSE says safe spaces are useful in certain circumstances to allow repressed voices to speak. ""Clearly we have some problems when it comes to structural barriers for certain groups. And if women and ethnic minority students on campuses want to self-organise to help overcome some of the barriers they face, I would say all power to them,"" he said. Megan Dunn of the NUS said it has to listen to students when they find some views threatening The National Union of Students said it has to listen to students when they say they find others' views threatening. ""There have certainly been moments in my education when I have been uncomfortable, my views have been challenged - I think most of us will be able to draw a distinction between times we have been uncomfortable and times we have felt threatened,"" Ms Dunn said. ""Some people would say opinions are threatening to them, and we have to be able to listen to that view as well."" The debate continues but the one thing that everyone I spoke to agreed on is that they want everyone to have a voice at university - they just disagreed about how best to achieve that.

"The Ethics and Empire project is being hosted by the McDonald Centre based at Christ Church college Up to 60 Oxford University academics have signed a letter in opposition to ""the agenda"" of a project assessing the ethics of empire. The programme is led by Prof Nigel Biggar, who claimed in a recent article inThe Times,,externalthere are aspects of empire Britain can be proud of. In a letter, published in The Conversation,external, the academics expressed their ""firm rejection"" of his views. Prof Biggar said none of the academics had raised their concerns in person. The Ethics and Empire project,externalaims to explore ethical questions of empire, which it has argued are not currently explored, because ""most reaches"" of academic discourse believe ""by definition empire is imperialist"" and ""wicked"". It will seek to measure apologies and critiques of empire against historical data from around the world, Prof Biggar said. Prof Nigel Biggar is Regius Professor of moral and pastoral theology at Oxford University The letter's signatories said the ideas and aims of the project are not representative of Oxford scholarship and were ""too simplistic to be taken seriously"". They added they would also not be engaging with the programme because it consists of closed invitation-only seminars. In response, Prof Biggar said ""in the current illiberal climate such discussion is only possible in private"" as ""enemies of free speech and thought would disrupt it"". He added any of the academics would be at liberty to refuse an invitation, but they ""would not close the discussion down"". Common Ground, a student group that aims to examine Oxford's ""colonial past"", has also criticised Prof Biggar and the project. It said the University of Oxford should not ""stand idly"" in the face of his ""apologies for colonialism"". A university spokesperson said ""arguments and differing approaches"" are to be expected, and defended Prof Biggar as an ""entirely suitable"" person to lead the ""valid evidence-led academic""  project Ethics and Empire University of Oxford Oxford company receives Royal Warrant for 'exceptional services' on centenary Comedy gala to return to Oxford for 'unstoppable laughter' with Oxfordshire Mind Oxfordshire independent bakery CLOSING after less than a year trading Celebrity radio producer among those pleading for help to find missing girl Pride organisers pay tribute after RuPaulâs Drag Race star dies at 32 Oxfordshire yellow weather warning extended as country braces for cold weather At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This video can not be played 'No to the pardon!' shouted protesters in the capital Lima Police in Peru have fired tear gas and clashed with thousands of protesters angry at the authorities' decision to pardon ex-President Alberto Fujimori. ""No to the pardon!"" chanted crowds in the capital Lima, during a second day of unrest that began on Christmas Eve. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori on health grounds. Mr Kuczynski acknowledged the anger at his decision but said he could not ""allow Alberto Fujimori to die in prison"". Fujimori, who is serving 25 years for human rights abuses and corruption, was last week moved from jail to hospital. The former president has low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. Protesters tried to march to the hospital where Fujimori was being treated - but were stopped by police Mr Kuczynski denies pardoning Fujimori as part of a deal with his party last week to avoid his own impeachment, for allegedly receiving illegal payments from the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. Two members of President Kuczynski's party in the Peruvian Congress, Vicente Zeballos and Alberto de Belaunde, have resigned in protest at the pardon. Police fought running battles with protesters in Lima Meanwhile, supporters of the man who led Peru from 1990 to 2000 celebrated outside the city hospital where he was being treated. He is admired by some Peruvians for combating Maoist rebels - but his critics considered him a corrupt dictator. On Monday, his son Kenji tweeted a video of himself breaking the news of the pardon to his father in his hospital bed and wishing him a Merry Christmas. Allow Twitter content?

A statement from President Kuczynski's office said he had decided to grant a ""humanitarian pardon to Mr Alberto Fujimori and seven other people in similar condition"", without naming the others. Doctors, the statement added, had ""determined that Mr Fujimori suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable illness and that prison conditions represent a grave risk to his life"". In a following statement, Mr Kuczynski said: ""I am convinced that those of us who consider ourselves democrats cannot allow Alberto Fujimori to die in prison. Justice is not vengeance. All pardons are by nature controversial. There is an important number of Peruvians who are opposed [to the pardon]. ""My decision is especially complex and difficult, but it is my decision. I can not only be the president of those that voted for me, I need to be it for all Peruvians."" The conservative Popular Force (FP) party, led by the former president's daughter Keiko Fujimori, controls Congress and on Thursday tried to impeach President Kuczynski over a corruption scandal. However, her brother Kenji split the FP vote, allowing the president to stay in power and prompting the accusation that Fujimori's release had been promised in exchange. ""To save his own skin he [President Kuczynski] cut a deal with Fujimori's supporters,"" said leftist politician Veronika Mendoza, labelling the president's decision as treason. In 2007, he was sentenced to six years in jail for bribery and abuse of power, but two years later was sentenced to another 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his time in office. He was convicted of authorising killings carried out by death squads. Protests erupted soon after news of the pardon came to light on Sunday, with many demonstrators waving pictures of victims of the counter-insurgency campaign. ""We believe the pardon was carried out in an illegal manner,"" one unnamed protester told Reuters. ""The medical report that supposedly sanctioned this was a fraud. The reality is that this sadly was a political agreement between the Fujimorists and the current government."" Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch in the Americas, tweeted:  ""I regret Fujimori's humanitarian pardon. ""Instead of reaffirming that in a state of law there is no special treatment for anyone, the idea that his liberation was a vulgar political negotiation in exchange for Pedro Pablo Kuczynski maintaining power will remain forever.""

"Traditional UK Boxing Day sales will suffer owing to spending on Black Friday and the squeeze on incomes, a survey suggests. The majority of shoppers (56%) who took part in the survey for BBC Radio 4 think Boxing Day sales have lost their appeal. Only a handful said they planned to get up early for a sales bargain. Some 37% of people surveyed expect to spend less this Boxing Day owing to spending on Black Friday. Satwinder (right) and Jyoti Matoo The survey of 1,000 shoppers was carried out for Radio 4's You and Yours by consumer analysts, Savvy Marketing. It found four out of 10 of people made a purchase during the Black Friday sales this year compared with three out of 10 in 2016. Satwinder and Jyoti Matoo from Leeds go shopping together every weekend. They told You and Yours they would not be getting up early to go shopping this time. ""The sales are on every day now. You can buy sale stuff whenever you like. I have queued up before on Boxing Day and I've got some bargains, but this year I'm going to stay in bed,"" said Satwinder. Catherine Shuttleworth, from Savvy Marketing, said: ""The data shows that people spent more money this Black Friday than last year and people can't spend that money twice, so the Boxing Day sales will suffer. ""Shoppers expect things to be discounted because times are tough and family spending isn't as flexible as it has been."" Festive cheer has been in short supply for retailers this season. Consumer spending has fallen for the third month in a row, according to analysis from Visa. The credit card company predicts the UK will see its first fall in overall Christmas spending by consumers since 2012. Ms Shuttleworth said retailers needed to get as many people into their shops as possible. ""If there aren't any deals, shoppers will go elsewhere, so sales are like a drug which retailers can't get off,"" she said. Despite this apparent addiction to discounting, 62% of people surveyed thought that constant sales devalued the brand of a shop. Online retailer Jenny Parker sells 180 different brands through her website. She agreed that year-round sales were detrimental. ""If you look at the brands which are doing well, they don't have blanket discounts. They are strategic about their pricing and when they go into sale,"" she said. The British Retail Consortium said other factors such as the weather, the timing of Christmas Day or the health of consumers' incomes could affect how much was spent during post-Christmas sales. Many more people were shopping online, it added. Rachel Lund, head of retail insight and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""Our data shows that sales of non-food products in the two weeks after Christmas are typically 20% to 30% lower than the average in the weeks leading up to Christmas.""

HMS St Albans monitored the Admiral Gorsdhkov's ""activity in areas of national interest"", it said. The Admiral Gorshkov, a new guided-missile frigate, is still undergoing trials, Russian media report. The Royal Navy says there has been a recent ""upsurge in Russian units transiting UK waters"". Britain also recently warned of a new threat posed by Russia to internet cables under the sea. HMS St Albans was sent on Saturday to ""keep watch on the new Russian warship Admiral Gorshkov as it passed close to UK territorial waters"", the Royal Navy said. The UK Ministry of Defence released photos of the crew on board HMS St Albans The British frigate remained at sea on Monday, monitoring the Russian vessel, and was due to return to Portsmouth on Tuesday. ""I will not hesitate in defending our waters or tolerate any form of aggression,"" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said. ""Britain will never be intimidated when it comes to protecting our country, our people, and our national interests.""

It has reportedly been sailing regularly between the White Sea off Russia's northern coast and the Baltic.

"This video can not be played What you need to know about Liberia's election Vote counting is under way in Liberia in a run-off presidential election between Vice-President Joseph Boakai and ex-football star George Weah. Mr Weah, 51, won the first round, but did not secure the required 50% of the vote for an outright victory. Legal challenges delayed the vote to replace Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female president. Turnout seems to have been low, but the result is expected to lead to the first smooth transfer of power in 73 years. More than two million people were eligible to cast their ballots in the nation of 4.6 million people, founded by freed US slaves in the 19th Century. The final result is expected later in the week. Mr Weah, the former AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain player, defeated Ms Johnson Sirleaf in the first round in 2005 but lost to her in the subsequent run-off. In the following election's run-off, in 2011, when he ran as a running mate to the opposition candidate, his coalition boycotted the vote, citing irregularities. This time, the mood at the headquarters of Mr Weah's Congress for Democratic Change party is ecstatic, with his supporters predicting victory as unofficial partial results come in. ""We know our result from our war room,"" Eddie Tarawali, a supporter of Mr Weah, told the BBC. Can Liberia's deputy leader succeed his boss? Ex-football star's rags-to-riches tale In contrast, the few people at the offices of Mr Boakai's United Party have long faces, reports BBC Africa's Umaru Fofana from the capital, Monrovia. However, the party's youth leader, Whroway Bryant, said there was ""absolutely"" no doubt that the 73-year-old vice-president was winning. By Alex Duval Smith, BBC News, Monrovia Despite indications of a low turnout, Liberia appears to have created the conditions for one elected president to hand over to another through the ballot box. There's still room for contestation, as the 10 October first round showed. The poll was followed by weeks of legal wrangling that ultimately led to the run-off being delayed. There were two petitions alleging fraud, including one from Mr Boakai. Even as he voted on Tuesday, the vice-president repeated his scepticism about the first round. Mr Weah also hinted that there had been fraud in the first round. Election observer groups will issue their preliminary comments over the next few days and the National Electoral Commission says the result will be confirmed within days. A representative for the opposition Liberty Party, Charles Brumskine, who came third in October's first round, challenged the result, saying it had been marred by ""massive fraud and irregularities"". But earlier this month the Supreme Court ruled that evidence of fraud was insufficient to merit a re-run of the opening round, and the run-off, originally due on 7 November, was announced. Despite a reported low turnout, voters queued outside this polling station in Monrovia Weah supporters had alleged some ballot-rigging, although there was no immediate official confirmation. Mr Weah himself said, after casting his vote, the election had been ""peaceful and good"". Goodluck Jonathan, the former Nigerian president, who is an observer at the election, told the BBC he was certain it would be free and fair despite ""some challenges"". Ms Johnson Sirleaf praised a violence-free electoral process, saying: ""The ballot box has replaced bullets and electoral disputes are settled through the courts"". Christopher Fomunyoh, an election observer from the National Democratic Institute, told the BBC that voting had gone much more smoothly than the first time round. This will be the first time for many generations that Liberians witness a transfer of power from one elected leader to another. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is stepping down after 12 years Ms Sirleaf took office in 2006, after her predecessor, Charles Taylor, was forced out by rebels in 2003, ending a long civil war. Taylor is serving a 50-year prison sentence in the UK for war crimes related to the conflict in neighbouring Sierra Leone.

"Sigmar Gabriel is foreign minister in Germany's current, caretaker government A ""smart"" Brexit deal could serve as a model for the EU's future relations with other non-EU states, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel says. Turkey and Ukraine were two states that could benefit from the template, he told Germany's Funke media group. He did not see either joining the EU any time soon, so alternative forms of closer co-operation were needed. The UK's future relationship with the EU, which it is due to leave on 29 March 2019, is still being negotiated. The two sides agreed this month on the three ""divorce"" issues that took up the first phase of negotiations: how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. In June 2016, the UK voted in a referendum to leave the EU after more than four decades of membership. Brexit: All you need to know How to handle Brexit chat at Christmas ""If we can reach a smart agreement with Great Britain that outlines its relations with Europe after Brexit, then that could serve as a model for other countries,"" he said. He foresaw a ""new, closer form of customs union"" with Turkey, provided the situation in that country changed. That would appear to conflict with the UK's aim to leave the EU's customs union as well as its single market. Germany is concerned at Turkey's human rights record under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, particularly the recent arrest of several German-Turkish nationals. ""It's a good sign that several detained Germans have been released,"" Mr Gabriel said, but he added there was still great concern over imprisoned journalist Deniz Yucel. ""The Turks know how important his fate is for us,"" he said. Under a specific customs union agreed in 1995, goods may travel between the two areas without customs restrictions although it excludes unprocessed agricultural products. Turkey's President Erdogan (L) with EU chief Jean Claude Juncker in 2015 Talks on accession, however, have not moved since 2005. Turkey country profile An association agreement currently exists between Ukraine and the EU which fosters political co-operation and trade. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (L) with Mr Juncker last month Ukraine country profile Nobody yet knows but the UK is due to leave both the EU's single market and customs union. Agreement was reached on 8 December to move talks forwardon to a proposed transition period after the UK leaves, and the future relationship. Brexit Secretary David Davis has called for a free-trade deal with no tariffs, like the deal struck between Canada and the EU. But unlike the Canada deal, he also wants financial services included in the tariff-free area. One headache for negotiators is the Irish border and how to maintain the flow of trade between Northern Ireland, which is part the UK, and the Irish Republic, which is in the EU. Mr Gabriel, from Germany's social democrat SPD party, is foreign minister in the caretaker coalition government led by conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel. After the inconclusive German general election in September, when Mr Gabriel's party fared badly, Mrs Merkel failed to form a new coalition without the SPD. The SPD is now preparing for talks with Mrs Merkel on a new coalition. What happens now that a deal's been done?

"People were earlier evacuated from the Vietnamese province of Ben Tre A tropical storm that was threatening southern Vietnam has weakened and is expected to dissipate within 48 hours. The Weather Prediction Center says Storm Tembin, with wind gusts up to 58mph (93km/h), is 170 miles south-southwest of Ho Chi Minh City, and is moving westward. Nearly a million people were earlier told to prepare for evacuation and some 70,000 were moved from low-lying areas. Tembin killed at least 240 people as it swept through the Philippines. Rescuers are searching for more than 100 people still missing. Bridges and roads on the southern island of Mindanao were destroyed or blocked by landslides, while nearly 1,000 houses were wrecked and many rice fields washed away.

ITV's highest rated programme was Coronation Street with 4.8 million viewers, making it number seven on the ratings list. The Great British Bake Off on Channel Four was watched by around 2.8 million people. By Lizo Mzimba, entertainment correspondent Coming together to sit and watch the Queen's broadcast is still a traditional part of Christmas for many families, and it is one of the main reasons that year after year the programme (broadcast on multiple channels) comes top of the overnight ratings. Once Christmas catch-up viewing is taken into consideration, it is likely the Queen will be overtaken at the top by another programme. Because with so much choice on 25 December, viewers will often opt to watch some shows live, while saving others to watch later. For example, this year there was a significant overlap between three of TV's most popular programmes - Call the Midwife on BBC One, Coronation Street on ITV and the Great British Bake Off on Channel Four. Overall, figures for some individual shows do seem to be dropping slightly year on year, but that is probably inevitable with the increasing amount of choice available on traditional channels and from on-demand services like Netflix and Amazon.

"This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: Best TMS moments from day one of Boxing Day Test Fourth Ashes Test, Melbourne Cricket Ground (day one of five) Australia 244-3 (89 overs):Warner 103, Smith 65* England:Yet to bat Scorecard Australia opener David Warner struck a century as England endured a tough time in the field on the opening day of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Warner dazzled with some fine strokeplay in a one-sided morning session against an England side that looked flattened aftersurrendering the Ashes in Perth. The tourists fought back and Warner could have been dismissed on 99, only for Tom Curran to be denied his maiden Test wicket when replays showed that he had overstepped. Still, Warner was dismissed shortly after reaching three figures and England had an opening when Australia were reduced to 160-3. But, under a cloudless sky and on a flat surface, home captain Steve Smith made an unbeaten half-century to guide Australia to 244-3 in front of a crowd of 88,172. England, already 3-0 down, are looking to avoid a second successive Ashes whitewash down under and third in 11 years. Currently on an eight-match losing streak in Australia, they have never previously lost nine consecutively. After a lacklustre start, the touring pacemen grew into the day but Moeen Ali posed no threat. And, ultimately, Joe Root's men are in urgent need of early wickets on day two to prevent Australia from racking up another huge total. How day one unfolded in the live text TMS Christmas quiz - podcast 'I painted Kevin Pietersen's house' - tales of England's travelling fans The swashbuckling manner in which Warner played during the morning session made run scoring look much easier than it later proved to be and set an ominous tone for England. The left-hander, faced with boundary sweepers on both sides as early as the fourth over of the match, punched through mid-off, cut, and whipped off his pads, all whilst running with urgency. Before his scoring was checked, there was a prospect of a century before lunch, but instead he had to settle for 83 of the 102-0 that Australia reached by the interval. David Warner appeared to exchange words with England's fielders after bringing up his century England, however, got a grip on scoring in the afternoon. Warner saw Cameron Bancroft pinned leg before by Chris Woakes for a painstaking 26 and spent eight overs in the 90s. The tourists' pressure looked to have paid off when Warner, one short of three figures, attempted a pull off Curran and top-edged to Stuart Broad at mid-on. As England celebrated, the big-screen replay of Curran overstepping brought a huge cheer from the home fans that was superseded one ball later when Warner nudged into the leg side and launched a sustained and emotional celebration to mark his 21st Test ton. Curran's error was not too costly, with Warner on 103 when he followed one that James Anderson got to move away, resulting in an edge to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. Tom Curran was awarded his England cap by former bowler Bob Willis After losing the toss in scorching heat and on a surface that initially seemed perfect for batting, England were always in danger of enduring a difficult day. Their new-ball bowling was nothing more than adequate and, as Warner showed his intent to score, the tourists were subdued for large parts of a morning that was barely a contest. To their credit, they improved immeasurably after lunch. The pace attack had the control to bowl to packed off side fields and Australia's scoring slowed on a pitch that increasingly revealed itself to be two-paced. From piling on more than 100 before lunch, Australia could only add 43 for the loss of two wickets in an attritional afternoon session. Curran impressed with seam movement and slower balls and, after tea, Broad ended a personal run of 69 wicketless overs by having Usman Khawaja caught behind. Off-spinner Moeen, though, remains a concern. A doubt on the morning of the match because of a finger injury, his six overs cost 35 runs and forced Root to turn to Dawid Malan's part-time leg-spin. Steve Smith is averaging 164 in the series and is nine short of passing 500 runs For their improvement and endeavour, England have only three wickets and are facing a huge challenge to get back into this match. Their biggest concern is the continuing presence of Smith, who has already made two big hundreds in this series. The skipper has scored a century in each of the past three Boxing Day Tests and has not been dismissed in Melbourne since 2014. Smith shared an unbroken stand of 84 with Marsh, the subject of big Broad lbw appeals from the first two balls that he faced, one of which was unsuccessfully reviewed. The world's number one batsman helped himself to an unflustered, problem-free half-century with the minimum of fuss. There was the occasional boundary through the off side, but scoring mainly came with tucks off the pads. His scores in first-innings in this series are 141 not out, 40, 239 and now an unbeaten 65. Smith saw off three overs with the new ball alongside Marsh, who has 31, and Australia have a platform from which they can bat England out of the game. Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""David Warner was fantastic. England had triggered his mindset into being negative with the way they've bowled this series. He's thought, 'I'll see off Broad and Anderson' and that's affected his game. ""From the first over today, however, Warner came out with more positivity and that's the best way he plays. ""He's a wonderful player to watch when he bats like he did today. ""I've always felt there is something there in this pitch for the bowlers. Go back to 1998 and 2010 when it did plenty on the first day. You don't get too many draws at the MCG. ""I can't see this Test match being a draw either so England are going to have to bat very well in their first innings."" James Anderson took his 100th Ashes wicket on the opening day in Melbourne England seamer James Anderson, speaking to TMS:""It was a long day, we didn't start well or adjust to conditions. It was a flat, slow wicket and we bowled too many bad balls and let them get away. ""But the way we came back in the second session was very impressive. The pace of the pitch didn't help us, but we stuck to our task well and just didn't get the breaks at the end. ""It was not ideal to lose the toss but we were due to lose one. We're still in the game. We need to bowl really well with the new ball tomorrow to get some breakthroughs."" Australia opener David Warner, speaking to BT Sport:""It was a hard fought day. England brought it back in the afternoon and bowled fantastic when the ball reversed but towards the end we got on a bit of a roll and as we have seen over the last couple of years Steve Smith comes in makes it look very easy. On his century:""I am obviously pleased but disappointed I didn't manage to go on. We talk about cashing in but I felt I let myself and the guys down. Credit to Jimmy he bowled fantastic in that spell.""

"This video can not be played What you need to know about Liberia's election Vote counting is under way in Liberia in a run-off presidential election between Vice-President Joseph Boakai and ex-football star George Weah. Mr Weah, 51, won the first round, but did not secure the required 50% of the vote for an outright victory. Legal challenges delayed the vote to replace Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female president. Turnout seems to have been low, but the result is expected to lead to the first smooth transfer of power in 73 years. More than two million people were eligible to cast their ballots in the nation of 4.6 million people, founded by freed US slaves in the 19th Century. The final result is expected later in the week. Mr Weah, the former AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain player, defeated Ms Johnson Sirleaf in the first round in 2005 but lost to her in the subsequent run-off. In the following election's run-off, in 2011, when he ran as a running mate to the opposition candidate, his coalition boycotted the vote, citing irregularities. This time, the mood at the headquarters of Mr Weah's Congress for Democratic Change party is ecstatic, with his supporters predicting victory as unofficial partial results come in. ""We know our result from our war room,"" Eddie Tarawali, a supporter of Mr Weah, told the BBC. Can Liberia's deputy leader succeed his boss?

From piling on more than 100 before lunch, Australia could only add 43 for the loss of two wickets in an attritional afternoon session. Curran impressed with seam movement and slower balls and, after tea, Broad ended a personal run of 69 wicketless overs by having Usman Khawaja caught behind. Off-spinner Moeen, though, remains a concern. A doubt on the morning of the match because of a finger injury, his six overs cost 35 runs and forced Root to turn to Dawid Malan's part-time leg-spin. Steve Smith is averaging 164 in the series and is nine short of passing 500 runs For their improvement and endeavour, England have only three wickets and are facing a huge challenge to get back into this match. Their biggest concern is the continuing presence of Smith, who has already made two big hundreds in this series. The skipper has scored a century in each of the past three Boxing Day Tests and has not been dismissed in Melbourne since 2014. Smith shared an unbroken stand of 84 with Marsh, the subject of big Broad lbw appeals from the first two balls that he faced, one of which was unsuccessfully reviewed. The world's number one batsman helped himself to an unflustered, problem-free half-century with the minimum of fuss. There was the occasional boundary through the off side, but scoring mainly came with tucks off the pads. His scores in first-innings in this series are 141 not out, 40, 239 and now an unbeaten 65. Smith saw off three overs with the new ball alongside Marsh, who has 31, and Australia have a platform from which they can bat England out of the game. Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""David Warner was fantastic. England had triggered his mindset into being negative with the way they've bowled this series. He's thought, 'I'll see off Broad and Anderson' and that's affected his game. ""From the first over today, however, Warner came out with more positivity and that's the best way he plays. ""He's a wonderful player to watch when he bats like he did today. ""I've always felt there is something there in this pitch for the bowlers. Go back to 1998 and 2010 when it did plenty on the first day. You don't get too many draws at the MCG. ""I can't see this Test match being a draw either so England are going to have to bat very well in their first innings."" James Anderson took his 100th Ashes wicket on the opening day in Melbourne England seamer James Anderson, speaking to TMS:""It was a long day, we didn't start well or adjust to conditions. It was a flat, slow wicket and we bowled too many bad balls and let them get away. ""But the way we came back in the second session was very impressive. The pace of the pitch didn't help us, but we stuck to our task well and just didn't get the breaks at the end. ""It was not ideal to lose the toss but we were due to lose one. We're still in the game. We need to bowl really well with the new ball tomorrow to get some breakthroughs."" Australia opener David Warner, speaking to BT Sport:""It was a hard fought day. England brought it back in the afternoon and bowled fantastic when the ball reversed but towards the end we got on a bit of a roll and as we have seen over the last couple of years Steve Smith comes in makes it look very easy. On his century:""I am obviously pleased but disappointed I didn't manage to go on. We talk about cashing in but I felt I let myself and the guys down. Credit to Jimmy he bowled fantastic in that spell.""

"This video can not be played 'No to the pardon!' shouted protesters in the capital Lima Police in Peru have fired tear gas and clashed with thousands of protesters angry at the authorities' decision to pardon ex-President Alberto Fujimori. ""No to the pardon!"" chanted crowds in the capital Lima, during a second day of unrest that began on Christmas Eve. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori on health grounds. Mr Kuczynski acknowledged the anger at his decision but said he could not ""allow Alberto Fujimori to die in prison"". Fujimori, who is serving 25 years for human rights abuses and corruption, was last week moved from jail to hospital. The former president has low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. Protesters tried to march to the hospital where Fujimori was being treated - but were stopped by police Mr Kuczynski denies pardoning Fujimori as part of a deal with his party last week to avoid his own impeachment, for allegedly receiving illegal payments from the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. Two members of President Kuczynski's party in the Peruvian Congress, Vicente Zeballos and Alberto de Belaunde, have resigned in protest at the pardon. Police fought running battles with protesters in Lima Meanwhile, supporters of the man who led Peru from 1990 to 2000 celebrated outside the city hospital where he was being treated. He is admired by some Peruvians for combating Maoist rebels - but his critics considered him a corrupt dictator. On Monday, his son Kenji tweeted a video of himself breaking the news of the pardon to his father in his hospital bed and wishing him a Merry Christmas. Allow Twitter content?

A statement from President Kuczynski's office said he had decided to grant a ""humanitarian pardon to Mr Alberto Fujimori and seven other people in similar condition"", without naming the others. Doctors, the statement added, had ""determined that Mr Fujimori suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable illness and that prison conditions represent a grave risk to his life"". In a following statement, Mr Kuczynski said: ""I am convinced that those of us who consider ourselves democrats cannot allow Alberto Fujimori to die in prison. Justice is not vengeance. All pardons are by nature controversial. There is an important number of Peruvians who are opposed [to the pardon]. ""My decision is especially complex and difficult, but it is my decision. I can not only be the president of those that voted for me, I need to be it for all Peruvians."" The conservative Popular Force (FP) party, led by the former president's daughter Keiko Fujimori, controls Congress and on Thursday tried to impeach President Kuczynski over a corruption scandal. However, her brother Kenji split the FP vote, allowing the president to stay in power and prompting the accusation that Fujimori's release had been promised in exchange. ""To save his own skin he [President Kuczynski] cut a deal with Fujimori's supporters,"" said leftist politician Veronika Mendoza, labelling the president's decision as treason. In 2007, he was sentenced to six years in jail for bribery and abuse of power, but two years later was sentenced to another 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his time in office. He was convicted of authorising killings carried out by death squads. Protests erupted soon after news of the pardon came to light on Sunday, with many demonstrators waving pictures of victims of the counter-insurgency campaign. ""We believe the pardon was carried out in an illegal manner,"" one unnamed protester told Reuters. ""The medical report that supposedly sanctioned this was a fraud. The reality is that this sadly was a political agreement between the Fujimorists and the current government."" Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch in the Americas, tweeted:  ""I regret Fujimori's humanitarian pardon. ""Instead of reaffirming that in a state of law there is no special treatment for anyone, the idea that his liberation was a vulgar political negotiation in exchange for Pedro Pablo Kuczynski maintaining power will remain forever.""

"Students at the London School of Economics set up a Free Speech Society in January in response to what they say is increasing censorship on university campuses. Now students are voting on whether the society should be banned. What's behind the row? Universities have long been considered places for debate and for ideas to be challenged, but alongside that they are also meant to be places where minorities of all kinds can feel safe, comfortable and not sidelined in a way they may be elsewhere. These two ideals are currently causing conflict on campuses, fuelled by concepts such as ""safe space"" and ""no platforming"" - used by students with a view to gathering and having discussions without views or opinions that are deemed offensive or threatening. So how can these terms best be defined? Â·No platform asserts that no proscribed person or organisation should be given a platform to speak, nor should a union officer share a platform with them. Â·A safe space is an accessible environment in which every student feels comfortable, safe, and can get involved free from intimidation or judgment. The National Union of Students (NUS) has an official no platform list which includes the BNP and Al-Muhajiroun, but individual unions and student groups can decide their own. Some recent decisions have caused a stir. Feminist writer Julie Bindel was banned from speaking at Manchester University's student union last October asthey said her views,externalon transgender people could ""incite hatred towards and exclusion of our trans students"". Manchester University banned Julie Bindel from speaking last year And at Canterbury Christ Church University, an NUS rep refused to share a platform with gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, whom she regarded as having been racist and ""transphobic"". This decision and others are still being rowed about online -  free speech advocates calling ""censorship"", but others arguing safe spaces allow free speech for those shut down throughout history. Brendan O'Neill is one of those who think this all amounts to censorship - the editor of current affairs magazine Spiked Online held a conference last week on the issue. He first campaigned against no platform while at university two decades ago - then it was only used against racists and Zionists. ""We argued that if you censored these groups, there's nothing to stop the censorious logic from spreading and encapsulating more and more people - and that's exactly what happened. ""When you accept the idea that some thoughts are too dangerous to have in public life, there's nothing to stop other thoughts from being swallowed up."" But NUS president Megan Dunn said: ""It's simply not the case that they are banned or censored, it's just whether they are invited to a students' union to speak or not. This is about students' unions, they're democratic organisations."" The Free Speech Society was started at LSE in January in reaction to incidents including the suspension of the rugby team for handing out sexist leaflets. On Friday, in what they describe as an ironic move, students are voting on whether the society should be banned. Its head, Charlie Parker, believes freedom of expression is being stifled. ""Free speech has always been there to help and protect minorities - if you look at gay rights movements, civil rights movements, feminism, all the great progression under these movements was made possible through the use of freedom of expression,"" he said. But many students argue that safe spaces are in place to make sure all students have a voice. Rayhan Uddin,  Labour Society black and minority ethnic officer at LSE says safe spaces are useful in certain circumstances to allow repressed voices to speak. ""Clearly we have some problems when it comes to structural barriers for certain groups. And if women and ethnic minority students on campuses want to self-organise to help overcome some of the barriers they face, I would say all power to them,"" he said. Megan Dunn of the NUS said it has to listen to students when they find some views threatening The National Union of Students said it has to listen to students when they say they find others' views threatening. ""There have certainly been moments in my education when I have been uncomfortable, my views have been challenged - I think most of us will be able to draw a distinction between times we have been uncomfortable and times we have felt threatened,"" Ms Dunn said. ""Some people would say opinions are threatening to them, and we have to be able to listen to that view as well."" The debate continues but the one thing that everyone I spoke to agreed on is that they want everyone to have a voice at university - they just disagreed about how best to achieve that.

She walked along in the heart of her new family between her fiance Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. She smiled at the crowd, which in some places, was five deep, some of whom had queued from 2.40am to be a part of the royal Christmas celebrations. When they left church, Meghan and Harry walked over to a couple of ladies who had been waiting. Meghan smiled as Prince Harry complimented them on their Christmassy coloured clothes and told them the royal children were so excited it was hard to keep them under control. The Americans in the crowd were especially thrilled to see her, mainly from the bases at Mildenhall and Lakenheath, happy at the prospect of one of their compatriots marrying into a British institution in May next year. One was so excited that he brought an engagement ring all the way from Wisconsin for his girlfriend and proposed to her in the queue. She said yes!

"Nearly two-thirds (63%) of university students believe the National Union of Students is right to have a ""no platforming"" policy, a survey suggests. The policy means people or groups on a banned list for holding racist or fascist views are not given a platform to speak on student union premises. And 54% of 1,001 students asked thought the policy should be enforced against people who could be found intimidating. The NUS said the policy allowed free speech without intimidation. ComRes interviewed 1,001 UK university students online for the survey, commissioned by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, with data weighted by course year, university type and gender. The NUS official no platform list contains six groups including the BNP and Al-Muhajiroun, but individual unions and student groups can decide their own.

The NUS said it was proud of the policy and that the poll results showed students recognised it was important to stand up to racism and fascism. ""In the past, students have been physically harmed and tragically even killed as a result of such organisations coming on to campuses and inciting hatred. That is why no platform was introduced in the first place, to keep students safe in a very real sense,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Our policy does not limit free speech, but acts to defend it by calling out violence, hate speech, bullying and harassment, which allows debate to take place without intimidation. Students' unions are champions of debate on campus, in fact a recent survey showed zero out of 50 students' unions had banned a speaker in the past year."" In recent years, individuals believed to be sexist, transphobic or rape apologists have also been banned from speaking at universities. It is argued these speakers would threaten a ""safe space"", which is described as an accessible environment in which every student feels comfortable, safe and can get involved free from intimidation or judgment. At Canterbury Christ Church University, an NUS rep refused to share a platform with gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, whom she regarded as having been racist and ""transphobic"". Responding to the charge, he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme's debate on no platforming: ""I simply say where is the evidence for that claim? I've asked all my accusers, none of them can provide a single bit of evidence. ""This is what is particularly offensive about some aspects of student politics today - people make false, baseless allegations to try and discredit their opponents."" Feminist writer Julie Bindel was banned from speaking at Manchester University's student union last October as students said her views on transgender people could ""incite hatred towards and exclusion of our trans students"". She told the debate: ""Thirteen years ago I wrote an article which some transgender activists took offence at. Since then it's been like an anti-feminist witch-hunt against me. I am no platformed by a couple of committees within the NUS and I'm constantly described as being like Hitler. It's deeply offensive but we don't have the right not to be offended. ""I don't mind students not inviting me, but other students get really fed up with me not being invited. I get more emails each week from feminist students who want to hear me speak on how to end men's violence.""

"Students at the London School of Economics set up a Free Speech Society in January in response to what they say is increasing censorship on university campuses. Now students are voting on whether the society should be banned. What's behind the row? Universities have long been considered places for debate and for ideas to be challenged, but alongside that they are also meant to be places where minorities of all kinds can feel safe, comfortable and not sidelined in a way they may be elsewhere. These two ideals are currently causing conflict on campuses, fuelled by concepts such as ""safe space"" and ""no platforming"" - used by students with a view to gathering and having discussions without views or opinions that are deemed offensive or threatening. So how can these terms best be defined? Â·No platform asserts that no proscribed person or organisation should be given a platform to speak, nor should a union officer share a platform with them. Â·A safe space is an accessible environment in which every student feels comfortable, safe, and can get involved free from intimidation or judgment. The National Union of Students (NUS) has an official no platform list which includes the BNP and Al-Muhajiroun, but individual unions and student groups can decide their own. Some recent decisions have caused a stir. Feminist writer Julie Bindel was banned from speaking at Manchester University's student union last October asthey said her views,externalon transgender people could ""incite hatred towards and exclusion of our trans students"". Manchester University banned Julie Bindel from speaking last year And at Canterbury Christ Church University, an NUS rep refused to share a platform with gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, whom she regarded as having been racist and ""transphobic"". This decision and others are still being rowed about online -  free speech advocates calling ""censorship"", but others arguing safe spaces allow free speech for those shut down throughout history. Brendan O'Neill is one of those who think this all amounts to censorship - the editor of current affairs magazine Spiked Online held a conference last week on the issue. He first campaigned against no platform while at university two decades ago - then it was only used against racists and Zionists. ""We argued that if you censored these groups, there's nothing to stop the censorious logic from spreading and encapsulating more and more people - and that's exactly what happened. ""When you accept the idea that some thoughts are too dangerous to have in public life, there's nothing to stop other thoughts from being swallowed up."" But NUS president Megan Dunn said: ""It's simply not the case that they are banned or censored, it's just whether they are invited to a students' union to speak or not. This is about students' unions, they're democratic organisations."" The Free Speech Society was started at LSE in January in reaction to incidents including the suspension of the rugby team for handing out sexist leaflets. On Friday, in what they describe as an ironic move, students are voting on whether the society should be banned. Its head, Charlie Parker, believes freedom of expression is being stifled. ""Free speech has always been there to help and protect minorities - if you look at gay rights movements, civil rights movements, feminism, all the great progression under these movements was made possible through the use of freedom of expression,"" he said. But many students argue that safe spaces are in place to make sure all students have a voice. Rayhan Uddin,  Labour Society black and minority ethnic officer at LSE says safe spaces are useful in certain circumstances to allow repressed voices to speak. ""Clearly we have some problems when it comes to structural barriers for certain groups. And if women and ethnic minority students on campuses want to self-organise to help overcome some of the barriers they face, I would say all power to them,"" he said. Megan Dunn of the NUS said it has to listen to students when they find some views threatening The National Union of Students said it has to listen to students when they say they find others' views threatening. ""There have certainly been moments in my education when I have been uncomfortable, my views have been challenged - I think most of us will be able to draw a distinction between times we have been uncomfortable and times we have felt threatened,"" Ms Dunn said. ""Some people would say opinions are threatening to them, and we have to be able to listen to that view as well."" The debate continues but the one thing that everyone I spoke to agreed on is that they want everyone to have a voice at university - they just disagreed about how best to achieve that.

" At exactly 11:15, the front door of a council flat in Brixton opened. Two women stepped out on to a quiet residential street. The younger woman, Rosie, had an awkward gait. Her movement was stiff and clunky, as though she simply wasn't used to walking any distance. In fact, she had spent the past 30 years - her whole life - in captivity. Now she was ill and needed urgent medical attention. Born into a “collective”, she was not allowed to see a doctor, had never been allowed outside alone and had been told that if she tried to leave she would spontaneously combust and die. Worried she might not survive her illness, on 25 October 2013, Rosie and another woman, Josie, sneaked out. Waiting for them just round the corner were members of an organisation that helps people who have been abused, trafficked or enslaved. Along with the police, they had helped organise the escape. It soon became apparent that Rosie and 57-year-old Josie weren't the only women who lived in the flat, and when police officers returned they met Aisha - a 69-year-old woman originally from Malaysia. At first she didn't want to leave, but as they talked, she changed her mind. In the weeks that followed, it became clear how extraordinary their life had been. All three women seemed extremely frightened, often referring to an all-powerful force called Jackie, which they believed might seek retribution or cause them terrible harm. They were terrified of electricity, which they called “eeee” and seemed anxious that household appliances might blow up or explode. As they revealed details of their existence and Rosie gradually became more confident, she decided to change her name to Katy, inspired by the lyrics of Katy Perry's song, Roar, which is about a woman overcoming a difficult relationship and finding her voice. Katy's own story, and everything she had managed to overcome, proved far stranger than anyone could have imagined. The household in Brixton was run by Aravindan Balakrishnan, who the women called Comrade Bala or AB. Describing life with him, Katy explains how he exercised total control over his so-called comrades. He said that “he's God, he rules the world, he's immortal and he's our leader and teacher and we just have to obey him”. He claimed to have an all-powerful machine at his disposal which he called Jackie, an acronym for Jehovah, Allah, Christ, Krishna and Immortal Easwaran. Jackie was supposedly an invisible computer satellite built by the Chinese. Aravindan Balakrishnan Balakrishnan claimed that with Jackie's help he could control the world from inside the flat. He took credit for all global events, including wars and natural disasters. Balakrishnan told his followers it was only a matter of time until he would become ‘the overt ruler of the world’ One day in 1995, a pizza delivery man rang their doorbell by mistake. “Bala said this was the British fascist state trying to provoke him by bringing a pizza he hadn't ordered and ringing on his bell to disturb his important political work,” says Katy. Later that day, there was a huge earthquake in Japan. “So the same day as the fascist state knocked on God's door, Bala's door, there was a huge earthquake in Kobe to punish the fascist state,” she says. In Japanese, Kobe means God's door. Kobe after the earthquake, 1995 “From what he said, if something happens anywhere in the world, it's going to affect everything else in other parts of the world,” says Aisha. “Nothing exists in isolation, everything has its consequences. That's all I understand.  I just accept it because it's beyond my comprehension.” Balakrishnan told his followers it was only a matter of time until he would become “the overt ruler of the world”, adds Katy. “He used to look at the newspapers and say: 'You see this article, they're coming closer to me.'  And then he would ask: 'Who's coming to whom?' And everybody used to say: 'They're coming to you,' all in unison around him.” Throughout her life, Balakrishnan warned Katy that she would experience spontaneous human combustion, or SHC, if she ever stepped outside - Jackie would know and make her burst into flames. Once, when she was a small child, he put her outside the front door as a punishment and she became hysterical with fear, assuming she was about to die. Later, wondering why she had survived, she rationalised away the inconsistency thinking that because Balakrishnan himself had put her outside, Jackie knew to spare her on this occasion. Katy describes how Balakrishnan persuaded his followers to believe that, if they misbehaved, Jackie even had the power to stop the household plumbing from working as a punishment.  Daily life was hard. The comrades were expected to rise early to do the housework, make meals and serve Balakrishnan. They competed for his favour and it was considered a great honour to be allowed to turn on the shower for him or to enter the bathroom after he had finished to turn the shower off. In the early years, when the group was larger, some of the comrades would be sent out to work to make money for the collective, although neither Balakrishnan nor his wife ever had a job. Aisha worked at one time in Superdrug and then in the department store Morleys in Brixton, while Josie worked in a local industrial laundry. One comrade was a nurse and another a midwife. Those who didn't go out to work remained indoors inside the collective, where every day they had to attend Balakrishnan's morning lectures, standing to attention, sometimes for three or four hours. Anyone who sat down was punished. The bedrock of Balakrishnan's belief system was the tenets and teachings of Marx, Lenin and Mao. The group wanted to bring about a communist revolution and believed they were building the new world. They operated in secret and hid themselves from the “British fascist state”. Lectures were extended rants that often consisted of Balakrishnan denouncing individual comrades for perceived misdemeanours or identifying what he called synchronisations in the world, based on things he had read in the papers or seen on the news. “Someone used to have to log these synchronisations and write them down. As a child, I would spend ages copying these out,” says Katy. Balakrishnan created a mythology around himself. Every day, comrades had to sing songs celebrating his existence. The anniversary of his conception and his birthday - 16 October and 16 July - were celebrated and significant world events which happened on or close to these dates were seen as being synchronised with his life, providing evidence of his greatness. He claimed that the splitting of the atom, the moon landing and the storming of the Bastille - which happened about 150 years before he was born - were all linked to him in this way. Comrades came to believe that everything was interconnected and that Balakrishnan, with the help of Jackie, was all-powerful. “I received a nasty letter from my brother in Malaysia,"" says Aisha. “AB opened it and read it and then a few years after that my brother passed away, so I said to myself, 'OK, that's Jackie's work.'” When the Space Shuttle Challenger blew up in 1986, Balakrishnan claimed this was because people in the household were challenging him. “He said that his name Aravindan began with the sound 'AR', so it was 'Challenge - AR'.  People in the house were challenging him, so that's why Challenge-AR blew up,” says Katy. Balakrishnan believed in his own immortality and told his followers that they too would become immortal if they lived according to his rules. Remaining inside the flat was one way of extending their lives. “Captive animals live longer,” was one of his oft-repeated mantras. “He didn't believe in going to the dentist because he says we should let our teeth drop naturally and then when you're 100, your teeth will re-grow and you'll get another set,” says Aisha. Comrades were not allowed to see a doctor either. “He used to say that NHS means Never Help Self. So if we get ill, we have to focus on him and then we will get better as if by magic,” explains Katy. Balakrishnan introduced many acronyms into the language of the collective - the “British fascist state” became BFS and Nato was known as Farto, which stood for Fascist and Racist Terror Organisation. Our brains… they were dirty - they had to be washed of all ideas The collective itself was commonly referred to as AB's CCF(P), which stood for Aravindan Balakrishnan's Communist Collective Family Pilot Unit. So why did the women stay with Balakrishnan for so long? The group had started as a left-wing political organisation but evolved as Balakrishnan developed a raft of pseudo-religious ideas. Over time “we were brainwashed” explains Aisha. “Our brains… they were dirty. They had to be washed of all ideas. When you want to build a new world, you can't bring the old into it, so we had to chip away the old and fill the void with new ideas.” Aisha and Katy both report that beatings were a regular feature of life within the collective and if there was ever any dissent or disobedience, violence would ensue. Once, when the thought of leaving did cross her mind, Aisha quickly realised she had nowhere to go. “I had nobody outside, I had lost contact with my family, I had no money, I had no job, and I might have been deported.” However, Josie defends Balakrishnan and fervently denies that he ever used force. Katy was born in 1983. Her mother, Sian Davies, had joined the collective voluntarily and began a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan in the early 80s. Sian became pregnant and their child was given the name Prem Maopinduzi. Prem means love in Hindi, and Maopinduzi appears to be a combination of the Swahili word for revolution, mapinduzi, and Mao. Katy's birth certificate “It meant Love Revolution and I hated that… he thought that when he rules the world I'm meant to be like a soldier for him or his mouthpiece,” says Katy, and in her teens she started to refer to herself as Rosie. Members of the collective were not told who her father was and were led to believe that Sian had been impregnated by Jackie. “He used to say I was the product of electronic warfare,” says Katy. Katy's mother, Sian Davies At this point, Balakrishnan coined the term Project Prem. Project Prem was an experiment in child rearing intended to eliminate the nuclear family - a pilot for a new form of social organisation that would be implemented globally once Balakrishnan ruled the world. Comrade Prem, as Katy was known, was dressed in genderless clothing, never went to school, never got to know any other children and only rarely left the house. She was not told who her parents were and was brought up collectively by the group, who were not allowed to show her affection. Only Balakrishnan was allowed to cuddle her. “If I was to cuddle other people, he used to say that that's like being a lesbian, to cuddle other women,” she says. Balakrishnan's own childhood was spent in Asia. He was born in India in 1940 and moved to Singapore with his family when he was eight.  In 1963, he travelled to the UK on a British Council scholarship to study at the London School of Economics. As a student, he became increasingly involved in left-wing politics and eventually abandoned his studies. In 1974 he set up the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought, which he described as a “Chinese-initiated World Revolutionary Party”.  Its slogan was “China's Chairman is Our Chairman. China's Path is Our Path”. By 1976, his Workers' Institute had moved into premises on Acre Lane in Brixton, south London.  On the ground floor was a meeting room and a shop selling communist tracts. Upstairs was a communal living area where about 15 of Balakrishnan's core followers slept on the floor, with men in one room and women in another. Along with his Tanzanian wife Chandra and her disabled sister, the group consisted mainly of fellow students from Singapore and Malaysia, who felt ambivalent about Britain's colonial and imperialist past. Aisha Wahab had come to the UK from Malaysia at the age of 24 to study quantity surveying. She joined the group in its early days. Aisha Wahab “I was really inspired by him and drawn to him. I thought he was great to have been able to clarify our minds as to what to do with our lives,” she says. Other members included Josie Herivel, a brilliant young violinist studying at the Royal College of Music and Sian Davies, a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, who used family money to pay the rent on the Acre Lane premises. An old school friend, Sally Unwin, remembers Sian as very academic, “a deep thinker”. But the last time she remembers seeing her, Sian was “dressed like a Maoist, with all the blue and the collar… and the way she talked to me, I didn't know who she was… It was quite scary”.  It was not long before the political activities at the Workers' Institute attracted the attention of the police and in March 1978, it was raided by officers searching for drugs. Although no drugs were found, nine members of the group, including Balakrishnan, were sent to prison for assaulting police officers during the raid. At their trial, they refused to recognise the authority of the court and when called to the stand, they shouted “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China! Death to the British fascist state! Victory to world revolution!” After a brief period of incarceration, Balakrishnan decided that in order to escape the attention of the “British fascist state”, the group must go underground. So from then on, it operated in secret, frequently moving house.  By 1980, it consisted of only seven followers, all of whom were women. As the women stopped going out to work, the group came to rely on Chandra's sister's disability allowance and Chandra's carer's allowance for an income. Balakrishnan exerted control over the collective for many years.  As well as threatening and beating them, he would use each individual's past to further undermine them. Sian Davies's father had killed himself when she was a teenager and Balakrishnan would repeatedly tell her this was her fault.  By 1996, Sian's mental health had become fragile and on Christmas Eve of that year, she fell from the second floor bathroom window of a terraced house in Shakespeare Road, Brixton in an apparent suicide attempt. The house in Shakespeare Road where the collective lived for several years “Sian was acting really oddly saying she's a devil and was starting to behave really unlike herself,” says Katy. “There was screaming in the middle of the night and subsequently I learned that Sian had tried to stab herself with a knife. She had tried to run out the door... then because she couldn't escape that way, she went out through the window “On the morning of Christmas Eve, I went downstairs and Sian was lying on the floor.  Her hands and legs were tied and she was gagged and she had this piece of cloth in her mouth.  It may have been a sock or something.” Balakrishnan and Chandra were both shouting at Sian. “She had tried to run out the door, that's why she was tied up, because she was trying to escape. Then because she couldn't escape that way, she went out through the window.” Sian was taken to hospital, where she fell into a coma. Balakrishnan insisted that Sian's family should not be told what had happened and Josie told them on the phone that Sian was “away travelling in India and sends her love”. After lying in a coma for seven months, Sian died. At the inquest into her death, the coroner asked Aisha whether Sian had any children. On Balakrishnan's instructions, Aisha said she didn't. “We definitely didn't want Katy to be taken away and live a life as of old and not participate in building a new society,” she explains. It was around this time that Katy guessed Sian was her mother, but paradoxically, after Sian's death, life got better for Katy in some respects. “She was one of the worst servants of Bala, so it was such a relief with her not there. His worst enforcer had gone,” she says. And Sian was not the only person to die in the course of the collective's existence.  In 2004, Oh Kar Eng, a nurse from Malaysia, who had been with Balakrishnan since the 1970s, banged her head on a kitchen cabinet and had a stroke. The following day, she too died. Oh Kar Eng died in 2004 These two deaths reinforced the idea in the minds of the remaining members that Balakrishnan had the power of life and death over them. “AB said that he helps people to live and that those who die have not internalised his teachings enough. That's why it frightened me,” says Aisha. “Sian and Oh had died and I thought 'OK, next time, it will be me.' I didn't want to die.” By 2005, Katy’s situation had caused her to become deeply depressed. Observing life outside her window, she began to doubt Balakrishnan’s account of the world. At the age of 22, having never gone outside on her own and despite believing she might be killed by Jackie, she decided to try to escape. She packed a bag and let herself out of the back door of the flat. When she asked a passer-by for help, they suggested she go to the police station. But with no experience of the outside world, she struggled to explain her situation to the officer at the desk, only saying that she had “run away from home”. The officer persuaded Katy to let her phone Balakrishnan, who came to collect her.  He reassured the police that all was well and took Katy back to the collective, where he denounced her and told her she was ungrateful. Katy remained in captivity for another eight years. Over the summer of 2013 Katy lost weight dramatically and became so unwell that Josie feared she might not survive. Arranging a doctor's appointment was not an option so the two women came up with a plan. In early October, they saw a story about forced marriage on the BBC News and at the end the newsreader gave out a helpline number. I just couldn't take living like an animal like that any more Josie committed the number to memory and saved change in secret from her regular trips to the grocery shop.  She smuggled a mobile phone into their home and, while Balakrishnan and Chandra watched Neighbours on television, they called for help. Katy, a few days after her escape They made a series of calls and were passed on to Gerard Stocks and Yvonne Hall at the Palm Cove Society, who, together with the Metropolitan Police, co-ordinated the women's rescue. Each week Balakrishnan and Chandra went shopping at the same time, so Katy knew when there would be an opportunity to escape. “We had to make sure they were not anywhere near when we walked out of the house… so 11:15 sharp we left, Josie and me, with our trolleys.” Yvonne and Gerard were waiting just round the corner. Katy was “delighted” but Josie already appeared to be having second thoughts. Left toright: Aisha, Katy, Yvonne Hall and Josie “She knew the police were involved, she was beginning to regret it, thinking it'll make trouble for Bala,” says Katy. But Katy was determined to leave and never go back: “I just couldn't take living like an animal like that any more, being treated with such disrespect and just being a non-person.” She felt confident she could trust Yvonne. “After what I had come from, anything was better than that. That's all I knew for sure.” When Katy left the collective she had “a hundred feelings at once, you can't really say what”. She couldn't believe it was true and was afraid that she would “wake up and find that I'm still stuck”. As they slowly walked to the meeting point “Katy had a beaming smile” remembers Yvonne. “We just hugged each other.” Aisha wanted to know why the cars coming towards us had white lights and the cars in front of us had red lights That same day, Yvonne and Gerard drove Katy, Josie and Aisha to Leeds where they gave them a place to stay. Katy was treated in hospital for diabetes. “The women seemed to start and finish one another's sentences. They spoke in unison, as if they'd had the same conversations with each other for years and years and years, so if one of them started a sentence, the others knew what the next bit was going to be,” says Gerard. “Aisha wanted to know why the cars coming towards us had white lights and the cars in front of us had red lights,” he adds. It rapidly became clear that Katy in particular had very few life skills. She was “overwhelmed by the enormity of everything, because she had been confined,"" says Yvonne. “She couldn't cross a road, had never handled money and couldn't look around or make eye contact.” Katy at Gerard and Yvonne's house After a while, Josie and Aisha were housed locally in sheltered accommodation, but Katy's needs were greater and she lived with Yvonne and Gerard for more than a year, while they helped her to develop the skills she would need to live independently. Balakrishnan was brought to trial in 2015 and was charged with sexual offences as well as with imprisoning his daughter. In the course of the police investigation, it emerged that he had sexually abused two women, Woman A and Woman B, over a period of years. Woman A described in court how Balakrishnan had made her write an account of her sexual history, which he then used to humiliate her in front of the others. Later he sexually abused her, raped her and regularly beat her. In 1989, after 13 years, she left the collective. Woman B was a nurse from Malaysia, who had moved into the Acre Lane commune in 1978. She too was beaten, sexually assaulted and raped. In 1992, she worked a night shift and found the courage not to return to the collective. In January 2016, Balakrishnan was convicted of crimes including rape, sexual assault, child cruelty and the false imprisonment of his daughter. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison. Josie and Chandra during Balakrishnan's trial His wife Chandra and Josie Herivel stood by him and made a statement to the press, declaring his innocence and claiming he had been framed by the “British fascist state”. Despite having voluntarily left the collective, Josie continues to follow his teachings and now devotes her time to trying to clear his name. Josie still campaigns for Balakrishnan's release Aisha is now 72 and lives in sheltered housing in Leeds. She claims she was unaware of any sexual abuse taking place in the collective. Although she has regrets about the way Katy was treated, she still believes in campaigning to make the world a better place and volunteers once a week in a local charity shop. She also has regular dentist appointments to get her teeth fixed. Katy has adopted the last name Morgan-Davies, consisting of two surnames from her mother’s side of the family. She is doing her best to leave the indoctrination of her past behind and has made remarkable progress. She is studying English and maths at college and has recently moved out of supported accommodation into a flat of her own. DNA tests carried out by the police confirmed that Balakrishnan is her father. Somehow she has managed to find it within herself to forgive him “I used to hate him, but not any more. Nelson Mandela said that you are still in prison if you hold on to your anger, hatred and bitterness, so there’s no place for that in my life.  I would like to reconcile with him in the future if he wants that.  But you can’t clap with one hand.” Vanessa Engle's documentary, The Cult Next Door, is broadcast on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT, 26 January -watch it on BBC iPlayer All images subject to copyright",Positive,0.9818781
" Some guests were awoken by the gunshots, others by the buzzing of three Black Hawk helicopters. It was the early hours of 16 July 2016. Around two-dozen Turkish commandos dropped into the grounds of the luxury Club Turban hotel in the coastal resort of Marmaris, armed with automatic rifles and grenades. They were hunting one man - Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The president had been holidaying at a private villa linked to the hotel. Tanks move through the streets of Ankara While rebel soldiers in Istanbul and Ankara blocked roads and bombed state buildings, the commandos had been sent to capture the president. It should have been the climax of their coup d'etat. Opening fire and hurling grenades, they stormed the hotel, killing two bodyguards. But they were too late. Acting on a tip-off, Erdogan had been whisked away from the resort by helicopter. Once at Dalaman Airport, he took a private jet to Istanbul, with his pilot masking its identity so it  appeared on radars as a normal civilian passenger plane. After 03:00, the president emerged outside Istanbul's Ataturk Airport to the roars of his supporters. The coup attempt had failed - and Recep Tayyip Erdogan was to emerge stronger than ever. President Erdogan's message to the Turkish people For many, that night marked the rebirth of modern Turkey. En route to Istanbul, Erdogan made a video-call to Turkish television, urging people on to the streets to resist the coup attempt. Turks responded en masse - and 265 people were killed in the process. Some lay in front of rebel tanks to block their advance, others ran into gunfire on the Bosphorus bridge, trying to overpower the coup plotters. By dawn, the coup had failed. For the first time since the foundation of the Turkish republic in 1923, the people had managed to stand up to the tanks. Over the decades, four coups had succeeded - Erdogan ensured a fifth did not. Millions gathered in nightly rallies, chanting his name and singing his campaign song. Erdogan went from almost losing control of his country to becoming untouchable. But for Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, it wasn't enough. After 11 years as prime minister, Erdogan had been elected president in 2014. The post was traditionally largely ceremonial but Erdogan had other ideas. The dominant figure in Turkish politics had long dreamed of enshrining his authority through constitutional change, turning Turkey from a parliamentary to a presidential republic, scrapping the post of prime minister and consolidating his hold on the country. On 16 April the Turkish people will decide in a referendum whether to accept his grand reform. The decision has become, in effect, a referendum on Erdogan and the Turkey he has moulded in his image - fiercely nationalist, conservative and beset by problems. This previously stable corner of the region has become consumed by terror attacks - once-rapid economic growth has stalled. Dozens of journalists are in jail. Three million, mostly Syrian, refugees have poured into the country. Tens of thousands of people have been arrested or dismissed following the failed coup. The country's hope of EU membership is evaporating. And Turkey is arguably more politically polarised than ever. But at the same time, Turkey has gone from a financial basket-case at the turn of the century into one of the world's top 20 economies. The middle-class has hugely expanded. Millions of impoverished Turks have been economically emboldened under Erdogan's leadership. Schools, hospitals, roads and giant infrastructure projects have transformed daily life. Pious Turks, who long felt excluded by an old secular elite, have been empowered. And Turkey has freed itself from the grip of a once omnipotent military. And now, the country will vote on its future. The president’s portrait stares down on Recep Tayyip Erdogan University in his family’s hometown of Rize, on Turkey’s Black Sea coast. Little says “personality cult” like naming an institution after a leader while he’s still alive. Hatice Yildiz, 22, sits in the central courtyard. The wooden bench is embossed with Erdogan’s name, naturally. Erdogan's hometown of Rize is 700 miles(1,100 km) east of Istanbul “I’m proud of my president and I’m proud of my university’s name,"" says the English literature student. ""He is really a good leader - a world leader.” Founded in 2006, the university took the president’s name five years ago and now boasts 20,000 students. Its modern faculties are spread across Rize - a small, unremarkable city, the beautiful mountains surrounding it blighted by drab high-rise buildings. The Recep Tayyip Erdogan University in Rize The region is a heartland of Turkish nationalism - the conservative and religious side of Turkey that felt forgotten for decades and that found its saviour in Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Many here were ostracised by the old secular elite, who built up the Turkish Republic from its genesis in 1923 with the ideals of its founding father, Ataturk - westward-looking and fiercely secular, resisting the pull of the Islamic Middle East. The Muslims of Anatolia often felt like second-class citizens, labelled “black Turks” as opposed to the bourgeois “white Turks”. They were banned from wearing headscarves in public institutions - until Erdogan came along, a conservative Muslim himself, the first prime minister whose wife wore a headscarf. His government repealed the ban in 2013. Hatice Yildiz “My mother said it was really bad in her time,” says Yildiz, who herself wears a headscarf. “Men could go to university but girls couldn’t, because they were covered. A person should be able to go anywhere they want - it shouldn’t be about their religion or their appearance. “Before Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that’s what it was like. And he destroyed that law.” Much of Erdogan’s support is underpinned by his championing of the Muslim cause. In Rize, they love his piety - and of course, his local roots. While Erdogan himself was born in Istanbul, he had strong family ties to Rize - his grandparents migrated there from Georgia and his father was born in the port city. Standing by the giant mosque in Guneysu, the village adjoining Rize where Erdogan has a house, relative Sadullah Mutlu says he remembers the young Recep as “a mature boy, always ambitious and interested in politics”. He wanted initially to become a professional footballer but was drawn towards the youth branch of an Islamist political movement. Soon after, he married Emine Gulbaran, with whom he has four children. His political rise was quick, becoming mayor of Istanbul, when he was briefly imprisoned under the secular regime for reciting a religious poem. Erdogan’s working-class origins in the Black Sea and childhood in the poor Istanbul neighbourhood of Kasimpasa gave him his common touch and ability to connect with ordinary voters. His supporters here feel he is their voice. Erdogan's face on a building in Rize Mehmet Meral is among them. Since the 1950s, his family has owned 140 acres of tea plantations in the mountains around Rize. It is the centre of the country’s tea industry, with Turkey the world’s fifth largest producer. Terraced rows nestle beside fast-flowing streams and Ottoman-era stone bridges. “Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one of us,” Meral says, “he’s one of the people. Before, all the leaders were rich kids or high class. He’s not like that.” He speaks our language, gets aggressive like we do - and tells the world what we want to say” That raw emotion is on show in the president’s rally in Rize, drumming up support for the constitutional referendum. He holds the stage for an hour, enthralling thousands of supporters with talk of bringing back the death penalty for the coup-plotters and vaunting Turkey’s giant infrastructure projects. Economic development is the other big driving force behind his support. He also hits out at Europe, continuing a row after European leaders banned his ministers from campaigning among the Turkish diaspora in their countries. “A few fascists will never destroy Turkey’s honour,” he proclaims, calling on Turks to “defy the grandchildren of Nazis” and back the constitutional change. Such abrasive comments have infuriated Western governments but delight his fans, who wear headbands with his name and chant his campaign song. The only other face on the giant flags is Ataturk - and Erdogan is now on the verge of eclipsing the republic’s greatest icon. The old secular ideals of Ataturk are virtually a distant memory in this side of Turkey. As his speech ends, Erdogan and his ministers throw presents into the crowds - chess sets and children’s toys. Outstretched hands clamber for the offering, a look of desperation in the faces of those for whom grasping the gift is second only to touching the great man. And then Erdogan cuts a ribbon to symbolise the start of construction work on an airport in Rize - he has doubled the number of airports in Turkey in the past decade as his infrastructure drive ploughs on, helping win votes. The reverence he commands is virtually unparalleled in the democratically elected world - “if he told me to die for him, I would” is a refrain you sometimes hear among his supporters. It is a level of devotion matched only by the depth of hatred he inspires in the other side of this polarised country. Istanbul's Gezi Park is a rare green space in the middle of a city choked by concrete. Next to Taksim Square, Istanbul's iconic heart, it is a haven of trees and grass amid the blaring car horns. Gezi was never an award-winning park - but its importance was transformed overnight in 2013. As the government announced plans to redevelop it into a shopping mall, it became the symbol of another turning-point in Erdogan's leadership. A few dozen environmentalists camped out in the park to show their disapproval. At dawn on 28 May, police moved in, burning down the tents and using tear gas. It was the spark that lit the biggest street protests in Turkey's modern history. The image of the Woman in Red was widely shared on social media “It was empowering,” says Foti Benlisoy, a publisher and Gezi park protester. “We had the sense we were making history.” Millions took to the streets across Turkey, spurred by the police violence but actually demonstrating about much more. Erdogan, who had seemed like a pro-European reformer in his early years, was showing an increasingly authoritarian side. The park itself turned into a giant carnival-like movement, similar to the Occupy protests elsewhere. Environmentalists were joined by leftist groups, Kurds, football fan clubs and a range of others. For a few days at least, the park hosted thousands of varied peaceful protesters. But on Taksim Square, and across the country, clashes with police escalated fast. Mark Lowen reporting on the Gezi Park/Taksim Square clashes “It was a de facto coalition of grievances,” says Benlisoy. “There was growing discomfort over the aggressive urban policies of the governing AK Party - over-building, commercialising common spaces, handing out tenders to Erdogan-friendly businessmen - with opposition from women's and LGBT movements, students and social rights groups.” Conservatism was taking over - restrictions on alcohol sales and abortions were announced, and Erdogan had urged women to have more children. Work had begun for Turkey's biggest mosque despite complaints that it was being built on protected forest land and would dominate Istanbul's skyline. While some members of the government tried a more conciliatory approach to the protesters, Erdogan clamped down hard, labelling them “marauders” and accusing them of “drinking alcohol in a mosque” - something the mosque's imam then denied. Early AKP rule under Erdogan reached out to democrats and liberals, leftists and Kurds, says Benlisoy. “But after Gezi his rhetoric became about the 'domination' of one side of Turkey towards the other, defining his support base by confrontation with the other.” The polarisation deepened as Erdogan was shaken by leaks of phone conversations later in 2013 that appeared to implicate him and his inner circle in corruption allegations, which he fiercely denied. He stoked the old Ottoman-era mentality of a Turkey under siege from its enemies, illustrated by the old adage “the only friend of a Turk is a Turk”. There was a new conspiracy theory every week as the prime minister increasingly turned to arch-loyalists, while expelling or sidelining members of his own party who dared to dissent. Freedom of expression was heavily squeezed. The progress of Erdogan's early years receded, as critical journalists, writers or artists were tarnished as “traitors”. Turkey regained its record as the world's leading jailer of journalists. Erol Onderoglu is among the 150 journalists now in prison or facing trial. A long-term representative of the watchdog Reporters Without Borders, Onderoglu attended an editorial meeting for a Kurdish paper, Ozgur Gundem, to mark World Press Freedom Day. The government accused the newspaper of spreading Kurdish “terrorism propaganda” and closed it. The prosecutor is now asking for a 14-year sentence against Onderoglu. For over a decade, we hoped that Turkey could belong to a European family... But then I found myself being handcuffed like an assassin.” He spent 10 days in prison and faces trial in June. As he recounts the toughest moment, his voice breaks. “When my wife and son came to visit me, I had to talk to them through the glass. That's when I realised what an injustice had been done to me.” Dozens of media outlets have been closed since the failed coup, and journalists have been variously charged with “terrorism propaganda” or “insulting the president”. Protest outside Cumhuriyet's office after editors were arrestedOctober 2016 Turkey's oldest mainstream newspaper, the secularist Cumhuriyet, has been raided and its editors arrested. Other critical voices have left the country or been jailed. Erdogan claims Turkey has “the world's freest press”, while also stating those in prison are not journalists but “terrorists, thieves or child molesters”. “Erdogan directly or indirectly controls 80% of the media in Turkey,” says Onderoglu, of the situation facing journalists. “Any criticism of him is seen as criticism of the state. The definition of the job we do has been systematically eliminated from the Turkish dictionary.” For Erdogan, extreme times justify extreme measures. “There is no difference between a terrorist holding a gun or a bomb and those who use their pen and position to serve their aims,” he said, after Turkey’s worst ever terror attack, which killed 103 people outside Ankara train station in October 2015. It heralded his crackdown - and dozens more attacks to come. Aynur Yaman, an ethnic Kurd, knows the cost more than most. In her one-room house in a desperately poor village close to Diyarbakir, the biggest city in southeast Turkey, she now cares for her seven children alone. Aynur Yaman Her husband, Mehmet Salih Yaman, was killed last year when a truck blew up close to their home. It was believed to be carrying explosives belonging to the outlawed Kurdish militant group the PKK, possibly stockpiled for a future attack. “They found his left finger and matched his DNA,” she says, “that’s all I remember - I had lost my mind.” She glances up at his photo that she keeps on the wall. In the corner, her one year-old baby starts to cry. He had just been born when his father died. “The PKK took away our dreams and stole a father of seven in the prime of his life,” 33-year-old Yaman says. “I don’t want to see their faces anymore. I will now vote for the people who have been supporting us psychologically and financially - for Erdogan.” Close to 30 terror attacks in the past two years have killed about 500 people. Kurdish militants were behind some - mainly targeting police officers and soldiers - while so-called Islamic State struck public areas, including Istanbul’s Ataturk airport and the city’s Reina nightclub last New Year’s Eve. Turkey feels constantly on edge, awaiting the next attack - security is the biggest issue for many as they prepare to vote. A ceasefire with the PKK broke down in July 2015, restarting a conflict that has killed 40,000 people since the 1980s. Some blamed the militants for resuming armed attacks, others believe Erdogan engineered an end to the truce to whip up nationalist votes and regain the parliamentary majority he lost a month earlier. If so, it worked - the AKP won back its majority in November 2015 and he’s hoping his hardline stance on terror will achieve victory in this referendum too. Kurds clash with police in protest at curfews in DiyarbakirDecember 2015 Large swathes of the southeast have seen curfews, military operations and urban warfare over the past two years. The UN estimates 2,000 people have been killed - soldiers and civilians - while the Turkish army says it has eliminated thousands of militants. The neighbourhood of central Diyarbakir where the worst of the fighting raged has been completely destroyed, with houses razed to the ground and surrounding buildings still torn by bullet holes. Thirteen MPs from the pro-Kurdish HDP, which became the third-biggest party in parliament in 2015, have been imprisoned for alleged links to the PKK and 86 mayors have been replaced by the government. Kurds who finally found a national political voice two years ago now feel silenced. “The vast majority here think Erdogan and his people are responsible for the devastation that’s happened,” says Ziya Pir, an HDP MP who faces 23 years in prison for “terrorism propaganda” and “membership of a terrorist organisation”. Bullet holes on a building in Diyarbakir Kurdish voters are split between conservative Erdogan supporters and the HDP - but he is adamant over where the blame lies. “The old nationalist mentality of Turkey couldn’t allow Kurds to be partners in ruling the country - they had to kill it.” He worries that hundreds of thousands in the southeast will be disenfranchised in the referendum after being displaced by the conflict and losing their voter registration. Now the only way to return to peace, he says, is with a “no” vote. “With a ‘yes’, Erdogan would establish an authoritarian regime that may lead Turkey into a dictatorship. If it’s a ‘no’, Erdogan will see he can’t be genuinely successful without the help or votes of the Kurds. A ‘no’ would give a chance to return to negotiations to solve the Kurdish problem”. AK Party office in Diyarbakir Erdogan argues strong central leadership will give him the power to face down Turkey’s terror threats. But critics argue his government’s lax control of the border with Syria and support for Islamist factions has exposed Turkey to the IS threat and allowed jihadist cells to grow here. Moreover, Ankara’s policy in Syria, attacking the Kurdish militia there, has made Turkey ever more vulnerable, provoking retaliatory strikes by the PKK. Orhan Tokar was caught up in the terror attack on Kurdish supporters in Diyarbakir in June 2015, which was blamed on IS. He lost part of his left leg in the bombing. An HDP supporter, his ire is directed mainly at the Turkish government. “Erdogan can denounce me as a ‘terrorist’ or a ‘traitor to my country’ – my vote will always be ‘no’,” he says. “If ‘no’ wins, spring will arrive and people will be happy again. If it’s ‘yes’, the system will go back to Ottoman times, like a sultanate. And that will divide Turkey.” After a year of terror attacks, Turks felt they had reached the bottom. But then came the coup. “The Gulen movement is a perfect definition of a cult,” says Said Alpsoy, sitting in his study surrounded by books on Islam.A conservative researcher, he spent 17 years as a follower of Fethullah Gulen, the Islamic cleric who the government blames for orchestrating last year's failed coup. “When Gulen was eating an orange, he threw the peel on the ground. I watched as one of his doctors grabbed the peel and ate it. I realised from the body-language that this was routine. The soles of his old shoes would even be boiled and eaten by his followers.” Pro-Erdogan protesters hang an effigy of GulenJuly 2016 He seems embarrassed, apologising for the cruder examples he's about to give. “Once, after Gulen gave an emotional sermon, he cried a lot and the handkerchief with which he cleaned his nose was wet. A young student took that handkerchief and cleaned his own face with it, right in front of me. Also, the stones of the olives that Gulen ate were never thrown away. They were distributed as valuable gifts to lower-grade people in the movement.” Pupils at a Gulenist school in Turkey, 2008 Fethullah Gulen has built a network of followers since the 1960s, principally through schools and universities that he endowed in Turkey and across the world. The group presents itself as a “faith-inspired, non-political, cultural and educational movement” adhering to “sympathy, compassion and altruism” through projects ranging from private schools to poverty aid programmes. But followers ended up taking senior positions across Turkey’s public and private sectors, led by Gulen from self-imposed exile in the US. “The movement never said in so many words 'let's take over the state',” says Said Alpsoy. “Instead they would say: 'The state is taken over by the enemies of religion - let's get rid of these invaders and we will give it back to its real owners - the pious Muslims of Anatolia.'” For years, Gulen was an ally of Erdogan, helping him cleanse the military of secularists. But when the corruption scandal against the prime minister broke in 2013, Erdogan accused so-called Gulenists of tapping his phones and doctoring the evidence. Gulen became enemy number one, accused of leading a “parallel state”. The government saw the putsch in 2016 as a vindication of its suspicions, blaming Gulen and his network and demanding his extradition from the US. Foreign governments have cast doubt - the intelligence agencies of the EU and Germany have said they remain unconvinced that Gulen ordered the coup. The UK's Foreign Affairs Committee found that while some Gulen followers may have been involved, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest the movement as a whole was behind it. Turkey has so far failed to persuade Washington to extradite the cleric back to Turkey. Fethullah Gulen in his study in the US The shadow of the failed coup hangs over the current referendum battle, with Erdogan denouncing “no"" voters as “siding with the coup-plotters"" and a post-coup state of emergency limiting anti-Erdogan protests and making some reluctant to speak out. It has also convulsed Turkish society through an ongoing purge of those suspected of siding with or backing the coup. More than 160,000 people have been detained, dismissed or suspended - from police officers to pilots and teachers to businessmen. Erdogan and his allies have painted a picture of enemies plotting against Turkey, but the purge has also now created a pool of victims willing to vote against him. The president stands accused of purging opponents who had nothing to do with the coup. Hundreds of academics have been fired, including those who signed a petition last year calling on the government to cease its military operations in Kurdish areas of the country. Erdogan lambasted them as “so-called intellectuals”, a “fifth column” of foreign powers and terrorists. Oget Oktem Tanor is among them. Eighty-two years old, she was Turkey's first neuropsychologist and an emeritus professor of Istanbul University. Now she has lost various rights she held as a civil servant and has been banned from travelling abroad, charged with “terrorism propaganda”. Oget Oktem Tanor “It's absurd,” the softly-spoken academic says. “Of course I'm not helping terrorists. I just put my opinion into words by signing this petition. I have nothing to do with propaganda. Teaching and being with my students is my life, so it's very hard for me not to be with them again. For the first time, I felt depressed.” She looks out to the Bosphorus from an apartment she's occupied for decades, as she built her reputation as one of Turkey's leading academics. After the coup of 1971, she was forced to flee the country with her husband, facing imprisonment and possible torture for being leftists. “That time was still better than now,” she says, “because there was a judiciary you could trust and civil courts you could rely on. Now they are all under pressure and there's no separation of powers as there should be in a democracy. I really fear for the future of my country.” Fear is felt on Istiklal Caddesi - or Independence Avenue - Istanbul’s main shopping street, which was until recently a symbol of the city’s vibrancy. Hundreds of thousands of people thronged its cafes and shops each day, tourists riding the iconic rickety red tram past the foreign consulates and booksellers. Today, it’s dotted with empty shops and bars, ""for rent"" signs filling spaces that would have been snapped up in days just a couple of years ago. Some avoid walking up the street entirely since a bomb exploded on it last year, killing four foreign tourists. It’s a pattern repeated elsewhere. Leading foreign retailers, including C&A and Topshop, have pulled back from Turkey and the shopping malls that mushroomed in the past decade are no longer bustling. Tourism, which makes up around 10% of the Turkish economy, is declining rapidly. In 2014 Turkey was the world's sixth most-visited country - with 42 million tourists. That dropped to 25 million in 2016 as Western tourists stayed away because of security fears. Hotels have slashed rates in an effort to bring them back. Foreigners arriving in Turkey per monthJanuary 2015 - February 2017 At Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, traditionally one of the world's most-visited tourist attractions, Erol Avci sits outside the carpet shop where he has worked for 39 years, desperate for custom. “I started working here aged 18,” he says, “and this is the worst it's ever been. We're down by 80% and are not making any profit, so I'm not drawing a salary.” His boss owns two of the shops they occupy - the third is rented and they're considering leaving it. Several others have already done so - empty shop-fronts now line some of the narrow lanes in this centuries-old maze of traders. There's a creeping sense of financial crisis - a feeling that Turkey's good run has ended. After a crash in 2001 that saw chronic inflation and the Turkish lira reaching an exchange rate of 1.5 million against the US dollar, Erdogan built a reputation for economic competence. Growth soared to over 10% in 2011 and Turkey became known as the New Tiger, the fastest-growing economy in the G20 group of nations. But terror attacks and political turbulence have led to the economy shrinking for the first time since 2009. Unemployment is over 12%. The Turkish lira has lost a quarter of its value against the dollar since mid-2016. “We are going through an economic crisis,” says Tekin Acar, whose chain of cosmetic stores is suffering. “Nobody is calling it that but sales are dropping, profits are falling and we will have to open smaller stores with fewer staff.” This malaise could play out in the referendum. Ali Avci sips tea outside his ceramics shop in the Grand Bazaar, trying to pass the day. He and his family have always voted for Erdogan's AK Party - but now for the first time, they plan to defy him and say “no” in the referendum. “This is a protest vote about the economy but also about Erdogan's lies, which we now see through social media,” he says. “Days go by without any customers now. I could survive here if this goes on for another year but then I'd have to close. People are afraid of saying they're going to vote no - but lots will.” It is a trend that appears to be gathering pace - some traditional AKP voters deserting the “yes” camp to voice their anger at the past two years of turbulence. Opposition campaigners in Istanbul Before the last general election, pro-government headlines screamed “AKP or chaos”. But even though the party won, chaos still came. And if Erdogan's once solid voter base begins to splinter, it could spell trouble for him in the referendum. In the last week of the campaign, the governors of Istanbul and Ankara banned two large “no” rallies, claiming they couldn’t guarantee security. “Yes” rallies, however, went ahead – and free buses were provided to transport those who wanted to come. On my 20-minute walk from my home to the BBC office in Istanbul, I counted 18 “yes” posters and one for “no”. In some places “no” campaigners have been attacked and some people have been sacked for publicising their opposition. Government supporters remain convinced that anti-Erdogan bias in the West is misconceived and point out that Turkey is - among other things - the world’s largest host of refugees. It became the main route for those crossing to Europe, with thousands boarding dinghies every night from the Turkish coast to the Greek islands, and many drowning en route. Turkey struck a deal with the EU to stem the flow - sending failed asylum seekers back. It’s widely believed that European leaders have tempered their criticism of Erdogan because they needed his co-operation on migrants. But in some Western capitals, anger at Turkey’s unpredictable leader is growing. The European Parliament called for a suspension of EU membership negotiations. In Turkey, this referendum will be a turning point. A “yes” would greatly strengthen Erdogan’s hand, giving him unprecedented power and possibly allowing him to remain in office until 2029, as well as virtually guaranteeing him and his family immunity from any attempts at prosecution. A “no” would not spell the end for him - but would embolden the Turkish opposition and provide a chance for a political challenge. Whichever way it goes, the chasm between Turkey and the West has grown dramatically. Some blame Erdogan for that but others see the fault with the EU - that it had a window of opportunity after opening negotiations in 2005 to coax Erdogan into long-lasting reforms. Instead, the argument goes, the EU gave way to the rhetoric of the likes of France’s Nicolas Sarkozy, who called Turkish membership “unthinkable”. Turkey sensed it would continue to be held in the EU’s waiting room. “Sadly, Europe sees President Erdogan and Turkey as an ‘other’ through which to deflect their internal problems onto a distant and imaginary enemy,” wrote Ibrahim Kalin, the president’s spokesman. “It only deepens the sense of mistrust that is already poisoning relations between Turkey and Europe on the one hand and Islamic and Western societies on the other.” Turkey matters. It remains a vital Western ally in the region, Nato’s eastern flank and a big trading partner. It is a crucial player in attempts to bring peace to Syria and the war against so-called Islamic State. As it tries, with faltering success, to pivot more towards Russia and Gulf States, that could have a considerable geopolitical impact. The West cannot afford to lose this country. “Democracy is like a train, Erdogan once famously said. “You get off once you have reached your destination.” Some believe he has many stations left to pass, others that this country is in the midst of a slow-motion train crash. This could be the crowning moment or the undoing of Erdogan’s Turkey. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has used his Christmas Day sermon to focus on terrorist atrocities and deceitfulness of ""populist leaders"" in 2017. Preaching to worshippers at Canterbury Cathedral, the Most Rev Justin Welby compared the Holy Family to modern-day refugees. He also contrasted Jesus with ""populist leaders that deceive"" their people. His Catholic counterpart, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, called for a rejection of ""radical individualism"" in society. Preaching at the Sung Eucharist service, the Archbishop said that the nature of power meant those who have it, seek to hold on to it. He said: ""In 2017 we have seen around the world tyrannical leaders that enslave their peoples, populist leaders that deceive them, corrupt leaders that rob them, even simply democratic, well-intentioned leaders of many parties and countries who are normal, fallible human beings."" He condemned terrorist atrocities and those who claimed that terror was ""the path to freedom in God"". Like the Popethe Archbishop drew parallels between the Nativity story and the migrant crisis. He said: ""[The Holy Family] flee as refugees, like over 60 million people today. ""Yet their story is the beginning of ours, it is an invitation to lives of freedom, found through God's freely offered love."" In his midnight homily, the Roman Catholic Church's most senior cleric in England and Wales warned of ""radical individualism"" in society  and said there was ""conflict in the air, not dialogue"". Cardinal Nichols added he hoped Christmas would bring ""green shoots of hope"". Speaking to the BBC before the Christmas midnight Mass in Westminster Cathedral, London, Cardinal Nichols said: ""In social media there's a barrage of views and once a statement or claim is made there's immediately a counterclaim, and the mode of exchange is conflict."" Cardinal Nichols was critical of social media He added that society needs ""to get over that notion that faith in God and reason are somehow opposed"". He said ""the heart has reasons that the mind doesn't always understand"". When asked about the part that religion plays in conflicts, he maintained faith was not the primary reason for unrest in places like the Middle East. ""Even the conflict in Northern Ireland; reading of it it that it was essentially about religious faith, is an inadequate rather superficial meaning. ""Most conflicts are about power and  territories and borders and wealth,"" the cardinal said. ""Often religious identity is in there in the mix but I don't think for the most part it is the key issue.""
