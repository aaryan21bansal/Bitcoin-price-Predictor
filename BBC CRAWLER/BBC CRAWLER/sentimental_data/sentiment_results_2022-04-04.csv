"June Brown, who has died at the age of 95, won her place in British hearts playing the chain-smoking washerwoman, Dot Cotton in EastEnders. It was a part she would play for more than 30 years - well past her 90th birthday. In person, Brown was a riot. One Guardian writer described her as ""Kenneth Williams trapped in the body of Cilla Black"". But like her on-screen persona, her private life was touched by extremes of emotion - with great happiness, romantic love affairs, terrible heartache and family tragedy. June Muriel Brown was born in Needham Market, Suffolk in 1927. Her father, Harry, was a wealthy businessman who went bust investing money in German banks before World War Two. Her mother, Louisa, was a milliner - who June was convinced loved her far less than her four other siblings.  Brown would describe herself as a ""mongrel"".  Her grandfather was from Scotland, her mother from Italian stock. On BBC One's Who Do You Think You Are? she discovered one of her great-great-great grandfathers had been a famous Jewish bare-knuckle fighter in London's East End. June Brown in the part that made her famous. Dot Cotton worked with Pauline Fowler and Ethel Skinner in the Albert Square launderette Her younger brother, John, died of pneumonia in 1932 when he was just 15 days old.  Two years later, June lost her elder sister to meningitis.  The loss of 8 year old Marise affected her deeply. It ""shaped the way I behaved for a long time"", she wrote in her autobiography, Before The Year Dot. ""In particular, it influenced my expectations of men,"" she said.  ""Too dependent, I found it impossible to be happy alone.  I was constantly in and out of love, always looking for the kind of caring she had given me."" Brown was academically able.  She won a scholarship to Ipswich High School and wanted to train as a biologist - but her father put his foot down.  He insisted it would be a waste of money fearing she ""would only go and get married"". She served in the Women's Royal Naval Service at the end of the war.  She was based in Scotland and it was during her time in the WRNS she discovered the joys of acting. When the war was over she got a job as a cinema operator in Argyll.  The newsreels of the liberation of Belsen horrified her.  ""It was extremely shocking for a girl of 18"", she told one interviewer.  ""We were a very innocent generation."" She won a place at London's Old Vic Theatre School where she met and married her first husband, actor John Garley. He suffered from depression and took his own life in 1957. A young June as Aisla Crane in 'The Case of the Frightened Lady' in 1957. ""He gassed himself using the coins I had left him for the gas meter,"" recalled Brown.  ""He'd had an affair with another actress, although I was the first to be unfaithful."" Despite their regular infidelities, she had found great companionship in her marriage to Garley.  It was the second time in her life that bereavement had hit her hard. Professionally, she was very successful.  She spent years with the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing on stage with Alec Guinness, John Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft. She played Hedda Gabler and Lady Macbeth but - to her lifelong regret - never got to play Cleopatra. In 1958, she married actor Robert Arnold who starred in the BBC series Dixon Of Dock Green.  The couple shared 45 years of marriage, before Arnold died of pneumonia in 2003. They had six children together in just seven years, although her second daughter Chloe, born prematurely at 28 weeks, died after just 16 days. In urgent conversation with Doctor Who's assistant, Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen). June Brown played the 13th century 'Lady Eleanor'. They were together - despite many more flings and affairs - for 45 years until his death in 2003. Motherhood saw the acting work dry up.  Brown considered completing her education and even began A level biology.  But she found it too much to juggle in her forties -  with so many children - and never completed the course. She gave acting another go in the 1970s - with a series of small parts in film and television.  There were appearances in Coronation Street and Doctor Who. And then Leslie Grantham, who played EastEnders' Dirty Den put her forward for the part that would make her a British icon. When Dot Cotton arrived in Albert Square in 1985, June Brown was in her late fifties.  She was booked for three months but stayed for more than a quarter of a century. Dot's lot was largely an unhappy one.  She was a hypochondriac, tragic-comic character - gossiping, chain-smoking and always guided by the scriptures. Arriving in Albert Square in 1985. Dot Cotton's troublesome son Nick was played by John Altman For years, she tried - and normally failed - to put her good-for-nothing son, Nick (played by John Altman), on the right track.  Her capacity to forgive him knew almost no bounds. There were breaks from the show.  Dot moved away from the Square in 1993 amid rumours Brown was unhappy with the axing of her friend and co-star Peter Dean - who played Pete Beale. After four years away, Brown returned to the Square and resumed the life of Dot.  Her character's story was used to develop many controversial themes - including cancer, illegal immigration and homophobia. In one compelling storyline she helped her best friend Ethel (played by Gretchen Franklin) to end her life in 2000.  The Observer wrote that it was ""one of the most moving dramatic sequences shown in recent years on British TV."" A 2000 storyline saw Ethel ask Dot to help her die after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. There was constant sparring with her on-screen husband Jim Branning (played by John Bardon), who she married after years of outright rejection.  Dot finally relented and accepted his proposal in an episode that aired in 2001. Their relationship provided many moments to lighten the gloom.  When Dot was stuck for words, her response was always the same - a roll of the eyes and that famous exclamation, ""Ooh I say!"" June Brown with on screen husband, John Bardon. A rare moment of happiness for Dot Cotton. In a special episode in 2003, Dot's Story - Tallulah Pitt-Brown played her character's life history by way of flash-backs. In 2008, June Brown became the first actor in a British soap to carry an entire episode alone.  She delivered an emotional monologue of her character's years of loss and grief - dictated to a cassette for her screen husband Jim - lying in hospital following a stroke. That performance saw her shortlisted for the Bafta for Best Actress.  She was the first from a soap opera to be so honoured since Jean Alexander's nomination for her portrayal of Hilda Ogden 20 years earlier. In 2015, her on screen son, Nick Cotton, finally died from a heroin overdose.  Dot served four months in prison for his manslaughter and retired from the launderette - although she did not leave the series completely. Dot Cotton spent time in prison following the death of her son Nick. Brown continued to make occasional appearances in the series - despite her eyesight beginning to fail.  She finally announced that she intended to leave the show in February 2020. Inevitably, June Brown would often be asked how much she resembled her most famous creation.  There were many similarities. She chain smoked from the age of 16 and would claim that tests had proved her blood was the colour of nicotine.  She was a devout Christian and consummate chatterbox - in turn prone to bursts of melancholy followed by gales of gravelly laughter. But the comparisons only go so far. June Brown was an avid supporter of the Conservative Party. Her favourite TV shows were not the soaps - but Newsnight and Panorama.  Ironically, for a soap star, she thought the time children spend watching television is abominable.  As for Twitter, her views were withering. June Brown at the age of 83 on the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special in 2010. She danced the tango with Vincent Simone. She once told The Times that she was ""never going to be made a Dame doing Dot"" - but she was awarded the MBE for services to drama and charity, before that was upgraded to an OBE in the last New Year Honours. And she claimed to have planned her funeral carefully. ""I want to be buried at sea,"" she told one interviewer.  ""The Britannia Shipping Company drops you off round the Isle of Wight.  I'll be in a nice white nightie and they wrap you in a balsa wood coffin and weight it."" It's probably not what Albert Square's scriptwriters would have planned for Dot Cotton.  But - for June Brown - it would be a fitting send-off for such a ""one of a kind"".

"Channel 4, founded in 1982, is funded by advertising but is publicly owned The government has decided to go ahead with plans to privatise Channel 4. A source said ministers believed public ownership was holding the broadcaster back ""in the face of a rapidly changing media landscape"". Plans for the sale, on which there has been a public consultation, will be included in May's Queen's Speech. But Channel 4 called it ""disappointing"" that ministers had made their decision despite ""significant public interest concerns"" over privatisation. Money made from the sale will be reinvested in a ""creative dividend"" to be shared among the TV industry, with some of it earmarked for independent production companies. Channel 4, founded by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in 1982 to deliver programmes for under-served audiences, is funded by advertising but is publicly owned. Channel 4 consultation over privatisation begins Channel 4 warns of privatisation risks Channel 4 move makes Leeds the new media city Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said: ""Channel 4 rightly holds a cherished place in British life and I want that to remain the case. I have come to the conclusion that government ownership is holding Channel 4 back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. ""A change of ownership will give Channel 4 the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future."" A government source said the channel would lose its ""straitjacket"" but retain its commitment to primetime news programming. The Channel 4 show It's a Sin has been nominated for 11 Bafta awards When it was announced last year that the government was carrying out a consultation on privatising Channel 4, its bosses warned of ""a real risk"" to some of its programmes. Responding to the announcement that the move was going ahead, a spokesperson for the broadcaster said: ""With over 60,000 submissions to the government's public consultation, it is disappointing that today's announcement has been made without formally recognising the significant public interest concerns which have been raised."" They added that there needed to be a ""lengthy legislative process and political debate"", saying: ""Channel 4 remains legally committed to its unique public-service remit. ""The focus for the organisation will be on how we can ensure we deliver the remit to both our viewers and the British creative economy across the whole of the UK."" In 2019, Channel 4, which brought shows including Friends, Big Brother and Countdown to UK audiences, opened a base in Leeds, to operate alongside its London headquarters. For Labour, shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said: ""Selling off Channel 4, which doesn't cost the taxpayer a penny anyway, to what is likely to be a foreign company, makes absolutely no sense. It will cost jobs and opportunities in the North and Yorkshire, and hit the wider British creative economy."" Liberal Democrat culture spokesman Jamie Stone said: ""Occasionally, we as a country manage to magic up a world-renowned gem into being and Channel 4 is a perfect example. And yet this government seems hell-bent on trashing this uniquely British legacy and undermining jobs and investment in the creative sector."" And SNP culture spokesman John Nicolson called the government's decision a ""direct attack on an innovative broadcaster which produces independent, high-quality journalism"".

""But Channel 5 came with big ambitions, with big plans and I don't think opportunities like this come around very often and I can't wait. ""And what an honour to step into the shoes of Sian Williams. I know how popular she is with both the team and also the audience, so all I can say is I will do my best to maintain her incredibly high standards. ""Thank you for watching and I'll see you soon on a TV screen somewhere.""

"Elon Musk's Twitter posts have brought him to the attention of financial regulators. Elon Musk has taken a 9.2% stake in Twitter, according to a US securities filing. The announcement sent Twitter shares soaring by more than 27% in New York trading on Monday. Tesla's chief executive owned 73,486,938 shares in the social media platform as of 14 March, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stake is worth $2.89bn (Â£2.2bn), based on Twitter's closing price on Friday. It makes him the largest shareholder in the company, with more than four times the 2.25% holding of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Mr Musk is a regular Twitter user with more than 80 million followers, although recently he said he is giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform. Late last month, Mr Musk asked his followers whether they thought the social media platform encouraged free speech. ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" He then asked: ""Is a new platform needed?"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He regularly uses Twitter to share updates from the companies he owns - including SpaceX and Neuralink. He is also known for sharing memes, adding to his popularity among fans. But some posts have drawn controversy. Last year he tweeted in response to a claim, made by the head of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), that just 2% of Mr Musk's wealth could help to solve world hunger. In October, Mr Musk said he would sell $6bn in Tesla stock and donate it to the WFP, provided it could describe ""exactly how $6bn will solve world hunger"". This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 Mr Musk saw the valuation of his Tesla car company surpass a market value of $1 trillion last autumn, making it the fifth such firm to reach the milestone, after Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet. Soon after he took to Twitter to ask users if he should sell a 10% stake in the electric carmaker. More than 3.5 million Twitter users voted, with nearly 58% voting in favour of the share sale leading toMusk selling around $5bn (Â£3.7bn) of sharesin the firm in November.

"This video can not be played What is cryptocurrency and how does it work? The Treasury has announced that it will regulate some cryptocurrencies as part of a wider plan to make the UK a hub for digital payment companies. So-called ""stablecoins"" will become recognised forms of payment to give people confidence in using digital currencies, it said. Stablecoins are designed to have a stable value linked to traditional currencies or assets like gold. They are considered less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The Treasury also said it planned to consult on regulating a much wider range of digital currencies later this year, without saying which they might be. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""We want to see the [cryptocurrency] businesses of tomorrow - and the jobs they create - here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term."" The Treasury has not yet confirmed which stablecoins will be regulated; well-known ones include Tether and Binance USD. Stablecoins are currently used in the United States to facilitate trading, lending or borrowing of other digital assets. What is cryptocurrency and how does it work? Why is the richest man in the world talking about Bitcoin? However, they are not without controversy. Tether, a Hong Kong based company, has faced questions over its business practices and was fined $41m in 2021 by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission for allegedly misstating its reserves. The UK's Treasury said regulating stablecoins would ensure they could be used ""safely"" by the public. Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital currencies that can be traded or used to buy goods and services, although not many shops accept them yet and some countries have banned them altogether. They are exchanged via ""peer-to-peer"" transactions, meaning there are no banks or other third parties involved. Wild fluctuation in the value of some digital currencies has led regulators to warn they pose risks. However, they are increasingly going mainstream, with major financial companies now investing in them. Meanwhile, Tesla founder Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, has voiced his support for virtual currencies and said Bitcoin is a ""good thing"". Separately, the Treasury said it will ask The Royal Mint to create a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) this summer. NFTs are assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold, but which have no tangible form of their own. The digital tokens, which emerged in 2014, can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets. NFTs have a unique digital signature which means they cannot be copied or replicated. UK Financial Services Minister John Glen said the UK saw ""enormous potential in crypto"" and had a ""detailed plan [for] harnessing the potential of blockchain and supporting the development of a world-best crypto ecosystem"". ""What does the future of crypto here in the UK look like? No-one knows for sure,"" he said in a speech. ""But we think that by making this country a hospitable place for crypto we can attract investment [and] generate swathes of new jobs."" Regulators are racing to draw up rules to manage cryptocurrencies amid concern that their growing popularity couldthreaten established financial systems. In December, the Bank of England's deputy governor said that while only about 0.1% of UK wealth was currently held as digital assets, that proportion was growing quickly. Sir Jon Cunliffe told the BBC that if the value of cryptocurrencies fell sharply, it could have a knock-on effect. Meanwhile, the US is moving to craft regulationsamid rising concern that the cryptocurrency industry is a haven for criminals. The process of generating digital coins via banks of powerful computers, called mining, is also highly energy intensive. Recent research suggests Bitcoin now generates carbon emissions comparable to the country of Greece. Mr Glen admitted there were concerns about the environmental impact and said the government ""will be looking closely at energy usage associated with certain crypto-technologies"". UK takes next steps in digital money plan How do cryptocurrencies work? Video, 00:02:22How do cryptocurrencies work? What's going on with Bitcoin? What are NFTs and how do non-fungible tokens work?

"Nadia and her three children managed to escape Mariupol after three weeks under siege Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, with no electricity, running water or gas. Multiple efforts to open up corridors for aid distribution and the evacuation of residents have failed. For those who have managed to escape, the suffering is far from over, especially for their children. The first thing they did was buy bread, sausage and water. Nadia Denysenko and her children had escaped after three weeks in Mariupol, under siege and under constant attack, living in their frigid apartment where the windows had blown out after a shell exploded nearby. For days they had very little to eat, and almost nothing to drink. ""We were so happy to have bottled water. We finished it in seconds,"" Nadia said, recalling the moment she reached relative safety with her two sons, aged 14 and five, and 12-year-old daughter. ""When the war started, my youngest son said 'Mum, I'd love to have some bread'."" Theirs is another story of incredible courage amid almost unbelievable tragedy. Inside Mariupol, they spent their days in corridors behind thick walls. Nights were in the basement. They usually woke up at 05:00. The loud explosions, sometimes far, sometimes close, let no-one sleep. ""It was hell. Just hell,"" Nadia, who is 39 and used to work at a supermarket in the city, said. ""You were living your days not knowing whether you'd wake up alive in the morning."" Mariupol has seen the worst horrors of Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Thousands have died as the invading forces surrounded the city, attacking it mercilessly from the air, from the ground and also from the sea. Many are being buried in mass graves, unceremoniously and unnamed. Street after street, building after building, most of Mariupol now lies in ruins. ""We were shelled heavily. They didn't care about anything... My son kept asking, 'Why are there explosions?',"" Nadia said. ""I would tell him, 'Don't worry son. It's just fireworks."" Nadia's youngest son would ask her: ""Why are they trying to kill us?"" During their time in the city, neighbours cooked the little food they had in a field kitchen in the street. ""We often remained outside because it was warmer than inside,"" Nadia said. On their final two days there, they had nothing left to eat. Not even cereal or oatmeal. It did not matter whether you had money. There was no food left in the city. In one of their attempts to flee, they went to a place where cars had gathered, believing it would be an evacuation point. They came under attack. ""It was on purpose,"" she said. They only survived, Nadia said, after a man pushed her and the children ""like puppies"" inside a damaged building, where they thought they would be protected. ""When we left,"" she said, ""we witnessed something terrible."" A car was hit by a shell. The driver, a soldier who was trying to take his family out of the city, was wounded in the head. She and others brought him to a basement, where a girl, who was not a doctor, gave him some stitches using an ordinary needle and thread. ""After seeing all of this we came back home and my younger son asked me, 'Mum, why are they trying to kill us?',"" Nadia said. ""What could I have told him? I don't know."" Nadia thinks her children will be able to overcome what they went through Days later, on 17 March, they finally managed to drive out of the city, as part of a convoy of private vehicles. First, they reached the village of Mangush. They then headed to Berdyansk, which is under Russian control. From there, they boarded a bus to Zaporizhzhia. The road, she said, was full of checkpoints set up by Russian soldiers or Russian-backed separatists. ""They checked us, especially the men, our phones,"" Nadia said. Knowing that could happen, she had already deleted all pictures she had from Mariupol. ""When we left the city, I was all dirty and covered with mud. I hadn't taken a shower. When you've got nothing to drink, you don't think about taking a shower."" It took them five days to travel from Zaporizhzhia to Lviv, in western Ukraine, a region that has been largely spared of Russia's attacks. One of the few signs here that this is a country at war is the sound of air raid sirens, which can go off several times a day. ""We're safe and we can buy food, but my son still hides food: bread, candies. He hides it in different parts of the flat where we're staying,"" she said. She asked him why he was doing that. ""He said, 'So I'll have something to eat tomorrow.'"" Nadia shows a picture of herself in Mariupol: ""They destroyed our city. There is nothing of it left"" Nadia thinks her children will be able to overcome what they went through. She said her daughter, who did not want to come with her for our interview, was a communicative person but still had not made friends in their new city. She wants to be able to return to Mariupol one day, when the war is over and the city rebuilt. ""There is nothing of it left... The city was blossoming and developing. It was just perfect,"" she said. The only thing they did not have, Nadia said, was McDonald's. ""I just don't understand why it all happened. Why did they do it?""

"This video can not be played Watch: Moment Hungary PM makes dig at President Zelensky in victory speech Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has won a fourth term by a landslide in the country's general election, near-complete results show. His right-wing Fidesz party won 135 of 199 seats with almost 99% of the votes counted, preliminary results show. The opposition alliance led by Peter Marki-Zay was far behind with 56 seats. In his victory speech, Mr Orban criticised Brussels bureaucrats and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling them ""opponents"". Mr Zelensky has repeatedly criticised Mr Orban's ban on the transfer of arms to Ukraine, with which it shares a border. However, Mr Orban - who has close ties with Moscow - has condemned the Russian invasion and taken in half a million refugees since the war began in February. ""We never had so many opponents,"" he said, quoted by AFP. ""Brussels bureaucrats... the international mainstream media, and the Ukrainian president."" Following the result, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Mr Orban a congratulatory message on the Telegram messaging app, according to the Kremlin. ""Despite the difficult international situation, the further development of bilateral ties of partnership fully accords with the interests of the peoples of Russia and Hungary,"" Mr Putin wrote. Mr Orban said that his ""huge victory"" could be seen ""from the Moon, but certainly from Brussels as well"". When officially confirmed by Hungary's electoral commission, the victory will be Fidesz's fourth successive win since 2010. The National Election Office said Fidesz would have 135 seats, a two-thirds majority, and the opposition alliance would have 56 seats - again, based on preliminary results. Mr Orban, 58, has had a fraught relationship with the EU, which considers that Fidesz has undermined Hungary's democratic institutions. Victory for Hungary's Orban means a headache for the EU The man who thinks Europe has been invaded In his 12 years in power, Mr Orban has rewritten the constitution, filled the top courts with his appointees and changed the electoral system to his advantage. During campaigning, the opposition's catchphrase was ""Orban or Europe"". Their candidate Peter Marki-Zay argued that Hungary should join Poland, the UK and others in supplying arms to Ukraine. And if called upon, and only within a Nato framework, should even consider sending troops. The opposition complained that Fidesz had isolated Hungary from the European mainstream, and from consensual democracy, fairness and decency. You could almost hear the collective thud of EU hearts sinking last night. A self-styled illiberal democrat, Hungary's leader has repeatedly clashed with Brussels over rule of law issues such as press freedom and migration. They've fallen out over Moscow too. Mr Orban is famed for his warm relations with Vladimir Putin. He signed up to Western sanctions - but refuses to supply Ukraine with weapons. He's the only EU leader to openly criticise President Zelensky. Hungary is becoming increasingly isolated in the EU and Nato - but Mr Orban knows neither institution is keen to ostracise him. They want a show of Western unity to display to Russia. His new term in office means he'll remain an unpredictable thorn in their side. More than 200 international observers monitored the election in Hungary, along with thousands of volunteers from across the political spectrum. Turnout hit 68.69%, almost matching the record number of voters in the last national elections in 2018. Mr Marki-Zay, the conservative opposition leader, conceded defeat late on Sunday evening. ""I will not hide my sadness and my disappointment,"" he told supporters, accusing Fidesz of running a campaign of ""hate and lies"". He claimed the opposition had done ""everything humanly possible"" but that the campaign had been ""an unequal fight"" as anti-Fidesz politicians got so little showing in state media.

"This video can not be played What is cryptocurrency and how does it work? The Treasury has announced that it will regulate some cryptocurrencies as part of a wider plan to make the UK a hub for digital payment companies. So-called ""stablecoins"" will become recognised forms of payment to give people confidence in using digital currencies, it said. Stablecoins are designed to have a stable value linked to traditional currencies or assets like gold. They are considered less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The Treasury also said it planned to consult on regulating a much wider range of digital currencies later this year, without saying which they might be. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""We want to see the [cryptocurrency] businesses of tomorrow - and the jobs they create - here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term."" The Treasury has not yet confirmed which stablecoins will be regulated; well-known ones include Tether and Binance USD. Stablecoins are currently used in the United States to facilitate trading, lending or borrowing of other digital assets. What is cryptocurrency and how does it work? Why is the richest man in the world talking about Bitcoin? However, they are not without controversy. Tether, a Hong Kong based company, has faced questions over its business practices and was fined $41m in 2021 by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission for allegedly misstating its reserves. The UK's Treasury said regulating stablecoins would ensure they could be used ""safely"" by the public. Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital currencies that can be traded or used to buy goods and services, although not many shops accept them yet and some countries have banned them altogether. They are exchanged via ""peer-to-peer"" transactions, meaning there are no banks or other third parties involved. Wild fluctuation in the value of some digital currencies has led regulators to warn they pose risks. However, they are increasingly going mainstream, with major financial companies now investing in them. Meanwhile, Tesla founder Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, has voiced his support for virtual currencies and said Bitcoin is a ""good thing"". Separately, the Treasury said it will ask The Royal Mint to create a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) this summer. NFTs are assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold, but which have no tangible form of their own. The digital tokens, which emerged in 2014, can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets. NFTs have a unique digital signature which means they cannot be copied or replicated. UK Financial Services Minister John Glen said the UK saw ""enormous potential in crypto"" and had a ""detailed plan [for] harnessing the potential of blockchain and supporting the development of a world-best crypto ecosystem"". ""What does the future of crypto here in the UK look like? No-one knows for sure,"" he said in a speech. ""But we think that by making this country a hospitable place for crypto we can attract investment [and] generate swathes of new jobs."" Regulators are racing to draw up rules to manage cryptocurrencies amid concern that their growing popularity couldthreaten established financial systems. In December, the Bank of England's deputy governor said that while only about 0.1% of UK wealth was currently held as digital assets, that proportion was growing quickly. Sir Jon Cunliffe told the BBC that if the value of cryptocurrencies fell sharply, it could have a knock-on effect. Meanwhile, the US is moving to craft regulationsamid rising concern that the cryptocurrency industry is a haven for criminals. The process of generating digital coins via banks of powerful computers, called mining, is also highly energy intensive. Recent research suggests Bitcoin now generates carbon emissions comparable to the country of Greece. Mr Glen admitted there were concerns about the environmental impact and said the government ""will be looking closely at energy usage associated with certain crypto-technologies"".

"UN scientists have unveiled a plan that they believe can limit the root causes of dangerous climate change. A key UN body says in a report that there must be ""rapid, deep and immediate"" cuts in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Global emissions of CO2 would need to peak within three years to stave off the worst impacts. Even then, the world would also need technology to suck CO2 from the skies by mid-century. Wind and solar now supply 10% of world electricity Farmers to be rewarded for using green fertiliser Heatwaves redefined in England over climate change After a contentious approval session where scientists and government officials went through the report line by line, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has now published its guidance on what the world can do to avoid an extremely dangerous future. First, the bad news - even if all the policies to cut carbon that governments had put in place by the end of 2020 were fully implemented, the world will still warm by 3.2C this century. This finding has drawn the ire of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Drought is having an impact in many countries including Bangladesh ""Some government and business leaders are saying one thing - but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic."" That sort of temperature rise would see our planet hit by ""unprecedented heatwaves, terrifying storms, and widespread water shortages"". To avoid that fate, the world must keep the rise in temperatures at or under 1.5C this century, say researchers. The good news is that this latest IPCC summary shows that it can be done, in what Mr Guterres calls a ""viable and financially sound manner"". But keeping temperatures down will require massive changes to energy production, industry, transport, our consumption patterns and the way we treat nature. To stay under 1.5C, according to the IPCC, means that carbon emissions from everything that we do, buy, use or eat must peak by 2025, and tumble rapidly after that, reaching net-zero by the middle of this century. To put it in context, the amount of CO2 that the world has emitted in the last decade is the same amount that's left to us to stay under this key temperature threshold. ""I think the report tells us that we've reached the now-or-never point of limiting warming to 1.5C,"" said IPCC lead author Heleen De Coninck, who's Professor of Socio-Technical Innovation and Climate Change at Eindhoven University of Technology. Speaking to BBC News she said: ""We have to peak our greenhouse gas emissions before 2025 and after that, reduce them very rapidly. ""And we will have to do negative emissions or carbon dioxide removal in the second half of the century, shortly after 2050, in order to limit warming to 1.5C."" Governments will need to look at the provision of low carbon transport The next few years are critical, say the researchers, because if emissions aren't curbed by 2030, it will make it nigh on impossible to limit warming later this century. Key to that in the short term will be how we generate energy. Luckily, solar panel and wind turbines have never been cheaper, having fallen in cost by around 85% over the past decade. ""It's game over for the fossil fuels that are fuelling both wars and climate chaos,"" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the IPCC approval session. ""There's no room for any new fossil fuel developments, and the coal and gas plants we already have need to close early."" But diets and lifestyles will also need changing, with huge scope for major carbon savings, according to the authors. ""Having the right policies, infrastructure and technology in place to enable changes to our lifestyles and behaviour can result in a 40-70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This offers significant untapped potential,"" said IPCC Co-chair Priyadarshi Shukla. ""The evidence also shows that these lifestyle changes can improve our health and wellbeing."" In practice, this means governments doing more to encourage walking and healthy eating, and putting in place the infrastructure for far more electric vehicles. One of the most contentious aspects of the report concerns the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This can be done in a number of different ways, including through planting trees and making changes to farming practices. Solar power has fallen dramatically in price in the last decade But the report finds that to keep warming from going over the dangerous 1.5C threshold, we will need more than new forests. Keeping temperatures down will require machines to remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This is very contentious as the technology is new and currently very expensive. Some participants in the IPCC process are highly sceptical that these approaches will work. ""The idea of quick emissions reductions and large negative emissions technologies are a concern,"" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from UCL, who was an observer in the approval session. ""There are a lot of pipe dreams in this report."" Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"Elon Musk's Twitter posts have brought him to the attention of financial regulators. Elon Musk has taken a 9.2% stake in Twitter, according to a US securities filing. The announcement sent Twitter shares soaring by more than 27% in New York trading on Monday. Tesla's chief executive owned 73,486,938 shares in the social media platform as of 14 March, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stake is worth $2.89bn (Â£2.2bn), based on Twitter's closing price on Friday. It makes him the largest shareholder in the company, with more than four times the 2.25% holding of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Mr Musk is a regular Twitter user with more than 80 million followers, although recently he said he is giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform. Late last month, Mr Musk asked his followers whether they thought the social media platform encouraged free speech. ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.

"Olivia Rodrigo said winning three Grammys was a ""dream come true"". Olivia Rodrigo, Silk Sonic and jazz musician Jon Batiste have shared the top honours at the 64th Grammy Awards. Batiste's uplifting soul record We Are won album of the year, while Rodrigo won best new artist and best pop album. Silk Sonic's soul throwback anthem Leave The Door Open took home both the record and song of the year prizes. Apart from the awards, the ceremony saw a tribute to Foo Fighters star Taylor Hawkins, and avideo plea from Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky. In a pre-taped message, he urged musicians to ""fill the silence"" left by Russian bombs ""with your music"". ""Tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks and TV. But not silence."" His speech was followed by a performance by John Legend, accompanied by Ukrainian musicians Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton; and poet Lyuba Yakimchuk. The ceremony, held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, also saw energetic performances from Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish and BTS, while folk icon Joni Mitchell made a rare on-stage appearance to introduce Brandi Carlile. Who wore what on the red carpet? Foo Fighters win three Grammys after Taylor Hawkins' death Grammy Awards 2022: Main winners and nominees This year's Grammys presented one of the most open fields in years, with the ""big four"" categories expanded to include 10 nominees each. But the Recording Academy tends to favour artists who acknowledge their musical heritage - a factor that undoubtedly helped Silk Sonic and Jon Batiste win their respective categories Batiste's album, We Are, is rooted in black music tradition, from the New Orleans jazz he grew up with, to the classic soul of Al Green, via modern R&B. The title track was written in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 - and the album's themes of positivity and intergenerational wisdom made it a favourite with voters, who awarded Batiste 11 nominations heading into this year's Grammys. Jon Batiste also picked up awards for his work on the soundtrack to the Pixar film, Soul Silk Sonic, a joint project between Bruno Mars and rapper/drummer Anderson .Paak, plough a similar furrow. Their sumptuous ballad Leave The Door Open is steeped in the 70s soul sounds of acts like The Chi-Lites and Earth, Wind & Fire, delivered with a knowing wink to modern sensibilities. The duo were clearly delighted with their double victory in song of the year and record of the year. ""We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point,"" said Paak, ""but in the industry, we call that 'a clean sweep'. ""To all the other nominees... the drinks is on Silk Sonic tonight."" The songcraft of both acts is impeccable, but they leave the Grammys with a headache. Neither act could be considered the defining sound of 2021. In fact, Batiste's album failed to chart in the UK and only reached number 86 in the US. Worse than that, their victories meant that younger, forward-thinking acts like Lil Nas X and Billie Eilish were overlooked - with neither collecting a trophy, despite multiple nominations. Silk Sonic gave a Vegas-themed performance to open the show Thank goodness, then, for Olivia Rodrigo - who was recognised for a stellar debut year that saw her score a global hit with the break-up ballad Drivers License, then top it with the whiplash-inducing pop-punk of Good 4 U. As well as best new artist, she also picked up best pop solo performance and best pop album. The 19-year-old dedicated the latter to her parents, saying the award was ""for you guys and because of you guys"". ""When I was nine years old, I told my mom I was going to be an Olympic gymnast, even though I could barely do a cartwheel,"" she recalled. ""The next week, when I told her I was gonna win a Grammy, she was very supportive, even though I'm sure she thought it was just a little kid pipe dream. ""I want to thank my mom for being supportive of all of my dreams, no matter how crazy; and I want to thank my mom and my dad for being equally as proud of me for winning a Grammy as they were when I learned how to do a back walkover."" There were also three awards for Foo Fighters, a little more than a week after drummer Taylor Hawkins was found dead in his Colombia hotel room at the age of 50. Presenter Jimmy Jamaccepted the prizes in the band's absence, ""with prayers to their loved ones"". The ceremony was held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, after a three month delay due to the Covid-19 surge in the US. ""Don't even think of it as an award show,"" said host Trevor Noah. ""Think of it as a concert where we're giving out awards"". He kept his word. For the first 25 minutes, the show shunned prizes to concentrate on music, with three back-to-back performances from the night's main nominees. Silk Sonic opened the show with a funky strut through their Vegas-themed track 777; followed by Olivia Rodrigo, who gave a sensitive reading of her ballad Drivers License from inside the vintage white Mercedes she drove in the song's video. Third came reggaeton star J Balvin, who pivoted from the sensual duet QuÃ© MÃ¡s Pues to a raucous, intricately-choreographed performance of In De Getto. If the Grammys wanted to display the breadth of this year's nominees in three songs, they succeeded. And then they kept going. BTS tore the roof off the MGM Grand with a heist-themed performance of their pop smash Butter; while Billie Eilish's scorching rendition of Happier Than Ever could only be extinguished by an on-stage rainstorm. BTS performed card tricks, danced through lasers and teased a kiss between singer V (Kim Tae-hyung) and Olivia Rodrigo Chris Stapleton, who dominated the country music categories, gave a gruff but mesmerising performance of best country song winner Cold; and Lady Gaga threw herself into the jazz standards Love For Sale and Do I Love You, as she paid tribute to her duet partner Tony Bennett, who was unable to attend the ceremony for health reasons. At the end of the performance, Gaga was moved to tears. ""I love you, Tony,"" she said into the mic. ""We miss you."" By focusing on music over sketches and set pieces, the Grammys became pacier and less self-indulgent than years gone by. It was the right lesson to learn from last year's scaled-back ceremony, where Covid restrictions forced artists into more intimate stagings. The ceremony also continued last year's innovation of celebrating behind-the-scenes talent, whose livelihoods were interrupted by the pandemic. After highlighting independent music venues in 2021, this year's ceremony turned the spotlight on women working behind the scenes. Among them was Billie Eilish's tour manager Nicole Massey, who called the star as ""the best 20-year-old boss in the world"". Billie Eilish wore a t-shirt paying tribute to Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins The ceremony took place a week after the Oscars - and the altercation between Will Smith and Chris Rock wasn't far from people's minds. During a non-televised portion of the ceremony, one presenter, Nate Bargatze, introduced the classical nominees while sporting a helmet. ""This is what comedians at awards shows have to wear now,"" he joked. Noah also referenced the incident during his opening speech. ""We're going to be dancing, we're going to be singing, we're going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths,"" he said. In contrast to Rock's barbs, however, the South African's monologue was positively good-natured, full of gentle quips about Lil Nas X's height (he's taller than you'd expect) and the show's Las Vegas setting. ""Look at this, people are doing shots,"" he gestured to the audience at home. ""I mean, last year, people were doing shots, but it was more Moderna and Pfizer. This time, we're back in the mix."" In what must have been a relief for the organisers, habitual award show disruptor Kanye West decided not to attend, after having his invitation to perform withdrawn for ""concerning online behaviour"". However, the star (who now goes by the name Ye) picked up two awards in the rap categories: best rap song for Jail and best melodic rap performance for Hurricane. Bennett, meanwhile, became the second-oldest Grammy winner in history. The star, who is 95, won best traditional pop vocal album for the 14th time for Love for Sale, his collaborative album of Cole Porter songs with Lady Gaga. The oldest Grammy winner remains 97-year-old Mississippi blues artist Pinetop Perkins, who won best traditional blues album in 2011 for his record Joined At The Hip.

"Nadia and her three children managed to escape Mariupol after three weeks under siege Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, with no electricity, running water or gas. Multiple efforts to open up corridors for aid distribution and the evacuation of residents have failed. For those who have managed to escape, the suffering is far from over, especially for their children. The first thing they did was buy bread, sausage and water. Nadia Denysenko and her children had escaped after three weeks in Mariupol, under siege and under constant attack, living in their frigid apartment where the windows had blown out after a shell exploded nearby. For days they had very little to eat, and almost nothing to drink. ""We were so happy to have bottled water. We finished it in seconds,"" Nadia said, recalling the moment she reached relative safety with her two sons, aged 14 and five, and 12-year-old daughter. ""When the war started, my youngest son said 'Mum, I'd love to have some bread'."" Theirs is another story of incredible courage amid almost unbelievable tragedy. Inside Mariupol, they spent their days in corridors behind thick walls. Nights were in the basement. They usually woke up at 05:00. The loud explosions, sometimes far, sometimes close, let no-one sleep. ""It was hell. Just hell,"" Nadia, who is 39 and used to work at a supermarket in the city, said. ""You were living your days not knowing whether you'd wake up alive in the morning."" Mariupol has seen the worst horrors of Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Thousands have died as the invading forces surrounded the city, attacking it mercilessly from the air, from the ground and also from the sea. Many are being buried in mass graves, unceremoniously and unnamed. Street after street, building after building, most of Mariupol now lies in ruins. ""We were shelled heavily. They didn't care about anything... My son kept asking, 'Why are there explosions?',"" Nadia said. ""I would tell him, 'Don't worry son. It's just fireworks."" Nadia's youngest son would ask her: ""Why are they trying to kill us?"" During their time in the city, neighbours cooked the little food they had in a field kitchen in the street. ""We often remained outside because it was warmer than inside,"" Nadia said. On their final two days there, they had nothing left to eat. Not even cereal or oatmeal. It did not matter whether you had money. There was no food left in the city. In one of their attempts to flee, they went to a place where cars had gathered, believing it would be an evacuation point. They came under attack. ""It was on purpose,"" she said. They only survived, Nadia said, after a man pushed her and the children ""like puppies"" inside a damaged building, where they thought they would be protected. ""When we left,"" she said, ""we witnessed something terrible."" A car was hit by a shell. The driver, a soldier who was trying to take his family out of the city, was wounded in the head. She and others brought him to a basement, where a girl, who was not a doctor, gave him some stitches using an ordinary needle and thread. ""After seeing all of this we came back home and my younger son asked me, 'Mum, why are they trying to kill us?',"" Nadia said. ""What could I have told him? I don't know."" Nadia thinks her children will be able to overcome what they went through Days later, on 17 March, they finally managed to drive out of the city, as part of a convoy of private vehicles. First, they reached the village of Mangush. They then headed to Berdyansk, which is under Russian control. From there, they boarded a bus to Zaporizhzhia. The road, she said, was full of checkpoints set up by Russian soldiers or Russian-backed separatists. ""They checked us, especially the men, our phones,"" Nadia said. Knowing that could happen, she had already deleted all pictures she had from Mariupol. ""When we left the city, I was all dirty and covered with mud. I hadn't taken a shower. When you've got nothing to drink, you don't think about taking a shower."" It took them five days to travel from Zaporizhzhia to Lviv, in western Ukraine, a region that has been largely spared of Russia's attacks. One of the few signs here that this is a country at war is the sound of air raid sirens, which can go off several times a day. ""We're safe and we can buy food, but my son still hides food: bread, candies. He hides it in different parts of the flat where we're staying,"" she said. She asked him why he was doing that. ""He said, 'So I'll have something to eat tomorrow.'"" Nadia shows a picture of herself in Mariupol: ""They destroyed our city. There is nothing of it left"" Nadia thinks her children will be able to overcome what they went through. She said her daughter, who did not want to come with her for our interview, was a communicative person but still had not made friends in their new city. She wants to be able to return to Mariupol one day, when the war is over and the city rebuilt. ""There is nothing of it left... The city was blossoming and developing. It was just perfect,"" she said. The only thing they did not have, Nadia said, was McDonald's. ""I just don't understand why it all happened. Why did they do it?""

"Tesla says it delivered a record number of its cars in the first quarter, despite supply chain challenges. The electric carmaker says it delivered more than 310,000 vehicles in the first three months of this year. That was almost 70% higher than for the same time last year. Chief executive Elon Musk says the improvement came despite an ""extremely difficult quarter"", including strict coronavirus policies in China, where Tesla has a so-called 'giga factory'. Tesla delivered 310,048 cars from the start of this year to the end of March, up from 184,800 a year earlier, according tofigures released over the weekend,external. ""This was an exceptionally difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions and China zero Covid policy,"" Mr Musk said on Twitter.

The bulk of deliveries were of Tesla's Model 3 sedan and Model Y. Mr Musk previously said the Model Y, which was launched in 2019, was part of Tesla's plan to reach a wider market. The world's most valuable carmaker is set to release its full financial results for the period on 20 April. Tesla has a 'giga factory' in Shanghai, which is a high volume car manufacturing plant, which also produces the lithium-ion batteries that power the vehicles. It was reportedly shut as the city saw a surge in coronavirus infections. Tesla did not resume production at the site on Monday as planned, according to reports that cited an internal memo. The company did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. In January, Mr Musksaid he expected Tesla to grow by more than 50% this yeardespite supply chain problems.

"June Brown, who has died at the age of 95, won her place in British hearts playing the chain-smoking washerwoman, Dot Cotton in EastEnders. It was a part she would play for more than 30 years - well past her 90th birthday. In person, Brown was a riot. One Guardian writer described her as ""Kenneth Williams trapped in the body of Cilla Black"". But like her on-screen persona, her private life was touched by extremes of emotion - with great happiness, romantic love affairs, terrible heartache and family tragedy. June Muriel Brown was born in Needham Market, Suffolk in 1927. Her father, Harry, was a wealthy businessman who went bust investing money in German banks before World War Two. Her mother, Louisa, was a milliner - who June was convinced loved her far less than her four other siblings.  Brown would describe herself as a ""mongrel"".  Her grandfather was from Scotland, her mother from Italian stock. On BBC One's Who Do You Think You Are? she discovered one of her great-great-great grandfathers had been a famous Jewish bare-knuckle fighter in London's East End. June Brown in the part that made her famous. Dot Cotton worked with Pauline Fowler and Ethel Skinner in the Albert Square launderette Her younger brother, John, died of pneumonia in 1932 when he was just 15 days old.  Two years later, June lost her elder sister to meningitis.  The loss of 8 year old Marise affected her deeply. It ""shaped the way I behaved for a long time"", she wrote in her autobiography, Before The Year Dot. ""In particular, it influenced my expectations of men,"" she said.  ""Too dependent, I found it impossible to be happy alone.  I was constantly in and out of love, always looking for the kind of caring she had given me."" Brown was academically able.  She won a scholarship to Ipswich High School and wanted to train as a biologist - but her father put his foot down.  He insisted it would be a waste of money fearing she ""would only go and get married"". She served in the Women's Royal Naval Service at the end of the war.  She was based in Scotland and it was during her time in the WRNS she discovered the joys of acting. When the war was over she got a job as a cinema operator in Argyll.  The newsreels of the liberation of Belsen horrified her.  ""It was extremely shocking for a girl of 18"", she told one interviewer.  ""We were a very innocent generation."" She won a place at London's Old Vic Theatre School where she met and married her first husband, actor John Garley. He suffered from depression and took his own life in 1957. A young June as Aisla Crane in 'The Case of the Frightened Lady' in 1957. ""He gassed himself using the coins I had left him for the gas meter,"" recalled Brown.  ""He'd had an affair with another actress, although I was the first to be unfaithful."" Despite their regular infidelities, she had found great companionship in her marriage to Garley.  It was the second time in her life that bereavement had hit her hard. Professionally, she was very successful.  She spent years with the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing on stage with Alec Guinness, John Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft. She played Hedda Gabler and Lady Macbeth but - to her lifelong regret - never got to play Cleopatra. In 1958, she married actor Robert Arnold who starred in the BBC series Dixon Of Dock Green.  The couple shared 45 years of marriage, before Arnold died of pneumonia in 2003. They had six children together in just seven years, although her second daughter Chloe, born prematurely at 28 weeks, died after just 16 days. In urgent conversation with Doctor Who's assistant, Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen). June Brown played the 13th century 'Lady Eleanor'. They were together - despite many more flings and affairs - for 45 years until his death in 2003. Motherhood saw the acting work dry up.  Brown considered completing her education and even began A level biology.  But she found it too much to juggle in her forties -  with so many children - and never completed the course. She gave acting another go in the 1970s - with a series of small parts in film and television.  There were appearances in Coronation Street and Doctor Who. And then Leslie Grantham, who played EastEnders' Dirty Den put her forward for the part that would make her a British icon. When Dot Cotton arrived in Albert Square in 1985, June Brown was in her late fifties.  She was booked for three months but stayed for more than a quarter of a century. Dot's lot was largely an unhappy one.  She was a hypochondriac, tragic-comic character - gossiping, chain-smoking and always guided by the scriptures. Arriving in Albert Square in 1985. Dot Cotton's troublesome son Nick was played by John Altman For years, she tried - and normally failed - to put her good-for-nothing son, Nick (played by John Altman), on the right track.  Her capacity to forgive him knew almost no bounds. There were breaks from the show.  Dot moved away from the Square in 1993 amid rumours Brown was unhappy with the axing of her friend and co-star Peter Dean - who played Pete Beale. After four years away, Brown returned to the Square and resumed the life of Dot.  Her character's story was used to develop many controversial themes - including cancer, illegal immigration and homophobia. In one compelling storyline she helped her best friend Ethel (played by Gretchen Franklin) to end her life in 2000.  The Observer wrote that it was ""one of the most moving dramatic sequences shown in recent years on British TV."" A 2000 storyline saw Ethel ask Dot to help her die after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. There was constant sparring with her on-screen husband Jim Branning (played by John Bardon), who she married after years of outright rejection.  Dot finally relented and accepted his proposal in an episode that aired in 2001. Their relationship provided many moments to lighten the gloom.  When Dot was stuck for words, her response was always the same - a roll of the eyes and that famous exclamation, ""Ooh I say!"" June Brown with on screen husband, John Bardon. A rare moment of happiness for Dot Cotton. In a special episode in 2003, Dot's Story - Tallulah Pitt-Brown played her character's life history by way of flash-backs. In 2008, June Brown became the first actor in a British soap to carry an entire episode alone.  She delivered an emotional monologue of her character's years of loss and grief - dictated to a cassette for her screen husband Jim - lying in hospital following a stroke. That performance saw her shortlisted for the Bafta for Best Actress.  She was the first from a soap opera to be so honoured since Jean Alexander's nomination for her portrayal of Hilda Ogden 20 years earlier. In 2015, her on screen son, Nick Cotton, finally died from a heroin overdose.  Dot served four months in prison for his manslaughter and retired from the launderette - although she did not leave the series completely. Dot Cotton spent time in prison following the death of her son Nick. Brown continued to make occasional appearances in the series - despite her eyesight beginning to fail.  She finally announced that she intended to leave the show in February 2020. Inevitably, June Brown would often be asked how much she resembled her most famous creation.  There were many similarities. She chain smoked from the age of 16 and would claim that tests had proved her blood was the colour of nicotine.  She was a devout Christian and consummate chatterbox - in turn prone to bursts of melancholy followed by gales of gravelly laughter. But the comparisons only go so far. June Brown was an avid supporter of the Conservative Party. Her favourite TV shows were not the soaps - but Newsnight and Panorama.  Ironically, for a soap star, she thought the time children spend watching television is abominable.  As for Twitter, her views were withering. June Brown at the age of 83 on the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special in 2010. She danced the tango with Vincent Simone. She once told The Times that she was ""never going to be made a Dame doing Dot"" - but she was awarded the MBE for services to drama and charity, before that was upgraded to an OBE in the last New Year Honours. And she claimed to have planned her funeral carefully. ""I want to be buried at sea,"" she told one interviewer.  ""The Britannia Shipping Company drops you off round the Isle of Wight.  I'll be in a nice white nightie and they wrap you in a balsa wood coffin and weight it."" It's probably not what Albert Square's scriptwriters would have planned for Dot Cotton.  But - for June Brown - it would be a fitting send-off for such a ""one of a kind"".

"Elon Musk was joined by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the new factory opening Tesla boss Elon Musk has opened a huge electric car ""gigafactory"" near Berlin which is the first European hub for the firm. The plant was delayed for eight months after local authority licensing problems. The more than â¬5bn (Â£4bn) factory is the biggest investment in a German car plant in recent history. Tesla said more than 3,000 of the factory's expected 12,000 workers had been hired so far. Mr Musk said: ""This is a great day for the factory,"" describing it as ""another step in the direction of a sustainable future"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the plant was a sign of progress and the future of the car industry. But outside, environmental groups protested over concerns ranging from the plant's water use to the trees felled to build it. Activists block an entrance during the opening day of the Tesla factory Gigafactory in Gruenheide near Berlin Tesla will deliver its first 30 German-made Model Y Performance cars on Tuesday. The firm says the cars have a 514km (320 mile) range and cost â¬63,990 (Â£53,000). At full capacity, the plant will produce 500,000 cars annually - more than the 450,000 battery-electric vehicles that German rival Volkswagen sold globally in 2021. It will also make batteries at an annual rate of 50 gigawatt hours (GWh), surpassing all other plants Germany. The new plant, officially called the Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, produces the Model Y and electric car batteries. For now, Volkswagen still holds the upper hand in Europe's electric vehicle market, with a 25% market share to Tesla's 13%. Mr Musk has said ramping up production will take longer than the two years it took to build the plant. Tesla received the final go-ahead from local authorities on 4 March to begin production, provided it met several conditions, covering issues such as water use and air pollution control. The carmaker had come close to losing its water supply contract when local environmental groups filed a complaint against the environmental ministry challenging the licence it granted to Tesla's water supplier.

"This video can not be played Watch: Remembering June Brown and character Dot Cotton EastEnders legend June Brown, who plays Dot Branning/Cotton, has died at the age of 95. With her headscarf and a cigarette in hand, Dot had been a fixture in Walford since 1985, the year the show began. Here are some of her most memorable moments. ""Give us a tea, Lofty. And a glass of water so I can take a Paracetamol."" Those were the first words June Brown uttered as Dot Cotton, on 4 July 1985 - five months after the show launched. ""I got a script and it was a series of illnesses,"" the actress later recalled, explaining how she made Dot a three-dimensional character. ""I thought, I can't play a list of illnesses. I thought, what can I do? Well, she is a hypochondriac and she is always worried about her illnesses. I thought, why? ""Because nobody loves her. Her husband comes and goes. Steals her money, her jewellery. Her son the same - threatens her with a knife and all sorts of things, and she has no-one who really loves her."" Dot (left) with Ethel, played by Gretchen Franklin (centre), and Lou, played by Anna Wing Dot and Ethel (played by Gretchen Franklin) were among the soap's great double acts, and in 1987 they shared a touching two-hander episode in which they reminisced about their lives during the Second World War while babysitting little Vicki. After popping out to buy bread and fig rolls, Dot returned to find Ethel asleep in the armchair and thought she had died. The distraught Dot got the shock of her life when Ethel stirred with the immortal words: ""Did you get those fig rolls?"" Dot was constantly trying to steer her bad boy son Nick (played by John Altman) onto the straight and narrow, with little success. In 1990, he even stooped to almost killing his own ma to steal her big bingo winnings, which he wanted to use to buy drugs. He intended to poison her by cooking a special shepherd's pie, but changed his mind at the last minute and went out for fish and chips instead. After a four-year break from the soap between 1993 and 1997, Dot returned to the Square to be faced with a familiar mix of highs and lows. A different kind of high came when she dabbled in ""alternative therapies"", with viewers seeing Dot stoned when she confused cannabis for herbal tea - and found herself under arrest as a result. One of her most gripping - and controversial - moments came in 2000 when terminally ill Ethel asked Dot to help her take an overdose of morphine to end her life. Dot agreed to go against her strict Christian beliefs and left out pills and a glass of water for her. ""You're the best friend I ever had,"" Ethel told her. The episode was seen by 16.5 million people. Wracked with guilt, Dot turned to shoplifting in order to get herself arrested, but police didn't believe her when she told them about Ethel. After turning him down once, Dot finally agreed to marry neighbour Jim Branning (John Bardon) when he popped the question on the London Eye on Christmas Eve 2001. ""I love you,"" said Jim. ""I don't think you're half bad either,"" was her reply. The pair tied the knot on Valentine's Day 2002. Dot returned to Wales for the spin-off Dot's Story In 2003, a one-off episode titled Dot's Story showed flashbacks to Dot's wartime childhood, when she was evacuated from London to Wales. The couple who took her in welcomed young Dot with open arms, but her arrival soon soured their relationship. Older Dot returned to find the wife on her deathbed and still blaming Dot for running away after the death of her husband. Dot had a whole episode to herself in 2008, the first British soap character to do so. It was a poignant monologue that showed her hidden depths as she recorded a tape for her husband, who had suffered a stroke (a storyline that arose because Bardon had suffered a stroke in real life). The performance earned Brown plaudits including a Bafta nomination for best television actress in 2009, although she didn't win. ""I was a bit disappointed. I would have liked to have got it quite honestly,"" the actress later said. But she got a real gong that year, being made an MBE for services to drama and charity. Dot had always tried to see the good in her wayward son, so viewers were shocked in 2015 to see her let him die. After hearing him own up to multiple murders, she bought heroin for him and decided not to call the emergency services as he overdosed and lay dying in her arms. ""I ain't called the ambulance,"" she told him. ""I prayed to let Jesus decide whether you get better or whether the world was a better place without you."" She confessed to police and spent four months in jail for manslaughter. After coming out of prison, she discovered the launderette where she had worked for all those years was to become a dry cleaner's, and she was out of a job. Viewers saw her say a sad farewell by walking around the shop and turning the lights off at Christmas 2016. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The Tesla Bot was unveiled last summer Elon Musk likes to have a focus - and this year, it looks like it might be robots. He told investors on a Tesla earnings call his nascent robot plans had ""the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business, over time"". And they would be the most important things Tesla worked on this year. The robot in question, part of a project dubbed Optimus, was previewed last year - to raised eyebrows - by a human in a robot suit dancing on stage. And the performance became a popular internet meme. The Tesla Bot, as it was dubbed, would use the same artificial-intelligence (AI) systems that helped power Tesla vehicles, Mr Musk said at the event last August - but no prototype has yet been made. He also said the not-yet-built 5ft 8in robot would have a screen on its ""face"" and be able to lift 150lb and travel at about 5mph. This week, Mr Musk told investors the humanoid robot's first application would be at a Tesla plant ""moving parts around the factory, or something like that"". But in the future, he sees it helping solve labour shortages. Andearlier this week, he tweeted:,external""Tesla AI might play a role in AGI [artificial general intelligence], given that it trains against the outside world, especially with the advent of Optimus"".

AGI refers to the ability of a machine to learn or understand tasks currently performed by humans. Mr Musk has previously warned AI risks killing off human civilisation. And in the same Twitter thread, he added: ""Decentralised control of the robots will be critical."" Professor of robot ethics Alan Winfield, at the University of West England, said: ""AGI is an exceptionally hard problem. ""The idea that you can crack AGI because you have created a driverless vehicle is absurd. ""Even if that car is highly capable, that would not be AGI - it would be high-functioning narrow intelligence. ""Google and Facebook have hired some of the best AI people in the world and the idea that Musk can come in and crack the problem is hubristic in the extreme."" Mr Musk does likes hard problems though, from autonomous cars to trips to Mars, and has plenty of successes. SpaceX's reusable rockets are widely regarded as representing a big step forward for space flights, for example. Pepper was one of the highest profile robots, making appearances at events around the world But previous efforts to create cost-effective mass-market humanoid robots have failed. In June, Japanese conglomerate Softbank announced production of Pepper, a friendly little humanoid, had been paused and would start again only when the robots were needed, much to the dismay of the academic community that used them. That said, robots are increasingly used in factories around the world, with a current average of 126 robots per 10,000 employees in the manufacturing industry, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Keeping robots upright is a big challenge Many, though, remained sceptical about Mr Musk's plans. Accel Robotics software engineer Filip Piekniewskitweeted,external: ""Anyone who thinks Tesla is actually building a humanoid robot is living in an alternate reality. ""Mars bases is more likely than the bot."" And professor of cognitive robotics Tony Prescott, at the University of Sheffield, told BBC News Mr Musk would face many challenges. ""If it is being used in a factory, then a wheel-based robot would be much easier to build and have no problems of balance - but then it wouldn't be humanoid,"" he said. Keeping the robot upright would be one of the biggest issues, Prof Prescott said, along with creating hands and any form of hand-to-eye co-ordination. ""These are fundamental research problems that you need to solve,"" he said. And even robots such as Atlas, designed by Boston Dynamics and regarded as one of the most sophisticated humanoid bots available ""will be attached to the ceiling when it is not making videos"". The AI in cars will be very different to that needed for robots, experts say ""Tesla cars are robots - but they are a much simpler form, so this will be starting from scratch,"" Prof Prescott added. Prof Winfield agrees with Mr Musk on one thing though. ""The only thing that Musk is getting right is that the path towards AGI will be through physical robots,"" he said. ""Our own intelligence is grounded in the real world."" The Tesla boss's new robotics focus may disappoint some customers - in the same earnings call, he also said the company would not be introducing any new car models in 2022. And he does have a history of making rather ambitious promises. In 2019, he said Tesla would have one million robot-taxis on the road by the end of 2020. RIP Pepper robot?

"Elon Musk's Twitter posts have brought him to the attention of financial regulators. Elon Musk has taken a 9.2% stake in Twitter, according to a US securities filing. The announcement sent Twitter shares soaring by more than 27% in New York trading on Monday. Tesla's chief executive owned 73,486,938 shares in the social media platform as of 14 March, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stake is worth $2.89bn (Â£2.2bn), based on Twitter's closing price on Friday. It makes him the largest shareholder in the company, with more than four times the 2.25% holding of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Mr Musk is a regular Twitter user with more than 80 million followers, although recently he said he is giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform. Late last month, Mr Musk asked his followers whether they thought the social media platform encouraged free speech. ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.

"EastEnders actress June Brown, who achieved fame as chain-smoking Dot Cotton, is celebrating her 90th birthday. The actress is one of the BBC soap's longest-running characters and has become a firm favourite with viewers. But like her on-screen persona, Brown's private life has seen its fair share of tragedy. She was born in Suffolk in 1927 to a wealthy father who went bust after investing money in German banks before World War Two. Her younger brother, John, died of pneumonia in 1932 aged just 15 days, and two years later she lost her elder sister, Marise, who was eight. Brown served in the Women's Royal Naval Service at the end of the war before leaving to train at London's Old Vic Theatre School. This video can not be played June Brown: 90 years in 90 seconds There she met and married her first husband, actor John Garley, in 1950, but he had depression and gassed himself to death at home in 1957. A year later, she married actor Robert Arnold who starred in the BBC series Dixon Of Dock Green. The couple shared 45 years of marriage, before Arnold died of pneumonia in 2003. They had six children together, although her second daughter Chloe, born prematurely at 28 weeks, died after just 16 days. Dot Cotton worked with Pauline Fowler and Ethel Skinner in the launderette When Dot Cotton arrived in Albert Square in 1985, Brown was in her late 50s. Actor Leslie Grantham, who played Dirty Den, suggested her for the role. Until then, Brown's career had incorporated stage, film and television, with appearances in Coronation Street and Doctor Who. But the character of Dot was to make the actress a star. Dot's lot was largely an unhappy one - always guided by the scriptures, she tried in vain to put her good-for-nothing son, Nick, on the right track. After a four-year break from the soap between 1993 and 1997, Dot returned to the Square and suffered more torment, helping her best friend Ethel to end her life in a controversial storyline in 2000. A 2000 storyline saw Ethel ask Dot to help her die after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Sparring with her on-screen husband Jim, whom Dot married in 2002, provided some lighter moments and when Dot was stuck for words, her response was the inevitable: ""Ooh I say!"". In 2008, the actress became the first actor in a British soap to carry an entire episode alone, with an emotional monologue dictated to a cassette for her screen husband to listen to in hospital following a stroke. That same year she was made an MBE for services to drama and charity. Brown told The Times in 1997 she was ""never going to be made a Dame doing Dot"", but she was on her way. Over the past decade Dot has had an eventful life in Albert Square, including seeing her son Nick return after faking his own death - and then watch him die from a heroin overdose. She subsequently served four months in prison for his manslaughter and retired from the launderette in recent months.

"This video can not be played Watch: Remembering June Brown and character Dot Cotton Actress June Brown, who played the much-loved character Dot Cotton on EastEnders for more than three decades, has died at the age of 95. Her family said they were ""deeply saddened"" to announce that their ""beloved mother"" had died ""very peacefully"" at her home on Sunday. EastEnders actor Adam Woodyatt described her as an ""incredible woman"". Dot Cotton was one of the BBC soap's longest-running characters and a favourite with viewers. Brown first appeared in the series in 1985, the year EastEnders was created. She stayed until 1993, returning to play the same character from 1997 until 2020. June Brown obituary: 'In person, she was a riot' The Dot Cotton story in pictures How EastEnders star June Brown rose to fame June Brown's 10 best EastEnders moments as Dot Cotton An EastEnders spokesperson said: ""There are not enough words to describe how much June was loved and adored by everyone at EastEnders, her loving warmth, wit and great humour will never be forgotten. ""June created one of the most iconic characters in Dot Cotton, not just in soap but in British television, and having appeared in 2884 episodes, June's remarkable performances created some of EastEnders finest moments."" After Brown's death was announced, many fans began sharing their favourite TV moment of hers - when the actress met Lady Gaga on the BBC's Graham Norton show. This video can not be played Watch: When Eastenders legend June Brown met Lady Gaga One of EastEnders' best-known stars, Brown was in her late 50s when she joined Albert Square. Actor Leslie Grantham, who played Dirty Den, suggested her for the role. Until then, Brown's career had incorporated stage, film and television, with appearances in Coronation Street and Doctor Who. Some of her biggest storylines included Nasty Nick's murder plot, when her son, played by John Altman, planned to poison her so he could steal her big bingo winnings to use on drugs. He changed his mind at the last minute. One of her most moving and controversial moments came when her close friend Ethel, who was terminally ill, asked Dot to help her take an overdose of morphine to end her life. Dot wrestled with her Christian beliefs but ultimately decided to leave out morphine pills for Ethel to take. Her relationship with husband Jim Branning, played by the late John Bardon, was much cherished by fans of the soap. EastEnders' June Brown losing her sight Listen: June Brown on Desert Island Discs EastEnders' June Brown leaves soap 'for good' Brown remained a favourite with viewers for years, but during a podcast interview in February 2020,she confirmedthat she had left the series ""for good"". In the last episode she featured in, Dot Cotton - or Dot Branning - left a voicemail message for another character, Sonia Fowler, saying she had moved to Ireland. Brown's EastEnders co-stars helped her celebrate her 90th birthday in 2017 Following the news of Brown's death, Woodyatt - who played Ian Beale in the soap for 35 years - said in a statement: ""I'm lost for words, something June never was. ""So many memories, so much fun. Just purely and simply an incredible woman who had the most incredible life and career, I was fortunate to have shared a small part of it. They never made you a Dame (we did try), but to me you will always be Dame Brown."" Gillian Taylforth, who plays Kathy Beale in the BBC soap, said: ""I'm truly heartbroken by this news. June Brown OBE, MBE, was an amazing woman and a truly wonderful actress. I shared many scenes with her over the years and she was always someone I looked up to and learnt from. There will never be another June Brown and I'm sending all my love to her family."" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said Brown was a ""true national treasure"". ""There was nobody quite like June Brown. She captured the zeitgeist of British culture like no other in her many years on our screens,"" she said. ""Today we've lost a true national treasure but my goodness what a life she has led. Rest in peace."" Brown (pictured outside Buckingham Palace) was made an MBE in 2008 EastEnders executive producer Chris Clenshaw said Brown was an ""iconic"" character both on and off screen. The BBC's director-general Tim Davie said: ""June Brown was a brilliantly talented actor who was loved by millions.  Her performances as the incomparable Dot Cotton delivered some of the most memorable moments in soap history."" ""Our thoughts are with her family and many friends."" Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Watch: Moment Hungary PM makes dig at President Zelensky in victory speech Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has won a fourth term by a landslide in the country's general election, near-complete results show. His right-wing Fidesz party won 135 of 199 seats with almost 99% of the votes counted, preliminary results show. The opposition alliance led by Peter Marki-Zay was far behind with 56 seats. In his victory speech, Mr Orban criticised Brussels bureaucrats and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling them ""opponents"". Mr Zelensky has repeatedly criticised Mr Orban's ban on the transfer of arms to Ukraine, with which it shares a border. However, Mr Orban - who has close ties with Moscow - has condemned the Russian invasion and taken in half a million refugees since the war began in February. ""We never had so many opponents,"" he said, quoted by AFP. ""Brussels bureaucrats... the international mainstream media, and the Ukrainian president."" Following the result, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Mr Orban a congratulatory message on the Telegram messaging app, according to the Kremlin. ""Despite the difficult international situation, the further development of bilateral ties of partnership fully accords with the interests of the peoples of Russia and Hungary,"" Mr Putin wrote. Mr Orban said that his ""huge victory"" could be seen ""from the Moon, but certainly from Brussels as well"". When officially confirmed by Hungary's electoral commission, the victory will be Fidesz's fourth successive win since 2010. The National Election Office said Fidesz would have 135 seats, a two-thirds majority, and the opposition alliance would have 56 seats - again, based on preliminary results. Mr Orban, 58, has had a fraught relationship with the EU, which considers that Fidesz has undermined Hungary's democratic institutions. Victory for Hungary's Orban means a headache for the EU The man who thinks Europe has been invaded In his 12 years in power, Mr Orban has rewritten the constitution, filled the top courts with his appointees and changed the electoral system to his advantage. During campaigning, the opposition's catchphrase was ""Orban or Europe"". Their candidate Peter Marki-Zay argued that Hungary should join Poland, the UK and others in supplying arms to Ukraine. And if called upon, and only within a Nato framework, should even consider sending troops. The opposition complained that Fidesz had isolated Hungary from the European mainstream, and from consensual democracy, fairness and decency. You could almost hear the collective thud of EU hearts sinking last night. A self-styled illiberal democrat, Hungary's leader has repeatedly clashed with Brussels over rule of law issues such as press freedom and migration. They've fallen out over Moscow too. Mr Orban is famed for his warm relations with Vladimir Putin. He signed up to Western sanctions - but refuses to supply Ukraine with weapons. He's the only EU leader to openly criticise President Zelensky. Hungary is becoming increasingly isolated in the EU and Nato - but Mr Orban knows neither institution is keen to ostracise him. They want a show of Western unity to display to Russia. His new term in office means he'll remain an unpredictable thorn in their side. More than 200 international observers monitored the election in Hungary, along with thousands of volunteers from across the political spectrum. Turnout hit 68.69%, almost matching the record number of voters in the last national elections in 2018. Mr Marki-Zay, the conservative opposition leader, conceded defeat late on Sunday evening. ""I will not hide my sadness and my disappointment,"" he told supporters, accusing Fidesz of running a campaign of ""hate and lies"". He claimed the opposition had done ""everything humanly possible"" but that the campaign had been ""an unequal fight"" as anti-Fidesz politicians got so little showing in state media.

"Tesla says it delivered a record number of its cars in the first quarter, despite supply chain challenges. The electric carmaker says it delivered more than 310,000 vehicles in the first three months of this year. That was almost 70% higher than for the same time last year. Chief executive Elon Musk says the improvement came despite an ""extremely difficult quarter"", including strict coronavirus policies in China, where Tesla has a so-called 'giga factory'. Tesla delivered 310,048 cars from the start of this year to the end of March, up from 184,800 a year earlier, according tofigures released over the weekend,external.

The bulk of deliveries were of Tesla's Model 3 sedan and Model Y. Mr Musk previously said the Model Y, which was launched in 2019, was part of Tesla's plan to reach a wider market. The world's most valuable carmaker is set to release its full financial results for the period on 20 April. Tesla has a 'giga factory' in Shanghai, which is a high volume car manufacturing plant, which also produces the lithium-ion batteries that power the vehicles. It was reportedly shut as the city saw a surge in coronavirus infections. Tesla did not resume production at the site on Monday as planned, according to reports that cited an internal memo. The company did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. In January, Mr Musksaid he expected Tesla to grow by more than 50% this yeardespite supply chain problems. The firm reported a record $5.5bn (Â£4.2bn) profit last year.

"As a conservative challenger, Peter Marki-Zay represents six opposition parties After 12 years in power, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is asking for eight more, but his right-wing Fidesz government is facing a strong challenge from an alliance of six opposition parties. Led by independent conservative Peter Marki-Zay, this alliance ranging from left to right aims to topple the Orban government on 3 April and opinion polls suggest a close race. But the playing field slopes steeply in favour of Mr Orban. The government dominates the media and enjoys massive financial resources: its spending on social media ads alone is three times that of the opposition parties. Its greatest asset is Viktor Orban himself, and his invincible reputation. He is also keen to export ""the Hungarian model"" of national sovereignty, around Europe and beyond. What makes him different to all the other challengers who've tried and failed to unseat Viktor Orban over the years is that he's a conservative. Peter Marki-Zay has emerged as the first serious opposition challenger to Viktor Orban in years Saint Stephen's church in the southern town of Mako is packed on a Sunday morning. Hymns are sung to a guitar accompaniment. The deep, patient voice of the young priest, Zoltan Palfai, radiates calm. The congregation obediently wear masks, ever cautious even as the pandemic in Hungary subsides. Towards the back on the right, Peter Marki-Zay sits as discreetly as he can between his wife and eldest daughter. At 49, he's nine years younger than Mr Orban. He's taller, fitter, and has even more children - seven to Mr Orban's five. And while Viktor Orban adeptly turns each criticism of his policies from the liberal left to his own advantage, Mr Marki-Zay attacks him on his home ground, from the right. Mr Orban's vaunted defence of the nation and that of his Fidesz party is a lie, he suggests. ""I'm convinced he's not a patriot at all,"" he says. ""He's not a Christian either. They have no principles, nationalistic values, religion. They are opportunists. Orban is the ultimate pragmatist. He would do anything to stay in power and get richer."" There's little love lost for Peter Marki-Zay on the government side either. Since he came a surprising first in opposition primaries last autumn, the government has launched an unprecedented campaign against him. Posters on every street corner and short video ads on YouTube portray him as ""mini-Feri"" - the puppet of former Socialist premier Ferenc Gyurcsany, whose DK party is part of the six-party coalition behind him. Could this man oust Hungary's powerful PM Orban? The contrast could not be greater between Viktor Orban's big team and the opposition leader, driven round by his wife, his social media content produced by his children. Fidesz, meanwhile, dissects every remark the challenger makes to undermine his credibility. He stands accused of denigrating women, pensioners and insulting Fidesz voters. Viktor Orban says Hungary under his leadership has thought differently about nation-states Mr Orban is a country boy too, but nowadays rubs shoulders with the rich and powerful. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is due this week and the Hungarian leader recently spent five hours with Russian President Vladimir Putin. US Republicans will hold their annual CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference) in the capital, Budapest, at the end of March, and there are rumours that former US President Donald Trump will be guest of honour. Mr Orban is loved far beyond Hungary's borders as a champion of ""traditional values"" against ""liberal elites"". Mr Orban has very good relations with Russia's Vladimir Putin ""We think differently from each other about Europe's precious legacy of tradition,"" he thundered, in his state of the nation address on 12 February. ""We think differently about the future of nations and nation-states; we think differently about globalisation; and now we think differently about the family."" Profile: Viktor Orban Hungary defies EU over immigration law Agoston Mraz of pro-government think-tank Nezopont predicts that Fidesz will win 110 seats in the 199-seat parliament (down from the current 133). He suggests only 200,000 people are yet to make up their minds. However, Mr Marki-Zay cites a poll suggesting 53% of Hungarians want a change of government. He says he's trying to appeal to one-third of the 8.3 million-strong electorate who are not committed to either government or opposition. In the 2018 election, Fidesz won with 2.8 million votes to 2.7 million for all the opposition parties combined, on a 70% turnout. Seven weeks before this election, there's still everything to play for. In Mako, the Fidesz campaign to undermine the conservative challenger appears to be having an effect. ""We really dislike him. We're not political at all, but those things he says, how he insults the voters,"" one woman told the BBC in the town's farmers' market as Peter Marki-Zay canvassed potential voters. ""There's no ink on Earth that could print what I think of him,"" hissed a cheese stall-holder, as the opposition leader strolled by with his wife. ""His rhetoric seems so extreme, he should be better prepared,"" said another. But some at the market quietly support him: ""He's got a good face, and clear eyes. I'll vote for him,"" said a woman selling leather boots. ""He has a chance. We believe in him. Because he's an educated man,"" said another stall-holder.

"Olivia Rodrigo said winning three Grammys was a ""dream come true"". Olivia Rodrigo, Silk Sonic and jazz musician Jon Batiste have shared the top honours at the 64th Grammy Awards. Batiste's uplifting soul record We Are won album of the year, while Rodrigo won best new artist and best pop album. Silk Sonic's soul throwback anthem Leave The Door Open took home both the record and song of the year prizes. Apart from the awards, the ceremony saw a tribute to Foo Fighters star Taylor Hawkins, and avideo plea from Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky. In a pre-taped message, he urged musicians to ""fill the silence"" left by Russian bombs ""with your music"". ""Tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks and TV. But not silence."" His speech was followed by a performance by John Legend, accompanied by Ukrainian musicians Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton; and poet Lyuba Yakimchuk. The ceremony, held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, also saw energetic performances from Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish and BTS, while folk icon Joni Mitchell made a rare on-stage appearance to introduce Brandi Carlile. Who wore what on the red carpet? Foo Fighters win three Grammys after Taylor Hawkins' death Grammy Awards 2022: Main winners and nominees This year's Grammys presented one of the most open fields in years, with the ""big four"" categories expanded to include 10 nominees each. But the Recording Academy tends to favour artists who acknowledge their musical heritage - a factor that undoubtedly helped Silk Sonic and Jon Batiste win their respective categories Batiste's album, We Are, is rooted in black music tradition, from the New Orleans jazz he grew up with, to the classic soul of Al Green, via modern R&B. The title track was written in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 - and the album's themes of positivity and intergenerational wisdom made it a favourite with voters, who awarded Batiste 11 nominations heading into this year's Grammys. Jon Batiste also picked up awards for his work on the soundtrack to the Pixar film, Soul Silk Sonic, a joint project between Bruno Mars and rapper/drummer Anderson .Paak, plough a similar furrow. Their sumptuous ballad Leave The Door Open is steeped in the 70s soul sounds of acts like The Chi-Lites and Earth, Wind & Fire, delivered with a knowing wink to modern sensibilities. The duo were clearly delighted with their double victory in song of the year and record of the year. ""We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point,"" said Paak, ""but in the industry, we call that 'a clean sweep'. ""To all the other nominees... the drinks is on Silk Sonic tonight."" The songcraft of both acts is impeccable, but they leave the Grammys with a headache. Neither act could be considered the defining sound of 2021. In fact, Batiste's album failed to chart in the UK and only reached number 86 in the US. Worse than that, their victories meant that younger, forward-thinking acts like Lil Nas X and Billie Eilish were overlooked - with neither collecting a trophy, despite multiple nominations. Silk Sonic gave a Vegas-themed performance to open the show Thank goodness, then, for Olivia Rodrigo - who was recognised for a stellar debut year that saw her score a global hit with the break-up ballad Drivers License, then top it with the whiplash-inducing pop-punk of Good 4 U. As well as best new artist, she also picked up best pop solo performance and best pop album. The 19-year-old dedicated the latter to her parents, saying the award was ""for you guys and because of you guys"". ""When I was nine years old, I told my mom I was going to be an Olympic gymnast, even though I could barely do a cartwheel,"" she recalled. ""The next week, when I told her I was gonna win a Grammy, she was very supportive, even though I'm sure she thought it was just a little kid pipe dream. ""I want to thank my mom for being supportive of all of my dreams, no matter how crazy; and I want to thank my mom and my dad for being equally as proud of me for winning a Grammy as they were when I learned how to do a back walkover."" There were also three awards for Foo Fighters, a little more than a week after drummer Taylor Hawkins was found dead in his Colombia hotel room at the age of 50. Presenter Jimmy Jamaccepted the prizes in the band's absence, ""with prayers to their loved ones"". The ceremony was held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, after a three month delay due to the Covid-19 surge in the US. ""Don't even think of it as an award show,"" said host Trevor Noah. ""Think of it as a concert where we're giving out awards"". He kept his word. For the first 25 minutes, the show shunned prizes to concentrate on music, with three back-to-back performances from the night's main nominees. Silk Sonic opened the show with a funky strut through their Vegas-themed track 777; followed by Olivia Rodrigo, who gave a sensitive reading of her ballad Drivers License from inside the vintage white Mercedes she drove in the song's video. Third came reggaeton star J Balvin, who pivoted from the sensual duet QuÃ© MÃ¡s Pues to a raucous, intricately-choreographed performance of In De Getto. If the Grammys wanted to display the breadth of this year's nominees in three songs, they succeeded. And then they kept going. BTS tore the roof off the MGM Grand with a heist-themed performance of their pop smash Butter; while Billie Eilish's scorching rendition of Happier Than Ever could only be extinguished by an on-stage rainstorm. BTS performed card tricks, danced through lasers and teased a kiss between singer V (Kim Tae-hyung) and Olivia Rodrigo Chris Stapleton, who dominated the country music categories, gave a gruff but mesmerising performance of best country song winner Cold; and Lady Gaga threw herself into the jazz standards Love For Sale and Do I Love You, as she paid tribute to her duet partner Tony Bennett, who was unable to attend the ceremony for health reasons. At the end of the performance, Gaga was moved to tears. ""I love you, Tony,"" she said into the mic. ""We miss you."" By focusing on music over sketches and set pieces, the Grammys became pacier and less self-indulgent than years gone by. It was the right lesson to learn from last year's scaled-back ceremony, where Covid restrictions forced artists into more intimate stagings. The ceremony also continued last year's innovation of celebrating behind-the-scenes talent, whose livelihoods were interrupted by the pandemic. After highlighting independent music venues in 2021, this year's ceremony turned the spotlight on women working behind the scenes. Among them was Billie Eilish's tour manager Nicole Massey, who called the star as ""the best 20-year-old boss in the world"". Billie Eilish wore a t-shirt paying tribute to Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins The ceremony took place a week after the Oscars - and the altercation between Will Smith and Chris Rock wasn't far from people's minds. During a non-televised portion of the ceremony, one presenter, Nate Bargatze, introduced the classical nominees while sporting a helmet. ""This is what comedians at awards shows have to wear now,"" he joked. Noah also referenced the incident during his opening speech. ""We're going to be dancing, we're going to be singing, we're going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths,"" he said. In contrast to Rock's barbs, however, the South African's monologue was positively good-natured, full of gentle quips about Lil Nas X's height (he's taller than you'd expect) and the show's Las Vegas setting. ""Look at this, people are doing shots,"" he gestured to the audience at home. ""I mean, last year, people were doing shots, but it was more Moderna and Pfizer. This time, we're back in the mix."" In what must have been a relief for the organisers, habitual award show disruptor Kanye West decided not to attend, after having his invitation to perform withdrawn for ""concerning online behaviour"". However, the star (who now goes by the name Ye) picked up two awards in the rap categories: best rap song for Jail and best melodic rap performance for Hurricane. Bennett, meanwhile, became the second-oldest Grammy winner in history. The star, who is 95, won best traditional pop vocal album for the 14th time for Love for Sale, his collaborative album of Cole Porter songs with Lady Gaga. The oldest Grammy winner remains 97-year-old Mississippi blues artist Pinetop Perkins, who won best traditional blues album in 2011 for his record Joined At The Hip.

"Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has already started celebrating Projected results from Serbia's presidential and parliamentary elections suggest that Aleksandar Vucic and his Progressive Party have both won comfortable victories. In a joint forecast, the CeSID election monitor and Ipsos polling organisation predict that Mr Vucic will win a second five-year term as president by taking almost 60% of the vote. Meanwhile, the Progressive Party will maintain their dominance in the National Assembly, securing more than 40 percent of the vote. Assuming they form their usual coalition with the Socialist Party, they should have a comfortable governing majority. Mr Vucic said he was ""proud"" of the ""great support of the people"" - and described his campaign as ""the cleanest and most beautiful in the history of Serbia"". He listed the priorities for his second term as continuing Serbia's modernisation, attracting foreign investments and ensuring peace and stability. And he indicated that he would aim to maintain Belgrade's traditional ties with Moscow, despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine - while continuing with EU membership negotiations. ""Good relations in the region are the most important thing, but also not breaking ties with traditional friends,"" he said. Opposition parties will be bitterly disappointed with the results. They boycotted the previous parliamentary election in 2020, claiming that government influence over the media made a free and fair vote impossible. Their absence just allowed the Progressive Party to govern unopposed. Serbia's dominant leader performs balancing act So this time a wide range of parties formed a coalition, United Serbia, to offer voters a credible alternative. They promoted a former general, Zdravko Ponos, as their presidential candidate - and hoped he would at least force Mr Vucic into a second round. But he fell a long way short - polling less than 20%. United Serbia will now form the second largest bloc in the National Assembly - where they will be joined by the new, green-left movement, Moramo. One of the latter's most prominent members, the environmentalist Aleksandar Jovanovic, questioned why the national election commission had failed to publish preliminary results. He called on his supporters to ""defend every vote on the street"" if evidence of voting irregularities emerged. And he said the Environmental Uprising campaign would continue its protests against pollution and lithium mining in Serbia - both of which had become hot topics before the start of the war in Ukraine. The election commission is set to publish the official results on Monday evening. But it already seems clear that Serbia's voters have chosen the ""peace and stability"" which Mr Vucic told them he and his party offer.
