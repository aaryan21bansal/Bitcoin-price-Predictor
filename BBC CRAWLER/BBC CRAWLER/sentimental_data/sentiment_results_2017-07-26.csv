"A villager points to the house where a teenage girl was raped in Muzaffarabad, Multan Some 20 people from Multan, Pakistan, have been arrested for ordering the rape of a teenage girl, in revenge for a rape her brother allegedly committed. Police said the families of the two girls are related. Members of both had joined forces to decide what should be done. ""A jirga [village council] had ordered the rape of a 16-year-old girl as punishment, as her brother had raped a 12-year-old,"" police official Allah Baksh told AFP. He said the village council was approached earlier this month by a man who said his 12-year-old sister had been raped by their cousin. The council then ordered the complainant to rape the sister of the accused in return - which police say he did. Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reported,externalthat the girl was forced to appear before the group and raped in front of them and her parents. The mothers of the two girls later filed complaints at the local police station. Medical examinations have confirmed rape in both cases. Reports suggest the second girl was raped in front of the family council Another officer, Ahsan Younas, told  BBC Urdu that the first girl to be raped was aged between 12 and 14. The victim of the revenge rape is said to be 16 or 17. He said police had registered a complaint against 25 people, and that the suspect accused of raping the 12-year-old was still at large. While some reports say the group that ordered the rape was a jirga - or village council - BBC sources said it was actually formed by members of the two families. How a rape was filmed and shared in Pakistan Pakistan elders 'ordered girl's death' How a murdered social media star reflects Pakistan Jirgas, a kind of council formed of local elders, often settle disputes in rural Pakistan. However, they are illegal and have been condemned for a series of controversial rulings - including ordering so-called ""honour killings"" and past incidents of ""revenge rape"". In 2002, a jirga ordered the gang rape of 28-year-old Mukhtar Mai, whose 12-year-old brother was accused of an affair with an older woman. Mukhtar Mai, pictured in 2011, was gang-raped by order of a tribal council Ms Mai took her rapists to court - an act of extraordinary courage in Pakistan, where sexual assault victims still face considerable stigma. When their convictions wereoverturned by Pakistan's Supreme Court, she was offered many ways out of the country. However, she chose to stay in her village and start a girls' school and a women's refuge yards away from where she was raped. Profile: Who is Mukhtar Mai? Ms Mai is now a prominent women's rights activist, and her story inspired an opera, ""Thumbprint"", which opened in New York in 2014. Rape survivor takes to Pakistan catwalk.

"Eleanor Wilson was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct A teacher who had sex with a student in a plane toilet on a school trip has been banned from the profession. Eleanor Wilson, 28, who worked in Bristol, kissed the pupil and drank alcohol with him while on the flight. A National College for Teaching & Leadership (NCTL) panel found she engaged in sexual activity with a male pupil in August 2015. The panel'sreport,externalfound her guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and banned her from teaching indefinitely. The NCTL found an ""inappropriate relationship"" took place with the pupil in 2015/16 when she met him in her office, shared her mobile number with him, took him on outings, drank alcohol with him and kissed him on more than one occasion. Miss Wilson also encouraged the pupil, who has not been identified, to hide their relationship and lied about it when an investigation into the allegations was undertaken by the school, the panel said. The panel ruled she ""fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession"".

"This video can not be played The video (in Italian) showing the river next to Lavertezzo, in Switzerland, has gone viral Most people would be delighted if their home town was compared to the Maldives, one of the world's top beauty spots. But not, it seems, those living in the village of Lavertezzo, Switzerland.

How an Italian winemaker is taking on Sicily's rural mafia Cruise tourists overwhelm Europe's ancient resorts In it, filmmaker Marco Capedri and his friend Federico Sambruni frolic in the crystal clear waters of the Verzasca river, in the shadow of an imposing double-arched stone bridge. ""A magnificent canyon crossed with emerald waters - one hour from Milan and 45 minutes from Varese,"" Mr Capedri's post proclaimed. With that, Lavertezzo's residents - who are no strangers to tourists - found themselves overwhelmed by Italians crossing the border in search of a taste of paradise. ""I thought the valley had exploded,"" one resident told Ticino News[in Italian],external. Another accused the tourists, who came from all over, of turning the valley into ""an outdoor toilet"" and ""running semi-naked down the street"". The reporter, meanwhile, noted the ""socks, cigarettes and cans"" left behind by the day-trippers. The town's mayor, Roberto Bacciarini, was more circumspect in his response. Speaking to Italian newspaper Repubblica[in Italian],external, he admitted the video had done ""a good job"" in attracting people to the area, but added: ""[Mr Capedri] would do us a favour if he asked his compatriots to park their cars in an orderly manner, and respect the rules of the place.""

"The Premier League has been awarded a High Court order for the forthcoming 2017-18 season, which will help it combat the illegal streaming of games. The blocking order will require UK Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to prevent people from illegally accessing streams of its matches. It will allow the league to combat the illicit sale and use of devices such as pre-loaded IPTV and Kodi boxes. A similar order was obtained for the final two months of the 2016-17 season. That saw more than 5,000 server IP addresses blocked that had previously been streaming Premier League content. Sky and BT Sport hold the live rights for Premier League football. The two firms paid a record Â£5.136bn for rights to show live matches for three seasons. Kodi is free software, built by volunteers, that is designed to bring videos, music, games and photographs together in one easy-to-use application. Some shops sell set-top boxes and TV sticks known as Kodi boxes, preloaded with the software. The developers behind Kodi say their software does not contain any content of its own and is designed to play legally owned media or content ""freely available"" on the internet. However, the software can be modified with third-party add-ons that provide access to pirated copies of films and TV series, or provide free access to subscription television channels and programmes, including sports events. The English top flight League is currently undertaking its biggest ever copyright protection programme. Its anti-piracy efforts have also contributed to a range of prominent apps and add-ons being closed down as the law catches up with them. ""This blocking order is a game-changer in our efforts to tackle the supply and use of illicit streams of our content,"" said Premier League Director of Legal Services, Kevin Plumb. ""It will allow us to quickly and effectively block and disrupt the illegal broadcast of Premier League football via any means, including so called 'pre-loaded Kodi boxes'. ""The protection of our copyright, and the investment made by our broadcast partners, is hugely important to the Premier League and the future health of English football."" A recent poll of 1,000 people forBBC 5 live Daily found: Nearly half of fans say they have streamed a match online through an unofficial provider - just over a third do so at least once a month and about one in five at least once a week The main reasons include a friend/family member doing it and they just watch; the quality of the stream; and because sports TV packages are considered not good value for money Just under a third of fans do not know whether it is illegal to stream live Premier League matches online from unofficial providers, but another third believe it is always illegal.

"It is time to reconsider the widespread advice that people should always complete an entire course of antibiotics, experts in the BMJ say. They argue there is not enough evidence to back the idea that stopping pills early encourages antibiotic resistance. Instead, they suggest, more studies need to be done to see if stopping once feeling better can help cut antibiotic use. But GPs urge people not to change their behaviour in the face of one study. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, leader of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said an improvement in symptoms did not necessarily mean the infection had been completely eradicated. ""It's important that patients have clear messages, and the mantra to always take the full course of antibiotics is well known - changing this will simply confuse people."" Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypse World's most threatening superbugs ranked in new list Oral sex spreading unstoppable bacteria The opinion piece, by a team of researchers from across England, argues that reducing the use of antibiotics is essential to help combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Prof Martin Llewelyn, from the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, together with colleagues, argues that using antibiotics for longer than necessary can increase the risk of resistance. He suggests traditional long prescriptions for antibiotics were based on the outdated idea that resistance to an antibiotic could develop when a drug was not taken for a lengthy time and an infection was undertreated. Instead, he says, there is now growing evidence that short courses of antibiotics - lasting three to five days, for example - work just as well to treat many bugs. He accepts there are a few exceptions - for example, giving just one type of antibiotic for TB infections - which is known to lead to rapid resistance. But the team says it is important to move away from blanket prescriptions and, with more research, give antibiotic prescriptions that are tailored to each infection and each person. The study acknowledges that hospitals are increasingly reviewing the need for antibiotics from day to day and that there is a growing trend towards shorter courses of drugs. But it questions whether advice such as stopping once feeling better would be beneficial - particularly when patients do not get the opportunity to be reviewed in the hospital every day. They accept this idea would need more research. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, leader of the Royal College of General Practitioners, says while it is important to take new evidence into account, she ""cannot advocate widespread behaviour change on the results of just one study"". She says recommended courses of antibiotics are ""not random"" but tailored to individual conditions and in many cases courses are quite short. And she says: ""We are concerned about the concept of patients stopping taking their medication mid-way through a course once they 'feel better', because improvement in symptoms does not necessarily mean the infection has been completely eradicated. Meanwhile, Kieran Hand, spokesman for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ""This opinion article from respected NHS infection experts is a welcome opening of the debate in the UK on the relationship between the length of a course of antibiotics, efficacy and resistance. ""As researchers have pointed out, further research is needed before the 'Finish the course' mantra for antibiotics is changed and any alternative message, such as, 'Stop when you feel better,' can be confidently advocated. ""The ideal future scenario would be that the right length of treatment for a specific infection for patients is identified from clinical trials and the exact quantity prescribed and dispensed."" Public Health England says patients should continue to follow their health professional's advice about using antibiotics.

"This video can not be played Riley Dosh explains why she wants to defend her country US President Donald Trump says transgender people cannot serve in ""any capacity"" in the military. He tweeted,externalthat he had consulted with military experts and cited ""tremendous medical costs and disruption"". The Obama administration decided last year to allow transgender people to serve openly in the military. But in June, Defence Secretary James Mattis agreed to a six-month delay in the recruitment of transgender people. As is often the case, the announcement came in a series of tweets. Mr Trump said: ""After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" But the measure will not go into effect immediately, as spokesperson Sarah Sanders told reporters at a White House press briefing. The implementation policy has to be worked out, she said when asked if troops on battlefields would be immediately sent back to the United States. This was ""a military decision"" said Mrs Sanders, adding that it is ""not meant to be anything more than that"". 'My stomach dropped': Transgender troops hit by ban The secret life of a transgender airman Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America Reporter Different stance - on the campaign trail last year The timing of this transgender ban is almost as interesting as the move itself. Why now? With the Trump administration being buffeted by the Jeff Sessions political death watch, the ongoing multi-prong investigation into the Trump campaign, the healthcare drama in the Senate and the impending Russian sanctions bill, perhaps the administration decided this was a good time to change the subject and rally conservative forces to his side. Republicans have long used cultural issues as a wedge to divide Democrats and energise evangelicals. As one White House insider acknowledged, this is straight out of that playbook. While Mr Trump campaigned as sympathetic to LGBT rights, he needs the traditional religious conservatives to stay loyal to him now, more than ever. Or perhaps,as Politico is reporting,external, the White House sought to resolve an intraparty dispute that threatened passage of a key military spending bill in the House of Representatives. That the president chose to do so suddenly, with little advanced notice, would not be out of the ordinary for this administration. The president's action will create a furore among liberals and the media commentators whose disdain for the current administration is not a new development. This is a fight the White House will welcome. The independent Rand Corporation estimated in 2016 that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender, although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000. Rand also predicted that the inclusion of transgender people in the military would cause a 0.13% increase in healthcare spending (approximately $8.4m). A Military Times analysis,externalfound that the Department of Defense spends five times that figure just on erectile dysfunction drug Viagara alone. The Obama administration's move to allow transgender people in the military to serve openly was announced in June 2016 by then Defence Secretary Ash Carter. This video can not be played Being transgender in the US military - Jamie Ewing spoke to the BBC in 2016 The policy included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender. Transgender people would be permitted to join the services, so long as they could demonstrate they had been stable in their new gender for at least 18 months. This was meant to come into effect on 1 July 2017 but the Trump administration delayed it by a further six months. The Pentagon said the five branches of the military needed more time to ""review their accession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces"". While Mr Trump's decision concerns transgender military personnel, the US military's ban on openly gay and lesbian servicemen and women - known as ""Don't ask don't tell"" - was lifted in 2011. Delays leave transgender military in limbo UK chiefs praise transgender troops LGBTQ campaign group, GLAAD, called Mr Trump's move ""a direct attack on transgender Americans"". Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Centre, a leading think-tank which studies gender and sexuality in the military, told the BBC that Mr Trump's decision would force transgender troops to in effect live as gays and lesbians did under ""Don't ask, don't tell"". Kristin Beck, a retired elite Navy SEAL, issued a challenge to President Trumpin an interview with Business Insider,external: ""Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy."" She said that during her decorated military career, she had been ""defending individual liberty"". ""Being transgender doesn't affect anyone else,"" she said. ""We are liberty's light. If you can't defend that for everyone that's an American citizen, that's not right."" NBC's Micah Grimes tweeted this reaction Former Defence Secretary Carter released a critical statement: ""To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military. There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honourably."" Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican John McCain, said major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter and continued: ""The statement was unclear. The Department of Defense has already decided to allow currently-serving transgender individuals to stay in the military, and many are serving honorably today. Any American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving."" Chelsea Manning, a transgender former US soldier, tweeted her reaction to the news Several British military generals have condemned Mr Trump's decision, including the commander of the UK Maritime Forces, Rear Admiral Alex Burton. ""As an @RoyalNavy_LGBT champion and senior warfighter I am so glad we are not going this way"", he wrote on Twitter, later adding: ""We have a justifiably rigorous selection process but it doesn't include discrimination and we're a better fighting force for it."" Trump revokes transgender toilet rules Republican opponents of transgender people serving in the military include Vicky Hartzler, a congresswoman from Missouri, who wants transgender service members honourably discharged. Some oppose the military having to bear medical costs associated with transgender recruits, such as gender reassignment. Tony Perkins of the socially conservative Family Research council said: ""Our troops shouldn't be forced to endure hours of transgender 'sensitivity' classes and politically correct distractions."" Trump supporter and political commentator Scott Presler is among those who disagree with the military carrying the cost of such interventions. While disagreeing with the ban, he added that ""generals know more about war than I do. ""I am cognisant that they understand what it takes to go to war... I don't think this is an attack on the LGBT community. ""I'm mixed, but I have confidence in the guidance that President Trump is receiving,"" he said. ""I don't think for a second he's prejudiced.""

"The government's Â£3bn clean air strategy does not go ""far enough or fast enough"", campaigners have said. Moves including banning the sale of new diesel and petrol cars from 2040 and Â£255m for councils to tackle air pollution locally have been welcomed. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government was determined to deliver a ""green revolution"". But environmental groups criticised the decision not to include a scrappage scheme or immediate clean air zones. Questions about the petrol and diesel car ban Reality Check: Does pollution cut short 40,000 lives a year? Special Report: So I can breathe Manoeuvring a path to cleaner air The plan to stop all sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 is part of the government's intention for almost every car and van on UK roads to be zero emission by 2050. The government report includes the promise of Â£40m immediately to start local schemes rolling, which could include changing road layouts, retrofitting public transport or schemes to encourage people to leave their cars at home. The funding pot will come from changes to tax on diesel vehicles and the reprioritising departmental budgets - the exact details will be announced later in the year. If those measures do not cut emissions enough, charging zones for the most polluting vehicles could be the next step. While air pollution has been mostly falling in the UK, in many cities, nitrogen oxides - which form part of the discharge from car exhausts - regularly breach safe levels. Mr Grayling said the new plan showed the government was ""determined to deliver a green revolution in transport and reduce pollution in our towns and cities"". But campaigners say these are the measures that need to be implemented now to tackle environmental and health problems, with air pollution linked to about 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK. On the road electric style Professor Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Hea lth, said air pollution ""is a public health emergency"" and said it was ""frankly inexcusable"" that the plans still did not go far enough. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas welcomed the 2040 announcement, but added: ""We also need action that tackles this health emergency in the coming months and years. ""We should use this opportunity to revamp our towns and cities with investment in walking and cycling, and by ensuring that public transport is affordable and reliable."" Greenpeace UK's clean air campaigner Areeba Hamid said 2040 was ""far too late"" and called for the UK to ""lead the world in clean transport revolution"". And ClientEarth - the law firm that took the government to court over pollution levels - said the plans were ""underwhelming"" and ""lacking in urgency"". The shadow environment secretary, Labour's Sue Hayman, said the plan saw the government ""shunting the problem on to local authorities"" and accused it of having a ""squeamish attitude"" towards clean air zones. ""With nearly 40 million people living in areas with illegal levels of air pollution, action is needed now, not in 23 years' time,"" she added. Liberal Democrat and former Energy Secretary Ed Davey criticised the lack of scrappage scheme as a ""shameful betrayal"" of diesel car drivers, and said it showed ""the utter lack of ambition"" of the plan. And London Mayor Sadiq Khan said people in the capital were ""suffering right now"" because of air pollution and ""can't afford to wait"". The AA also said significant investment would be needed to install charging points across the country for electric vehicles and warned the National Grid would come under pressure with a mass switch-on of recharging after the rush hour. The government said a new bill would allow it to require the installation of charge points at motorway service areas and large fuel retailers. The timetable for councils to come up with initial plans has been cut from 18 months to eight, with the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) wanting to ""inject additional urgency"" into the process. It follows the government being given its own deadline of 31 July after High Court judges said it was failing to meet EU pollution limits. Local Government Association environment spokesman Martin Tett welcomed the additional funding, but opposed holding off on a scrappage scheme, arguing ""this immediate intervention could help increase the uptake of lower emission vehicles"". BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said councils were not happy to be taking the rap for the controversial policy when it was the government that had encouraged the sale of diesel vehicles in the first place. ""Today's government plan is not comprehensive - it doesn't address pollution from construction, farming and gas boilers,"" he added. ""And clean air campaigners say the government is using the 2040 electric cars announcement to distract from failings in its short-term pollution policy."" The UK announcement comes amid signs of an accelerating shift towards electric cars instead of petrol and diesel ones, at home and abroad: Earlier this month,President Emmanuel Macron announced similar plans to phase out diesel and petrol cars in France, also from 2040 BMW announced on Tuesday that afully electric version of the Mini would be built at the Cowley plant in Oxford from 2019 Swedish carmakerVolvo has said all new models will have an electric motor from the same year Ford's chief financial officer Bob Shanks told the BBC that he supported the ban and believed that Europe would be ""ground zero"" in leading a global trend to electric vehicles. ""We certainly see that trajectory being quite feasible, and is something that we support,"" he added.

"Facebook revenues and profits soared in the most recent quarter, as advertising dollars poured into the social media company and users continued to flock to the site. More than two billion people - more than a quarter of the world's population -  log into the site every month, a powerful draw for advertisers. The firm said revenues hit $9.3bn (Â£7.09bn) over the April to June period, jumping 45% year-on-year. Profits climbed 71% to $3.9bn. ""We had a good second quarter and first half of the year,"" said chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004. Facebook has been adding more advertising as well as more consumers, as it explores how to monetise its other social networking platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp. The company said that Instagram was making an increasing contribution to growth, but that the news feed at the heart of Facebook remained the biggest driver. It was still early days for advertising on Facebook's messenger service, said Mr Zuckerberg, but he told an investor call he was ""confident we're going to get this right in the long term"". Facebook faces competition from Snapchat amongst younger consumers Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said brands were experimenting with different advertising formats within Facebook's platforms, for example Tropicana had found that six-second ads gave better results than longer versions, she said. Facebook faces competition from Snapchat, a platform particularly popular amongst young social media users, which pioneered the idea of ""stories"", a series of messages aimed at a wider audience that lasts for 24 hours. Instagram and WhatsApp are now offering similar features. Facebook shares, which have risen steadily this year, bounced 3.6% in after-hours trade. The company said mobile ads represented 87% of its advertising revenue of $9.16bn, up from 84% a year ago. The firm now employs more than 20,600 people, up 43% year-on-year. The firm said the number of monthly active users at the end of June - 2.01 billion - was 17% higher than a year ago and two thirds of those logged onto the site daily.

Connie Yates and Chris Gard originally asked to be allowed to take their son home to die, after ending their legal case on Monday to seek therapy abroad. For practical reasons, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said a hospice was the most appropriate place for him. His parents and the hospital have until 12:00 BST on Thursday to agree his end of life care and how long he has left. The story of Charlie Gard Charlie Gard parents end legal fight for US treatment Connie Yates was in court to hear the decision about where her son will spend his final days The court heard there was a dispute between hospital bosses and Charlie's parents about care plans for the 11-month old baby.

The family had been unable to find an intensive care specialist, which the hospital had said was ""essential"" for Charlie's care, though. Setting the deadline, Mr Justice Francis said he hoped all parties could reach an agreement by 12:00 BST on Thursday, otherwise Charlie would be moved anyway and his life support treatment ended soon after that. He said the name of the hospice and when Charlie was admitted would remain private. As the judge made his decision, Ms Yates shouted ""I hope you are happy with yourselves"" and left the court crying.

"This video can not be played Earl Spencer tells Today he was ""lied to"" over princes' wish to follow Diana's coffin Princess Diana's brother Earl Spencer says he was lied to about Prince William and Prince Harry wanting to walk behind their mother's coffin. He said it was a ""bizarre and cruel thing"" for the princes to do and the funeral procession was ""the most horrifying half an hour of my life"". He told Radio 4's Today: ""I was lied to and told that they wanted to do it, which of course they didn't."" He spoke as the 20th anniversary of her death approaches on 31 August. ""It was the worst part of the day by a considerable margin, walking behind my sister's body with two boys who were obviously massively grieving their mother. ""It was a sort of bizarre circumstance where we were told you just have to look straight ahead. ""But the feeling, the sort of absolute crashing tidal wave of grief coming at you as you went down this sort of tunnel of deep emotion, it was really harrowing actually and I still have nightmares about it now."" This video can not be played Princess Diana's brother tells Radio 4's Today he still has nightmares about walking behind her coffin The earl also said there had been four attempted break-ins at the family home where Princess Diana was buried after she was killed in a Paris car crash. He said he had been a ""passionate advocate"" for William and Harry not to have to walk behind their mother's body but was told the plan had been decided. ""I was liaising with some courtier at Buckingham Palace and he mentioned it and I said of course not, of course they are not going to do that, and he said it had been decided. ""I said she [Diana] just would not want them to do this and there was lots of sort of embarrassed coughing and various other conversations. ""Then eventually I was lied to and told that they wanted to do it, which of course they didn't, but I didn't realise that."" Prince Harry sought counselling over Diana's death Prince William: I talk about Granny Diana Princes regret last 'rushed call' with Diana Prince Harry, who was 12 when his mother died, has previously spoken about walking in the funeral procession,saying no child ""should be asked to do that"". Describing the procession, the earl said he could hear people sobbing, wailing and shouting messages of love to Diana and the princes which was a ""very tricky time"". ""But it was impossible not to connect with the emotion coming from the crowd. It was so powerful. Pulsing through us, I think. ""And it was so bizarre, there was a sort of crunching of our procession, the horses and the carriage and our footsteps, and then the incredible crashing emotion coming in from every side. It was really horrifying."" The earl revealed he wrote the eulogy to his sister in his study, a place loved by Princess Diana, and the speech was about speaking for ""my sister who was no longer there"". His promise at the funeral in 1997 that William and Harry would be protected by ""blood family"" was seen as an attack on the Royal Family. The earl says his eulogy was trying to ""celebrate"" Diana The earl said he believes Princess Diana would have been proud of his speech, which he re-read to her body a couple of days before she was buried. ""I know people will think that I am some sort of fruitcake, but I do remember hearing almost some sort of approval then and then I realised then I probably had got some of the thoughts in order."" Reflecting on the eulogy, he said: ""I don't feel I said many pointed things. I believe that every word I said was true and it was important for me to be honest. ""I wasn't looking to make any jabs at anyone actually, I was trying to celebrate Diana and if by doing that it showed up particularly the press I think in a bad way, well, they had that coming."" The earl's eulogy also touched on Princess Diana's eating disorders and criticised the paparazzi. ""In her final years Diana was really brought low by elements of the paparazzi and the tabloids,"" he said. ""I remember she told me about one man that promised to hound her until the day she died, then would urinate on her grave. ""So, she was dealing with a very dark side of the media and, even at her funeral, I think it was appropriate to touch on that."" Princess Diana was one of the most-photographed women in the world The earl said he has re-read his speech for the first time in 20 years and believes it was ""very balanced"". When asked whether the Queen, who is his godmother, said anything to him about the eulogy, he said a friend had told him she said he had a right to say whatever he felt. ""I am not some rabid republican, but the speech was about Diana, it wasn't really about anyone else,"" he said. Princess Diana is buried in the grounds of her childhood home Princess Diana was buried in the grounds of Althorp estate, her childhood home in Northamptonshire, after the earl changed plans for her to be laid to rest in the family tombs at a local church. He said it seemed ""natural"" to bury her at their family home as he ""wanted to keep her safe"". The earl added: ""There was such a whipped up feeling of emotion everywhere that I was very worried about where we could safely bury her.""

"Investigators say that before Justine Damond was shot to death by a Minneapolis police officer, a woman ""slapped"" the back of his patrol car. The search warrant issued by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) does not say if that woman was the Australian yoga teacher. The document may shed light on the possible source of the ""loud sound"" that startled the car's driver. Damond was killed by Officer Mohamed Noor after calling 911 two weeks ago. The search warrant, which was provided to local news stations by investigators, stated: ""Upon police arrival, a female 'slaps' the back of the patrol squad. ""After that, it is unknown to BCA agents what exactly happened, but the female became deceased in the alley."" Australia waits for answers in 'American nightmare' 'Why did the police not use their cameras?' Justine Damond Mohamed Noor, who fired the fatal shot across his partner and through the driver's window, has so far refused to be interviewed by investigators. Officer Matthew Harrity, who was driving the police cruiser through the alley behind Damond's home, has told detectives that they were startled by a ""loud sound"" just before the shooting. Mock-official signs were posted around the city over the weekend, but quickly were taken down Neither officer had turned on their body camera, which recently-adopted regulations require every officer to carry. Both men have been placed on paid administrative leave. The BCA report was compiled about seven hours after the shooting Also detailed in the report are several items recovered from the scene and submitted for forensic examination by investigators. This video can not be played Mayor Betsy Hodges was interrupted by angry protesters at a news conference about the police chief's resignation A 9mm cartridge shell, Damond's mobile phone, blood from the rear driver's side door of the squad car, and fingerprints and spots on the rear and exterior of the vehicle were all recorded by the BCA. Investigators have determined that Damond, who moved from Australia two years ago, was unarmed when she was killed. Damond, 40, had called 911 twice before midnight to report a possible rape in her upscale Minneapolis neighbourhood about 20 minutes before her death,.

"A ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars is to be brought forward, the government says. So how could the move help the UK meet its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050? And what does it mean for drivers? The ban is being introduced in 2035 - five years earlier than previously planned. Experts said the original target of 2040 would be too late if the UK wanted to achieve its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050. The ban is also being expanded to hybrid cars and plug-in hybrids, which had not been included under the original proposals. As a result, people will be able to buy only electric or hydrogen cars and vans. About a third of CO2 emissions in the UK come from transport. So the ban on conventional car sales will certainly help move the UK towards the net-zero target the government announced in 2019. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises government, said if other countries followed the UK, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended temperature rise of 1.5C by 2100. This is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change. However, banning new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars won't be enough on its own. The government will also need to tackle the emissions coming from energy generation. These are almost as high as from transport and come from things such as industry and people's homes. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox) - which come from car exhausts - regularly exceed safe levels in many cities. Diesel vehicles produce the overwhelming majority of roadside Nox gases. So removing petrol and diesel vehicles from the roads should help bring air qualitywithin the guidelines set out by the World Health Organization (WHO),external. Air pollution has been a concern for decades. But the issue gained renewed urgency when the UK government lost court cases over its plans to reduce nitrogen-dioxide levels. As a result,ministers were ordered by the courts to produce a new plan to tackle Nox levels. The discussion was complicatedwhen carmakers were found to be cheating emissions tests. But in recent years, scientists have become more certain about the ways air pollution harms people.Studies have linked it to heart disease and lung problems,external, as well as other conditions. A really simple guide to climate change The five major challenges facing electric vehicles Rise of SUVs 'makes mockery' of electric car push The Committee on Climate Change believes the cost of electric cars will be similar to that of petrol or diesel vehicles by 2024-25. But for now, electric cars are more expensive than their petrol or diesel counterparts. That's because battery technology is still developing and production requires expensive raw materials and engineers. The UK's most popular electric car, the Nissan Leaf, costs Â£26,000 for a basic model. The government does provide a Â£3,500 subsidy but for many motorists, the cost is still too high. Some experts say a more radical approach, such as no VAT on electric cars, would create a surge in demand. A scheme like this exists in Norway, where 2019 saw a huge increase in people opting for electric cars. At present, there is a very small second-hand market for electric cars. That's because they make up less than 1% of the total number of cars on UK roads. If we're to switch to electric cars, the speed of installing charging points will have to radically increase, to cope with demand. It has been estimated theUK needs to have 25 million charging points for electric vehicles. There are now nearly 11,000 places in the UK where you can charge electric vehicles. While there are parts of the country where the number of charging points is keeping up with demand, more are needed in many places. And there are other potential problems. For example, where will power points be sited? Will roads have to be dug up for cabling? Will drivers have to share power points, and so be restricted to certain charging times? People who live in flats, or houses without driveways, could struggle to charge their electric cars at home. It is hoped charge points installed in lampposts next to parking bays could help but rollout so far has been limited. There is also a need for more rapid-charging points, for people on long journeys and those who haven't charged overnight. There is currently no UK-wide scrappage scheme in place for petrol and diesel cars and it is unclear if the government is considering this. In London, the city's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced a Â£25m scrappage scheme to take older polluting cars and motorbikes off its streets, to reduce CO2 pollution. You will still be able to buy a second-hand petrol or diesel car in 2035 and drive one you currently own. There could even be a boom in petrol or diesel sales in 2034, as motorists prepare to buy combustion engines for the final time.

"Laura Hussey and her fiancÃ©, Gary Smyth, were due to get married in March after winning a 20,000 euro (Â£18,000) package Five Irish couples who won what they thought were dream weddings have been left heartbroken after the 20,000 euro (Â£18,000) prize money was withdrawn. Each couple topped a poll after their friends and family bought the most votes from the Win Our Wedding competition online and via text. Votes were encouraged by the promise that 5% of the money would be given to the Make A Wish Charity. But now the winners have been informed their weddings will not be funded. Elaine Whitney, the face of the company behind Win Our Wedding, wrote in an email that the competition had to close due to ""cash-flow"" struggles and ""bad publicity"". Elaine Whitney delivered the bad news to 'winning' couples in an email on Friday She said she ""sincerely apologised"" for letting the couples down and hinted that some of the suppliers may agree to go ahead without payment. The competition's Facebook page has since been taken down. Ms Whitney has been contacted by the BBC and made no comment, buttold the Irish Examiner,external: ""There are two things I'm guilty of, one is not closing the company in 2016 and the other is letting couples down. ""I am absolutely heartbroken."" Ms Whitney has started a new company based on a new model and has said she will be able to cover the cost of two weddings in 2018 once the new model is up and running, The Examiner reported. A spokesperson for Make A Wish Ireland, who grant wishes to children with life-threatening conditions, said Win Our Wedding had not honoured its donation agreement, and the partnership had been terminated in December 2015. ""If the Make-A-Wish Ireland logo appeared on any Win Our Wedding literature since 31 December 2015, it was without the approval of Make-A-Wish Ireland,"" said the charity. The Consumers' Association of Ireland has raised concerns the platform upon which the scheme resembles a pyramid scheme. ""This brings concerns as to the legal advice sought and received upon establishment of the company,"" said the association's Dermott Jewell. ""It is clear from the messages that the situation has deteriorated over the last six months,"" he told BBC News NI. ""This raises questions regarding the consideration of continuing while knowing of a financial problem which raises the consideration of reckless trading."" The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission Ireland has advised anyone with concerns about the competition to contact their consumer helpline. Laura Hussey and her fiancÃ©, Gary Smyth, were due to get married in March after winning a 20,000 euros package. Miss Hussey, from Longford, County Longford, said a friend tagged her in a post about the competition last September. Miss Hussey estimates about 2,000 euro (Â£1,780) was spent on the competition by friends and family ""We have been together 21 years and have three beautiful children, but one thing and another means we've never had the money for a wedding,"" she said. ""We are both from the same very close-knit community, so everyone got behind us straight away. ""Everyone from the Girl Guides to the local driving school supported us."" Miss Hussey has already chosen her wedding dress Miss Hussey estimates that about 2,000 euros was spent on the competition by their friends and family. Each couple topped a competition poll after friends and family bought thousands of euros worth of votes The couple even threw some of their own wages into votes in the closing days of the competition. Miss Hussey replied to Friday's email saying: ""How am I going to explain this to my kids and family? ""You've just shattered our dreams."" Competition winners Carol Fleming and her fiancÃ© Dermot Molloy, from Drangan, County Tipperary, discovered the funding would not be forthcoming less than four weeks before their wedding in August. Carol Fleming, her fiancÃ© Dermot Molloy and their son Danny Their son Danny has a rare heart condition. Winning the competition was supposed to have made the family's life easier, but it had instead become a ""nightmare"", said Miss Fleming. Miss Fleming said the competition had become a nightmare She said the couple had entered the competition in March - three months after the agreement between Make A Wish and Win Our Wedding was terminated - but were not made aware no money would be going to the charity. Most of the suppliers booked for the wedding have agreed to do the work for free and the wedding will still go ahead in August. Cynthia Geelan and her fiancÃ© Michael Cruise were also winners and were due to get married in December Cynthia Geelan and her fiancÃ© Michael Cruise, from Newtownforbes, County Longford, are due to get married on 9 December, and remain hopeful their wedding will go ahead as planned. Peggy O'Callaghan, from New South Wales in Australia and her fiancÃ© Keith Smith, from County Cavan, are now doubtful their wedding will go ahead Peggy O'Callaghan and Keith Smith, who both live in Australia, were hoping to move home to Ireland after winning the competition, as they did not think they would be able to afford the expense of both flights and a wedding. They are now doubtful their wedding will go ahead. Kathy Smith and Luke Kelly, from Cavan won the competition in 2015 and were due to get married in November this year. Kathy Smith and Luke Kelly have decided to downsize their wedding Miss Smith said: ""We were constantly running into issues with them for payments, saying they had other weddings in front of ours that had to be priority and that we couldn't book in anything else for another while. ""Now that we have heard that the competition won't be paying out any more money, we have had to downsize our wedding. ""In total, we have received around 4,500 euros from them and are still owed around 15,000, which has left us in a difficult position to pay for our wedding this November.""

"The boy admitted aggravated vehicle taking and possessing a firearm A 15-year-old boy has admitted tipping over a car with a fork-lift truck while armed with an air rifle. A police helicopter was scrambled when reports emerged of a truck ""driving erratically"" around Hazel Gardens in Sonning Common in September last year. The boy told Oxford Magistrates' Court court: ""It probably wasn't the best thing to have done."" He admitted aggravated vehicle taking, possessing an unloaded firearm, and careless driving. This video can not be played A member of the public filmed the boy on the fork-lift The magistrates heard the teenager stole the vehicle from Oliver Agriculture in Cane End, near Reading, and drove it two-and-a-half miles to Sonning Common. There he wrote off a Fiat Punto by tipping it on to its side, a prosecutor said. Chairman of the magistrates Colin Mcguire described the fork-lift truck as ""a lethal machine"" and asked the Youth Justice Service to carry out a report. The teenager from Henley-on-Thames, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will be sentenced on 16 August. The Fiat Punto was written off Armed boy filmed on stolen forklift.

For practical reasons, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said a hospice was the most appropriate place for him. His parents and the hospital have until 12:00 BST on Thursday to agree his end of life care and how long he has left. The story of Charlie Gard Charlie Gard parents end legal fight for US treatment Connie Yates was in court to hear the decision about where her son will spend his final days The court heard there was a dispute between hospital bosses and Charlie's parents about care plans for the 11-month old baby. Ms Yates and Mr Gard have now accepted their son has to be moved to a hospice but wanted to spend a week there with him before he died. Some nurses from GOSH and a doctor have volunteered to care for the terminally-ill baby during that time, the family's lawyer Grant Armstrong said. The family had been unable to find an intensive care specialist, which the hospital had said was ""essential"" for Charlie's care, though. Setting the deadline, Mr Justice Francis said he hoped all parties could reach an agreement by 12:00 BST on Thursday, otherwise Charlie would be moved anyway and his life support treatment ended soon after that. He said the name of the hospice and when Charlie was admitted would remain private. As the judge made his decision, Ms Yates shouted ""I hope you are happy with yourselves"" and left the court crying.

"Aisha was showered with expensive gifts by the militant who took her as his wife In our series of letters from African journalists, Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at why some Nigerian women have gone back to the militant Islamists who abducted them. When news emerged that some of the Chibok schoolgirls, abducted by Boko Haram in 2014, had declined to return home with the batch of 82 freed in May, the world found it difficult to believe. Not even the release of a Boko Haram video showing some hijab-clad, Kalashnikov-wielding girls saying they were happy in their new lives, was enough to convince people. ""They must have been coerced,"" some said. ""It must beStockholm syndrome,"" others said. What else could explain why any girl, any woman, would choose to remain with such horrible men? Yet, some women rescued by the Nigerian military from captivity are willingly returning to Boko Haram's Sambisa forest hideout in north-eastern Nigeria to be with these same horrible men. What we know about Chibok abductions Who are Boko Haram In January, I met Aisha Yerima, 25, who was kidnapped by Boko Haram more than four years ago. While in captivity, she got married to a commander who showered her with romance, expensive gifts and Arabic love songs. The fairytale life in the Sambisa forest she described to me was suddenly cut short by the appearance of the Nigerian military in early 2016, at a time her husband had gone off to battle with other commanders. When I first interviewed Aisha, she had been in government custody for about eight months, and completed a de-radicalisation programme run by psychologist Fatima Akilu, the executive director of the Neem Foundation and founder of the Nigerian government's de-radicalisation programme. ""I now see that all the things Boko Haram told us were lies,"" Aisha said. ""Now, when I listen to them on the radio, I laugh."" But, in May, less than five months after being released into the care of her family in north-eastern Maiduguri city, she returned to the forest hideout of Boko Haram. The Nigerian military have been battling Boko Haram since 2009 Over the past five years, Dr Akilu has worked with former Boko Haram members - including some commanders, their wives and children - and with hundreds of women who were rescued from captivity. ""How women were treated when in Boko Haram captivity depends on which camp a woman was exposed to. It depends on the commander running the camp,"" she said. ""Those who were treated better were the ones who willingly married Boko Haram members or who joined the group voluntarily and that's not the majority. Most women did not have the same treatment."" Aisha had boasted to me about the number of slaves she had while in the Sambisa forest, the respect she received from other Boko Haram commanders, and the strong influence she had over her husband. She even accompanied him to battle once. ""These were women who for the most part had never worked, had no power, no voice in the communities, and all of a sudden they were in charge of between 30 to 100 women who were now completely under their control and at their beck and call,"" Dr Akilu said. ""It is difficult to know what to replace it with when you return to society because most of the women are returning to societies where they are not going to be able to wield that kind of power."" Apart from loss of power, other reasons Dr Akilu believes could lead women to willingly return to Boko Haram include stigmatisation from a community which treats them like pariahs because of their association with the militants, and tough economic conditions. Dealing with the aftermath of release can be a struggle for some of those who were abducted ""De-radicalisation is just one part of it. Reintegration is also a part of it. Some of them have no livelihood support built around them,"" Dr Akilu said. ""The kind of support you have in de-radicalisation programmes does not follow you when you leave. They often come out successful from de-radicalisation programmes but they struggle in the community and it is that struggle that often leads them to go back,"" she said. Recently, I visited Aisha's family, who were still in shock at her departure and worried about her wellbeing. Her mother, Ashe, recalled at least seven former Boko Haram ""wives"" she knew, all friends of her daughter, who had returned to the Sambisa forest long before her daughter did. ""Each time one of them disappeared, her family came to our house to ask Aisha if she had heard from their daughter,"" she said. ""That's how I knew."" Some of the women kept in touch with Aisha after they returned to Boko Haram. Her younger sister, Bintu, was present during at least two phone calls. ""They told her to come and join them but she refused,"" Bintu said. ""She told them she didn't want to go back."" Unlike some former Boko Haram ""wives"" I've met, who are either struggling to survive harsh economic conditions or dealing with stigma, Aisha's life seemed to be on track. She was earning money from buying and selling fabric, regularly attending social events and posting photos of herself all primped up on social media, and had a string of suitors. ""At least five different men wanted to marry her,"" her mother said, pointing out that there could be no greater form of acceptance shown to a woman, and presenting this as evidence that her daughter faced no stigma whatsoever from the community. ""One of the men lives in Lagos. She was thinking of marrying him,"" she said. But, everything went awry when Aisha received yet another phone call from the women who had returned to the forest, informing her that her Boko Haram ""husband"" was now with a woman who had been her rival. From that day, the vivacious and gregarious Aisha became a recluse. ""She stopped going out or talking or eating,"" Bintu said. ""She was always sad."" Two weeks later, she left home and did not return. Some of her clothes were missing. Her phones were switched off. She took the two-year-old son fathered by the commander in the Sambisa forest, but left the older one she had with the husband she divorced before her abduction. ""De-radicalisation is complicated by the fact that we have an active, ongoing insurgency. In cases where a group has reached settlement with the government and laid down their arms, it is easier,"" Dr Akilu said. ""But, when you have fathers, husbands, sons still in the movement, they want to be reunited, especially women."" Asta, another former Boko Haram ""wife"", told me that she has heard of the many women returning to the group, but has no plans to do so herself. However, the 19-year-old described how terribly she misses her husband, and how keen she is to hear from him and to be reunited with him. She insisted that she would not return to the forest, not even if he were to ask her. ""I will tell him to come and stay here with us and live a normal life,"" she said. But as with Aisha, the desire to be with the man she yearns for may turn out to be more compelling for Asta than the aversion to a group responsible for the deaths of thousands of people in north-east Nigeria, and for the displacement of millions who are struggling to survive in refugee camps.

"Lana Del Rey is in a good mood. She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her favourite UK delicacy - a sandwich from Pret. When she discovers she's in the same building as the BBC newsroom, the star politely asks for a guided tour. ""I never get to do stuff like this,"" marvels the singer, as she walks wide-eyed past the studios and satellite feeds. In this context, Del Rey is oddly anonymous. Jane Hill, who is preparing to read the lunchtime news on BBC One, doesn't even look up when the superstar squeezes past her desk. It's a rare luxury for someone who's followed by paparazzi and the all-seeing cameras of TMZ when she's at home in California. This video can not be played Highlights of Lana Del Rey's performance at Radio 1's Big Weekend 2017 She addresses the lack of privacy on her new album, Lust For Life, where a song called13 Beaches,externalfinds Del Rey searching for a spot ""past Ventura and lenses plenty"" where she can enjoy a romantic moment in seclusion. When we sit down to chat, she reveals those same concerns stopped her attending thewomen's marchesin Los Angeles, earlier this year. ""I drove my sister and her girlfriends to the marches,"" she says. ""I thought about [joining in] but I felt, like, not really sure how it would go. ""I didn't really want to be a distraction to that group of 10 girls who were going. I wanted them to think about the actual march and not about me standing right next to them."" Five things we learned by speaking to Lana Del Rey Lana speaks to BBC News in 2012 Lana Del Rey on BBC Music But the star is making her contribution in other ways. A new song,God Bless America And All The Beautiful Women In It,external, is an ode to womankind (""may you stand proud and strong""); whileCoachella - Woodstock In My Mind,external, mines the contradictions of dancing at a festival ""whilst watching tensions with North Korea mount"". It's a new dimension for Del Rey's lyrics - which have traditionally concerned themselves with ""looking for love in all the wrong places"". ""I kind of got jolted into the real world again,"" she says. ""Just being in California, it's such a liberal state, I was bombarded with the news every day. So my studio became like a think tank - during the elections it was a constant conversation with my producer and engineers and assistant engineers. ""And then obviously during Coachella, that news broke about North Korea and pointing missiles at each other. That was a bit of a rude awakening."" Lust For Life sees Lana questioning America's place in the world Del Rey's work rate is astonishing. Lust For Life is her fifth album in six years - and it bursts at the seams, with 16 tracks all co-written with her longtime producer Rick Nowels. They record everything at his studio in Santa Monica, just blocks away from the beach, so it ""never feels like work,"" she says. ""Just walking in every day and having a coffee together and taking a walk, and then we start. ""So it doesn't ever feel like I'm pumping them [the songs] out. Although it's definitely a blessing that I've been able to put out so much music."" On Lust For Life, the singer has opened up musically, as well as lyrically. Thetitle track,externalis a pulse-raising duet with The Weeknd, whileSummer Bummer,externalalmost self-destructs, dissolving into digital noise and blacked-out beats, with Lana's vocals barely holding the song together. She's also welcomed collaborators into her world for the first time - absorbing them into her aesthetic, rather than capitalising on chart trends. ""It was really fun!"" she says of working with A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd. ""I wanted those guys to add a little fire, a little energy to the record."" The Lust For Life video finds Lana and The Weeknd sharing a romantic evening on top of the Hollywood sign More daunting was inviting rock legend Stevie Nicks to duet onBeautiful People, Beautiful Problems,external. ""I was definitely nervous,"" says Del Rey of the recording session. ""She got off the plane at 10:30, so she didn't get to the studio until midnight - and she just breezed in, black on black, gold everywhere. She was kind of a vision. ""When she started singing, she told me she wanted to hear me sing something, too. And then Ireallyfreaked out! ""I said to her over the mic, 'I just sound so quiet compared to you.' And she was like, 'That's ok, you can be my little echo!' ""I thought that was so cool. I'm not as loud as her. My voice isn't as low as hers. But she loves it for what it is. ""That, as it was happening, was a career-defining moment for me."" The star's hits include Video Games, Born To Die, High By The Beach and Ultraviolence Other songs on the album had a more troubled gestation. Del Rey says the closing track,Get Free,external, originally had a different title, and much more personal lyrics. ""That song started out really revealing,"" she says. ""I wanted to summarise my whole experience over the last six years; and then I realised, I don't want to reveal everything."" Once the initial version was ""out of my system"", she says, the recording was ""deleted completely then started from scratch"". The lyrics became more vague and more hopeful; and the re-recorded version ends with Del Reyreferencing Neil Young,external: ""I want to move out of the black, into the blue"". ""I think it would have been hard for me to do interviews if I'd said a couple of particular things that I was thinking of,"" she says of the original. ""Kind of the wayUltraviolence,externaldid. It was harder to promote that record."" She's referring to the title track of her second album, which depicted Del Rey in a destructive, abusive relationship. Del Rey haspreviously hinted,externalthe song refers to her association with an ""underground sect"" in New York, which was controlled by a charismatic guru. In concert, she has recently stopped singing the song's key line, ""he hit me and it felt like a kiss"". ""I don't feel comfortable with that lyric any more,"" she says now. ""Whatever my concept of affection was at the time, it does not serve me any more. Obviously. Hopefully."" Lana's fanbase is particularly devoted - she leaves most shows carrying armfuls of bouquets On Lust For Life she seems happier, more outward-looking than before. On stage, she's more confident, too. Launching the album at a one-off gig in London, she's forced to abandon her performance of the opening track,Love,external. Earlier in her career, she might have frozen. Now, she just sings it a capella, with the crowd stepping in as her own personal choir. ""I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I think my keyboard player was playing the wrong chords,"" she explains. ""I was leaning in to him and saying, 'That's not it, that's not it' and he was like, 'Thatisit, trust me'. ""I listened for 10 seconds and I was like, 'Damn, I definitely can't get it'. I couldn't get it in rehearsal, either. So I just told him to stop. I feel bad - I was kind of abrasive. ""But that song is at the heart of the record and I thought it'd be weird if I didn't do it. So, luckily the people who were at the show knew the words and they sang along with me."" She listens with glee to a recording of the song - explaining how, because she wears in-ear headphones, she hadn't realised how loud the crowd had been. ""I'm so glad,"" she says. ""Being in the audience, did you feel that, too?"" I tell her it was like being in church. ""Oh, stop!"" she beams, and bursts into laughter. That good mood isn't going anywhere soon.

"The branding of the On Purpose products is ""subtle but appropriate"", says Mary Beech It's easy to miss. The words ""on purpose"" are printed on a small label inside the tote bag alongside the name of the woman who made it. It sits inconspicuously next to the other handbags on the shelves at high-end fashion brand Kate Spade. There is nothing notably different about it. Yet it was made in a factory that doesn't have a reliable source of running water, where the electricity routinely cuts out, and where, until relatively recently, the workers didn't have the necessary manufacturing skills. It's in a tiny village called Masoro in landlocked Rwanda. There are no dependable roads, which means all the products made here have to be airlifted out - a much more expensive option than the usual way of sending them by ship. And perhaps most unusually, this factory didn't exist at all until global fashion firm Kate Spade decided to open it and fund its creation just over three years ago. The obvious question is: Why? On Purpose senior manager Taryn Bird says it was important the project was commercial as well as charitable ""We like to stretch ourselves,"" laughs Mary Beech, chief marketing officer at the firm. She says as a brand that makes clothing and handbags for women, and whose employees are mainly female, doing something to help empower women ""came very naturally"". The branding of the product is subtle, says Ms Beech, because they don't want it to be a token charity product. ""We want women to buy these bags because they walk into the store and love them. First and foremost it has to be a beautiful product which is completely natural and integrated,"" she adds. Rwanda's horrifying 1994 genocide, when 800,000 Rwandans were killed, continues to affect people today, and Kate Spade says this history was an added incentive for choosing the location. Around 150 people, mainly women, work at Abahizi Dushyigikirane Corporation, known as ADC Of course, many brands undertake charitable projects. Fashion firm Asos, for example, sells a ""Made In Kenya"" range produced by local clothing manufacturer Soko, which it says aims to support local craftsmanship. Similarly, footwear firms Toms and Roma Boots both give away a pair of shoes to a child in need for each pair they sell. The difference with Kate Spade's charitable initiative On Purpose, the firm says, is that it's a business venture that had to make commercial as well as emotional sense. ""It couldn't be a crafty aside done for corporate social responsibility that didn't tie back into economic sustainability,"" says Taryn Bird, senior manager of the On Purpose initiative. She said this was because the firm wanted to set up something that lasted and enabled the factory to be financially independent, eventually taking orders from other fashion brands and becoming part of the global supply chain. The only way to make sure this happened, was to set it up themselves, says Ms Bird. Kate Spade has trained ADC's workers so they have the skills needed to make its products The factory is not owned by Kate Spade, but is an official supplier. The people who work there - around 150 - are employed by Abahizi Dushyigikirane Corporation, known as ADC. So is this just exploiting Rwanda's low-wage economy? Kate Spade says not, pointing out even the lowest paid worker's salary in the country is considerably higher than the median salary for private sector jobs in Rwanda. It has also set up a life skills programme at the company, offering counselling, information on health and nutrition and English language lessons. While the firm won't be drawn on how much exactly it ploughed into the factory to get it going, Ms Beech says it was ""a minimal investment"". Almost four years on she says they are ""on track"" to get their investment back and for the factory to become profitable. The staff retention rate is an impressive 98%. But Africa is not such an unusual choice for a firm looking to diversify its supplier base. Labour costs are already much lower than in China. According to Georgetown University in Washington,which studied the Kate Spade project,external, staff in factories in coastal China earned around $700 (Â£537) a month, over six times the average $113 monthly salary at the ADC factory. Africa is seen by many as the world's next low-cost manufacturing hub Africa also offers what Ms Bird describes as ""a very business friendly climate for export companies"". ADC does not have to pay duties on incoming raw materials and is also able to export the finished bags to the US without tariffs. In contrast, tariffs on handbags from Asian suppliers range from 4.5% to 17.5%, according to Georgetown University. So Africa has the potential to become the world's next low-cost manufacturing hub thanks to a cheap workforce and an abundance of raw materials. A lot of production has moved there already. Ms Beech, however, says that wasn't why Kate Spade chose Rwanda. The bags made there were additional orders reflecting increased demand for its products. Pietra Rivoli, a professor teaching finance and international business at Georgetown University, and part of the team which researched the project, says it proves it's possible to put a factory anywhere. ""The set up was not terribly complex. It's not something that other companies could not do given the motivation and support from management,"" she says. She says the supportive factory set-up made ADC feel very different to any other factory she had visited. Kate Spade offers ""a demonstrative case study"" of an alternative approach, says Prof Pietra Rivoli ""I'm not saying other factories are somehow bad. But most supplier relationships tend to be very transactional. The relationship is one of monitoring for labour abuses, whereas the ADC approach is a much more positive philosophy."" Typically, how cheaply and quickly something can be made are the main criteria a company uses for deciding where to locate a factory. Prof Rivoli says the Kate Spade example offers ""a demonstrative case study"" of an alternative approach. ""What they have shown is that it can really be a win-win. The factory can pay the company back [for the set-up costs] and the firm can support the worker and their communities. So far it's one small-scale experiment. But Kate Spade says it is already planning to pilot a second factory in a different developing country in the next couple of years. ""This time we'll make sure it has access to a port,"" laughs Ms Beech. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Where's hot?

"The civil unrest left 43 people dead and more than 1,000 injured Darryle Buchanan was approaching his 12th birthday when he awoke on the morning of 23 July 1967 to the sounds of what appeared to be a raucous party outside. As the young altar boy rose from his bed and ironed his cassocks that Sunday morning, preparing for duty at St Agnes Catholic Church, he could smell smoke. ""I thought people must be barbecuing or something,"" he recalled. The phone rang and his mother, an emergency room technician who worked an overnight shift, called to tell her son to stay put. Fewer than 10 blocks away, Detroit was beginning to burn. Fifty years ago and five days before Mr Buchanan's birthday, police raided an after-hours African-American blind pig, or an unlicensed drinking and gambling club, and arrested 82 people in the middle of the night. The incident touched off civil unrest across Detroit over the next five days, prompting Michigan Governor George Romney to deploy the National Guard and eventually President Lyndon Johnson to send troops from the US Army's 82nd and 101st Airborne Division to quell the violence. Once the dust settled, 43 people were dead, 1,000 were injured and more than 7,000 were arrested - many of whom were African-American - in what seemed like a warzone to the rest of the country. The subject is the focus of Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow's forthcoming film Detroit, which centres on a single incident at the Algiers Motel during that week of violence. Police fatally shot three black teens at point-blank range and beat other black men while looking for snipers at the motel. Only one officer faced trial for the shootings and was acquitted by an all-white jury - a refrain that has continued in recent years amid a national debate on excessive use of police force. The disorder caused more than $50m (Â£38m) in damages and reduced an upwards of 2,000 buildings to rubble Mr Buchanan spent the next week watching as the 12th Street neighbourhood - once a bustling business and commercial district - became engulfed in chaos, destroyed brick by brick. ""People were coming down the street with shopping carts and things in their hands,"" he recalled of that first morning. ""I actually saw a guy run from the meat market across 12th Street with a side of beef on his back,"" he says with a chuckle. ""I for one didn't know what he was going to do with it because you gotta have the right carving tools for that, but that's just how insane it was."" Mr Buchanan remembers sweaty nights sleeping beneath his grandparents' dining room table that week, peering out the window as police raided the building next door and watching looters burn down a dry cleaners as he stood across the street. ""When the building collapsed through the floor, there was this rush of cool air that came out of the basement that you could feel change in the intensity of the heat,"" he says. ""These rats were on fire, running down on 12th Street, as the whole thing came down. ""When a building catches fire it doesn't smell like a bonfire or paper burning. It is a smell like after an earthquake or something, that smell of decay. And that lingered because the rubble just sat there."" ""It was a warzone,"" Mr Buchanan says The devastation included more than $50m (Â£38m) in damages and reduced more than 2,000 buildings to piles of smouldering ashes, plunging the one-time Model City into a downward spiral of poverty and blight. During the stifling temperatures of the summer of 1967, known elsewhere as the Summer of Love, civil unrest erupted across nearly 130 cities across the country - but Detroit would mark the bloodiest and its scars would run deep for decades to come. ""Detroit's story is America's story,"" says Marlowe Stoudamire, the director of the Detroit Historical Museum's exhibit commemorating the event. Detroit 67: Looking Back to Move Forward,external, is a three-year project spanning the 50 years before and after 1967, including oral histories from hundreds of locals and former residents. ""We've had some victories and we've had a lot of failures,"" he says. ""But it's important for us to look at our collective history no matter where we are and understand how it intersects with our lives."" Before the unrest, Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanaugh, often described as a white liberal visionary, touted the Motor City as a successful example of President Johnson's Model Cities Program. Detroit was among several cities to receive millions in federal funding for urban development as its booming economy attracted thousands of workers to the centre of the automobile industry. ""Detroit was really this shining city on a hill in terms of racial harmony,"" says Jeffrey Horner, a Wayne State University urban studies and planning senior lecturer who is teaching a course on the events. The race riot that never was Amateur photographer captures pivotal 20th Century moments The city, home to the three largest US carmakers, brimmed with wealth and boasted more than 90% of the car market after World War Two. ""Detroit had this amazing history before the riots, but it was this 10-year period of time where city's fortunes completely reversed,"" Mr Horner says. For many, the blind pig arrests marked the final straw in the black community's long-simmering frustrations with economic strife, housing discrimination and racial tensions with a predominantly white police force. By 1967, African-Americans made up just 5% of the police force, but roughly 40% of the population. The 1967 crisis has been described as riots, with hundreds of locals taking part in burning buildings, ransacking local businesses and widespread violence. Of the 43 people killed, 33 were African-American and 10 were white, including a police officer, two firefighters and a National Guardsman. But the disorder has also been called a rebellion, underscoring long-standing economic and racial frustrations among the city's large black community amid a period of urban renewal. ""The timber was dry that weekend,"" says Mr Horner. ""It should have been no surprise to anybody in the black community but I think there is almost unanimity this took the white power base in the city completely by surprise."" The chaos on the streets was indeed met by shock from city officials and police, who were overwhelmed by the violence and required both state and federal help to put an end to the volatility. Both state and federal troops were called in to help quell the unrest Mr Horner is among those who refer to the unrest as a rebellion, titling his class The 1967 Rebellion: Retrospect and Prospect. He says his research shows that the black community was ""entirely morally justified"" in rebellion against its mistreatment. ""These were very disenfranchised people and people who were being treated as second-class citizens,"" he says. ""But I don't think there was any justification for the horrible outcomes and loss of lives and loss of property. ""It really turned the city upside down and in many respects the city hasn't recovered from it, but as far as the rebellion occurring in the first place, I think it was justified."" Ike McKinnon, a former police chief and deputy mayor, was one of the few African-American police officers on duty as the unrest roiled Detroit. He was driving home after a long shift when he was pulled over by two white officers, he recalled inthe Detroit 67 project,external. Still dressed in uniform, Mr McKinnon was ordered to get out of his car, where one of the officers pointed a gun in his face and said: ""Tonight you're going to die, nigger."" Mr McKinnon said he saw the officer begin to pull the trigger, then he dived back into his car and took off as they open fire. ""So that was a sad reality to me that here we had these two police officers who shot at me, and it hit me in terms of, if they shot at me, a fellow police officer, what are they going to do to other people in the street, the city?"" he said. Before the unrest, Stella Heatley, a British nanny from Suffolk who worked for the British Council in nearby Grosse Pointe Park from 1966 to 1969, recalls the thrill of taking a bus downtown to shop at department stores, never concerned for her safety. ""It was really a pleasant life. We really didn't think anything about it,"" she says of how she spent her days as a nanny. But then came the outbreak of violence and her sense of well-being changed. ""The riots really put a stop to going downtown with the same sense of security."" Mrs Heatley, who permanently returned to Detroit in 1973 after marrying her American husband, Henry, remembers hearing about the violence a day after the police raid. She received a phone call from the Council to pack a bag and to be ready to leave, possibly by boat, on Monday afternoon. The family remained, but Mrs Heatley remembers watching television images of plumes of smoke billowing from the streets. ""There was a media blackout so it was about a week before the full gravity of the damage done became clear to the general public,"" she says. ""They burned everything,"" Mrs Heatley says ""It was just block after block after block just burnt to the ground,"" she says, describing the days that followed. ""They had burnt their own homes, their own shops, their own professionals - it was just decimated. ""People were genuinely alarmed that if it started there it could continue elsewhere. There was a fear,"" she added, ""an apprehension."" The fear was palpable - and it hung over the city, Mrs Heatley says. ""People literally left in the next few weeks because they weren't sure of what would happen, what the impact on immediate future of the city would be and they were afraid, in some cases, for the children going to school,"" she says. ""They just didn't feel safe."" The city's population would indeed shrink from 1.8 million people, at its peak in 1950 as the country's fifth largest city, to just 672,000 people today. The Twelfth Street business district never recovered after 1967, leading many of the buildings to fall into a state of disrepair and shop owners to abandon the area. The street now stands commercially barren, marked by empty plots of land, a park and housing complexes. ""I felt this sense of loss that the community I knew was never going to be the same. And it wasn't,"" Mr Buchanan says. The events also exacerbated the white flight of the middle class to the suburbs, which began in the 1950s, starving the city of tax revenue and ultimately leading to the decline of Detroit's public schools. But the unrest is also a reminder to residents of the community leadership that rose from the ashes of 1967, with the creation of several organisations including New Detroit and Focus: HOPE. Some of those community-driven changes served as the city's backbone as it endured the following decades of economic turmoil, Mr Horner points out, including the so-called Great Recession of the late 2000s, the near collapse of the car industry and Detroit's historic declaration of municipal bankruptcy in 2013. What happens when a city loses half its population Trump: The view from Detroit ""The community development movement was a very important link between city government and residents, to the extent that it spurred discussion amongst stakeholders and groups such as aggrieved citizens,"" he says. ""Just the fact that there's a lot more talking going on now than there was in 1967 is an important lesson."" The state also passed the Michigan Fair Housing Act to fight housing discrimination and Detroit elected its first black mayor, Coleman Young, in 1973. These lessons are more important than ever as the city undertakes a massive revitalisation effort, accelerated by young entrepreneurs returning to the city, Mr Stoudamire says. ""Detroit is not a blank canvas. You don't build on top or around people, you build with people,"" he says. ""That's why we're trying to use this as a catalyst to move forward. Our identity doesn't need to be recalibrated, but our stories need to be told.""

"Jodie Whittaker in Trust Me Before she takes over the lead role in Doctor Who, Jodie Whittaker will be appearing on our screens as a very different doctor... and a fake one at that. In BBC One thriller Trust Me, Whittaker plays Cath Hardacre, a nurse who loses her job after she turns whistle-blower. Wanting to provide a better life for her young daughter, she steals her best friend's identity as a senior doctor and lands a job in an Edinburgh hospital (a colleague amusingly describes the A&E department as ""like Braveheart with bad-tempered pensioners"".) Armed with her nursing knowledge and some medical textbooks, Cath sets out to bluff her way as an experienced emergency medic. Of course, it doesn't all go smoothly. Trust Me contains several squirm-inducing scenes of medical procedures that don't go by the book An early encounter sees her straighten a man's broken foot having forgotten to give him an anaesthetic. Imagine the screams. Then there's a heart-stopping - and heart-breaking - sequence involving the victims of a car crash. ""There was blood squirting everywhere,"" says Whittaker, at a press screening that was held before the recent announcement she was to replace Peter Capaldi in Doctor Who. This video can not be played New Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker's former roles Like her character in Trust Me, the blood is of course fake, but that doesn't make it any less excruciating to watch. ""The prosthetics were amazing,"" Whittaker adds. ""And there were phenomenal actors coming in and committing to the sound of pain."" Trust Me was written by Dan Sefton, a real-life A&E doctor, whose other TV writing includes Good Karma Hospital and Mr Selfridge. ""I think there are loads of people who aren't real doctors,"" says Sefton, somewhat chillingly. ""It's not that hard to fake it if you have some qualifications. Part of this thing is that people don't ask too many questions. We set this deliberately in a place that was on the periphery and struggling to recruit."" Sefton also reveals that there had once been a case of a bogus doctor working in his own hospital. ""He only got found out through some administrative thing, because he was actually pretty competent,"" he recalls. ""Often these doctors are very professional and get along very well with their colleagues. The only flaw is that they aren't real doctors."" Writer Dan Sefton, who is also a practicing doctor, talked Jodie Whittaker through medical procedures As well as writing the tense hospital scenes, Sefton also helped give the actors some medical training. That included teaching Whittaker how to insert a needle into his own arm. ""I got it in your vein first time,"" the Broadchurch actress notes proudly. ""But I forgot to put the cap on and you started bleeding, which was a bit of a panic!"" Whittaker says she was fine with the ""physical and emotional stuff"" that the script demanded. ""The thing I struggled most with - and that comes from failing over half my GCSEs - was the pronunciation of medicines."" The rest of the cast includes Emun Elliott as an A&E doctor, Sharon Small as the consultant in charge, and Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison as Cath's ex-boyfriend and father of their daughter. Whittaker describes herself as big fan of the NHS.  ""You don't have to be rich to be poorly,"" she says. ""There are obviously problems - we all read the news - but I feel that the thing you want to celebrate is the day-to-day people: The doctors and nurses."" Sefton admits that what fascinates him is WHY people pretend to be doctors. ""Men almost always do it for egotistical reasons,"" he says. ""They are often fantasists. They want to be somebody who is impressive. ""Women tend to do it more much more practical, interesting reasons.  That's one of the reasons I chose a female protagonist for this drama. ""I was much more interested in looking at how the act of lying changes someone who is an essentially honest person."" Trust Me begins on Tuesday 8 August on BBC One.

"This video can not be played ""We're still not out of the woods yet"" - tourist who witnessed the wildfires Wildfires in south-eastern France have forced the evacuation of 10,000 people overnight, officials say. Hundreds of firefighters have been deployed to battle the fires near Bormes-les-Mimosas, in the country's Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur region. France earlier asked its EU neighbours for more help fighting the fires. Some 4,000 hectares (15.4 sq miles) of land have burned along the Mediterranean coast, in the mountainous interior and on the island of Corsica. ""The evacuations, at least 10,000, followed the progression of the fire,"" a fire official was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. ""It's an area that doubles or triples its population in summer,"" the official added. At least 10,000 people have been evacuated after wildfires swept through south-eastern France Some 4,000 hectares (15.4 sq miles) of land have burned along the Mediterranean coast One of the worst fires is raging in an area near the popular resort of Saint-Tropez. In Corsica, hundreds of homes have been evacuated. Overall, more than 4,000 firefighters and troops backed by water bombers have been trying to extinguish the flames since Monday. At least 12 firefighters have been injured and 15 police officers affected by smoke inhalation, officials say.

She said that as many as 3,000 people - including tourists from other campsites - ended up staying on the beach in cold winds. ""People are just very tired,"" Ms Minot said, adding that there very young children among the evacuees. Water bombers have been tackling the blaze since Monday These homes came close to being destroyed She said she saw planes scooping up water from the sea and then going back ""into the pool of black smoke"" on the coast.

"Zeppelin was spotted in Shotts, North Lanarkshire, on Sunday A hedgehog that had swollen to the size of a beach ball is being cared for by the Scottish SPCA. The animal was spotted by a member of the public on Sunday in Shotts, North Lanarkshire. Vets believe the hedgehog was clipped by a car, puncturing a lung and causing air to be trapped under the skin. The Scottish SPCA said the hedgehog, nicknamed ""Zeppelin"" by staff, had now ""deflated"" and was being cared for at one of the charity's rescue centres.

"An advert by a vegan campaign group claiming ""Humane milk is a myth"" has been cleared by regulators, despite complaints from the dairy industry. Milk producers said it described the separation of mothers from their calves in an inaccurate and misleading way. The ad featured a photo of a cow behind a piece of barbed wire and the headline ""Humane milk is a myth. Don't buy it."" TheAdvertising Standards Authority (ASA) said,externalit was ""unlikely to materially mislead readers"". The national newspaper advert for campaign group Go Vegan World goes on to state: ""I went vegan the day I visited a dairy. The mothers, still bloody from birth, searched and called frantically for their babies. ""Their daughters, fresh from their mothers' wombs but separated from them, trembled and cried piteously, drinking milk from rubber teats on the wall instead of their mothers' nurturing bodies. All because humans take their milk."" The ASA said seven complainants, some of whom had experience working in the dairy industry, suggested the claims were misleading and questioned whether they could be substantiated. Go Vegan World said the advert did not state or imply that calves were separated from their mothers prior to the 12 to 24 hours recommended by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). But they said they believed the exact timing was irrelevant, and most people would consider separation at 25 hours equally as unjust as separation at 24 hours. The ASA said the language in the advert was ""emotional and hard-hitting"" Clearing the advert, the ASA said it understood the complainants were concerned the advert implied a significant number of dairy farms did not comply with animal welfare standards in place in the UK, and milk production was therefore ""inhumane"" in that sense. But it concluded that while ""the language used to express the claims was emotional and hard-hitting"", it was a fact that calves were generally separated from their mothers very soon after birth under Defra regulations and so the advert was unlikely to materially mislead.

"This video can not be played A montage of photos, set to Ariana Grande's One Last Time, was played in the service The youngest Manchester bombing victim was a ""superstar in the making"", her father has said at her funeral. Wiping away tears, Andrew Roussos joined mourners at the city's packed cathedral to remember ""stunning, stunning"" eight-year-old Saffie. She was among 22 people killed whenSalman Abedi detonated a homemade bombat an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May. The service was the last of the funerals forthe victims. Live updates on this story Hundreds of mourners filed into the cathedral, some wearing pink, which was Saffie's favourite colour. Andrew Roussos puts a hand around his son Xander as he carries his daughter's coffin Others carried a single rose, as requested by the family, in tribute to their daughter's middle name, Rose. Saffie's coffin was also covered in roses. Saffie, from Lancashire, had been at the venue with her mother Lisa and sister, Ashlee Bromwich, 26, who were both injured in the attack. During the service, Mr Roussos said he had been ""honoured to be her dad"" and she was ""a superstar in the making"". ""To become something in life, you need to have that something,"" he said. ""That spark. That charisma. The ones that make it are born with it, they get it from the very beginning. ""Saffie had that."" Saffie's mother Lisa Roussos and brother Xander watched as her coffin, covered with roses, was carried out of the hearse Andrew Roussos described his daughter as ""a joker"" and ""a huge character"" Mr Roussos added the ""Manchester community, family and friends have been fantastic"". The cortege left Wythenshawe Hospital, where Mrs Roussos, who has undergone multiple operations since the attack and for a while was in an induced coma, is still receiving treatment. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police Ian Hopkins Saffie's coffin was covered in roses A letter from her sister Ashlee was read out in which she wrote: ""I close my eyes and I see your face with your brown eyes burning. ""I imagine how you run up and jump into my arms. I see you everywhere, with your smile from ear to ear. ""You lived to entertain, and to keep us all smiling. Something about you got everyone's attention. Your silliness and jokes are the highlights of my memories. ""Whatever you wanted, you were going to make it happen. I wish I could do you justice with my words. ""Nothing more, nothing less could I have ever wanted in a baby sister."" Manchester Cathedral, just around the corner from the scene of the bombing, seemed an especially poignant location for a day of tributes to the atrocity's youngest victim. It also marked the last of 22 funerals for those who died. Many of those ceremonies have been private, unpublicised affairs, but the family of Saffie Roussos extended an open invitation for anyone to come to pay their respects. A bleak, rainy afternoon did not dissuade hundreds from attending. The cathedral itself was packed, with dozens of others - including many children - listening to the service via speakers set up outside. Mourners heard how eight-year-old Saffie had loved dance, performance and stardom. She lived to entertain, and had dreamt of one day being as famous as her idol, Ariana Grande. Today's service, back in the heart of Manchester, was a reminder that she, and all of the victims, will certainly not be forgotten. Saffie was a pupil at Tarleton Primary School in Lancashire A montage of photos, set to the music of Grande's hit One Last Time, was also shown before being released by her family and friends. The YouTube video clip shows a series of photographs and the family said they hoped it would be liked and shared to fulfil her dream of becoming famous. This video can not be played 'She was a huge character' - Manchester attack father Rev Govender said 22 decorative bees would be placed in the cathedral's furniture as a memorial to the victims of the bombing. He asked Mrs Roussos to hold one of the model bees as he dedicated it to Saffie. He said the service was a ""poignant moment"", not just for Saffie's family but also for the people of Manchester. Saffie's coffin was carried outside to the sound of school friends singing Over The Rainbow as spontaneous applause rang out from members of the public as the funeral cars left the cathedral for a private cremation. Saffie with her mother, Lisa Flowers and tributes flooded in for Saffie after the Manchester attack A short service was also held at Holy Trinity Church in Tarleton, where Saffie went to school, for those who could not travel to Manchester. The Rev David Craven said: ""There was a real desire among some in the community to have a gathering to mark Saffie's life. ""We wanted to open the doors of the church, which will be open all day for quiet reflection, and collective grief. ""You can't even begin to imagine what the families are going through. It's times like this when words seem hollow."" Twenty-one funerals had previously been held for the victims of the attack, several of them private. The first was for 14-year-oldEilidh MacLeod in Barra, Scotland, on 5 June, and the most recent was forKelly Brewster in Sheffieldon 21 July. Who were the victims?

"Mike Ashley was described in court as a ""power drinker"" Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has won a High Court battle with an investment banker over a Â£15m deal allegedly made in a pub. Jeffrey Blue told the court Newcastle United's owner reneged on a promise to pay him a multimillion-pound sum if he increased the firm's share price. The court heard about ""drink-fuelled"" meetings in pubs, including one where Mr Ashley ""vomited into a fireplace"". Mr Ashley's lawyers said he had won a ""comprehensive"" victory. The hearing was told that four years ago Mr Ashley met Mr Blue and three other finance specialists at the Horse and Groom in London and ""consumed a lot of alcohol"". Mr Ashley said: ""I can't remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking. ""If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him Â£15m if he could increase [Sports Direct's] share price to Â£8, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn't being serious."" He said he paid Mr Blue Â£1m in ""other deals"" unrelated to the Horse and Groom meeting. Jeffrey Blue described ""unorthodox"" working practices at Sports Direct Mr Blue described Mr Ashley as a ""serious businessman"", but said the work ethic at Derbyshire-based Sports Direct was ""like nothing else I have ever seen"" with business conducted ""in unorthodox ways and in unusual venues"". The Â£14m High Court case between Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley and a banker offered a revealing insight into how business is done in some quarters. Stories of monster drinking sessions, kebabs and vomiting into a fireplace emerged as financial expert Jeffrey Blue tried to get Ashley to cough up. He claimed the Sports Direct founder had promised him the money in a deal struck in a pub, but Ashley said the conversation was no more than a joke. And a judge has now agreed no-one could have thought he was being serious. The judge said that during the Horse and Groom meeting Mr Ashley promised him Â£15m, but Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell said Mr Blue only mentioned the figure of Â£1m to him. Ruling in Mr Ashley's favour, judge Justice Leggatt said: ""No reasonable person present... would have thought that the offer to pay Mr Blue Â£15m was serious and was intended to create a contract. ""They all thought it was a joke. The fact that Mr Blue has since convinced himself that the offer was a serious one, and that a legally binding agreement was made, shows only that the human capacity for wishful thinking knows few bounds."" He ordered that Mr Blue would have to pick up Mr Ashley's legal bill of Â£1.5m, as well as his own of ""one million odd"". In a statement after the ruling Mr Ashley said: ""The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded Â£8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct.""

"Fees for those bringing employment tribunal claims have been ruled unlawful, and the government will now have to repay up to Â£32m to claimants. The government introduced fees of up to Â£1,200 in 2013, which it said would cut the number of malicious and weak cases. Government statistics showed 79% fewer cases were brought over three years - trade union Unison said the fees prevented workers accessing justice. The government said it would take steps to stop charging and refund payments. The Supreme Court,externalruled the government was acting unlawfully and unconstitutionally when it introduced the fees. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: ""The government has been acting unlawfully, and has been proved wrong - not just on simple economics, but on constitutional law and basic fairness too."" He added: ""These unfair fees have let law-breaking bosses off the hook these past four years, and left badly treated staff with no choice but to put up or shut up. ""We'll never know how many people missed out because they couldn't afford the expense of fees."" The government had already made a voluntary commitment to reimburse all fees if it was found they acted unlawfully. Fees have raised about Â£32m since being introduced. Justice minister Dominic Raab said the government would cease taking fees for employment tribunals ""immediately"" and begin the process of reimbursing claimants, dating back to 2013. He said: ""We respect the judgement and we are going to take it fully on board and we are going to comply with it."" It would fall to the taxpayer to pick up the bill, he said. ""The tricky, the difficult, the fluid balancing act that we've got is we want to make sure there's proper access to justice, we want to make sure frivolous or spurious claims don't clog up the tribunal and at the same time we've got to make sure we've got the right way to fund it.,"" he said. Fees ranged between Â£390 and Â£1,200. Discrimination cases cost more for claimants because of the complexity and time hearings took. The Supreme Court found this was indirectly discriminatory because a higher proportion of women would bring discrimination cases. It also said that some people would not bring cases to employment tribunals because paying the fees would render any financial reward pointless. The court's summary added claimants in low or middle income household could not afford the fees ""without sacrificing ordinary and reasonable expenditure for substantial periods of time"". TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said it was a ""massive win"" for workers. ""Too many low-paid workers couldn't afford to uphold their rights at work, even when they've faced harassment or have been sacked unfairly,"" she said. The decision was welcomed by employment lawyer Karen Jackson, who said: ""I don't know an employment lawyer who didn't think it was wrong to have fees. ""We all felt that morally it was the wrong thing to do as a barrier to justice.""

"This video can not be played Riley Dosh explains why she wants to defend her country US President Donald Trump says transgender people cannot serve in ""any capacity"" in the military. He tweeted,externalthat he had consulted with military experts and cited ""tremendous medical costs and disruption"". The Obama administration decided last year to allow transgender people to serve openly in the military. But in June, Defence Secretary James Mattis agreed to a six-month delay in the recruitment of transgender people. As is often the case, the announcement came in a series of tweets. Mr Trump said: ""After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" But the measure will not go into effect immediately, as spokesperson Sarah Sanders told reporters at a White House press briefing. The implementation policy has to be worked out, she said when asked if troops on battlefields would be immediately sent back to the United States. This was ""a military decision"" said Mrs Sanders, adding that it is ""not meant to be anything more than that"". 'My stomach dropped': Transgender troops hit by ban The secret life of a transgender airman Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America Reporter Different stance - on the campaign trail last year The timing of this transgender ban is almost as interesting as the move itself. Why now? With the Trump administration being buffeted by the Jeff Sessions political death watch, the ongoing multi-prong investigation into the Trump campaign, the healthcare drama in the Senate and the impending Russian sanctions bill, perhaps the administration decided this was a good time to change the subject and rally conservative forces to his side. Republicans have long used cultural issues as a wedge to divide Democrats and energise evangelicals. As one White House insider acknowledged, this is straight out of that playbook. While Mr Trump campaigned as sympathetic to LGBT rights, he needs the traditional religious conservatives to stay loyal to him now, more than ever. Or perhaps,as Politico is reporting,external, the White House sought to resolve an intraparty dispute that threatened passage of a key military spending bill in the House of Representatives. That the president chose to do so suddenly, with little advanced notice, would not be out of the ordinary for this administration. The president's action will create a furore among liberals and the media commentators whose disdain for the current administration is not a new development. This is a fight the White House will welcome. The independent Rand Corporation estimated in 2016 that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender, although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000. Rand also predicted that the inclusion of transgender people in the military would cause a 0.13% increase in healthcare spending (approximately $8.4m). A Military Times analysis,externalfound that the Department of Defense spends five times that figure just on erectile dysfunction drug Viagara alone. The Obama administration's move to allow transgender people in the military to serve openly was announced in June 2016 by then Defence Secretary Ash Carter. This video can not be played Being transgender in the US military - Jamie Ewing spoke to the BBC in 2016 The policy included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender. Transgender people would be permitted to join the services, so long as they could demonstrate they had been stable in their new gender for at least 18 months. This was meant to come into effect on 1 July 2017 but the Trump administration delayed it by a further six months. The Pentagon said the five branches of the military needed more time to ""review their accession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces"". While Mr Trump's decision concerns transgender military personnel, the US military's ban on openly gay and lesbian servicemen and women - known as ""Don't ask don't tell"" - was lifted in 2011. Delays leave transgender military in limbo UK chiefs praise transgender troops LGBTQ campaign group, GLAAD, called Mr Trump's move ""a direct attack on transgender Americans"". Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Centre, a leading think-tank which studies gender and sexuality in the military, told the BBC that Mr Trump's decision would force transgender troops to in effect live as gays and lesbians did under ""Don't ask, don't tell"". Kristin Beck, a retired elite Navy SEAL, issued a challenge to President Trumpin an interview with Business Insider,external: ""Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy."" She said that during her decorated military career, she had been ""defending individual liberty"". ""Being transgender doesn't affect anyone else,"" she said. ""We are liberty's light. If you can't defend that for everyone that's an American citizen, that's not right."" NBC's Micah Grimes tweeted this reaction Former Defence Secretary Carter released a critical statement: ""To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military. There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honourably."" Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican John McCain, said major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter and continued: ""The statement was unclear. The Department of Defense has already decided to allow currently-serving transgender individuals to stay in the military, and many are serving honorably today. Any American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving."" Chelsea Manning, a transgender former US soldier, tweeted her reaction to the news Several British military generals have condemned Mr Trump's decision, including the commander of the UK Maritime Forces, Rear Admiral Alex Burton. ""As an @RoyalNavy_LGBT champion and senior warfighter I am so glad we are not going this way"", he wrote on Twitter, later adding: ""We have a justifiably rigorous selection process but it doesn't include discrimination and we're a better fighting force for it."" Trump revokes transgender toilet rules Republican opponents of transgender people serving in the military include Vicky Hartzler, a congresswoman from Missouri, who wants transgender service members honourably discharged. Some oppose the military having to bear medical costs associated with transgender recruits, such as gender reassignment. Tony Perkins of the socially conservative Family Research council said: ""Our troops shouldn't be forced to endure hours of transgender 'sensitivity' classes and politically correct distractions."" Trump supporter and political commentator Scott Presler is among those who disagree with the military carrying the cost of such interventions. While disagreeing with the ban, he added that ""generals know more about war than I do. ""I am cognisant that they understand what it takes to go to war...

"What do Doctor Who, the Metropolitan Police and the UK Supreme Court all have in common? All three have recently appointed a woman in their leading role for the first time. Baroness Hale is the latest, continuing her trailblazing career by being named asthe president of the Supreme Courton Friday. She followed closely behind Jodie Whittaker's headline-grabbing casting asTV's first female Doctor,while Cressida Dick became thefirst woman to take charge of London's police forcein its 188-year history earlier this year. That trio have, between them, ended 250 years of male dominance. Yet there are plenty of renowned British institutions where a woman is still to reach the summit. Here are a selection: The man in the job Philip Hammond is the top dog at the Treasury - the latest in a long line of men. He was appointed in July 2016 as the government's chief financial minister. Along with prime minister, foreign secretary and home secretary, it's regarded as one of the four great offices of state, but while the others have all had female occupants, the wait for the first female chancellor goes on. The first chancellor listed by the government's website was Sir Richard Sackville in 1559. That's 458 years and counting... Any women contenders? Following the Brexit referendum, Andrea Leadsom was briefly one of the favourites to become the next chancellor. Yet she had set her sights on the biggest prize - becoming prime minister. But after losing out to Theresa May, she was then overlooked for the chancellor role. There were rumours Amber Rudd, the home secretary, waslined up for the role,externalthis year - but that was seemingly dependent on the Conservatives claiming a landslide victory in June's general election. A hung parliament put paid to that. Mrs May's weakened position meant Mr Hammond kept his grip on the job. The man in the job In February 2013 Justin Welby became the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior cleric in the Church of England. It's a mere 1,420 years since St Augustine was the inaugural archbishop. Of course a woman - the Queen - holds the title of the supreme governor of the Church, but there has not yet been a woman who has taken up that archbishop role. Any women contenders? The last time this job was vacant, a female candidate wasn't a viable proposition. Women couldn't even be considered for bishop positions. That all changed in November 2014 when the Church of England voted to allow females into the role, following decades of wrangling over the issue. Two months later,Libby Lane was consecratedas its first woman bishop. Rachel Treweek went one step further as the Bishop of Gloucester, becoming the first female to bein charge of a diocese.and the first to sit in the House of Lords. By November 2015, eight women had been made bishops. The man in the job Tony Hall has been in the hotseat since March 2013, becoming the 16th permanent director general since the BBC's creation. Lord Reith, the corporation's founder, was the first - and the longest serving - beginning his 11-year tenure in 1927. Any women contenders? Not last time around - Lord Hall was approached directly for the role following the resignation ofGeorge Entwistleafter just 54 days in the job. The BBC Trust didn't speak to anyone else. Helen Boaden and Caroline Thomson were strong contenders to replace Mark Thompson in 2012, before Entwistle got the nod. Last year, Anne Bulford was namedLord Hall's second in command- the first woman to be deputy director general. For rivals Channel 4 a female leader is more imminent. Alex Mahon has been appointed as their firstfemale chief executiveand will take up the role in the autumn. The man in the job Canadian Mark Carney replaced Mervyn King as the head of the UK's central bank in June 2013, becoming the first foreigner to run the institution. In its 323-year history, there has never been a woman in charge, even though one appears on the front of all of the country's banknotes [yes, the Queen again]. Any women contenders? Mr Carney has led a drive to get more women in senior roles at the Bank. Charlotte Hogg landed the newly created role of chief operating officer in 2013 and was the most senior female employee in the institution's history. Earlier this year she was appointed deputy governor and was touted as a potential successor to Mr Carney - before hersudden resignationafter failing to disclose a potential conflict of interest. There has been a woman in charge of a major British bank - Ana Botin became the first female to hold that title when she became chief executive of Santander UK in December 2010. That led her to being named the third most powerful woman in Britain in 2013 by BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, just behind the Queen and Theresa May. The man in the job The newspaper's current editor, John Witherow, has been at the helm since January 2013. Founded in 1785, the Times is one of Britain's oldest and most influential newspapers around the world, and has had 21 different male editors. It all began with John Walter, whose family owned the paper for almost 125 years. Any women contenders? Emma Tucker could be in the frame when the position next becomes vacant. The former editor of Financial Times Weekend has been deputy editor at the Times since October 2013. And at sister paper, the Sunday Times, Sarah Baxter has been deputy editor for the last four years, Women have already made the breakthrough at other newspapers. The Guardian handed the reins to Katharine Viner in 2015 - the first female editor at the paper in 194 years, while Rebekah Brooks' groundbreaking spell in charge of the Sun lasted between 2003 and 2009. And Eve Pollard, the self-styled First Lady of Fleet Street, edited two papers - the Sunday Mirror from 1987 to 1991 and Sunday Express from 1991 to 1994. But one of the UK's first women editors, Mary Howarth, didn't exactly blaze a trail when she was appointed as editor of the Daily Mirror when it launched in 1903. No other woman has held that role since. The man in the job Jeremy Corbyn, one of the most unexpected winners of the party leadership in its history, was elected in September 2015. Founded by Keir Hardie in 1906, Labour has never been led by a woman other than for brief interim periods. Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman have both been acting leader. Any women contenders? Ms Harman was deputy leader under both Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, but didn't run for the main job. She has since admitted she should have stood in 2010. Women candidates have a history of doing badly in Labour leadership contests. Diane Abbott trailed in last in 2010 and the two female contenders in 2015, Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper, came in last and second last. During last year's contest Angela Eagle dropped out before it had officially begun, leaving no women in the race. If Mr Corbyn was to leave his position any time soon, Ms Cooper is the favourite with some bookmakers. Angela Rayner, the youngest ever shadow education secretary, has also been spoken of as a future contender. The man in the job Speculation continues over whether Daniel Craig will return as James Bond, but as it stands, he is the man in the driving seat of the superspy's favoured Aston Martin. He first appeared as 007 in 2006, succeeding the likes of Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan in one of the most sought-after roles in British cinema. Any women contenders? Gillian Anderson, of X-Files fame, has put her hat in the ring to be the next 007. Last year she tweeted, alongside a mocked-up poster of herself in the role, ""It's Bond, Jane Bond"". Charlize Theron, who plays a British spy in her upcoming film Atomic Blonde, has been endorsed by fellow actor Chris Hemsworth as a future Bond. Bookmakers certainly aren't writing off the possibility. ""Any female"" is currently joint-seventh favourite with Ladbrokes and Coral - the same odds as Michael Fassbender.

"Divorces are known to break a heart or two but in one case in Japan, an extra 54 violins were left in tatters. A woman has been arrested for destroying her former partner's violin collection and 70 bows, together worth 105.9m yen ($950,700, Â£770,000). The 34-year-old suspect broke into his apartment in Nagoya and wrecked the instruments, police said. The incident took place in 2014 in the midst of their breakup but the woman has only just been arrested. Her 62-year-old former husband is said to have been both a maker and collector of violins. The most valuable instrument among the 54 casualties was an Italian-made violin worth 50m yen, the Kyodo news agency said. According to Japanese media, the woman is a Chinese national and was arrested on Tuesday upon returning from China to Tokyo.

"This video can not be played Riley Dosh explains why she wants to defend her country US President Donald Trump says transgender people cannot serve in ""any capacity"" in the military. He tweeted,externalthat he had consulted with military experts and cited ""tremendous medical costs and disruption"". The Obama administration decided last year to allow transgender people to serve openly in the military. But in June, Defence Secretary James Mattis agreed to a six-month delay in the recruitment of transgender people. As is often the case, the announcement came in a series of tweets. Mr Trump said: ""After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" But the measure will not go into effect immediately, as spokesperson Sarah Sanders told reporters at a White House press briefing. The implementation policy has to be worked out, she said when asked if troops on battlefields would be immediately sent back to the United States. This was ""a military decision"" said Mrs Sanders, adding that it is ""not meant to be anything more than that"". 'My stomach dropped': Transgender troops hit by ban The secret life of a transgender airman Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America Reporter Different stance - on the campaign trail last year The timing of this transgender ban is almost as interesting as the move itself. Why now? With the Trump administration being buffeted by the Jeff Sessions political death watch, the ongoing multi-prong investigation into the Trump campaign, the healthcare drama in the Senate and the impending Russian sanctions bill, perhaps the administration decided this was a good time to change the subject and rally conservative forces to his side. Republicans have long used cultural issues as a wedge to divide Democrats and energise evangelicals. As one White House insider acknowledged, this is straight out of that playbook. While Mr Trump campaigned as sympathetic to LGBT rights, he needs the traditional religious conservatives to stay loyal to him now, more than ever. Or perhaps,as Politico is reporting,external, the White House sought to resolve an intraparty dispute that threatened passage of a key military spending bill in the House of Representatives. That the president chose to do so suddenly, with little advanced notice, would not be out of the ordinary for this administration. The president's action will create a furore among liberals and the media commentators whose disdain for the current administration is not a new development. This is a fight the White House will welcome. The independent Rand Corporation estimated in 2016 that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender, although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000. Rand also predicted that the inclusion of transgender people in the military would cause a 0.13% increase in healthcare spending (approximately $8.4m). A Military Times analysis,externalfound that the Department of Defense spends five times that figure just on erectile dysfunction drug Viagara alone. The Obama administration's move to allow transgender people in the military to serve openly was announced in June 2016 by then Defence Secretary Ash Carter. This video can not be played Being transgender in the US military - Jamie Ewing spoke to the BBC in 2016 The policy included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender. Transgender people would be permitted to join the services, so long as they could demonstrate they had been stable in their new gender for at least 18 months. This was meant to come into effect on 1 July 2017 but the Trump administration delayed it by a further six months. The Pentagon said the five branches of the military needed more time to ""review their accession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces"". While Mr Trump's decision concerns transgender military personnel, the US military's ban on openly gay and lesbian servicemen and women - known as ""Don't ask don't tell"" - was lifted in 2011. Delays leave transgender military in limbo UK chiefs praise transgender troops LGBTQ campaign group, GLAAD, called Mr Trump's move ""a direct attack on transgender Americans"". Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Centre, a leading think-tank which studies gender and sexuality in the military, told the BBC that Mr Trump's decision would force transgender troops to in effect live as gays and lesbians did under ""Don't ask, don't tell"". Kristin Beck, a retired elite Navy SEAL, issued a challenge to President Trumpin an interview with Business Insider,external: ""Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy."" She said that during her decorated military career, she had been ""defending individual liberty"". ""Being transgender doesn't affect anyone else,"" she said. ""We are liberty's light. If you can't defend that for everyone that's an American citizen, that's not right."" NBC's Micah Grimes tweeted this reaction Former Defence Secretary Carter released a critical statement: ""To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military. There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honourably."" Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican John McCain, said major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter and continued: ""The statement was unclear. The Department of Defense has already decided to allow currently-serving transgender individuals to stay in the military, and many are serving honorably today. Any American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving."" Chelsea Manning, a transgender former US soldier, tweeted her reaction to the news Several British military generals have condemned Mr Trump's decision, including the commander of the UK Maritime Forces, Rear Admiral Alex Burton. ""As an @RoyalNavy_LGBT champion and senior warfighter I am so glad we are not going this way"", he wrote on Twitter, later adding: ""We have a justifiably rigorous selection process but it doesn't include discrimination and we're a better fighting force for it."" Trump revokes transgender toilet rules Republican opponents of transgender people serving in the military include Vicky Hartzler, a congresswoman from Missouri, who wants transgender service members honourably discharged. Some oppose the military having to bear medical costs associated with transgender recruits, such as gender reassignment. Tony Perkins of the socially conservative Family Research council said: ""Our troops shouldn't be forced to endure hours of transgender 'sensitivity' classes and politically correct distractions."" Trump supporter and political commentator Scott Presler is among those who disagree with the military carrying the cost of such interventions. While disagreeing with the ban, he added that ""generals know more about war than I do. ""I am cognisant that they understand what it takes to go to war...

"Eighteen-year-old Sally Anne Bowman was murdered in south London in 2005 A man serving a life sentence for raping and murdering teenage model Sally Anne Bowman has admitted attacks on two other women previously. Mark Dixie, 46, wasjailed in 2008,externalfor repeatedly stabbing Miss Bowman then raping her as she lay dead or dying in Croydon, south London in 2005. Dixie now admits raping a woman in her car in Croydon when he was 16. The former chef also molested another woman near a railway bridge in 2002 and will be sentenced on 22 September. 'He got what he deserved', model's family say,external The secret history of Sally Anne Bowman's killer,external A previous hearing was told he ambushed a woman in an isolated car park in 1987 then raped her. Following the sex attack, he tied her to the back seat of her car then set fire to the front seat. ""He later told police he had set fire to a Tampax,"" prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told Southwark Crown Court earlier. She managed to escape and raised the alarm. Mark Dixie was jailed for a minimum of 34 years in 2008 Dixie has also admitted charges of indecent assault and GBH after hitting another woman on the head several times with a chef's steel - used to sharpen kitchen blades. He attacked her near a railway bridge in Croydon and told his victim ""I'm going to kill you"". Dragging her up the stairs he proceeded to assault her but was interrupted by another woman who heard the commotion. ""When she asked what was going on, Dixie said 'nothing, nothing, it's just a row with my girlfriend,'"" the prosecutor said. Dixie fled after the victim said: ""help, help, he's attacking me"". The teen model's body was found by a skip in Croydon Mr Aylett QC told the court Dixie had revealed the attacks to police after finally admitting in January 2015 that he had killed Miss Bowman. Miss Bowman's murder was something Dixie had previously denied. ""He wrote to police indicating he wanted to tell them the truth of what had happened to Sally Anne, because at the trial he said that he was not responsible for her murder,"" Mr Aylett said. During the original three-week murder trial Dixie claimed to have found Miss Bowman dead and proceeded to have sex with her lifeless body after he had been on a drink and drugs binge. The 18-year-old's body was found next to a skip in Croydon in September 2005.

"A stronger UK film industry helped the service sector to expand, the ONS said. UK economic growth edged slightly higher in the three months to June, as a stronger service sector offset weaker manufacturing and construction. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy expanded by 0.3% in the quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months. But the ONS added there had been a ""notable slowdown"" from last year. Within the service sector, the retail and the film industries helped underpin growth, the ONS said. ""While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth,"" said Darren Morgan, ONS head of national accounts. Although the economy eked out higher growth in the second quarter, it was below levels seen in the final three months of 2016, when gross domestic product grew by 0.7%. Analysts said the latest ONS data, which is an initial estimate, diminished the chances of an interest rate rise any time soon. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: ""The confirmation of the lacklustre performance of the economy so far this year surely also diminishes the chance of an interest rate hike any time soon, especially as growth prospects for coming months have become increasingly skewed to the downside."" Film production in the UK, plus box-office receipts from cinemas, was one of the best performing parts of the economy during the April-June period. The ONS said ticket receipts from Wonder Woman and the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film were among the items that had boosted the sector it calls motion picture activities. That sector grew 8% in the second quarter. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK economy had now grown consistently for four-and-a-half years. ""We can be proud of that, but we are not complacent,"" he added. ""We need to focus on restoring productivity growth to deliver higher wages and living standards for people across the country."" Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""Growth for the first half of 2017 is below expectations, and it follows continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices."" Aberdeen Asset Management chief economist Lucy O'Carroll said: ""This pick-up will be taken as good news, but it really doesn't amount to much. ""The figures are the first estimate of growth, based on very patchy data. They always get revised over time, and often substantially so. ""It's the underlying trends that matter. They don't look favourable at the moment, given the uncertainties around Brexit and the pressure on household budgets from higher inflation."" The construction sector weakened in the second quarter, according to the ONS. That was backed up by Andrew Sweeney, from Care Building Services. He told the BBC: ""We seem to be pricing a lot more projects. We price projects for clients; we have estimators in the office. After we've priced it the clients pull it because it is coming over the budget. ""We've been given orders for jobs and at the last minute the clients have pulled them away from us due to concerns over the market."" Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, said the UK's growth in the first half of the year had been its slowest since 2013. He added: ""Whereas growth has accelerated significantly so far this year in continental Europe and many emerging markets, the UK is missing out. ""While the downside risks from the Brexit vote have not yet played out in a major way, the uncertainty stemming from Brexit is leading to caution in all areas of spending and policy that have long-term implications. ""The UK would probably be growing at 2.5% or above this year were it not for Brexit, with strong gains in real wages and more business investment."" The latest growth figure was in line with economists' expectations, and is unlikely to change expectations that, at its policy meeting next week, the Bank of England will keep interest rates at their current record low. On Monday, the International Monetary Funddowngraded its forecast for UK economic growththis year because of the weak first-quarter figure. The IMF said it expects UK GDP to grow by 1.7% instead of its previous projection of 2%.

"In 2015, hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees crossed from Hungary into Austria The EU's top court has ruled that a law requiring refugees to seek asylum in the first country they reach applies even in exceptional circumstances. The case, brought by Austria and Slovenia, could affect the future of several hundred people who arrived during the migrant crisis of 2015-16. The ruling concerns two Afghan families and a Syrian who applied for asylum after leaving Croatia. The court says it is Croatia's responsibility to decide their cases. The crisis unfolded during the summer of 2015, as one million migrants and refugees travelled through the Western Balkans. Under the so-called Dublin regulation, refugees typically have to seek asylum in the first EU state they reach. But Germany suspended the Dublin regulation for Syrian refugees, halting deportations to the countries they arrived in. From August 2015, hundreds - and sometimes thousands - arrived in Austria every day, initially via Hungary and later through Slovenia. Many wanted to travel on to Germany, but around 90,000 applied for asylum in Austria, equivalent to about 1% of its population. Among them were two Afghan sisters, Khadija and Zainab Jafari, and their children who arrived at the Austrian border in February 2016. According to Stephan Klammer, a lawyer from the Diakonie charity, ""they came through the organised transports from the Austrian and other governments"". In 2015, the equivalent of 1% of Austria's population applied for asylum there ""They came from Macedonia in a few days directly to Austria. At the Austrian border the Jafari sisters were allowed in because they said they wanted to go to Austria and ask for asylum,"" he said. But unlike many other Afghans, they were not granted asylum. The Austrian authorities eventually decided that they should be deported back to Croatia, their point of entry to the EU, under the Dublin regulation. Mr Klammer said: ""In some cases, the authorities said 'We are not responsible because of the Dublin procedure, Croatia is responsible'. So the Jafaris got this decision."" The Jafari sisters' case was taken to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), along with a similar incident in Slovenia involving a Syrian national. On Wednesday the ECJ ruled that their crossing of the Croatian border had to be considered irregular under the Dublin rule. Just because one EU country allows a non-EU citizen to enter its territory on humanitarian grounds, that authorisation is not valid in other EU countries. Austrian lawyer Clemens Lahner said that hundreds of asylum seekers would be affected by the ECJ's decision. ""For those already in Croatia - 700 or so - for them the story is over. Austria won't take them back."" But the fate of others is unclear. Farzad Mohammadi from Afghanistan came to Austria in February 2016 when he was 17 years old. He was deported back to Croatia last November. ""It was very difficult. I had tried so hard. I was in a choir, I played football, I was doing a German course, I did everything I could, but they said that is the law - you have to go,"" he told the BBC. However, he was allowed to return to Austria pending the court decision. 'Hipster right' group trying to stop rescue ships The man who migrated twice Austria passes tough new asylum law Mr Mohammadi in Austria is unclear as a result of the ruling ""Croatia was very bad, worse than Austria. We only had a thin blanket, there were problems with the heating. The toilets were dirty. Very very difficult."" In its ruling the ECJ stressed that EU countries could show a ""spirit of solidarity"" under a sovereignty clause that allows member states to examine asylum applications even if they do not have to. Lawyer Clemens Lahner told the BBC that for ""those whose asylum claims have been frozen, technically they can be sent back but the court reminds states they can show solidarity or leniency"". In response to the big migrant influx, the EU agreed to relocate 160,000 refugees from Italy and Greece, the two countries that have seen the biggest number of arrivals. However, only 24,600 people have been relocated so far,according to an EU report,externalpublished on Wednesday. Although the pace of relocations has improved, two countries have refused to take any refugees, Poland and Hungary. The Czech Republic has not taken anyone since 2016 and Austria has only recently agreed to accept refugees. Hungary along with Slovakia and Poland called for the relocation policy to be scrapped, but their complaint received a setback from an ECJ legal adviser on Wednesday. The advocate general recommended that the objection be thrown out, partly because the policy helped ""relieve the considerable pressure on the asylum systems of Italy and Greece following the migration crisis in the summer of 2015"". A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"The donated brains of college and high school players were also studied A study of American football players' brains has found that 99% of professional NFL athletes tested had a disease associated with head injuries. The report published on Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association studied 202 deceased players - 111 of them from the NFL. All but one former National Football League player were found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The study is the largest of its kind yet conducted, its authors say. The invisible plague of concussion Dr Ann McKee, director of Boston University's CTE Center, which ledthe study,external, cautioned against drawing any immediate conclusions. ""There's a tremendous selection bias,"" she said, explaining how many of the brains were donated specifically by families who had suspected that their loved ones were suffering from CTE, which researchers believe is caused by repeated blows to the head. ""There's no question that there's a problem in football. That people who play football are at risk for this disease,"" she told US media. The neurodegenerative brain disease CTE is typically found in people who have suffered repeated blows to the head, studies have found. It causes a build-up of so-called tau proteins which can disable neuro-pathways and cause memory loss, impaired judgment, confusion and a variety of other mental health issues. All 202 players studied - ranging in age from 23 to 89 - were required to have football as their primary exposure to head trauma. Of the 202 total players, 87% were found to have traces of CTE. It was also found in 48 of 53 college players and three of the 14 high school players. Players featured in the study came from every position on the field, and from high school, university, and Canadian leagues, in addition to the NFL. In a statement the NFL said it was grateful for the study and the ""value it adds in the ongoing quest for a better understanding of CTE"". ""There are still many unanswered questions relating to the cause, incidence and prevalence of long-term effects of head trauma such as CTE,"" the organisation continued. ""The NFL is committed to supporting scientific research into CTE and advancing progress in the prevention and treatment of head injuries."" The NFL in 2016acknowledged for the first timethat there is a connection between CTE and football. In 2015, a federal judgeapproved a class-action lawsuitbrought against the NFL by thousands of players, who had alleged they had suffered brain damage as a result of concussions. Ron Sinai, of US legal funding firmNova Legal Funding,external, said that similar lawsuits are being brought against the NCAA. ""College football players are having many of the same health issues as the pro players. In July 2016 a judge approved a $75 million settlement to resolve many, but not all, of these cases,"" he said.

"Fees for those bringing employment tribunal claims have been ruled unlawful, and the government will now have to repay up to Â£32m to claimants. The government introduced fees of up to Â£1,200 in 2013, which it said would cut the number of malicious and weak cases. Government statistics showed 79% fewer cases were brought over three years - trade union Unison said the fees prevented workers accessing justice. The government said it would take steps to stop charging and refund payments. The Supreme Court,externalruled the government was acting unlawfully and unconstitutionally when it introduced the fees. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: ""The government has been acting unlawfully, and has been proved wrong - not just on simple economics, but on constitutional law and basic fairness too."" He added: ""These unfair fees have let law-breaking bosses off the hook these past four years, and left badly treated staff with no choice but to put up or shut up. ""We'll never know how many people missed out because they couldn't afford the expense of fees."" The government had already made a voluntary commitment to reimburse all fees if it was found they acted unlawfully. Fees have raised about Â£32m since being introduced. Justice minister Dominic Raab said the government would cease taking fees for employment tribunals ""immediately"" and begin the process of reimbursing claimants, dating back to 2013. He said: ""We respect the judgement and we are going to take it fully on board and we are going to comply with it."" It would fall to the taxpayer to pick up the bill, he said. ""The tricky, the difficult, the fluid balancing act that we've got is we want to make sure there's proper access to justice, we want to make sure frivolous or spurious claims don't clog up the tribunal and at the same time we've got to make sure we've got the right way to fund it.,"" he said. Fees ranged between Â£390 and Â£1,200. Discrimination cases cost more for claimants because of the complexity and time hearings took. The Supreme Court found this was indirectly discriminatory because a higher proportion of women would bring discrimination cases. It also said that some people would not bring cases to employment tribunals because paying the fees would render any financial reward pointless. The court's summary added claimants in low or middle income household could not afford the fees ""without sacrificing ordinary and reasonable expenditure for substantial periods of time"". TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said it was a ""massive win"" for workers. ""Too many low-paid workers couldn't afford to uphold their rights at work, even when they've faced harassment or have been sacked unfairly,"" she said. The decision was welcomed by employment lawyer Karen Jackson, who said: ""I don't know an employment lawyer who didn't think it was wrong to have fees. ""We all felt that morally it was the wrong thing to do as a barrier to justice.""

"Mike Ashley was described in court as a ""power drinker"" Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has won a High Court battle with an investment banker over a Â£15m deal allegedly made in a pub. Jeffrey Blue told the court Newcastle United's owner reneged on a promise to pay him a multimillion-pound sum if he increased the firm's share price. The court heard about ""drink-fuelled"" meetings in pubs, including one where Mr Ashley ""vomited into a fireplace"". Mr Ashley's lawyers said he had won a ""comprehensive"" victory. The hearing was told that four years ago Mr Ashley met Mr Blue and three other finance specialists at the Horse and Groom in London and ""consumed a lot of alcohol"". Mr Ashley said: ""I can't remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking. ""If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him Â£15m if he could increase [Sports Direct's] share price to Â£8, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn't being serious."" He said he paid Mr Blue Â£1m in ""other deals"" unrelated to the Horse and Groom meeting. Jeffrey Blue described ""unorthodox"" working practices at Sports Direct Mr Blue described Mr Ashley as a ""serious businessman"", but said the work ethic at Derbyshire-based Sports Direct was ""like nothing else I have ever seen"" with business conducted ""in unorthodox ways and in unusual venues"". The Â£14m High Court case between Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley and a banker offered a revealing insight into how business is done in some quarters. Stories of monster drinking sessions, kebabs and vomiting into a fireplace emerged as financial expert Jeffrey Blue tried to get Ashley to cough up. He claimed the Sports Direct founder had promised him the money in a deal struck in a pub, but Ashley said the conversation was no more than a joke. And a judge has now agreed no-one could have thought he was being serious. The judge said that during the Horse and Groom meeting Mr Ashley promised him Â£15m, but Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell said Mr Blue only mentioned the figure of Â£1m to him. Ruling in Mr Ashley's favour, judge Justice Leggatt said: ""No reasonable person present... would have thought that the offer to pay Mr Blue Â£15m was serious and was intended to create a contract. ""They all thought it was a joke. The fact that Mr Blue has since convinced himself that the offer was a serious one, and that a legally binding agreement was made, shows only that the human capacity for wishful thinking knows few bounds."" He ordered that Mr Blue would have to pick up Mr Ashley's legal bill of Â£1.5m, as well as his own of ""one million odd"". In a statement after the ruling Mr Ashley said: ""The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded Â£8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct."" Ashley 'is a money-making machine' Sports Direct claimant's story disputed Sports Direct's Ashley a 'power drinker' Ashley calls Â£15m pub promise 'nonsense' Ashley Â£14m claim was 'drink banter' Ashley 'vomited in fireplace at meeting' Six new things we know about Mike Ashley HM Courts Service At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played Environment Secretary Michael Gove tells Today a US trade deal will not allow chlorinated chicken The UK should not accept imports of chlorinated chickens as part of any future trade deal with the US, Michael Gove has said. The environment secretary told the BBC that the UK would not ""compromise"" on or ""dilute"" its animal welfare standards in the interests of trade. The EU currently bans chlorine-washed chickens on welfare grounds. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has questioned this but downplayed the potential for UK-US disagreement. Inside a US/UK trade deal Trump: UK trade deal 'could be big' It will be up to the UK to decide whether to retain the ban once it leaves the EU in March 2019. Labour said the government's ""casual and inconsistent"" approach risked undermining British farmers. On a visit to Washington on Monday, Mr Fox said chlorinated chicken was just one detail in one sector that would only be addressed at the end of discussions about a free trade deal - which are likely to be years away. He has suggested there are no food safety issues regarding chlorine-washed chickens, a view shared by many UK experts. In the US, it is legal to wash chicken carcasses in strongly chlorinated water. Producers argue that it stops the spread of microbial contamination from the animal's digestive tract to the meat, a method approved by US regulators. But the practice has been banned in the EU since 1997, where only washing with cold air or water is allowed. The EU argues that chlorine washes could increase the risk of bacterial-based diseases such as salmonella on the grounds that dirty abattoirs with sloppy standards would rely on it as a decontaminant rather than making sure their basic hygiene protocols were up to scratch. There are also concerns that such ""washes"" would be used by less scrupulous meat processing plants to increase the shelf-life of meat, making it appear fresher than it really is. Agriculture is likely to be one of the sticking points in talks over a deal, amid concerns about differing farming and welfare practices, such the use of growth hormones given to cows and cattle. Asked whether lifting the ban on chlorinated chickens was a price to be paid for sealing a post-Brexit deal with the US, Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""No. I have made it perfectly clear we are not going to dilute our high environmental standards or our animal welfare standards in the pursuit of a trade deal. ""We need to ensure that we do not compromise those standards. And we need to be in a position as we leave the European Union to be leaders in environmental and in animal welfare standards."" On whether poultry could scupper a US trade deal, he added: ""The Trade Secretary, quite rightly, pointed out that, of course, this issue is important, but we mustn't concentrate just on this one issue when we look at the huge potential that a trade deal can bring."" While membership of the EU meant the UK had to accept some environmental obligations ""which do not work in the interests of the environment"", he said the UK had been a world leader in environmental standards for decades and that would continue after Brexit. This video can not be played Fox: It's early days in US trade discussions Mr Fox, who concluded a four-day trip to the US on Wednesday, has said the UK will not be lowering its food safety or animal welfare standards after Brexit but decisions on US chicken imports and other consumer protection issues should be based on scientific advice. ""There is no health issue with that - the European Union has said that it is perfectly safe,"" he said. ""The issue lies around some of the secondary issues of animal welfare and it's perfectly reasonable for people to raise that, but it will come much further down the road."" A Lords report on Wednesday warned that UK farmers' livelihoods could be threatened by an influx of cheaper food imports from the US. It said there was evidence that UK consumers would be willing to pay more for food reared to higher standards but it remained to be seen if this would happen in practice. For Labour, shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said the cabinet was in disarray over the issue. ""Theresa May must set the record straight by publicly supporting British poultry farmers and committing to protect the British public from substandard food produce in a race-to-the-bottom Brexit,"" she said. But Conservative MP John Redwood said British farmers were already losing out to cheaper competition from the European continent, where welfare standards - both in terms of the rearing and transport of animals - were not as high as in the UK. ""When we leave the EU we will be free to set our own standards, which will be higher than EU minimum requirements,"" he wrote on his blog. ""This makes animal welfare an odd argument for people to use who want us to stay in the EU system.""

"A stronger UK film industry helped the service sector to expand, the ONS said. UK economic growth edged slightly higher in the three months to June, as a stronger service sector offset weaker manufacturing and construction. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy expanded by 0.3% in the quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months. But the ONS added there had been a ""notable slowdown"" from last year. Within the service sector, the retail and the film industries helped underpin growth, the ONS said. ""While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth,"" said Darren Morgan, ONS head of national accounts. Although the economy eked out higher growth in the second quarter, it was below levels seen in the final three months of 2016, when gross domestic product grew by 0.7%. Analysts said the latest ONS data, which is an initial estimate, diminished the chances of an interest rate rise any time soon. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: ""The confirmation of the lacklustre performance of the economy so far this year surely also diminishes the chance of an interest rate hike any time soon, especially as growth prospects for coming months have become increasingly skewed to the downside."" Film production in the UK, plus box-office receipts from cinemas, was one of the best performing parts of the economy during the April-June period. The ONS said ticket receipts from Wonder Woman and the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film were among the items that had boosted the sector it calls motion picture activities. That sector grew 8% in the second quarter. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK economy had now grown consistently for four-and-a-half years. ""We can be proud of that, but we are not complacent,"" he added. ""We need to focus on restoring productivity growth to deliver higher wages and living standards for people across the country."" Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""Growth for the first half of 2017 is below expectations, and it follows continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices."" Aberdeen Asset Management chief economist Lucy O'Carroll said: ""This pick-up will be taken as good news, but it really doesn't amount to much. ""The figures are the first estimate of growth, based on very patchy data. They always get revised over time, and often substantially so. ""It's the underlying trends that matter. They don't look favourable at the moment, given the uncertainties around Brexit and the pressure on household budgets from higher inflation."" The construction sector weakened in the second quarter, according to the ONS. That was backed up by Andrew Sweeney, from Care Building Services. He told the BBC: ""We seem to be pricing a lot more projects. We price projects for clients; we have estimators in the office. After we've priced it the clients pull it because it is coming over the budget. ""We've been given orders for jobs and at the last minute the clients have pulled them away from us due to concerns over the market."" Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, said the UK's growth in the first half of the year had been its slowest since 2013. He added: ""Whereas growth has accelerated significantly so far this year in continental Europe and many emerging markets, the UK is missing out. ""While the downside risks from the Brexit vote have not yet played out in a major way, the uncertainty stemming from Brexit is leading to caution in all areas of spending and policy that have long-term implications. ""The UK would probably be growing at 2.5% or above this year were it not for Brexit, with strong gains in real wages and more business investment."" The latest growth figure was in line with economists' expectations, and is unlikely to change expectations that, at its policy meeting next week, the Bank of England will keep interest rates at their current record low. On Monday, the International Monetary Funddowngraded its forecast for UK economic growththis year because of the weak first-quarter figure. The IMF said it expects UK GDP to grow by 1.7% instead of its previous projection of 2%.

The globetrotting by the three ministers - dubbed the ""three Brexiteers"" for their role in backing a Leave vote - comes amid increased scrutiny of the opportunities and challenges facing Britain in terms of negotiating free trade agreements with other countries once it leaves the EU. UK and EU still split on citizens' rights Johnson pushes trade deal with New Zealand Trump: UK trade deal 'could be big' No deals can be done until withdrawal in March 2019 but the UK has established a series of inter-ministerial working groups in the US and Australia to discuss the way ahead while also signalling to other countries, such as New Zealand, that they will be ""near the front of the queue"". US President Donald Trump has said a deal with the UK could be ""big and exciting"" in terms of jobs, accusing the EU of a ""very protectionist"" stance towards America. The EU has insisted Brexit talks will only be held by the European Commission, and the Department for Exiting the European Union confirmed Mr Davis' talks with officials in Germany would be private. How to holiday like a prime minister Everything you need to know about Brexit Brussels has also made clear that trade talks between the UK and the EU must wait until other issues, including the status of expats and any ""divorce bill"" to be paid by the UK, have been settled. The role of the European Court of Justice has emerged as a stumbling block to a deal on citizen's rights, despite both sides insisting that they want to come an arrangement. The UK is seeking a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" with the EU after Brexit to replace its membership of the common market and customs union.

"The new bill may complicate President Trump's plans to improve relations with Russia The US House of Representatives has voted to impose fresh sanctions on Russia, despite President Donald Trump objecting to the legislation. Senior officials will be targeted in retaliation for alleged Russian interference in the US 2016 election. The bill is likely to complicate President Trump's hopes of improving relations with Russia. Russia said the vote could destroy the possibility of ""normalising relations"" between the two countries. The bill needs to be passed through the Senate before it can be sent on to the president to be signed. The White House says it is reviewing the bill, and it is unclear whether the president will veto it. ""While the president supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the president's desk,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. Russia's relationship with the president has dogged his first six months in office, amid allegations Moscow interfered to help Mr Trump get elected. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Mr Trump has also piled pressure on his attorney general over the Russia inquiry. He has publicly labelled Jeff Sessions ""weak"" andsaid he was ""disappointed""in Mr Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the investigation. Trump to decide fate of Sessions 'soon' Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House The legislation,external, which passed by 419 to three, was described by House Speaker Paul Ryan as a sanctions package that ""tightens the screws on our most dangerous adversaries in order to keep Americans safe"". The sanctions on Russia were drawn up in part to further punish its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. If passed, they would: Penalise firms, including those in Europe, that contribute to Russian energy development, affecting companies involved the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany Shorten the duration of loans to Russian banks and Russian oil and gas companies Freeze assets of state-owned mining and railway companies Codify existing sanctions to make them more difficult to lift in the future Stop President Trump being able to singlehandedly ease the sanctions The US already has a range of sanctions in place against Russian individuals and companies over Crimea. In December, following claims of election hacking, then-President Barack Obama expelled 35 diplomats and closed two Russian compounds in the US. The bill will also see fresh sanctions against North Korea and Iran over ballistic missile tests. But the new measures against Russia have been criticised in Europe. A spokesman for the Germany foreign ministry expressed concern on Wednesday, saying US politicians were conducting industrial policy under the guise of sanctions, according to Reuters. By Barbara Plett, BBC state department correspondent The legislation codifies sanctions imposed by Barack Obama over Russia's Ukraine interventions, which would make lifting them more difficult. It also expands restrictions on doing business with Russian companies, in particular on energy development. That has the Europeans very worried they'll be penalised for supporting Russian pipeline projects. But what concerns the White House is a measure that limits the president's traditional right to waive the sanctions: he would be forced to consult congress first. That and the broad bipartisan support for the legislation shows just how wary lawmakers are about Mr Trump's pro-Moscow approach. The Senate had overwhelmingly passed an earlier version of the bill: the differences between the two have to be worked out before Mr Trump decides how to respond. The White House has suggested the president may support the bill after some changes to the original draft, but he would have little room to manoeuvre anyway because Congress almost certainly has enough votes to override a veto. This version of the legislation still needs to be approved by the Senate, but it is not yet clear when it will consider the bill. But if it passes through the Senate mostly intact, the bill would provide a headache for President Trump, who has signalled a more conciliatory approach towards Moscow. If the two chambers pass similar but slightly different bills, a committee will draw up a compromise version for approval. Once both House and Senate have approved a bill, it goes to the president to be signed into law. The president could veto the bill, but in doing so would fuel suspicion that he is too supportive of the Kremlin, correspondents say. The bill has widespread support from both major parties in both Houses - making a veto a potentially unpopular political move. Additionally, a presidential veto can be ignored if two thirds of both the House and Senate vote to override the president. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Trump is ""going to study that legislation and see what the final product looks like."" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov described the vote as ""a very serious step towards destroying the possibilities for normalising relations with Russia"". ""What has happened goes beyond the realms of common sense,"" Mr Ryabkov told Russian media, adding that Moscow had already warned that sanctions from the US would ""not go unanswered"". Russia had hoped that Donald Trump's election would produce a reset in relations, and that the economic sanctions imposed over its actions in Ukraine might even be lifted, reports the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow. But Russian politicians argue that President Trump has been blocked in that - by a wave of ""Russophobia"" sweeping the US, our correspondent says. The Kremlin continues to insist it did not interfere in the US elections. One Russian newspaper has described the latest sanctions as ""punishment, without a crime"".

"Humans could become extinct if sperm counts in men continue to fall at current rates, a doctor has warned. Researchers assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, seem to have halved in less than 40 years. Some experts are sceptical of theHuman Reproduction Update,externalfindings. But lead researcher Dr Hagai Levine said he was ""very worried"" about what might happen in the future. The assessment, one of the largest ever undertaken, brings together the results of 185 studies between 1973 and 2011. Dr Levine, an epidemiologist, told the BBC that if the trend continued humans would become extinct. ""If we will not change the ways that we are living and the environment and the chemicals that we are exposed to, I am very worried about what will happen in the future,"" he said. ""Eventually we may have a problem, and with reproduction in general, and it may be the extinction of the human species."" Scientists not involved in the study have praised the quality of the research but say that it may be premature to come to such a conclusion. Dr Levine, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found a 52.4% decline in sperm concentration, and a 59.3% decline in total sperm count in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The study also indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is continuing and possibly even increasing. In contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa, but the researchers point out that far fewer studies have been conducted on these continents. However, Dr Levine is concerned that eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too. Many previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion of them have been flawed. Some have investigated a relatively small number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts. There is also concern that studies that claim to show a decline in sperm counts are more likely to get published in scientific journals than those that do not. Another difficulty is that early methods of counting sperm may have overestimated the true count. Taken together these factors may have created a false view of falling sperm counts. But the researchers claim to have accounted for some of these deficiencies, leaving some doubters, such as Prof Allan Pacey of Sheffield University, less sceptical. He said: ""I've never been particularly convinced by the many studies published so far claiming that human sperm counts have declined in the recent past."" ""However, the study today by Dr Levine and his colleagues deals head-on with many of the deficiencies of previous studies."" But Prof Pacey believes that although the new study has reduced the possibility of errors it does not entirely remove them. So, he says, the results should be treated with caution. ""The debate has not yet been resolved and there is clearly much work still to be done. ""However, the paper does represent a step forward in the clarity of the data which might ultimately allow us to define better studies to examine this issue."" There is no clear evidence for the reason for this apparent decrease. But it has been linked with exposure to chemicals used in pesticides and plastics, obesity, smoking, stress,diet, and evenwatching too much TV. Dr Levine says that there is an urgent need to find out why sperm counts are decreasing and to find ways of reversing the trend. ""We must take action - for example, better regulation of man-made chemicals - and we must continue our efforts on tackling smoking and obesity.""

"Connie Yates and Chris Gard accept Charlie should be moved to palliative care A High Court judge is set to decide later where Charlie Gard's life will end after another dispute between his parents and hospital bosses. Chris Gard and Connie Yates want permission to take the 11-month-old home for his final days. But Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said it was not practical to provide the level of life-support treatment to Charlie at the couple's London home. It says a hospice would be a more appropriate place for him. The court hearing is due to resume at 14:00 BST. Doctors at the London hospital have saidmoving Charlie to a hospiceis the best option as a ventilator would not fit through the couple's front door in Bedfont, west London. Mr Justice Francis, who analysed the dispute at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court on Tuesday, said that, having heard the evidence, the chances of Charlie's parents' wishes being granted were small. Charlie's medical case explained Charlie Gard's parents end legal fight Charlie has a rare genetic condition and would not live to see his first birthday, his father said Charlie has the rare genetic disorder, encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. He has brain damage and cannot move his arms or legs. Speaking on Tuesday, Ms Yates said: ""We promised Charlie every day we would take him home. It seems really upsetting after everything we've been through to deny us this."" Grant Armstrong, representing the parents, accused hospital bosses of ""putting up obstacles"". ""The parents wish for a few days of tranquillity outside of a hospital setting,"" he said. ""The parents had hoped that Great Ormond Street would work with them."" This video can not be played Chris Gard: ""We are so sorry we could not save you"" But lawyers for the hospital said staff had ""moved heaven and earth"" for Charlie. Katie Gollop QC said the couple's needs had to be balanced against Charlie's best interests. She said GOSH staff had found an ""excellent hospice"" that would give Charlie and his parents the space, privacy and protection they needed. Charlie has been in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October The latest hearing comes after Charlie's parents abandoned attempts to persuade the judge to let their son travel to the US for experimental treatment. They had asked Mr Justice Francis to rule their son should be allowed to undergo a trial of nucleoside therapy in New York developed by Professor Michio Hirano, a move opposed by hospital medics who argued the treatment would be ""futile"". Butin its statement to the High Court,external, the hospital said it was also ""increasingly surprised and disappointed"" that Dr Hirano, ""had not read Charlie's contemporaneous medical records or viewed Charlie's brain imaging or read all of the second opinions about Charlie's condition"". GOSH said Professor Hirano had not taken the opportunity to see Charlie until last week, despite being offered the chance to do so by the hospital in January. Even though the professor gave written evidence at all the court cases, the hospital said it only emerged last week that he had not read the judge's ruling following the first High Court hearing in April. The hospital added it was concerned to hear the professor state in the witness box at the High Court hearing on 13 July that he had a financial interest in some of the treatment he proposed prescribing for Charlie. But Dr Hirano said: ""I became involved in Charlie's case when I was contacted by his parents, and I subsequently agreed to speak with his doctors to discuss whether an experimental therapy being developed in my lab could provide meaningful clinical improvement in Charlie's condition. ""As I disclosed in court on 13 July, I have relinquished and have no financial interest in the treatment being developed for Charlie's condition. ""Unfortunately, a MRI scan of Charlie's muscle tissue conducted in the past week has revealed that it is very unlikely that he would benefit from this treatment.""
