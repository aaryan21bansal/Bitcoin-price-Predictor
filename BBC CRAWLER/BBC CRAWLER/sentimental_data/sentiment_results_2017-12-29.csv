"This is the resignation letter that Lord Adonis says he sent to Downing Street whilequitting as the government's infrastructure adviser. The Right Hon Lord Adonis House of Lords, London SW1 The Right Hon Theresa May MP 10 Downing Street London SW129 December 2017 Dear Prime Minister, The hardest thing in politics is to bring about lasting change for the better, and I believe in co-operation across parties to achieve it. In this spirit I was glad to accept reappointment last year as Chair of the independent National Infrastructure Commission, when you also reaffirmed your support for HS2, which will help overcome England's north-south divide when it opens in just eight years time. I would like to thank you for your courtesy in our personal dealings. The Commission has done good work in the past 27 months, thanks to dedicated public servants and commissioners. Sir John Armitt, my deputy chair, and Phil Graham, chief executive, have been brilliant throughout. I am particularly proud of our plans for equipping the UK with world-class 4G and 5G mobile systems; for Crossrail 2 in London and HS3 to link the Northern cities; and for transformational housing growth in the Oxford-Milton Keynes-Cambridge corridor. I hope these plans are implemented without delay. However, my work at the Commission has become increasingly clouded by disagreement with the Government, and after much consideration I am writing to resign because of fundamental differences which simply cannot be bridged. The European Union Withdrawal Bill is the worst legislation of my lifetime. It arrives soon in the House of Lords and I feel duty bound to oppose it relentlessly from the Labour benches. Brexit is a populist and nationalist spasm worthy of Donald Trump. After the narrow referendum vote, a form of associate membership of the EU might have been attempted without rupturing Britain's key trading and political alliances. Instead, by allying with UKIP and the Tory hard right to wrench Britain out of the key economic and political institutions of modern Europe, you are pursuing a course fraught with danger. Even within Ireland, there are set to be barriers between people and trade. If Brexit happens, taking us back into Europe will become the mission of our children's generation, who will marvel at your acts of destruction. A responsible government would be leading the British people to stay in Europe while also tackling, with massive vigour, the social and economic problems within Britain which contributed to the Brexit vote. Unfortunately, your policy is the reverse. The Government is hurtling towards the EU's emergency exit with no credible plan for the future of British trade and European co-operation, all the while ignoring - beyond sound bites and inadequate programmes - the crises of housing, education, the NHS, and social and regional inequality which are undermining the fabric of our nation and feeding a populist surge. What Britain needs in 2018 is a radically reforming government in the tradition of Attlee, working tirelessly to eradicate social problems while strengthening Britain's international alliances. This is a cause I have long advocated, and acted upon in government, and I intend to pursue it with all the energy I can muster. Britain must be deeply engaged, responsible and consistent as a European power. When in times past we have isolated ourselves from the Continent in the name of ""empire"" or ""sovereignty"", we were soon sucked back in. This will inevitably happen again, given our power, trade, democratic values and sheer geography. Putin and the rise of authoritarian nationalism in Poland and Hungry are flashing red lights. As Edmund Burke so wisely wrote, ""people will not look forwards to posterity who do not look backwards to their ancestors."" However, I would have been obliged to resign from the Commission at this point anyway because of the Transport Secretary's indefensible decision to bail-out the Stagecoach/Virgin East Coast rail franchise. The bailout will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds, possibly billions if other loss-making rail companies demand equal treatment. It benefits only the billionaire owners of these companies and their shareholders, while pushing rail fares still higher and threatening national infrastructure investment. It is even more inexcusable given the Brexit squeeze on public spending. The only rationale I can discern for the bailout is as a cynical political manoeuvre by Chris Grayling, a hard right Brexiteer, to avoid following my 2009 precedent when National Express defaulted on its obligations to the state for the same East Coast franchise because it too had overbid for the contract. I set up a successful public operator to take over East Coast services and banned National Express from bidding for new contracts. The same should have been done in this case. Yet, astonishingly, Stagecoach has not only been bailed out: it remains on the shortlist for the next three rail franchises. The East Coast affair will inevitably come under close scrutiny by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee, and I need to be free to set out serious public interest concerns. I hope the PAC calls Sir Richard Branson and Sir Brian Souter to give evidence. I am ready to share troubling evidence with the PAC and other parliamentary committees investigating the bailout. As you know, I raised these concerns with the Chancellor and the Transport Secretary as soon as the bailout became apparent from the small print of an odd policy statement on 29 November majoring on reversing Beeching rail closures of the 1960s. I received no response from either Minister beyond inappropriate requests to desist. Brexit is causing a nervous breakdown across Whitehall and conduct unworthy of Her Majesty's Government. I am told, by those of longer experience, that it resembles Suez and the bitter industrial strife of the 1970s, both of which endangered not only national integrity but the authority of the state itself. You occupy one of the most powerful offices in the history of the world, the heir of Churchill, Attlee and Gladstone. Whatever our differences, I wish you well in guiding our national destiny at this critical time.

"UK stock markets climbed to new highs on the final day of trading for 2017. Both the FTSE 100 index of leading blue chip companies and the FTSE 250 reached new records at the close of trading. US stock markets have also hit new peaks over the year, helped in part by Donald Trump's sweeping tax reforms. Stephen Eckett, author of the annual Harriman Stock Market Almanac, said: ""All the dangers that were anticipated with a Trump administration haven't materialised."" The FTSE 100 finished up 7.6% at 7,687.77 compared with the last day of trading in 2016. Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 ended 14.7% ahead at 20,726.26 compared with the end of last year. Mr Eckett said: ""It has been a little bit of a surprise to many people that markets were are strong as they were this year."" George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the FTSE 100 had been lifted by natural resource giants such as Shell and BP which have benefitted from a rise in oil prices. Brent crude fell as low as $45 per barrel in June but is now trading at $66.34. The fall in sterling since Brexit has also boosted earnings since many of the FTSE 100 companies have large operations abroad, said Linda Yueh, a professor of economics at London Business School. "" A lot of the rise in the FTSE 100 is because of the weak pound,"" she said. By Joe Lynam, Business Correspondent If ever we needed a reminder about the disconnect between our largest listed companies and Britain's 'real' economy , we got it today.  UK GDP growth is well below the G7 average and real wages continue to fall. Despite that, Britain's PLCs are doing very well thank you. That's because most of them earn the vast majority of their profits overseas and the global economy is enjoying is best period of sustained growth in a decade. The better the world does, the more stuff UK quoted firms can sell. It helps, of course, that the pound has remained relatively weak since the referendum last year - meaning British based exporters can repatriate higher profits earned in stronger currencies. However, John Botham, global equities product director at City firm, Invesco Perpetual, said that, while the UK's leading index is at a record high, ""the FTSE 100 has performed far less well than the US stock market and indeed many stock markets around the world"". In the US, the tech-focused Nasdaq has rose more than 1,740 points or about 28% since the start of the year to close at 24,719.22 on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained about 25% over the year, adding more than 4,830 points to close at 24,719. The S&P 500 rose 19% since January, adding more than 400 points to close at 2673.6. Oil prices recovered towards the end of 2017 Analysts attribute the rise to strong corporate earnings at global companies, with technology firms contributing heavily to the gains. Commenting on the year ahead, Mr Botham said: ""We are looking at a situation where global growth seems reasonably well synchronised and we are likely to continue to see earnings growth from companies around the world."" Housebuilders were among the best performing companies on the FTSE 100 in 2017. Berkeley Group, which mainly builds luxury homes in London, rejoined the blue chip index in September and has seen its share price rise by more than 50% this year. Berkeley had fallen out of the FTSE 100 last August and into the FTSE 250 after its share price tumbled on fears that the UK's vote to leave the European Union would adversely impact on the housing market. Fellow property group Persimmon saw its share price rise by 57%. However, Mr Salmon said: ""Not all of the referendum effects have blown over."" Businesses such as advertising giant WPP and broadcaster ITV were among the worst performers as companies reduced investment in marketing. ""Advertising spending does fall into discretionary spending,"" said Mr Salmon. NMC Healthcare, which is one of the largest private healthcare providers in the UAE, saw its share price jump by 84% after expanding its operations in the Middle East. Shares in British Gas-owner Centrica endured a bumpy year, falling 41% after being buffeted byPrime Minister Theresa May's revived planto put a price cap on energy bills.

"This video can not be played Protesters take to streets venting anger against authorities Anti-government demonstrations that began in Iran on Thursday have now spread to several major cities. Large numbers reportedly turned out in Rasht, in the north, and Kermanshah, in the west, with smaller protests in Isfahan, Hamadan and elsewhere. The protests began against rising prices but have spiralled into a general outcry against clerical rule and government policies. A small number of people have been arrested in Tehran, the capital. They were among a group of 50 people who gathered in a city square, Tehran's deputy governor-general for security affairs told the Iranian Labour News Agency. The US State Department condemned the arrests and urged ""all nations to publicly support the Iranian people and their demands for basic rights and an end to corruption"". The demonstrations began in the north-eastern city of Mashhad- the country's second most-populous - on Thursday. People there took to the streets to express anger at the government over high prices, and vented their fury against President Hassan Rouhani. Fifty-two people were arrested for chanting ""harsh slogans"". The protests spread to other cities in the north-east, and and some developed into broader anti-government demonstrations, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to police beatings. Hassan Rouhani, the president who moved left Iranians urge Rouhani not to disappoint On Friday, despite warnings from authorities, the demonstrations spread further to some of the biggest cities in the country. They represent the most serious and widespread expression of public discontent in Iran since mass protests in 2009 that followed a disputed election, correspondents say. What began as a protest against economic conditions and corruption has turned political. Slogans have been chanted against not just Mr Rouhani but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and clerical rule in general. Demonstrators were reportedly heard yelling slogans like ""The people are begging, the clerics act like God"". Protests have even been held in Qom, a holy city home to powerful clerics. There is also anger at Iran's interventions abroad. In Mashhad, some chanted ""not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran"", a reference to what protesters say is the administration's focus on foreign rather than domestic issues. Iran 'building permanent military base' in Syria Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Other demonstrators chanted ""leave Syria, think about us"" in videos posted online. Iran is a key provider of military support to the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. It is also accused of providing arms to Houthi rebels fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which it denies, and is an ally of Lebanon's powerful Shia movement Hezbollah. President Hassan Rouhani continues to be dogged by economic problems Iran's Fars news agency, which is close to the elite and powerful Revolutionary Guards security force, reported that many protesters who turned out over economic grievances decided to leave rallies after others yelled political slogans. President Rouhani promisedthe 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with world powerswould boost the economy. However despite the lifting of international sanctions, the unemployment rate is 12.4%. There have been calls on social media for protests up and down the country, despite warnings from the government against illegal gatherings. Demonstrations of varying sizes are reported to have occurred in at least seven cities. Overall, the numbers said to be taking part range from a less than 100 in some places to thousands in others - but demonstrations do not appear to be taking place on a massive scale. Videos posted on social media appear to show clashes between security forces and some demonstrators in Kermanshah. Fars news agency reported that protesters there destroyed some public property and were dispersed. The governor-general of Tehran said that any such gatherings would be firmly dealt with by the police, who are out in force on main intersections. Officials in Mashhad said the protest was organised by ""counter-revolutionary elements"", and video online showed police using water cannon. Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian The demonstrations have taken the Iranian authorities by surprise. Impromptu anti-government demonstrations are rare in a country where the Revolutionary Guard and numerous intelligence agencies have a strong grip on the population. Predictably they are blaming anti-revolutionary elements and foreign agents. But the protests clearly stem from seething discontent in Iran, mainly because of the worsening economic conditions faced by ordinary Iranians. A BBC Persian investigation has found that Iranians, on average, have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years alone. Many believe that money that should be used to improve their lives is being spent by Iran's leaders on conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Billions are also being spent on spreading religious propaganda and Shia Islam around the world. But it seems that the hardliners opposed to President Rouhani may have triggered the unrest by holding a demonstration that quickly grew out of control and spread to cities and towns across the country.

"People should take three steps to try to solve a health problem before seeing their GP, a doctors' leader has urged. Patients should see if they can sort it themselves, see a pharmacist or use a reputable online source of information, the Royal College of GPs says. GPs ""really feel the pinch"" over winter because of demand, said chairwoman Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard. If just 5% of people did not visit their GP, it would ""save 50,000 appointments,"" she told the BBC. GP leaders say there are not enough family doctors working in England and that practices are closing at an ""alarming rate"". According to Professor Stokes-Lampard, ""up to a quarter of appointments could be avoidable or sorted out by other means"". She urged patients to adopt the ""three before GP"" mantra. ""We're just asking people to stop and think, when you reach for the phone to book a GP appointment think: 'Can I do this myself? Do I need some online help? Could a pharmacist help me?' ""Even if 5% of people paused before reaching for the phone... that would save 50,000 appointments, perhaps freeing up a bit of space for those who need them,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. A reputable online source would include NHS Choices, she said, praising the site for its ""helpful, sensible advice that's up-to-date, written by doctors and nurses for patients. ""There's nothing more trustworthy than the NHS. The NHS spends a lot of money on that website for very good reason."" But she added: ""We're not suggesting for a moment that people shouldn't be seeing their GPs if they need to - that's what we're there for."" ""Today over a million people will be seeing a GP around the UK."" Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard is a practising GP working in the Midlands The practising GP said people had been visiting her surgery with indigestion over the festive period. She says: ""People eat a bit too much, drink a bit too much, gain a bit of weight and develop indigestion and heartburn. ""That's the sort of thing where a pharmacist could easily signpost them to a range of medications."" She said: ""We don't have enough GPs. ""The workload has gone up inexorably because of an ageing population with multiple long-term conditions."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Neal Patel of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said pharmacists were the experts on medicines and could help people with questions about winter bugs as well as concerns about side-effects of prescription medicines. ""Even if it is a cough or a cold, don't wait until it gets more serious. Seek advice from your pharmacist,"" he said. He added: ""Crucially, pharmacists can help you decide when that worrying symptom is something you can manage yourself or when you should seek help."" An NHS England spokesman said: ""We do need more GPs."" Newly-qualified doctors were choosing GP training at near-record levels, he said, but this was being partly offset by early retirements so the NHS was also stepping up international recruitment. The Home Office said it was keeping all immigration routes under review, but said the last time the independent migration advisory committee reviewed whether GPs should be added to the shortage occupation list, they did not recommend including them.

"Farhad Salah and Andy Sami Star appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court Two men have appeared in court accused of preparing to build a bomb in the lead up to Christmas for an attack in the UK. Chip shop owner Andy Sami Star, 31, from Chesterfield, and Farhad Salah, 22, from Sheffield, are charged with preparing an act of terrorism. The pair, who appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court by video link from Leeds, were remanded in custody. Mr Star's solicitor said there was no evidence he was involved in terrorism. He indicated that his client would plead not guilty. Police carried out lengthy searches in Chesterfield and Sheffield earlier in December Thomas Halpin, prosecuting, told the hearing the Crown alleged that the pair had been in the early stages of a plot at the time of their arrests. The pair were among four people arrested on 19 December by detectives from Counter Terrorism Policing North East following an intelligence-led operation. A 36-year-old man from Burngreave, Sheffield, remains in police custody for questioning.

"Remain campaigners suffered a defeat in last year's EU referendum More clarity is needed in rules aimed at stopping campaigners bypassing spending limits during a referendum, the Electoral Commission says. It said campaigners should have to provide more information to show they were not using multiple groups to avoid hitting spending limits. The watchdog says it will ""review"" new claims that the rules were breached by the EU Remain campaign last year. Britain Stronger in Europe said it had always complied with the rules. Electoral Commission reopens probe into Vote Leave Momentum spending investigated The Electoral Commission is already formally investigating the Leave campaign. Now the Guido Fawkes websiteis calling for,externala similar probe into the other side. It used information published by the commission to suggest that ""co-ordinated"" spending had been spread between various Remain-backing groups which were set up in the run-up to the referendum. More than Â£1m was donated to these new campaigns, it says. In response, a Britain Stronger in Europe spokesman said it had ""always complied fully with Electoral Commission rules on working together and included any instances of it happening in our return to the Electoral Commission"". The commission said: ""We consider and assess possible breaches of the rules consistent with our published enforcement policy and will review the Guido Fawkes articles before deciding whether any action is required."" The key question is whether the different groups were ""working together"" with the official Remain campaign on a ""coordinated plan or arrangement"". If they were, their spending would count towards its Â£7m spending limit. The commission has previously said it might be difficult for campaigners to know whether this rule applies. For example, they are able to ""liaise and discuss campaigning approaches"" but not to spend money on joint advertising campaigns. The commission called on the government to provide legal clarification of what represents ""joint spending"". It also said campaigners should have to specify who they worked with and how much they each spent on their spending returns. There have already been several investigations into the way campaign money was spent during the EU referendum, which Leave won in June 2016. Last month the Electoral Commission said it would reopen a probe into more than Â£600,000 spent by a campaign run by university student Darren Grimes, days ahead of the vote.

"Suvarnabhumi is Thailand's largest airport No-one really enjoys a long airport stopover, but for one Zimbabwean family, Bangkok's main airport has been home for nearly three months. According to the Thai immigration bureau, the four children under 11 and four adults arrived in Bangkok in May, but are refusing to return to Zimbabwe for fear of persecution. Their plight came to light after someone who said he worked at Suvarnabhumi airport posted a photo on Facebook showing himself giving a little African girl a Christmas present. In the now deleted post, Kanaruj Artt Pornsopit said the family had been living in the airport for nearly three months ""because of the unsettled situation"" in their country. ""Hope all of you back to your sweet home soon"", he said. Airport staff have been providing meals and assistance to the family Immigration bureau spokesman Pol Col Cherngron Rimphadee told the BBC the family initially arrived in Thailand as tourists. They attempted to fly out of Bangkok in October to the Spanish city of Barcelona via Kiev in Ukraine. But they were denied boarding because they did not have visas to enter Spain. However, they were also unable to re-enter Thailand as they had overstayed their initial tourist visas by five months and had to pay a hefty fine. They later made arrangements with Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) to fly via Kiev to Dubai instead - and then on to a third country - bypassing European immigration.

Mugabe: hero or villain? Jubilation greets end of Mugabe era However, there is currently no open instability in Zimbabwe, so some in the country have cast doubts on the family's claim of persecution.

Col Rimphahdee confirmed the family had applied to the UN for asylum, but for now were living in Suvarnabhumi airport and being looked after and fed by airport staff. He told the BBC's Thai Service that the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, had ""requested"" that the family remain in Thailand as it was ""working on a process... to send them to a third country"". A UNCHR spokesperson said they were ""currently exploring solutions"" but could not provide any further details or confirmation. Thailand does not provide legal status to refugees and asylum seekers. Suvarnabhumi is home to luxury shops, convenience stores and dozens of food outlets The family's situation has been likened to the film The Terminal, in which actor Tom Hanks plays a man who is trapped in a New York airport. The film is based on the real life story of Iranian Mehran Karimi Nasseri,,externalwho lived in Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris for 18 years when he found himself caught in diplomatic limbo. But Col Rimphadee said: ""Please try not to compare this to the movie. Their situation is not as dramatic... actually they have plenty of options."" ""They could travel to other countries that are willing to take them... We also offered to relocate them to our holding centre where there is childcare. But they refused.

"This video can not be played Lord Adonis denies being pushed out of his government role The government's infrastructure adviser has announced he is quitting his role, describing Brexit as a ""populist and nationalist spasm"". Lord Adonis said Prime Minister Theresa May was ""pursuing a course fraught with danger"" over the UK's EU departure. The ex-Labour minister is already a high-profile campaigner against Brexit. A government source said: ""He's been moving closer towards the exit door with each new onslaught he makes against Brexit."" The source added: ""He's now walked through the door before he was pushed."" But Lord Adonis later insisted it had been his decision to leave, as his ""differences with the government had become too great"". Lord Adonis, who was transport secretary under Gordon Brown between 2009 and 2010, has chaired the National Infrastructure Commission since 2015. The commission produces a report in every Parliament advising the government on spending in areas such as transport connections and energy. Lord Adonis sparked anger earlier this year when he compared Brexit to the appeasement of the Nazis in the 1930s, and has repeatedly called for last year's referendum vote to be reversed. In hisresignation letter, he accused Mrs May of ""allying with UKIP and the Tory hard right to wrench Britain out of the key economic and political institutions of modern Europe"", saying the UK was ""hurtling towards the EU's emergency exit with no credible plan for the future of British trade and European co-operation"".

""A responsible government would be leading the British people to stay in Europe while also tackling, with massive vigour, the social and economic problems within Britain which contributed to the Brexit vote."" Lord Adonis said he planned to oppose ""relentlessly"" the government's EU (Withdrawal) Bill in the House of Lords. As well as Brexit, he said the recent decision to end the East Coast rail franchise three years early, would also have forced him to quit, describing it as a bailout costing hundreds of millions of pounds. MP Iain Duncan Smith said the departure of Lord Adonis was ""long overdue"". He added: ""It's a bit rich for him to pontificate on what he calls populism, but what most would refer to as democracy, when he himself has never been elected by a public vote. He has instead relied on preferment from others."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The year 2017 saw a burst of optimism among American investors and consumers, despite the turmoil sparked by President Trump's first year in office. The President strode from one political storm to the next as he took an axe to many of the policies of the Obama administration, but - on the economic front - the waters could hardly have been smoother. Annual economic growth has been a healthy 3% while the United States stock market is up around 25% on the year. It is true that the dollar is down roughly 10%, which makes the real rise in share prices a little less impressive, but the improved confidence of many Americans is impossible to deny. According to the US economist Irwin Stelzer of the Hudson Institute, it is the low unemployment rate of 4.1% that is the key factor. ""There are six million unfilled jobs in the United States at the moment,"" he says. The US stock market is up about 25% on the year ""There are labour shortages, wages have started to creep up a little bit after a long period of being flat; and that makes people cheerful, makes consumers cheerful, makes consumers confident."" Talking to the BBC, Mr Stelzer says the rise in share prices reflects both higher company profits and the hope of tax cuts to come. There's also a psychological impact from President Trump, he says, with business people now waking up every morning hopeful the government will do something for them, rather than to them. ""There's a lot of the Trump effect that is negative in the business community,"" he adds. ""They're unsettled by his - shall we call it - erratic behaviour. But the regulatory stuff, the repealing, the rolling back, not only of the regulations themselves, but of the method of enforcing the regulations has really, really encouraged the business community."" The US needs to boost government infrastructure spending, says Larry Summers But not everyone thinks that the underlying picture is as solid as it looks. The former Democrat US treasury secretary Larry Summers has called US growth a ""sugar high"", resulting from a temporary boost from a weaker dollar. Mr Summers says the US desperately needs more government spending on roads, airports and bridges - and on human capital and science. Despite the strength of both the US and European economies, there was still plenty of evidence in 2017 that many voters feel the spoils of the economic recovery have not been fairly distributed. In the UK general election the left-wing policies of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn won many more votes than expected; in Germany's election centrist parties performed poorly; while in France the populist National Front won a third of the votes in the final round of the presidential election. 2017 was a year when the cruelty of the climate wreaked terrible devastation in the Americas. More than three months on from Hurricane Irma, most Barbudans are still in shelters on the nearby island of Antigua Hurricane Irma was the strongest Atlantic basin hurricane ever recorded - its winds damaged 95% of the buildings on the Caribbean island of Barbuda. Meanwhile Hurricane Maria caused tens of billions of dollars of damage to Puerto Rico. No single weather event can be definitively linked to changes in the climate. Even so, the terrifying pictures of devastation focused minds again on the fragility of planet Earth. President Trump announced he was planning to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement, although many argued that the move would make little difference to the actual level of US emissions, as the country's coal-fired power stations are no longer economically viable and are likely to continue to be shut down anyway. In addition, cities and states in the US said they would press on with efforts to cut emissions. Climate scientists ended this year by delivering the bad news that estimated total global emissions of the ""greenhouse gas"" carbon dioxide are rising again after a decline in the previous three years. Hurricane Maria caused tens of billions of dollars of damage to Puerto Rico The climate campaigner Jonathon Porritt, of Forum for the Future, says he believes that China is starting to meet the challenge of decarbonising its economy, with ambitious targets for solar, wind and reforestation - planting billions of trees. By contrast, he was most concerned by the situation in India: ""India is a huge economy and growing fast, and in some respects, could become more of a destabilising factor than either the USA or China."" Mr Porritt also thinks there is a ""huge communications and engagement challenge"" in persuading ordinary people in rich countries to change their behaviour to stop them flying too much and eating too much meat. He points out that meat production accounts for about 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions, while the impact of flying is about 3% of global emissions. The numbers of people flying continues to increase by 7% a year, a development he regrets. ""I've always argued that aviation is going to be the toughest nut to crack. We're locked into a way of life now that makes flying very cheap and very easy for people."" The number of people flying is rising by 7% a year Irwin Stelzer of the Hudson Institute says that he remains disappointed that there is currently little political support for a global carbon tax which could provide a consistent incentive to decarbonise the economic system. ""I think everybody is in favour of somebody else reducing emissions,"" he says. It was an historic year for Zimbabwe, which saw the resignation of President Robert Mugabe, who had run the country since the end of white rule in 1980. John Robertson, an economist and journalist who has been in the country throughout this period, says Mr Mugabe's policies have destroyed a considerable part of the country's productive capacity. Zimbabweans celebrate after the resignation of Robert Mugabe ""The government did terrible damage to property rights and to civil rights,"" he says. ""We are now employing fewer people than we did 37 years ago when the country became independent and during that time the population has nearly doubled."" But with Mr Mugabe gone, he tells the BBC he is now more optimistic: ""If it is not derailed by greed, I think we have got every chance of this turning into something very positive.""

"It was the year the UK stock market broke through a price barrier it set back in 1999. The unemployment rate reached lows not seen for 42 years as record numbers of people found themselves in work. Silenced during the financial crisis, the full-throated roar of capitalism should have been deafening. And yet on many measures, 2017 was a bad year for capitalism, the system of free-market economics. For starters it was the year it faced serious opposition. In his conference speech, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that capitalism faced a ""crisis of legitimacy"" after the 2008 financial crash and the time had now come for a new economic model, with a bigger role for the public sector, renationalised utilities and more investment in infrastructure and skills. Labour Party membership doubled under Mr Corbyn, and having been written off by most pundits when the election was called, Labour ended up gaining 30 seats. Jeremy Corbyn has spoken of capitalism facing a ""crisis of legitimacy"" since the 2008 financial crisis As with all political punditry, hindsight proved helpful. Experts who wrote off his chances soon claimed it was no surprise how well Mr Corbyn's criticisms of capitalism went down given the economic reality of most people's lives. Capitalism's central promise is that through hard work you - and your family - will have a better life. Of course, there are recessions from time to time but, generally speaking, the tide of economic growth will eventually lift all ships. Well, that hasn't been true for millions of people since the economic crisis of 2008 but in 2017 a new grievance was added to the decade-long austerity fatigue. After a two-year period in which pay rises narrowly exceeded negligible inflation, prices started rising faster than pay - meaning on average people were getting a little poorer every day. CBI ex-boss says capitalism not working Is the productivity puzzle the chancellor's biggest problem? Social mobility: 'Britain remains deeply divided' The main reason behind stagnant pay was, as every economist in the land told us throughout 2017, poor productivity. That is measured as the value of stuff made or services provided per worker, per hour. When it goes up, you can afford to pay workers more, their living standards improve and they pay a bit more tax for public services - everyone is happy. When productivity doesn't go up, none of those good things happens. None of those good things happened this year. In fact, 2017 was the year the budget watchdog in the UK finally gave up waiting for the usual historical rise in productivity to return - with painful consequences for the public finances and the chancellor. When you give up on improving productivity, some would argue that you are pretty much giving up on capitalism. Capital is meant to find its way to where it is needed to boost economic performance and deliver a return to the providers of the capital. In the process, labour-intensive industries such as manufacturing, for example, can buy new kit to make more stuff more efficiently and therefore can pay the reduced number of workers more money. Poor productivity remains a major problem for the UK economy This year also saw even big asset managers raising the alarm over how little businesses were investing in the future - preferring instead to increase payouts to shareholders. Dividends from UK companies increased 17.5% in the three months to September, the biggest rise anywhere in the world and that is up against some stiff competition. For the past few years, US companies have paid out more than 100% of their profits. That means they are shrinking, not growing. There are other reasons for capitalism's poor showing in improving people's living standards. Ultra-low interest rates for a decade have kept some zombie companies alive that otherwise would have died and thereby see capital and people reallocated to healthier, more productive businesses. London shares have enjoyed a buoyant year Why does this matter? Perhaps the most damning report on capitalism in 2017 was to be found in the housing and social mobility figures. Home ownership in England fell to its lowest level in more than 30 years despite umpteen speeches, initiatives and programmes from successive governments to reverse the decline. The possibility of owning a home is perhaps the poster child of capitalism, a two-fingered gesture to the feudalism that preceded it and a powerful expression of social mobility. Getting on in life is at the heart of the capitalist promise and delivering on that is important enough for the government to have appointed a Social Mobility Commission. It recently reported that, at the current rate, it would take 15 years to narrow the ability gap between rich and poor at the age of five, 20 years for wages to return to the same level in real terms as they were before the crash and 80 years to close the gap in higher education participation rates. Levels of home ownership have continued to fall That was the last report delivered by the commission's chairman, former Labour minister Alan Milburn, before he resigned along with his Tory deputy, former cabinet minister Baroness Shephard, citing lack of progress and government support. A bad end to a bad year for the champions of capitalism. In truth, there have been very few good years for capitalism since the great financial crisis. In 2011, the Occupy movement invaded Wall Street and the City of London demanding immediate global change. Those tents and placards are long gone. But the effects of the crisis on earning power, living standards, home ownership and social mobility - all things capitalism promises to improve - remain with us as we end 2017. Let's end on a note of cheer. Thanks to the wealth destruction of the financial crisis, changes to UK tax policy lifting many lower earners out of income tax altogether and a higher national minimum wage, income inequality has actually declined in the UK in the past decade. UK firms 'set to pay Â£94bn in dividends' Has inequality been getting worse?

"The boss of Vanguard, one of the world's biggest investment funds, has expressed concerns about the record highs in stock markets. Bill McNabb, chairman of the US company, told the BBC the markets could be on course for a ""decent-sized correction at some point"". US stocks closed at fresh highs on Monday, days after the UK's FTSE 100 index hit a new record. Mr McNabb said Vanguard was also watching Brexit ""very carefully"". Vanguard, which manages $4.5 trillion (Â£3.5tn) of funds worldwide, employs about 400 people in London. The firm's main focus is on providing tracker funds for do-it-yourself investors which follow the rise and fall of indices such as the FTSE 100. In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, Mr McNabb said stock markets were not ""in bubble territory"", but he felt valuations were ""very high"". Wall Street has hit new records several times over the last month on expectations of strong company profits and hopes that President Trump will win backing for his tax cut plan. Mr McNabb said financial markets ""keep reaching new highs"", partly because they had ignored some of the political turbulence around the Trump administration. ""The Trump presidency has in a sense defied conventional wisdom,"" Mr McNabb said. He suggested it was because the markets were viewing ""a lot of what gets said as really just words"". Mr McNabb said markets were looking at ""the actions behind the words"" of the Trump presidency But Mr McNabb predicted that over the next 10 years stock markets will fall back again and the return from shares could drop from 9% to 6%. ""We expect there could be a decent-sized correction at some point,"" said Mr McNabb, who is stepping down as chief executive at the end of the year but staying on as chairman of Vanguard. The UK's FTSE 100 closed at a record high on Thursday at 7,556.24, but has since eased back slightly. Mr McNabb said the firm was also monitoring the economic impact from Brexit on Europe and the UK. Vanguard is concerned about rules for non-UK workers and the regulation of some of its financial products after the UK leaves the European Union. But he added that those issues were ""overcome-able"". ""We remain very optimistic about the UK's prospects as a place to do business in the long-run,"" he added. In May, Vanguard launched a new service to attract personal investors in the UK, offering tracker funds directly to consumers. Mr McNabb's comments come as a City lobby group warned financial firms would pull the trigger on ""irreversible"" job relocations next year unless the government agreed a transitional Brexit deal. The City UK said financial firms were ""beyond the planning stage now"" and would go ahead with contingency plans next year if there was no progress in the Brexit talks.

"This video can not be played Lord Adonis denies being pushed out of his government role The government's infrastructure adviser has announced he is quitting his role, describing Brexit as a ""populist and nationalist spasm"". Lord Adonis said Prime Minister Theresa May was ""pursuing a course fraught with danger"" over the UK's EU departure. The ex-Labour minister is already a high-profile campaigner against Brexit. A government source said: ""He's been moving closer towards the exit door with each new onslaught he makes against Brexit."" The source added: ""He's now walked through the door before he was pushed."" But Lord Adonis later insisted it had been his decision to leave, as his ""differences with the government had become too great"". Lord Adonis, who was transport secretary under Gordon Brown between 2009 and 2010, has chaired the National Infrastructure Commission since 2015. The commission produces a report in every Parliament advising the government on spending in areas such as transport connections and energy. Lord Adonis sparked anger earlier this year when he compared Brexit to the appeasement of the Nazis in the 1930s, and has repeatedly called for last year's referendum vote to be reversed. In hisresignation letter, he accused Mrs May of ""allying with UKIP and the Tory hard right to wrench Britain out of the key economic and political institutions of modern Europe"", saying the UK was ""hurtling towards the EU's emergency exit with no credible plan for the future of British trade and European co-operation"".

""A responsible government would be leading the British people to stay in Europe while also tackling, with massive vigour, the social and economic problems within Britain which contributed to the Brexit vote."" Lord Adonis said he planned to oppose ""relentlessly"" the government's EU (Withdrawal) Bill in the House of Lords. As well as Brexit, he said the recent decision to end the East Coast rail franchise three years early, would also have forced him to quit, describing it as a bailout costing hundreds of millions of pounds. MP Iain Duncan Smith said the departure of Lord Adonis was ""long overdue"". He added: ""It's a bit rich for him to pontificate on what he calls populism, but what most would refer to as democracy, when he himself has never been elected by a public vote.

"Drunk tanks may have to become the norm in towns and cities to keep ""selfish"" revellers out of A&E, the head of the NHS in England says. Simon Stevens said he would be closely monitoring how the mobile units cope on New Year's Eve before deciding whether they should become a regular feature. Drunk tanks provide a safe place for those who have over-indulged to be checked over and sleep it off. They are often used over the festive period to stop people ending up at A&E. There are around 16 mobile units - also known as booze buses - across the UK, according to a recent survey, and a number of cities operate them all year round, including Newcastle, Cardiff, Manchester and Bristol. Mr Stevens said he may start recommending others follow suit, given an estimated 15% of attendances at A&E are due to alcohol consumption. This rises to about 70% on Friday and Saturday nights. A number of cities have already introduced drunk tanks He said he was thinking about the move after spending time with ambulance crews in London and the West Midlands in recent weeks. ""I've seen first-hand how paramedics and A&Es are being called on to deal with drunk and aggressive behaviour."" Why is gin and tonic getting pricier? Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality?,external Parents give children alcohol 'too young' But Dr Katherine Henderson, a consultant in emergency medicine from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, said it might be better to have a conversation about people drinking less on a night out. She told the BBC: ""By making this facility, it's like saying 'you can depend on the NHS to provide you with a safe place to sober up'"". ""You're saying 'there's a safety net for you', rather than saying 'how are you going to get yourself and your friends home safely'?"" Dr Henderson also said she was concerned that NHS frontline staff were working in the mobile units, when ""they could be helping others"". But she conceded that the last thing busy hospitals needed was more patients coming in to A&E. ""We are seeing people who are so intoxicated that they need to be on a trolley - which takes up a whole cubicle space; people who need cleaning up - which takes up a lot of nursing time; and people with serious injuries, who may be difficult to spot among the many that are extremely drunk. ""It's something we just don't need."" In Newcastle on a Friday and Saturday night, a Safe Haven van already operates to help vulnerable people - not just people who are drunk. Dame Vera Baird, the Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner, whose office part funds the van, said: ""It's a safe location to help anybody who needs any support. It saves an enormous amount of money and time."" Prof Simon Moore, from Cardiff University, is carrying out a study into the impact of different types of drunk tanks based in six cities in relieving pressure on the emergency services. He said: ""The very, very drunk with head injuries and similar will still need to go to A&E, but the health service is very risk-averse so they have a tendency to refer to A&E if they suspect something is wrong. ""So all you need is a good trained person - a paramedic or nurse - in the city centre to say 'we can hold off for a bit, this person is going to be fine in an hour or so', and then they can go home and sleep it off."" Prof Moore said it should be ""a joined-up service"" that refers people for treatment for their underlying drink problems. In Northern Ireland, Belfast operates an NHS-run unit and an SOS bus, which helps anyone who is vulnerable. In Scotland, there are no drunk tanks in operation and the government said they had no plans to introduce them. Bristol launched the UK's first drunk tank three years ago in a partnership between the police, ambulance and local hospital. Known officially as an alcohol recovery centre, it is a state-of-the-art medical facility contained in a 60ft-long converted articulated lorry. The vehicle has beds and seats as well as two showers. It comes with medical drips, oxygen, blood testing equipment and a pump system for the worst-affected revellers. It is staffed by paramedics who provide basic treatment, although those who need it can still be sent to A&E. Since it was launched, other cities including Manchester, Cardiff and Newcastle, have tried their own versions. The National Institute for Health Research is now looking at how effective they are at dealing with drunks. As the nation prepares to see in the new year, Simon Stevens reminded revellers to be responsible. ""When the health service is pulling out all the stops to care for sick and vulnerable patients who rightly and genuinely need our support, it's frankly selfish when ambulance paramedics and A&E nurses have to be diverted to looking after revellers who have overindulged. ""NHS doesn't stand for 'National Hangover Service',"" he added. Minimum price 'will affect 70% of alcohol' Should there be a word for an 'almost alcoholic'?

"This video can not be played Fire commissioner: The fire quickly spread up the stairs - the stairway acted like a chimney New York City investigators believe the Bronx fire that killed 12 people, including four children, was caused by a child playing with a cooker. An unattended three-year-old boy accidentally started the blaze, fire commissioner Daniel Nigro said. As the child's mother fled with her two children, she then left the door open, allowing the fire to enter the hallway. The stairway had then ""acted like a chimney"" allowing the fire to spread rapidly upwards, he explained. This video can not be played New York City Fire Department released footage of the aftermath of the fire. The fire on Thursday night was the deadliest in the city for at least 25 years, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. Police said that among the dead were three girls, aged one, two and seven, and a boy who had not yet been identified. At least 20 people were rescued from fire escapes, officials say Officials have not yet released the names of any of the victims. Five victims were declared dead at the scene. At least 20 people were rescued from fire escapes and another 12 were brought out of the building. More than 170 firefighters helped bring the blaze under control in below-freezing weather conditions. This video can not be played Eyewitnesses say they heard people screaming and saw others waiting to be rescued Local media report that two children were found dead in the arms of a woman who had been seeking shelter in a bathtub. A US Army soldier, who was home for the holidays, is being reported missing by his family. Emmanuel Mensah, 28, was staying on the third floor of the building, his father told the New York Daily News. He had visited four hospitals looking for his son. Residents who did manage to escape huddled outside in the biting cold. Some fled the building without shoes or coats and the Red Cross handed out blankets to people on the street. New York City is experiencing a severe cold snap, and temperatures dropped to around -10C (13F) on Thursday night. The water from firefighters' hoses could be seen turning to ice on the ground. Who died in Bronx fire? The identities of the 12 victims have begun to emerge, as family members confirm the deaths of their loved ones. Four members of the same family have been confirmed dead by a family member. Karen Stewart-Francis, 37, died with her two daughters and was part of a large Jamaican family living in the building, according to her mother, Ambrozia Stewart. Ms Stewart named the children as Kylie Francis 2, and Kelly Francis, 7, adding that her niece, 19-year-old Shawntay Young, was also killed. Her son-in-law, Holt Francis, is in hospital in a coma. Maria Baptise, 56, as well as her 8-month-old granddaughter, also died, her brother told ABC News. Mrs Baptise's daughter - the child's mother - is in hospital and is being treated for her injuries. The building contains more than 20 flats and was built just over 100 years ago. According to public records, the building has received several code violations, including for a broken smoke detector on the first floor where authorities say the fire began. Mayor De Blasio told WNYC radio on Friday that ""there were concerns raised about the building itself"", but that ""based on the research we have at this moment, it does not appear there was anything problematic about the building or the fire safety in the building"".

"The Lighthouse Winmore filled up with oil to take to Taiwan but never went there, it is alleged South Korea has revealed it seized a Hong Kong-registered ship last month suspected of supplying oil to the North in breach of international sanctions. Officials said the Lighthouse Winmore had secretly transferred 600 tonnes of refined oil to a North Korean ship. A UN Security Council resolution bans ship-to-ship transfers of any goods destined for Pyongyang. The revelations came as China denied claims by President Donald Trump it had allowed oil shipments to the North. North Korea crisis in 300 words How North Korea does business under sanctions Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? The ship entered Yeosu port in South Korea on 11 October,externalto load up with refined oil and left for Taiwan four days later, Yonhap news agency reported. But instead of going to Taiwan it transferred the oil to a North Korean ship and three other vessels in international waters on 19 October, South Korean officials were quoted as saying. This defies a UN Security Council resolution imposed on 11 September. The New York Timessaid the transfer was captured in US satellite photos,external, released by the US Treasury in November, although the Lighthouse Winmore was not named by the Treasury. The Lighthouse Winmore was seized when it returned to Yeosu in November and remains in South Korea, South Korean officials said. There is no evidence for this, as although the Lighthouse Winmore is Hong Kong-flagged, it was leased by a Taiwanese company, Billions Bunker Group Corp. Taiwan's Presidential Office said the company that chartered the ship was not incorporated in Taiwan, but did not say whether the firm's owner or officials are Taiwanese. The Chinese government said the accusations against it were ""not consistent with the facts"". North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has refused to bow to international pressure ""China has never allowed Chinese enterprises nor individuals to violate UN Security Council resolutions imposed on the DPRK,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said. China handles about 90% of the North's foreign trade. There has been increasing suspicion in Washington that Chinese ships have been secretly transferring petroleum to North Korean vessels at sea. China has continued to deny this, saying it fully enforces UN resolutions against Pyongyang. On Thursday, Mr Trump tweeted he was ""very disappointed"" with China, which he said had been ""caught red-handed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The tweet followed a report on the issue inSouth Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo,external. Quoting South Korean government officials, the report said the illegal ship-to-ship transfers had been filmed by US spy satellites about 30 times since October. President Trump told the New York Times he had ""been soft"" on trade issues with China,externalbecause he wanted its help on North Korea but was now threatening to end that. He said: ""Oil is going into North Korea. That wasn't my deal. If they don't help us with North Korea, then I do what I've always said I want to do."" Yes. Last weekBeijing supported a US-drafted UN resolutionthat included measures to slash the North's petrol imports by up to 90%. The 22 December sanctions also refer specifically to attempts by the North to procure prohibited goods,external. The measures address the ""illicit imports of petroleum through deceptive maritime practices by requiring Member States to seize, inspect and freeze any vessel in their ports and territorial waters for involvement in prohibited activities"". On Thursday, the UN Security Council also denied international port access to four more North Korean ships suspected of carrying banned goods, AFP reported. It would bring the total number of ships blocked by the UN to eight. North Korea is already subject to a raft of sanctions from the US, the UN and the EU. The latest round was sparked by the 29 November launch of a ballistic missile, which flew higher than any other the North has tested. In a typically bellicose response,North Korea described the new sanctions as an ""act of war"". Mr Trump has previously threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it launches a nuclear attack. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has described the US president as ""mentally deranged"". This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC They have been imposed for more than a decade with little success. In fact, North Korea has said fresh sanctions will only make it accelerate its nuclear programme.

"Louise and Jamie Redknapp have been granted a divorce decree after 19 years of marriage. Former pop star and Strictly finalist Louise filed for divorce citing the ""unreasonable behaviour"" of ex-footballer Jamie, according to court papers. A family court judge concluded their relationship was ""irretrievably"" broken and granted a decree nisi. The marriage will formally end when a decree absolute is granted. The divorce petitioner - in this case, Louise Redknapp - has to wait six weeks and a day to apply for the decree absolute after the decree nisi has been granted by the court. Neither party was at the brief court hearing in central London on Friday. The Redknapps married in 1998 on a luxury 130ft yacht called Lady Tamara in Bermuda. When she announced the couple had separated earlier this year, Louise said she felt like ""a sort of Stepford wife"".

"This video can not be played Blood and bullet holes mark the scene of the church attack Nine people have been killed in two attacks on Coptic Christians in Helwan district, south of Cairo, Egypt's interior ministry has said. Six civilians and a policeman died when a gunman tried to storm a church but was intercepted and arrested, it said. It said the man had previously attacked a Coptic-owned shop in the same area, killing two brothers. The so-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed its ""soldiers"" carried out the church attack. The interior ministry's account differs from an earlier version of events given by Egypt's health ministry. The initial report said 12 were dead, and suggested there were two attackers. It said one had been killed, and the other fled but was later captured. More than 100 Christians have been killed in Egypt in the past year, with most attacks claimed by the local branch of IS militants. Egyptian Christians living in fear for the future Egypt country profile Security forces have reinforced checkpoints in place around the capital in response to the attacks. They announced plans earlier this week to protect festivities around the New Year and, on 7 January, Coptic Christmas. They include the deployment of rapid-reaction forces, combat troops and jamming equipment. According to the interior ministry statement, the first attack on Friday took place at a household appliances shop. Then the attacker headed to the Saint Mina Coptic church, where he attempted ""to trespass the church's perimeter security"". ""The security forces have dealt with the attacker and managed to arrest him after he was injured,"" the ministry said. Security forces are on guard around the capital But it said that seven people, including an auxiliary policeman, had been killed and four injured as the gunman opened fire at the church. The attacker also had an explosive device, a machine gun and 150 rounds, it added. The ministry suggested he was known to security services, saying he was ""one of the most active terrorist elements and he carried out several terrorist attacks which resulted in the martyrdom of a number of policemen and civilians"". However, the interior ministry account contradicts earlier ones from officials and witnesses, who spoke of a higher death toll and more than one attacker. Video footage has also emerged appearing to show one gunman lying dead at the scene and another alleged attacker fleeing in a red car. In the wake of Friday's attacks, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi offered condolences to family members and vowed to continue ""cleansing the country of terrorism and extremism"". Egypt's Copts have in the past accused the authorities of making only token gestures to protect them and these incidents will not help calm tensions, our correspondent Radwa Gamal says. Egypt's Coptic Christians have long felt under attack Egypt is a Muslim-majority country and its Christian minority - mostly members of the Coptic Orthodox Church - make up around 10% of the population. Last Easter, on Palm Sunday, at least 45 people died in twin attacks on Coptic churches in Alexandria and the Nile Delta city of Tanta. At least 29 Copts were killed on a bus en route to a monastery in central Egypt in May, and a Coptic Orthodox priest was stabbed to death in Cairo in October. The attacks have been blamed on, and in many cases claimed by, Islamists affiliated with IS.

"This video can not be played US tax bill: the winners and losers US President Donald Trump has hailed sweeping tax reforms after they were given final approval by Congress, despite fierce criticism by Democrats. ""We are making America great again,"" a jubilant Mr Trump said. He is expected to sign his first major legislative achievement - the biggest rewrite of the US tax code in a generation - in the coming days. The bill slashes taxes for corporations and the wealthy, while offering mixed, temporary relief to working people. Democrats have labelled the Republican tax bill ""government for sale"", with prominent Senator Elizabeth Warren describing it as a ""heist"". Allow Twitter content?

Hosting Republican leaders at the White House, President Trump said: ""This will indeed be a very big day when people look back at our country."" He thanked congressional leaders for pushing through what he called ""the largest tax cut in the history of our country"". Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan praised Mr Trump's ""exquisite presidential leadership"" for the success of the bill. Earlier, in a statement, Mr Trump said:  ""I promised the American people a big, beautiful tax cut for Christmas. With final passage of this legislation, that is exactly what they are getting."" Elizabeth Warren, like every other Democratic senator, opposed the bill Because of a procedural glitch, the bill had to be voted on for a second time in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives. It passed by 224 votes to 201 on Wednesday afternoon. Democrats say that error was caused by Republicans rushing the most sweeping overhaul of the tax system since 1986 through Congress. In an often secretive process, no public hearings were held and multiple last-minute amendments that were pushed by lobbyists cropped up in the final version. The unpopular bill is likely to be a major issue during next year's mid-term congressional elections. Fifty-two per cent of adults said they opposed the tax plan, while only 27% supported it, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The Republican tax plan explained Non-partisan analysts say the greatest beneficiaries of the package will be the super-wealthy, multinational corporations and the commercial property industry. In the immediate future, the plan will see the vast majority of taxpayers having lower tax bills, but those cuts expire in 2025. By 2027, the Tax Policy Center estimates the overall change would be negligible. And 53% of taxpayers would face higher bills, many of them in the lower income brackets. This video can not be played Paul Ryan's exuberant gavelling reflects how long he's pushed for tax reform The bill is projected to add $1.5tn (Â£1.1tn) over the next decade to the $20tn US debt, which Mr Trump promised last year he would eliminate. But Republicans argue it will boost economic growth. The legislation reaches beyond fiscal matters to tick off a wish list of conservative priorities. It strikes a serious blow to Obamacare, scrapping the fine levied on Americans who do not buy health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office says this will increase premiums for people who have medical coverage. The bill also opens Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, a major defeat for environmentalists. Read the full explanation Demonstrators in New York rallied in Wall Street on Tuesday As the final vote approached in the Senate overnight, the chamber's Democratic leader Chuck Schumer scolded Republicans for talking during his closing argument. ""This is serious stuff,"" the New York senator said. ""We believe you're messing up America."" Among the most outspoken critics are those progressive figures in the party often tipped as possible 2020 presidential contenders. Mr Trump has called the bill a Christmas gift to the middle class Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted: ""Let's call this out for what it is: Government for sale."" Senator Kirstin Gillibrand accused Republicans of having ""put their donors before hardworking middle-class families"". Senators Cory Booker, of New Jersey, and Kamala Harris, of California, said the bill was a ""travesty"". And Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator who was Hillary Clinton's running mate last year, branded the legislation ""highway robbery"". Trump's tax cuts: Why they matter further afield Will Trump's plans trigger a tax war? How the reforms affect us all By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter It wasn't exactly easy, but President Trump now has his signature legislative achievement. The self-styled dealmaker-in-chief was finally able to flex his party's majority muscle, overcoming internal dissent to accomplish some long-sought political goals. What one Congress can do another can undo, of course, and the task ahead for Republicans is selling a sceptical public on the benefits of their plan. While they may argue that Americans will come around once they see lower tax bills, many may have already made up their mind. Like Obamacare eight years ago, this tax legislation was passed by partisan muscle alone. And like that law, many Americans view the legislation as largely benefitting others. They will be difficult to convince otherwise. Repealing key provisions of this tax law will be as uniting for Democrats as healthcare repeal was for conservatives. President Trump and Republicans have their victories. They will have to fight to keep them. Has Trump delivered on his promises? What is in the tax plan? Winners and losers?

"The shadow of the New Year's Eve sex attacks in Cologne still looms large in Germany Organisers of Berlin's New Year's Eve celebrations are to set up a ""safe zone"" for women for the first time. The new security measures planned for the Brandenburg Gate party come amid concerns about sexual assaults. A large number of assaults and robberies targeting women at Cologne's New Year's Eve celebrations two years ago horrified Germany. Hundreds of women reported being attacked by gangs of men with migrant backgrounds. The events in Cologne heightened tensions in the country over the large influx of refugees and migrants - 1.1m people arrived in Germany in 2015, some, but by no means all, fleeing violence in Syria and Iraq. Cologne police 'right to target North Africans' at new year Women describe 'terrible' assaults Should Germany pay its migrants to leave? Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend the New Year's Eve party in Berlin on Sunday and security will be strict. Large bags, such as rucksacks, and alcoholic drinks will be banned at the Brandenburg Gate. Women who have been assaulted or feel harassed will be able to get support at a special ""safety zone"", staffed by the German Red Cross, on Ebertstrasse. Preparations are under way for the New Year Eve's party at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin The city's police have also issued advice to women,external, encouraging them to seek help if they feel threatened and to carry a small bag with no valuables. The 'right amount' of panic for women in public Undercover in London, catching harassers on the Tube Cologne officials set up a ""security point"", staffed by social workers and psychologists, at the city's 2016 carnival following the New Year's Eve attacks. But the idea of a special safe zone for women at large public events has not been welcomed by everyone. Critics say it does not tackle the perpetrators of sexual violence, while some others complain it is discriminatory.

"This video can not be played Blood and bullet holes mark the scene of the church attack Nine people have been killed in two attacks on Coptic Christians in Helwan district, south of Cairo, Egypt's interior ministry has said. Six civilians and a policeman died when a gunman tried to storm a church but was intercepted and arrested, it said. It said the man had previously attacked a Coptic-owned shop in the same area, killing two brothers. The so-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed its ""soldiers"" carried out the church attack. The interior ministry's account differs from an earlier version of events given by Egypt's health ministry. The initial report said 12 were dead, and suggested there were two attackers. It said one had been killed, and the other fled but was later captured. More than 100 Christians have been killed in Egypt in the past year, with most attacks claimed by the local branch of IS militants. Egyptian Christians living in fear for the future Egypt country profile Security forces have reinforced checkpoints in place around the capital in response to the attacks. They announced plans earlier this week to protect festivities around the New Year and, on 7 January, Coptic Christmas. They include the deployment of rapid-reaction forces, combat troops and jamming equipment. According to the interior ministry statement, the first attack on Friday took place at a household appliances shop. Then the attacker headed to the Saint Mina Coptic church, where he attempted ""to trespass the church's perimeter security"". ""The security forces have dealt with the attacker and managed to arrest him after he was injured,"" the ministry said. Security forces are on guard around the capital But it said that seven people, including an auxiliary policeman, had been killed and four injured as the gunman opened fire at the church. The attacker also had an explosive device, a machine gun and 150 rounds, it added. The ministry suggested he was known to security services, saying he was ""one of the most active terrorist elements and he carried out several terrorist attacks which resulted in the martyrdom of a number of policemen and civilians"". However, the interior ministry account contradicts earlier ones from officials and witnesses, who spoke of a higher death toll and more than one attacker. Video footage has also emerged appearing to show one gunman lying dead at the scene and another alleged attacker fleeing in a red car. In the wake of Friday's attacks, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi offered condolences to family members and vowed to continue ""cleansing the country of terrorism and extremism"". Egypt's Copts have in the past accused the authorities of making only token gestures to protect them and these incidents will not help calm tensions, our correspondent Radwa Gamal says. Egypt's Coptic Christians have long felt under attack Egypt is a Muslim-majority country and its Christian minority - mostly members of the Coptic Orthodox Church - make up around 10% of the population. Last Easter, on Palm Sunday, at least 45 people died in twin attacks on Coptic churches in Alexandria and the Nile Delta city of Tanta. At least 29 Copts were killed on a bus en route to a monastery in central Egypt in May, and a Coptic Orthodox priest was stabbed to death in Cairo in October. The attacks have been blamed on, and in many cases claimed by, Islamists affiliated with IS.

"It is known as the great synchronisation. For the first time since the financial crisis all the global centres of economic growth are seeing an economic growth spurt. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was so chipper at the fund's Autumn Meeting in October she took to quoting Percy Shelley. ""There is harmony in autumn,"" she told the assembled finance ministers in Washington, including Philip Hammond. Europe, China, Japan, the emerging Asian economies and America (the world's economic growth engine) had all seen an ""accelerating cyclical upswing"", the IMF said, upgrading its global growth forecast to 3.7% from 3.6%. A figure that is in sharp contrast to last year's more sluggish 3.2%, which was the lowest since the financial crisis. Finally, the world is dragging itself out of its credit crunch stupor. The decision by the US Senate to pass Republicanproposals for a $1.3trn (Â£1trn) tax cut is likely to further boost the American economy. An analysis by the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation suggests that over a decade GDP growth could increase by 0.7% compared with a baseline scenario of no change. And for an economy worth in the region of $19trn that's an awful lot of new value. As I am sure President Donald Trump will be, well, trumpeting. Corporation tax on business profits will be cut from 35% to 21%. Alongside new restrictions on shifting profits abroad, the cut is likely to lead to a major repatriation of US business profits which are at present being sheltered offshore. Individual taxes will also be cut, but more modestly. ""In general, tax policy affects economic growth by changing incentives for owners of capital to invest and for potential workers to supply labour to the economy by changing the after-tax rates of return to these two factors of production,"" the Joint Committee said in its analysis earlier this month. Put simply, tax cuts tend to be an economic incentive to invest for businesses and to work and spend for employees. Of course, there have been many critics of the US tax reforms. The wealthy gain more than those less well off. And the business tax cuts are far larger than those for middle-income Americans. The cuts are also likely to add to the US deficit, although Republicans argue that greater economic growth will ultimately increase the overall tax take. There is one big take out from today's policy change - American economic growth is strengthening and this is likely to boost it further. China, much of the rest of Asia and the European continent are also seeing stronger figures. That is good news for Britain, where, although overall growth has been downgraded, exports have been boosted, helped along by the weaker pound. Manufacturing output surveys suggest order books are at their healthiest for 30 years. The great synchronisation is with us. And America's plans for tax cuts won't do anything to harm that.

" The Swapper is a story about the internationally-acclaimed British documentary photographer David Hurn; it is a story of a dyslexic, Welsh schoolboy written off as being ""a bit thick"" and an extraordinary ""succession of bizarre coincidences"" which would propel him into the ranks of photography's elite. A fixture of Sixties London and the Hollywood inner sanctum, his images of Jane Fonda as Barbarella, Sean Connery as James Bond, and the Beatles on the set of A Hard Day's Night, became icons of the 20th Century. But they are mere window dressing on a body of work so influential that recognition by him is now regarded as something of an anointing of careers. David Hurn is a luminary of Magnum Photos. Magnum is the stuff of legends. Being invited to join its hallowed ranks - there are only 62 working members in the world - is notoriously difficult; think of it as a kind of SAS, Harvard, an Olympics gold medal of photography. It is one of the most revered and exclusive organisations in the world which has documented life on virtually every corner of the planet over the past 70 years. That one famous photograph that sticks in your mind? Chances are it is a Magnum shot. Its photographers have informed generations with some of the most indelible, mind-blowing, thought-provoking, disturbing, entertaining and curious images of our time. Once nominated by existing members, you run a rigorous four year, three-stage gauntlet of continually proving your worth. Only the chosen few survive to be voted in as fully-fledged members. ""One of the first emails any new nominee will receive, on being accepted by Magnum, is from Hurn, inviting them to exchange,"" says Martin Parr, out-going president of Magnum Photos. ""Everyone always willingly agrees; they select their favourite Hurn image and vice versa."" To swap with David Hurn is a flattering entrée into the big time for photographers both inside and outside Magnum, young, old, established and lesser-known. It is continuing a tradition started by Hurn in the late 1950s. Just as then, whenever a photographer's talent catches his eye today, he approaches them to swap a print. His collection - now a 700-strong who's who of photography - is the subject of a major exhibition entitled 'Swaps, Photographs from the David Hurn Collection' in his native Cardiff. It heralds the realisation of a long-held dream of Hurn's - the opening of the first permanent gallery dedicated to photography at Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales, where he has recently donated his entire £3.5m archive. The museum is of deep significance. His mother, perhaps recognising something in her dyslexic son whom teachers had written off, would take him there on weekly visits. The marble-floored halls of Rodin statues and Brangwyn paintings ignited an insatiable curiosity that continues to fuel his work today. The following sets out a selection of swaps from the exhibition which illustrate influences on his life, a selection of his own work along with the story of the ""succession of bizarre coincidences"" that shaped his extraordinary career as a self-taught photographer and educator. And how aged 83, David Hurn has a new quest - to harness the phenomenon of the selfie to inspire photographers of the future. When it comes to spontaneously bawling your eyes out some places are undoubtedly more desirable than others; the officers' mess at Sandhurst isn't one of them. But then epiphanies are renowned for their untimeliness and on Saturday, 12 February 1955, David Hurn had exactly that, an epiphany; the non-religious kind. Hurn is a staunch atheist. ""It's such a ludicrously romantic story, it's almost stupid,"" he says. Hurn, who left school with no qualifications, was doing national service when he was plucked from the ranks and catapulted into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. The army officer training centre needed to bolster its rugby team and Hurn's skill on the field made him an asset. His dyslexia, long before it was recognised, had meant that childhood ambitions to be a vet or an archaeologist were scoffed at so at school he focussed on the one thing he could do well - sport. ""And so that's how I ended up at Sandhurst,"" he says. ""That's the really puzzling part of my life as it was like going to university which had been totally out of my reach. ""I studied military history which I found fascinating and played sports all the time. My dad was a soldier in the Welsh Guards and so, like him, my life was mapped out very pleasantly indeed right up until the day I retired."" In the officers' mess that Saturday, Hurn was browsing through a copy of Picture Post - then a popular, weekly photojournalism magazine. He stopped dead at a picture taken by the legendary French humanist photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, a founding member of Magnum Photos. Henri Cartier-Bresson in 1992 by Martine Franck Part of a ground-breaking photo essay on the Russians - the first by any Western photographer during the Cold War - it showed a soldier buying his wife a hat at a Leningrad department store, their child standing beside them. ""I suddenly burst into tears,"" he recalls. ""I mean crying quite seriously. ""We had a lot of propaganda at Sandhurst which basically said the equivalent of all Russians eat their children. ""My earliest memory is my dad coming home from the army and taking my mum with me in tow to Howell's department store in Cardiff, where he bought her a hat. ""So my first recollection of mum and dad in love, and demonstrating that love, is her trying on various hats. When I saw this picture it brought all that back to me. State department store Univermag, Leningrad, 1954, Henri Cartier-Bresson ""What I recognised instantly then was the extraordinary ability of photography to evoke memory and boy, how powerfully it could do that. ""And I suddenly disbelieved the propaganda about Russia. I looked at the picture and was totally convinced that Russian people were just normal people like the rest of us. ""It was so significant. I remember saying to myself 'This is what I'd really love to do, go round shooting pictures of army officers buying their wives hats and getting other people to cry'."" He bought a Kodak folding Retina camera and resigned from the army. His father was appalled. He had struggled through the Depression and never really forgave his son from walking away from an opportunity like Sandhurst. ""It was totally illogical,"" he says. ""I had enormous doubts about what I was doing but they were over-powered, and, again, it sounds so romantic, by an intense desire to do this illogical thing - to take photographs."" Hurn found digs in London and sold shirts in Harrods. The Partisan coffee bar in Soho, shot by Hurn, 1957 In the evenings and weekends he would obsessively shoot photos around the lively coffee house scene in Soho. Famous for their impromptu late-night jazz sessions, coffee bars such as the Nucleus, Le Macabre, The Partisan, were hot houses for 1950s liberal-thinking, politicised bohemians - burgeoning artists, film makers, writers and intellectuals - whose ideas helped propagate the countercultural explosion of the following decade. Hurn was at a show of Cartier-Bresson's photographs when leading professional photographer Michael Peto introduced himself. He viewed Hurn's work and offered to help, introducing him to a thrusting photo agency called Reflex. Hurn was taken on as an assistant. Reflex specialised in early telephoto lens photography - ""The idea that the Royal watch by paparazzi is a recent phenomenon is nonsense,"" Hurn says - and it was a fertile training ground but he wanted more. ""The Hungarian revolution was happening and me and a friend thought we'd go and have a look at what was happening,"" he says. Child freedom fighter, Budapest, 1956 ""I bought a second-hand Contax camera with two lenses and a book on how to use it which I read as we hitch-hiked our way to Hungary. I was chancing my arm really. ""We got through the Iron Curtain by getting a lift on some ambulances. We hitch-hiked to Budapest and found out where the press were gathered. Somebody heard I was a freelance. The LIFE magazine photographer hadn't managed to get in so their reporters said ""you're now working for LIFE magazine"". ""My first assignment with a camera I was still unsure how to use was with LIFE magazine. ""But then I've always said it's much better to start at the top than the bottom. At least you can cling on up there and that's what I did, I clung on."" Woman shopping during a lull in fighting, Budapest, 1956 One of the two photos published in LIFE - which sold 13.5m copies a week at its peak - remains particularly pertinent to him. It is of a child freedom fighter. ""A photograph allows you to record a single moment in time,"" he says. ""It's always there. And I keep that one to remind me that the boy might well have died the next day."" As well as LIFE magazine his pictures of the anti-Soviet Hungary uprising appeared in Picture Post and the Observer. Hurn says only one per cent of what he shot was any good and that was down to fluke. Fluke or not, on his return he was offered the unimaginable - a staff job at LIFE magazine. What was even more unimaginable, he turned it down. ""It's very strange,"" Hurn says. ""I'm not entirely sure why. I didn't want to be working for a magazine and tied in that way. US troops assault Omaha Beach, D-Day landings, Normandy, 6 June 1944, Robert Capa ""I presume I was fearful of being told what to do; maybe insecurity that I wouldn't be able to deliver, I don't know; I just felt much safer working on my own which after Hungary, I knew was possible."" Whatever the reason, Hurn's unswerving single-mindedness was curiously in sync with the vision that had given rise to Magnum 10 years earlier. The agency was conceived in the aftermath of, and in reaction to, the totalitarianism horrors of World War II. It was the quixotic vision of Robert Capa, reputed to be the greatest combat and adventure photographer in history. Robert Capa shortly before he died in a land mine explosion in Vietnam, then part of Indochina, on assignment for LIFE magazine A friend and colleague of Steinbeck and Hemingway, his intrepid coverage of conflicts earned him the Croix de Guerre and the Medal of Freedom from President Eisenhower in 1947. That same year Capa approached four fellow war photographers, veterans of the Spanish Civil war and World War II - Frenchman Henri Cartier-Bresson, Briton George Rodger and Americans David Seymour and William Vandivert - and explained his idea about combining their talent into a cooperative. The intention was two-fold: to protect the copyright of their images and ensure their artistic integrity and freedom. By controlling copyright, Capa realised he could publish in not just one, but maybe 15 magazines, which meant he could spend three times as long on a story and still be financially ahead. It was a revolutionary business model whereby they would choose stories and not rely on direction from newspaper editors, a halcyon concept of ""a brotherhood… beyond the pale of editorial sanction and censorship who could interpret the world as it was and who worshipped only things as they were"". The paperwork was drawn up in New York followed by a champagne celebration which is said to have given rise to the name, Magnum. Actor Peter O'Toole shot by Hurn in London, 1962 Little wonder given its pedigree that being accepted as a member is ""considered one of the finest accolades of a photographer's career"". And it was an accolade that was about to move onto Hurn's radar. Hurn, who shared flats with fledgling actor Peter O'Toole and was close friends with aspiring film-maker Ken Russell, obsessively analysed photography and its history with new-found friends such as Don McCullin, Ian Berry and Philip Jones Griffiths, all of whom later joined Magnum and achieved international acclaim covering conflicts around the world. Don McCullin, knighted in 2017 for services to photography, at Hurn's flat in Bayswater, 1972 ""We had gravitated together,"" he says. ""We were do-ers not talkers and I've always find do-ers want to be in the company of other do-ers. ""I've never drank nor smoked so I've never been a pub person. We'd socialise in the coffee bars, analysing the work of great photographers, how to make a picture better. There was a friendly rivalry which has continued ever since and I suspect had a lot to do with the fact that all of us have done pretty well. Philip Jones Griffiths, renowned for his coverage of the Vietnam War, shot by Hurn at the Mayfair flat of Magnum's Eve Arnold ""In London at the time a few of the big photojournalism magazines had closed and it was all about newspapers. That was great in that they used photographs well; the Daily Express would sometimes run a double page photograph and the Daily Mail back then had something like 32 foreign correspondents. The problem with that was it was all linked to current affairs and news. ""I made a decent job of it but I wasn't terribly interested. The people around me were all really interested and almost by definition, were better than me. ""McCullin was interested in anything that made his adrenaline go. Philip Jones Griffiths was a very astute political animal, he really understood what politics were about, Ian was basically a traveller… and there was no way I was going to compete. ""I was aware that I was floating around in a pretty high class second division and I was never going to be in the first division while I was in that world. ""Then in 1958 I had a stroke of luck."" Hurn was photographing tourists enjoying the pigeons in Trafalgar Square. Trafalgar Square, part of a photo essay on London shot by Larrain in 1958-59 ""Suddenly this guy came up to me,"" he says. ""He was also photographing the pigeons and he said 'I think you are probably a very good photographer'. I thought it was a bit odd at first. ""He told me that you can tell by the sheer concentration of some people when they are shooting pictures, most people don't concentrate, they just shoot lots of pictures. Chilean photographer Sergio Larrain in Paris 1959 ""We went and had coffee. His name was Sergio Larrain, a photographer from Chile who was part of something called Magnum agency. I'd never even heard of Magnum. Sergio is in my top three of favourite photographers ever, so it was an extraordinary coincidence to meet him like that. Sergio Larrain: Fishermen's daughters in the village of Los Horcones, Chile, 1956 ""We became very good friends. He showed me his pictures and they were exactly the sort of thing I loved. They had a poetic quality; they were seemingly about nothing yet were incredibly significant and poignant. He was totally a man after my own heart."" Larrain was the first photographer Hurn received a print from. It was only later, as he grew in stature as a photographer that he would ask to swap. ""I remember saying 'Oh I really like that' and he gave me a copy and I asked him to sign it. Prints weren't 'a thing' back then as there were no photo galleries as such. They would emerge later and galleries would sell signed prints as art in order to meet business overheads. ""This was long before that but it had sparked in me the realisation that to collect other people's pictures was a nice thing to do, a bit like someone's autograph. And that's how the swaps started."" Magnum photographer Elliott Erwitt (let) with John Hillelson, shot by Rene Burri Larrain looked at Hurn's pictures and steered him away from news and current affairs urging him to focus on his other work, similar in tone to his own, pictures of everyday people, the beauty of the mundane. ""That was great for me,"" Hurn says. ""It was as if someone had released me and given me permission to do what I loved. ""Sergio was a huge influence on my life. He introduced me to the London agent who represented many agencies around the world including Magnum, a man called John Hillelson. ""I'm sure he took me on only because Sergio had recommended me. But it was another enormous break. I've had extraordinary breaks throughout my life. George Rodger in the Algerian Sahara, 1957 ""I've never worked out if everyone has these chances but maybe they don't grab them. I've been incredibly lucky but I genuinely think luck is simply realising something's significance and taking advantage of it."" There was no doubt the introduction to John Hillelson - whose Fleet Street agency contributed much to 20th Century photo-reportage - was pivotal. By the early 1960s Hurn had found his niche and had little competition. At John Hillelson's behest he offered up a steady stream of photo essay ideas to the emerging Sunday supplements. Meanwhile, Hillelson also steered him towards foreign magazine markets in France, Italy and Brazil. More crucially perhaps, he provided direct access to the world of Magnum photographers. From Bruce Davidson's photo essay entitled Brooklyn Gang, New York, 1959 Whenever Hurn heard of a noted photographer's impending arrival from overseas he would make himself available as a guide, driver or general assistant. ""I believe there are two ways to learn to do things well, in the arts particularly,"" Hurn says. ""Teach yourself, learn by experience and examine work by people who do what you want to do and continually ask ""Why are they better than me?"". ""The other method is to learn directly from someone you admire and who does what they do terribly well. ""George Rodger, a founding member of Magnum, lived in England. I met him and we got on very well. My instinct was to talk to the great photographers. And so I went out of my way to meet great photographers like Bill Brandt, I found out where he lived and simply knocked on his door. Major Green confesses to murdering a woman in an apartment block where he worked, New York, 1937, Weegee ""With each great photographer I met, my collection of prints would build. But I was always careful to discuss with them particular pictures of theirs that I liked. I think that made them happy that somebody wasn't just saying ""oh I'd like a picture of yours""."" One of the first photographers Hurn offered to assist was Bruce Davidson, a young, hot-shot American and Magnum rookie who had wowed with gritty photo essays inside the hostile, disenfranchised New York ghettos and the US civil rights movement. Bruce Davidson around the time he first met Hurn in London,1960 ""Bruce was about the same age as me and I remember thinking 'Hang on, this guy is one of the greatest photographers in the world and I'm still floundering around trying to get something in the local newspaper',"" Hurn says. ""So that was an incredible spur. I really picked his brains a lot. ""Through watching him work I identified, without understanding it before that point, the idea of authorship which is what interests me most about photography. 'The dead man's wife arrived...and then she collapsed', New York, 1941, Weegee ""How can I describe authorship without it being elitist? Well, it is elitist to an extent, it's about distinctiveness. I'm interested in Monet as a painter because I can instantly see a particular painting is by Monet. And I find that interesting. ""It's the same with anything. Why do we move towards a certain singer? Barb Jungr is a singer I like very much whom most people won't have heard of. Why is it when I hear a song of hers I know instantly it's her singing? ""I find it more interesting in photography because there's no logic to it. All you've got is a box with a hole at the front. That's what we've all got and that's all we've ever had since photography was invented. ""All that happens is the image of life out there goes whizzing through that lens and goes bang onto some material or other and you get a trace of that life on the back of the box. And you've got once chance at it, unlike painting or writing you can't go back and edit, in photography the moment's gone and will never happen again. Anthony Esposito, held for murdering a businessman and police officer in the 'Battle of Fifth Avenue', 1941, Weegee ""So, all we have is this box with a hole in the front. So how come if there was a sheep dog trial for instance and Cartier-Bresson, McCullin and Bruce Davidson were there, they are all photographing exactly the same thing but if you showed me 10 pictures from that event I would be able to tell you who had taken what picture? ""It's the signature of someone which can't be contrived; it's the purest thing to their real personality, the world seen through their eyes. The pictures are stamped with the unique style of the individual who shot them. ""But what is necessary for the authorship to come through is an impeccable command of the technical side. The best photographers might say 'Oh, the technical side is unimportant'. Well, the technical side is staggeringly important but it has got to the point with them that they don't have to think about it. That only comes through hard work and incessant practice. ""I always stress this point... you're not a photographer because you are interested in photography. ""The picture is out there, you don't make the picture, you just have a good visual eye and press the button at the right time. For that you must have an intense curiosity and tenacity, not just a passing visual interest, in the theme of the pictures. This curiosity leads to intense examination, reading, talking, research and many, many failed attempts. ""A good example of authorship is Weejee whom I regard as one of the greatest photographers. He was an out and out news photographer. He worked primarily at night with a very large format camera which is very unwieldy and he worked only in New York."" Arthur Fellig - nicknamed Weejee, the phonetic of Ouija board due to his seemingly supernatural radar for unfolding human drama long before the emergency services got the call - is said to have been the inspiration behind the 2014 movie Nightcrawler starring Jake Gyllenhaal. ""What is extraordinary about him is that news photographers are usually geared only for content and therefore they produce powerful content but they don't usually produce powerful pictures as such,"" Hurn adds. ""Weejee had this extraordinary talent of combining incredibly powerful content with an enormous sense of design in extreme conditions. ""I feel very much the same about McCullin who was in very difficult situations like wars and managed to produce pictures which were much more than 'Gosh, he managed to push the button amidst all that going on; isn't he brave?' He had the ability to look and observe and press the button at just the right time in very stressful circumstances. The pictures are more than simply a record, they are deeply moving. That's authorship. And it's a very attractive thing."" In 1963 Hurn was given the ultimate stamp of cool when a film by Ken Russell about his life work entitled Watch the Birdie was broadcast by the BBC. It illustrates the versatility and diversity of Hurn's repertoire - a photo-journalist scaling a brick wall to escape a guard dog one minute, a meticulously-lit fashion spread for Harper's Bazaar the next. Then it cuts to him dropping in on Little Sisters of the Assumption in Notting Hill Gate to document their work tending to the sick and destitute before roaring off in his custom-built sports car to Joey the Soho stripper who performs 30 times a day, an example of his signature radical and ground-breaking (for the time) black and white photo essays on London's alternative lifestyles or subcultures, drugs, transvestism etc. Nuns nursing the elderly unable to find hospital beds,Notting Hill,1963 Strip club - thought to be the first of its kind - in Old Compton Street, 1963 ""That was thanks to the example of Elliot Erwitt I'd met a few years before and who was another big influence on my work,"" Hurn says. Erwitt, an American advertising and documentary photographer renowned for his quirky and immensely funny take on the absurdity and comedy of everyday life, is described as a master of Cartier-Bresson's so-called 'decisive moment' - that special moment that ""transcends the subject and place and can be looked at for years to come"" - to the layman it's identifying the exact split second to press the shutter. ""Meeting him was wonderful because he put into my head that you can actually do commercial photography as well as do the work you really want to do,"" Hurn adds. ""He worked in advertising but he never muddled that up with the fact that he carried a Leica camera with him at all times and shot his own pictures separately to the commercial work he was doing. Elliott Erwitt ""So thanks to him I never had this hang up about 'selling out' by doing commercial work. It's the practise of doing things to your best ability, regardless of what you're doing."" To supplement his income and free him up to work on his preferred documentary or 'eye witness' photography, Hurn accepted invitations to photograph the film sets of countless films - El Cid, Bond, Alfie - after being introduced to a Hollywood film agent Tom Carlile through his late friend Richard Johnson, the distinguished actor who turned down the role of James Bond. And on the subject of Bond, Hurn, who worked on the set of the first four 007 movies, shot the iconic film poster for From Russia With Love at his flat in Bayswater's Porchester Court, a creative hub and landmark destination for photographers the world over during the 60s. An entourage including Hollywood producer Cubby Broccoli, descended along with Sean Connery. But there was one problem. ""The film's publicist came up to me and said 'I don't know what we're going to do. I've forgotten the gun'. To drive back out to the film studios would have taken hours. It happened that I enjoyed target shooting with an air pistol. It was a Walther and had a beautiful box with Walther written on the outside of it. Bond's pistol was a Walther PPK. Movie publicist Tom Carlile in Hurn's studio on a Bond shoot. He would later hire Hurn for Barbarella ""I said 'Look, although it's an air pistol and has this great, big long barrel and Bond's has a small barrel, nobody here will know. The mere fact it's got Walther on the box they'll think it's the right one'. ""I said all you've got to do is make sure when they come to do the poster that the long barrel is cut off and it will be ok. But when it came to do the poster art they forgot. So if you look at any of those Bond posters, there's Mr Macho brandishing his air pistol."" Soon after Hurn was introduced to the Beatles film director Dick Lester who asked him to follow the group around for the six weeks of filming for their first film A Hard Day's Night. He liked Ringo Starr the best but it was the ""exceedingly shy"" George Harrison that Hurn would have the biggest impact on by introducing him to his future wife. One of George Harrison's first encounters with Pattie Boyd Hurn's friend, fellow photographer Eric Swayne was dating Pattie Boyd at the time. Swayne was keen to meet the Beatles and Hurn somehow persuaded Dick Lester to allow them onto the set and Pattie became a film extra. Harrison, who would later write the love song Something about her, was transfixed. ""I introduced her to them all,"" Hurn says. ""I had no idea that the one had goggled at her more than the others. Of course, I wasn't the greatest friend of dear Eric Swayne from then."" A Hard Day's Night had cemented the Fab Four's place at the forefront of the British Invasion - the storming popularity of British music and culture into the US. Director Dick Lester giving direction Hurn, who became an associate member of Magnum a year later in 1965, had played his part in that but it was two years later in 1967 in an altogether more cosmic invasion that he was to become better known. The New York Times described Jane Fonda as the leading lady in the cult sci-fi movie Barbarella as ""the most iconic sex goddess of the 60s"". But that might never have been the case had it not been for Hurn. The young Fonda, insecure about her looks and who hated being photographed, was giving film producer Dino de Laurentiis  a tough time over the publicity stills and had rejected them out of hand. ""The publicist Tom Carlile phoned me up and explained what was going on,"" Hurn says. ""He said 'Look David, come over to Italy and see if you can sort it out for me and try and calm her down'. ""The moment we met we got on extremely well. She said she felt her face was lop-sided 'like a squirrel with one cheek full of nuts'. I managed to make her laugh and somehow won her confidence. ""We became very good friends and I ended up spending nine months with her and her then husband Roger Vadim on the set and at their home. She's still a friend. We met up in LA a few months ago."" The Barbarella images graced the covers of 126 magazines around the world. Newsweek reportedly achieved both its greatest news-stand sales and its highest number of subscriber cancellations when it published pictures of a naked Fonda on its cover under the headlines Anything Goes, The Permissive Society. By this stage Hurn's hero and inspiration Henri Cartier-Bresson had actually visited his famous flat to personally examine his contact sheets shortly before he was voted in as a full member of Magnum in 1968. ""It was like seeing God,"" he says. Hurn's then wife, model and actress Alita Naughton with their daughter Sian Hurn led a rarefied life; an internationally-successful career, a beautiful wife, accomplished and celebrated friends, and an Aston Martin parked outside the front door. The dyslexic schoolboy from Cardiff had done pretty well for himself. But just over a year after Barbarella hit the screens, Hurn had left London, his marriage had broken down and he was living in a VW camper van on the banks of the river Severn near Newport, south Wales. The lure of Hollywood celebrity and expensive London life-style had begun to fade some four years before. Two surviving children survey the rescue operation in Aberfan, October 1966, Hurn One of the first photographers on the scene of the 1966 Aberfan disaster when 116 children and 28 adults died after a coal waste tip collapsed and crashed down a mountain burying the village school, Hurn was deeply affected by the experience. ""I hadn't lived in Wales since 1941,"" Hurn says. ""My dad was in the army so we had moved around the UK. But my entire family was still in Cardiff. ""Aberfan had a profound effect on me because of how obscene it was. But it also vividly brought home to me the idea of Wales. Why did I still think of it as home? That fascinated me. One of Hurn's earliest photo - dreaming of being a mum, 1958 ""The reality came in 1970 that I really didn't want to continue doing the stuff I'd be doing anymore; I guess I wanted a simpler life,"" Hurn says. With characteristic curiosity, he drove to Wales to explore the concept of culture and home for a new book. It was the beginning of an extensive, life-long body of work, books and exhibitions on his homeland, documenting its people, landscape and the massive upheaval of a nation as the pillars of industry which had shored up its economy for so long continued to crumble. Pit pony handlers' rest room, Neath Valley, 1993, Hurn As he traversed the country documenting every day Welsh life, once again, a chance meeting was to change his fate. Wandering around the countryside with his dogs and camera, Hurn met and struck up a conversation with a local college administrator. Chatting about photography Hurn was asked if photography was something which could be taught. Hurn's Rollerblading, Venice Beach, 1980 Hurn's curiosity kicked in - what did all the most successful photographers have in common? Hurn teaching at Newport in 1975 ""I saw a pattern in how all the most respected photographers approached their work,"" Hurn said, ""and I believed that these basic principles could be passed onto aspiring youngsters."" Hurn's interest was encouraged and he set up the School of Documentary Photography at the Newport College of Art. It would become one of the most sought after courses in the UK and beyond. Jnr Wales ballroom dance championships, Bargoed 1973, Hurn The course was run with Hurn's characteristic pragmatic approach. There was to be no philosophical navel-gazing about 'truth' or the 'theory of light', it was about being on time, wearing good shoes - ""If you're walking around for hours taking pictures, you need them"" - analysing the contact sheets of successful photographers - ""It's the best way to see how they think"" - and, most importantly of all, getting a job. ""It was unbelievable,"" Hurn says. ""We used to have about 700 applicants for 15 to 20 places. Round-up of the last wild horses in Arizona desert, 1980, Hurn Photography students wearing David Hurn masks at a college party But after 17 years of running the course which had built up a world-class reputation, Hurn walked out the door the day he was told the course was going to become a degree. ""The driving force for me was to bring in people who I thought could get a job and we deliberately kept the qualification at a lower level, a college diploma,"" he says. ""The second it became a degree course, there were all these rules about how much academic theory there had to be and this, that and the other. Absolutely fine; I'm not against people doing that, I simply said it had nothing to do with what I wanted, which was to get people jobs."" First, second and third in Miss Rosebud of Rhyl, 1972, Hurn Now, after 30 years of a ""frugal, very simple lifestyle"" plying his trade, Hurn, credited by some as one of the most influential figures in photography education, is returning to that theme once again. And curiously his renewed interest has been sparked by the phenomenon of the selfie. ""What's happening now is suddenly for the first time ever you have something which virtually everyone in the world loves - photography,"" Hurn says. ""Nearly everyone's got the equivalent of an iPhone and they all take pictures. Tenby, 1974 - feeding the seagulls, Hurn ""The only slight problem about this is the instinct of most people seems to be to take pictures of themselves or their friends and nothing outside of that. By far the most interesting aspect of the selfie is that everyone does it. ""The point of the selfie is immediate and only of interest for seconds so most of the interest seems to me as someone who doesn't do it, to be the fun act of doing it, usually with friends. Hurn's first selfie taken earlier this week at his home in Tintern, Monmouthshire ""I was listening to a radio programme which talked about the top 20 words that we use. Towards the end it said what's interesting is that two words - 'I' and 'myself' - had come into the list for the first time. I thought boy, that's interesting because it really fits in with today's culture. Sheep sheltering from the rain on the military artillery range,  Mynydd Epynt,1973 ""But I find that puzzling because rarely in the things that I think have been worthwhile in my life have the people involved been particularly interested in themselves. ""I find myself having to be very careful that I don't sound like my dad and therefore I retreat and simply say I don't find it interesting, I'm not condemning it in any way. It could be incredibly positive but I don't understand it as I find it very repetitious. ""But I would argue that with the selfie you have a captive audience in that they're interested in photography. Toys retrieved from Penparc refuse site 1990, Hurn ""I'm really interested in getting people to expand from just taking pictures of themselves; to see if they find photography interesting if for no other reason than there are jobs out there. There aren't jobs in taking pictures of yourself and your friends but there are jobs in taking pictures of other things. ""There are jobs in science and health. Anyone who's had a major operation, their life has been saved by a camera going down their throat or up their backside. The most important picture taken during his life, says Hurn. The colon cancer he made a full recovery from in 2001 ""I'd like to say to teenagers as I strongly suspect they're not told this in school, 'Do you realise that being a wedding photographer is a good profession', radiographers are needed, estate agent photographers and so on. These are honourable jobs which are probably more fun than stacking shelves in Tesco. Pub sing-song in Sennybridge, near Brecon, 1971 ""The idea that there's no future in taking pictures is nonsensical. If you go to Smiths in Paddington station there's 3,000 magazines for sale and they've all got pictures in them, they're on websites. ""Everybody's floundering a little bit as to how to make any money from it but those sorts of problems will be solved, clever people will find ways. Pictures are going to be needed there and the skills are still going to be the same."" Hurn is now passionate about the possibility of inspiring young minds with photography beyond their social media profiles. Mother kisses daughter in incubator, Arizona, 1980, Hurn. And so, coming back full circle to where his life began as a child visiting the museum in Cardiff, Hurn is drawing up workshops to engage some of the 34,000 school pupils who annually pass through its doors. His premise is simple: arrange competitions whereby children/teenagers select their favourite shot from a collection of six by well-known photographers and use smartphones to see how they might replicate that photographic style while taking pictures of their everyday lives. After all Henri Cartier-Bresson, the man whose work so moved Hurn all those years ago, once said: ""In photography the smallest thing can be a great subject. The little human detail can become a leitmotif."" Retired gentleman at MG Car owners ball, Edinburgh, 1967, Hurn His seemingly prosaic shot of a Russian soldier buying his wife a hat undoubtedly became the leitmotif, an object, an idea which has repeatedly reoccurred, throughout Hurn's life. It is a measure of the force of the medium of photography that a picture that probably took a 60th of a second to shoot continues to fuel the life of another man 62 years on. In the years to come maybe that same force will hit some young, floundering mind which happens upon an image of David Hurn's and, just like that moment in Sandhurst in 1955, an unexpectedly powerful response to a simple black and white record of a moment in time in a stranger's life will have altered their own in an instant.

" A secret network of wildlife traffickers selling baby chimpanzees has been exposed by a year-long BBC News investigation. The tiny animals are seized from the wild and sold as pets. The BBC’s research uncovered a notorious West African hub for wildlife trafficking, known as the “blue room”, and led to the rescue of a one-year-old chimp. In a dusty back street of Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s largest city, a tiny chimpanzee cries out for comfort. His black hair is ruffled and his dirty nappy scrapes the concrete floor as he crawls towards the familiar figures of the men who have been holding him captive. The baby chimp, ripped away from his family in the wild, is the victim of a lucrative and brutal smuggling operation, exposed by a 12-month-long BBC News investigation spanning half a dozen countries. In demand as pets in wealthy homes or as performers in commercial zoos, baby chimpanzees command a price tag of $12,500, a little under £10,000, but sometimes more. Each capture of a live infant like this one exacts a terrible cost on chimp populations. The usual tactic used by poachers is to shoot as many of the adults in a family as possible. This prevents them from resisting the capture of the baby and their bodies can then be sold as bushmeat. To obtain one infant alive, up to 10 adults are typically slaughtered. “One has to kill the mother, one has to kill the father,” explained Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, an expert in wildlife crime with Ivory Coast Police. “If our ancestors had killed them, nowadays we wouldn't even know about chimpanzees.” Once captured, these baby chimps then enter a sophisticated chain that stretches from the poachers in the jungles to middlemen, who arrange false export permits and transport, and ultimately to the buyers. The animals are in high demand in the Gulf states, south-east Asia and China, with buyers prepared to pay high prices and additional fees to help bypass international controls. And while they may be well looked-after while they are young, chimpanzees soon become too strong and potentially violent to be kept in a home. Karl Ammann, a Swiss wildlife activist who campaigns against chimp trafficking, describes it as a “kind of slavery” and warns that when chimps cease being cute infants, they face a terrible fate. “They still have 90% of their life ahead of them,” he said. “They get locked in some cage and maybe even killed in some cases because they have outlived their useful pet stage. That for me is just impossible to accept.” The baby chimp discovered by the BBC had been bought from a poacher, according to one account, for 300 Euros (£257). But it was rescued en route as a result of our research - leading Interpol officials and Ivorian detectives to expose a major trafficking ring. After months of work building relationships with dealers across a number of countries, our team tracked down the smuggling ringleaders to a house in Abidjan. Posing as prospective buyers, undercover reporters confirmed the infant chimp was at the property before alerting Interpol and local police who were waiting nearby. During the police operation, a small room about the size of a shower cubicle was discovered, decorated with small blue tiles. Inside it, they found a tiny chimp cowering in a wooden crate. The discovery was not only a moment of liberation for the little animal, but also a crucial turning point in a long search by wildlife campaigners to track down a notorious “blue room”, known to be used as a holding pen by traffickers and constantly restocked. For years, when dealers had circulated videos showing captive baby chimpanzees ready for sale, the same distinctive blue tiles were visible. Understood to be in West Africa, no-one knew which country it might be in, let alone which city, until our research led police to it. This revelation provides new insight into the potential scale of loss suffered by great apes, including chimpanzees. An estimated 3,000great apes, including orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees, are lost from the wild every yearas a result of illegal trade, according to the UN Environment Programme. They are either sold, killed during the hunt or die in captivity. About two thirds of the apes lost are chimpanzees - an endangered species. Western chimpanzees, like the one freed in Abidjan, are judged to be especially vulnerable, so are categorised as critically endangered. There are no more than 65,000 left and probably far fewer. Some1,800 apes were seized by authorities in 23 countries while being traffickedbetween 2005 and 2011, according to the Great Ape Survival Partnership, an alliance of more than 100 governments and other organisations. A quarter of those apes rescued were chimps. Although it is unknown how many smuggled apes reach their destinations undetected, the BBC’s investigation suggests the total is almost certain to be higher than previously thought. The illegal trade in great apes is made possible by the determination of the smugglers and the ease with which international laws on buying and selling endangered species can be evaded. Trading of endangered wild animals and plants is tightly controlled under the Cites agreement - theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora- which aims to protect all wildlife under threat. Under the convention, chimpanzees, which are awarded the highest level of protection (a listing under what is known as Appendix 1), can only be exported under a very limited number of exemptions. For example, the animals need to have been bred in captivity (which is not known to happen in West Africa) and exporting and importing organisations need to be registered with Cites. Despite this, the BBC’s investigation revealed that with the right money and the right connections the smuggling networks can evade these controls. In fact, our team was able to buy two permits to export chimps for $4,000 each. Posing as buyers for a client in Thailand, the team obtained their first permit in the Egyptian capital Cairo, which has long been known as a centre for animal trafficking. Our undercover reporter began negotiations over a secure messaging service with two pet traders, Mahmoud Khaled and Ramadan Abdelnaiem. The pair shared videos of infant chimps held inside the infamous blue-tiled room and offered to secure Cites permits allowing the animals to be exported. Khaled even promised to provide video footage of the chimp’s progress en route to its destination. “When [the] thing is shipped and put in boxes, you will receive a video,” he said. “When it goes to the airport, you receive a video, when it lands at the airport, you will receive a video. [When] it is shipped, you will receive a video. When it is put in the airplane, you receive a video...” While Khaled offered to obtain a Cites Appendix 1 permit, enabling the export of chimps, Ramadan suggested an alternative technique: getting permits for less endangered animals and then hiding the chimps among them. Both these methods are recognised by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime as “wildlife laundering”, when smugglers use fraudulent paperwork or mix protected species with legal shipments of wildlife. A video sent to the BBC’s undercover team by a dealer in West Africa shows how chimps and other endangered animals are smuggled in secret compartments in specially-designed crates. Here, this baby chimpanzee was hidden below animals including parrots, civet cats and mongoose which have less protection in international law. The shipment was made from West Africa and destined for Nepal. The chimp shown in this video, however, never made it. Messages found on the dealer’s mobile phone revealed that the chimpanzee had died, still hidden in the crate in transit at Istanbul airport. The BBC undercover team accepted Khaled’s offer and picked up the Appendix 1 permit two weeks later. Clumsily filled-in, with spelling mistakes and other inaccuracies, it appeared to be signed and stamped by a Jordanian government official. It showed our fake address and a simple internet search would have revealed it was not a Cites-registered institution. The next step was to see if we could arrange to buy the chimps, but at this point Khaled, called the deal off, afraid of being exposed. With the Egyptian deal fallen through, the team decided to deal directly with the source of the chimpanzees in West Africa. This time pretending to be an Indonesian pet shop acting for wealthy clients, our team made contact with a young dealer in Guinea called Ibrahima Traore. Again communicating over a secure messaging service, the team built up a relationship with Traore, aged just 22, who began to send us videos of chimpanzees -  once more in the setting of the blue room. It became clear that the room was being constantly re-stocked. Traore said he could sell us one or two baby chimps as well as a Cites permit. This time, the document the BBC team received looked genuine, though it was falsely filled in, and was signed and stamped by the national parks of Liberia. As the relationship with Traore developed, he began to reveal the scale of his illegal operation. He said he held chimpanzees at farms in Guinea, his home country, as well as in Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ivory Coast. In a conversation filmed secretly, Traore boasted of being able to circumvent international controls and having “someone important on the inside”. “I’m not afraid - you can import everywhere you want - send everywhere you want,” he said. Traore also told of how he shipped chimpanzees without any Cites documentation at all - by hiding them amongst other less-protected animals. One of his videos demonstrated how to smuggle chimps in secret compartments. Confronted with the BBC’s evidence, the secretary-general of Cites, John Scanlon, said that while he wasn’t shocked by the ease with which fraudulent permits for the export of baby chimps were purchased, he was “dismayed”. Although he believed the permit system was “sound and secure” overall, he said there were instances, particularly in West and Central Africa, where there was “an abuse of permits”. “There is corruption in the system,” he told the BBC. “We’ve brought it to the attention of our governments at a standing committee meeting several months ago. We said if we can’t get a handle on corruption, we are not going to stop illegal trade in wildlife.” For this reason, Cites was pushing to introduce an electronic system of permissions that would be harder to fake, he explained. “These things are not easy, but we are onto it, we are seeing it and we are doing our best.” But, despite this, Mr Scanlon said he did not believe there was a surge in the illegal trade in great apes, including chimpanzees. “If we did, I can assure you there would be a rush of attention to this issue and a rush of resources to stop it, but we are not seeing it,” he said. He stressed that wherever the abuse of permits was observed, the governments of those countries implicated were warned and punished. There were about 30 trade suspensions currently in place, he confirmed. Law enforcement efforts, however, appear to lag far behind the rates of illegal trade. Just 27 arrests were made in Africa and Asia in connection with the great ape trade between 2005 and 2011, and one-quarter of the arrests never led to prosecutions prosecuted, according to the UN Environment Programme. At Interpol, which facilitates international law enforcement cooperation, wildlife smuggling is a priority, but national governments have stipulated that the funding and investigative effort should be focused on the highest-profile threats, such as the slaughter of elephants and rhinos. David Higgins, manager of Interpol’s Environmental Security Unit, admitted the region of West Africa had not been a priority - and nor had the smuggling of great apes. Because such crimes did not threaten the economic well-being of a country, or its political stability, they did not compel governments to respond, he said, and the resources were simply not there. “Without the funding, we can’t do anything,” he said. “So with primates, unfortunately, our information is not as strong as it could be.” He urged states to step up and offer the required financial investment. “Yes, we need the global community’s attention on this and we call upon that level of support.” Back in Ivory Coast, it was the trafficking ringleader, Ibrahima Traore, who eventually led our reporters - and Interpol - to the blue room. He sent a video of the baby chimp and himself inside the room holding a piece of paper showing the date at the time of the deal - to show that the footage was genuine and that the animal had previously been captured and was ready for sale. His face was clearly visible and he seemed not to worry about incriminating himself. Days later our undercover reporter visited the property - purportedly to discuss arrangements for buying the chimpanzee - where they confirmed its presence and tipped off police. Ibrahima Traore was arrested and, along with his uncle Mohamed, is facing charges related to wildlife trafficking. The data captured from his phones and laptops revealed a goldmine of information about a sprawling international network of great ape traffickers, working across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Cites certificates found on Traore’s computer documented the possible illegal movement of dozens of different species of primates, as well as other endangered species. The evidence also implicated Traore’s brother, Aboubacar, who was named in a Cites document last year because of his smuggling of endangered birds including African grey parrots. Ibrahima Traore’s father, Alhassane, also appeared to be involved. Records showed his bank account in Guinea’s capital Conakry was used to deposit payments – and it was that account that the BBC team was told to use. The detective in charge in Ivory Coast, Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, pledged to delve into the entire illegal supply chain - from the hunters to the traffickers to the buyers. “In 10 years, in 20 years, we won’t have any more chimpanzees,” he warned. “This species will disappear. That’s the reason why this cause was taken up by Interpol. Personally I am committed to fight against this phenomenon. “These are rare species and it should not be us, in our generation, that wipes them out.” As for the baby male chimp discovered in the blue room, he was initially taken to the Interpol building in Abidjan, before being handed over to wildlife officials from the Ministry of Water and Forests. They took him to the zoo in Abidjan, where he was fed and comforted and given a name by keepers: Nemley junior. He was then shown an older female who acts as an adoptive mother to two other infant chimps. After being gradually introduced to this new family, Nemley junior may live with them. But caring for an infant chimp is a long-term and costly commitment so two wildlife organisations with experience of infant chimpanzees have offered him homes in specialists sanctuaries, including the Born Free Foundation. Will Travers, president of Born Free, described the exotic pet trade as “sickening and cruel” and promised to help relocate the baby chimp. “If given the opportunity, we will do all we can, with the help of our specialists and the full participation of the local government agencies, to try and relocate Nemley junior to a registered chimpanzee sanctuary, where this little victim of the illegal wildlife trade can be given a life worth living, in the company of other chimps, for the rest of his life.” But whatever happens next, the orphan has certainly been left traumatised, according to Dr Cleve Hicks of the University of Warsaw, a specialist in chimp behaviour who set up a chimp sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Mainly they have a broken heart - they’ve seen their mothers die,” he said. Dan Bucknall, of the wildlife charity Tusk, agreed that recovery could be “very difficult with such clever sentient animals” but added that chimpanzees were resilient creatures. “In the right hands, with good carers, and with constant attention, they can do OK and the prospects are good.”",Negative,2.198496e-06

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the fire was the deadliest in the city for at least 25 years. The victims include a one-year-old child, he added. The cause of the fire, on Prospect Avenue, near Fordham University and the Bronx Zoo, is not yet clear. More than 160 firefighters helped bring the blaze under control. In a statement, the New York Police Department said a boy and three girls, aged one, two and seven, had died.

"Margaret Thatcher clashed with John Major over his handling of the economy, just weeks after she resigned as prime minister, government files reveal. The National Archives' document shows the pair had a heated discussion in January 1991. Mrs Thatcher warned her successor as PM that he was on the verge of making an ""historic error"" about interest rates. She was also angry about his plans to abandon one of her signature policies, the poll tax. Mrs Thatcher, who was Conservative prime minister between 1979 and 1990, had previously made clear Mr Major, who went on to serve as prime minister until 1997, was her chosen successor. However, as time went on, and Mr Major spoke of his desire for ""compassionate"" Conservatism, she became suspicious that he intended to pursue his own course. Mr Major wrote to Mrs Thatcher on Boxing Day 1990 and invited her to a meeting where they might air - and resolve - their differences. During the meeting, which took place in Mr Major's room in the House of Commons on 3 January 1991, Mrs Thatcher warned that ""excessively high"" interest rates risked pushing the UK's economy into recession. She compared the position to Winston Churchill's decision as chancellor in 1925 to fix the parity of the pound at a high level. This led to deflation, mass unemployment and the General Strike. Thatcher's poll tax miscalculation Birmingham Six prison letter revealed Thatcher refused to share flight with panda ""Mrs Thatcher said conditions on the economy were very tough indeed,"" the official minute of the meeting said. ""She believed that there was a danger of repeating Winston Churchill's historic error."" Mr Major retorted that the situation in 1991 ""was not remotely comparable"". The government files have been released by the National Archives But in September 1992, his government unsuccessfully prevented a devaluation of the pound and the currency was forced out of the European Exchange Rate mechanism (ERM) - a system for tying the pound and other currencies' values to that of the German mark. It was a day that famously became known as Black Wednesday and was one of the low points of the premiership of Mr Major, who had been re-elected the previous April. John Major rushed out news that the Queen had agreed to pay income tax, in an attempt to deflect media criticism in 1992, the files reveal In the 1991 meeting, Mrs Thatcher made her views clear on Mr Major's decision to scrap the poll tax (officially known as the community charge), a policy that had  triggered civil disobedience and riots, as well as a rebellion in the Conservative Party. ""Local authorities would draw the conclusion that it was such a bad tax they could put it up as much as they liked and blame the government,"" she said. The National Archives in Kew, London, holds more than 11 million official documents, which are often opened as public records after 30 years. The government is reducing this timeframe to 20 years. Other documents released by the National Archives reveal that: Margaret Thatcher oncerefused to share a flight to Washington with London Zoo's male panda She was warned against inviting former US president Richard Nixon to Downing Street in 1980 - six years after Mr Nixon's resignation over the Watergate scandal John Major rushed out news that the Queen had agreed to pay income tax, in an attempt to deflect media criticism during her ""annus horribilis"" in 1992 European officials considered plans to write off billions of dollars of Soviet debt in return for nuclear disarmament One of six men wrongly convicted of the Birmingham pub bombingsbranded the British legal system as unable ""to spell the word justice"" Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was reported to be working on a peace plan in 1987 But there are some files that have been held back from public release, including one file covering the creation of the euro. About 100 documents remain unpublished, including files that cover the marriages of the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, the Lockerbie bombing, the Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry, and the basing of US cruise missiles in the UK. The Cabinet Office said the files were held back to safeguard national security and protect the privacy of people who are still alive.

"This video can not be played Blood and bullet holes mark the scene of the church attack Nine people have been killed in two attacks on Coptic Christians in Helwan district, south of Cairo, Egypt's interior ministry has said. Six civilians and a policeman died when a gunman tried to storm a church but was intercepted and arrested, it said. It said the man had previously attacked a Coptic-owned shop in the same area, killing two brothers. The so-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed its ""soldiers"" carried out the church attack. The interior ministry's account differs from an earlier version of events given by Egypt's health ministry. The initial report said 12 were dead, and suggested there were two attackers. It said one had been killed, and the other fled but was later captured. More than 100 Christians have been killed in Egypt in the past year, with most attacks claimed by the local branch of IS militants. Egyptian Christians living in fear for the future Egypt country profile Security forces have reinforced checkpoints in place around the capital in response to the attacks. They announced plans earlier this week to protect festivities around the New Year and, on 7 January, Coptic Christmas. They include the deployment of rapid-reaction forces, combat troops and jamming equipment. According to the interior ministry statement, the first attack on Friday took place at a household appliances shop. Then the attacker headed to the Saint Mina Coptic church, where he attempted ""to trespass the church's perimeter security"". ""The security forces have dealt with the attacker and managed to arrest him after he was injured,"" the ministry said. Security forces are on guard around the capital But it said that seven people, including an auxiliary policeman, had been killed and four injured as the gunman opened fire at the church. The attacker also had an explosive device, a machine gun and 150 rounds, it added. The ministry suggested he was known to security services, saying he was ""one of the most active terrorist elements and he carried out several terrorist attacks which resulted in the martyrdom of a number of policemen and civilians"". However, the interior ministry account contradicts earlier ones from officials and witnesses, who spoke of a higher death toll and more than one attacker. Video footage has also emerged appearing to show one gunman lying dead at the scene and another alleged attacker fleeing in a red car. In the wake of Friday's attacks, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi offered condolences to family members and vowed to continue ""cleansing the country of terrorism and extremism"". Egypt's Copts have in the past accused the authorities of making only token gestures to protect them and these incidents will not help calm tensions, our correspondent Radwa Gamal says. Egypt's Coptic Christians have long felt under attack Egypt is a Muslim-majority country and its Christian minority - mostly members of the Coptic Orthodox Church - make up around 10% of the population. Last Easter, on Palm Sunday, at least 45 people died in twin attacks on Coptic churches in Alexandria and the Nile Delta city of Tanta. At least 29 Copts were killed on a bus en route to a monastery in central Egypt in May, and a Coptic Orthodox priest was stabbed to death in Cairo in October. The attacks have been blamed on, and in many cases claimed by, Islamists affiliated with IS.

"The case relates to Mr Zuma's use of state funds to upgrade his private home South Africa's top court has found that parliament failed to comply with its duties in holding President Jacob Zuma accountable over a public funding case. The ruling said parliament must now set out rules for impeachment proceedings, but it remains unclear whether this will lead to any impeachment. The court was hearing a case brought by opposition groups who wanted parliament to be compelled to begin impeachment. It relates to Mr Zuma's use of state funds to upgrade his private home. Will Zuma be ousted as president?,external The trials of Jacob Zuma The Gupta scandal explained Handing down the Constitutional Court ruling, Judge Chris Jafta said: ""We conclude that the assembly did not hold the president to account.

This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes The court ruling was by majority. Dissenting Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said the ruling was a clear case of ""judicial overreach"". Some $15m (Â£11.1m) in state money was spent upgrading Mr Zuma's home. In March 2016, the court ruled he had ignored a watchdog's findings and said he must pay some of the money back. The president has reimbursed $631,000, deemed by the Treasury to be ""reasonable"". Parliament then debated the matter and he survived a no-confidence vote, but Friday's court ruling said that the procedures it followed were insufficient. Mr Zuma has been weakened by a number of corruption allegations and by his recent replacement by Cyril Ramaphosa as head of the ruling ANC.

"The company has announced a range of measures to ""regain the trust"" of customers Apple has apologised after facing criticism for admitting it deliberately slows down some ageing iPhone models. The company now says it will replace batteries for less and will issue software in 2018 so customers can monitor their phone's battery health. Some customers had long suspected the company slowed older iPhones to encourage customers to upgrade. Apple admitted slowing some phones with ageing batteries but said it was to ""prolong the life"" of the devices. In a statement posted on its website,external, the firm said it would reduce the price of an out-of-warranty battery replacement from $79 to $29 in the US for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later. In the UK the prices will drop from Â£79 to Â£25. Is Apple getting sloppy? The biggest tech stories of 2017 Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed It said it was pushing ahead with measures to ""address customers' concerns, to recognise their loyalty and to regain the trust of anyone who may have doubted Apple's intentions"". ""At Apple, our customers' trust means everything to us. We will never stop working to earn and maintain it. We are able to do the work we love only because of your faith and support - and we will never forget that or take it for granted,"" it said. The firm has had eight separate lawsuits in the US filed against it over the matter, and had also been facing additional legal action in Israel and France. Apple acknowledged earlier this monththat it does deliberately slow down some models of the iPhone as they age. Apple says it will issue a software update to give users more information about battery health It said it had made changes to the iOS operating system to manage ageing lithium-ion batteries in some devices, because the batteries' performance diminishes over time. ""Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, [when they] have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,"" the company said. It also emerged on Thursday that the tech giant's chief executiveTim Cook had been ordered by the firm to only use private jets for both business and personal transport for security reasons. In November,Apple was forced to release an update to fix a security issue with its Mac operating systemthat made it possible to gain entry to a device and administrative powers without a password.

Over the same period, 60,000 people looked at its web pages for advice on how to cancel membership. However, the number of unhappy customers in 2017 was in line with previous years. Among the typical complaints were: gyms being closed for long periods of time classes being shorter than advertised poor quality facilities people being held in a contract unfairly ""At this time of year we're bombarded with offers for health and fitness memberships, which can ask for a lot of money or commitment up front,"" said Kate Hobson, consumer expert at Citizens Advice.

"Chia Chia (left) had to find another flight from London to Washington to make its date with Ching Ching Margaret Thatcher once refused to share a flight to Washington with London Zoo's giant panda, newly-released National Archives' files have revealed. Lord Zuckerman, president of the London Zoological Society, suggested that Chia Chia the panda could share the prime minister's Concorde flight in 1981. Washington's Smithsonian Institution had asked to borrow Chia Chia, to mate it with US-based Ching Ching. But Mrs Thatcher said pandas were not ""happy omens"" for politicians. Cabinet secretary Sir Robert Armstrong wrote: ""Lord Zuckerman sees this as a signal demonstration of the special relationship and would be very happy to time the announcement of the loan or the delivery of the panda in any way that the prime minister thought would be most likely to benefit Anglo-American relations. ""He even suggested that the prime minister might like to take the panda in the back of her Concorde, when she goes to Washington next month."" How Thatcher was briefed on Sex Pistols Thatcher considered suing BBC Today show Thatcher and Major clashed over economy But Mrs Thatcher's  private secretary, Clive Whitmore replied: ""She has commented that she is not taking a panda with her - 'Pandas and politicians are not happy omens!""' The file also showed Mrs Thatcher's initial response. On a briefing note about the idea, she had written in blue felt tip pen: ""I am not taking a panda with me"". To emphasise her point she underlined the word ""not"" twice and also underlined the word ""me"". She then added: ""Lord Z knows more about pandas than I do - I am sure he can arrange these things.""

The Falkholt family were returning from Christmas celebrations when their vehicle was hit by an oncoming car, local media reported. The driver of the other car, Craig Anthony Whitall, 50, died at the scene along with Lars Falkholt, 69 and Vivian Falkholt, 60. Falkholt played the feisty character of Hope Morrison on Home and Away Jessica Falkholt's stint as Hope on the long-running Home and Away series came to an end in November 2016. The character had first appeared when she and Raffy Morrison arrived in Summer Bay. Hope briefly worked at the garage, but ran away after stealing money from there and from Salt restaurant. It emerged that her young sister Raffy - actually her cousin - was a sibling of the Morgans, so Raffy stayed in the Bay with them when Hope was jailed for her crimes. Falkholt stars in the US film Harmony, set for release next year. The film's production team previously said they were ""in complete shock over this tragedy"".

"This video can not be played Sophie Smith: Father appeals for missing student to come home The coastguard is searching the shoreline for a missing student who has not been seen since Boxing Day. Sophie Smith, 21, left her home in Gorleston, Norfolk, dressed in shorts and a vest top at 03:00 GMT. A police helicopter is scouring the coastline and officers believe the most likely scenario is that Ms Smith entered the sea at Gorleston. Norfolk Police have sought expert analysis of tidal movement to help direct the searches. Ms Smith went missing in the early hours of Boxing Day Insp Will Drummond said: ""Sophie had been receiving treatment for depression and anxiety. ""Our enquiries have revealed there's been a degree of pre-planning to her disappearance and this, combined with her mental state and comments made the previous day, suggest the most likely scenario is that she has gone into the sea. ""The sea searches will be carried out by the coastguard while the police helicopter is being deployed to conduct coastline searches. Based on tidal analysis, the searches will be carried out in targeted areas."" Ms Smith was seen on CCTV a short time after leaving her home heading towards the seafront. There have been no other confirmed sightings since then. Sophie Smith vanished from her home in Avondale Road, Gorleston, dressed in just a vest top and shorts Insp Drummond added: ""Local CCTV footage has been examined but unfortunately Sophie is not captured on any other cameras. ""She didn't take her mobile phone and hasn't accessed her bank accounts or social media accounts since leaving home. ""This is clearly a very distressing time for her family and we continue to keep them updated of ongoing work in this case."" Ms Smith is described as being white, about 5ft 8in (1.73m), of a slim build with shoulder length blonde hair. It is believed she was wearing a dark coloured vest top and light coloured shorts.

"Mr Trump has been spending Christmas at his Florida resort US President Donald Trump has said he believes he will be treated ""fairly"" by the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. There has been tension between the White House and the inquiry and Mr Trump has had to deny planning to fire lead investigator Robert Mueller. Mr Trump again denied there had been any collusion with Russian officials. He told the New York Times,externalhe did not know how long the inquiry would take, but it had made the US ""look very bad"". Speaking in an interview at his golf club in West Palm Beach in Florida, Mr Trump insisted he had the right to begin or end any justice department investigations. ""But for purposes of hopefully thinking I'm going to be treated fairly, I've stayed uninvolved with this particular matter,"" he said. Why attacks on Robert Mueller are mounting The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? 'Incorruptible' G-man stalks Trump presidency Mr Trump said of Mr Mueller, the special counsel: ""I think he's going to be fair."" The New York Times said that Mr Trump had denied 16 times during the interview that there had been any collusion with Russia. The former head of the FBI Robert Mueller has been heading the collusion inquiry US intelligence agencies believe Moscow tried to tip the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump - a charge denied by both Russia and the US president. Mr Trump has labelled Mr Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt""while other Republicans accuse it of bias. Mr Trump repeated his allegation that Democrats had invented the issue ""as a hoax, as a ruse, as an excuse for losing an election"". The president said he was not concerned about when the inquiry would finish as he had nothing to hide. But he said: ""It makes the country look very bad, and it puts the country in a very bad position. So the sooner it's worked out, the better it is for the country."" He was repeating his comments from May that the probe was ""hurting the US terribly"". Mr Trump said the matter had angered his supporters, adding: ""My base is stronger than it's ever been."" On other areas in the interview, Mr Trump: Again condemned Democrats for not taking a bipartisan approach to legislation Said he had to endorse the defeated candidate Roy Moore in the Alabama special election, as that was what the ""head of the Republican"" party had to do Again criticised Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia inquiry Said he believed the media would become more favourable to him as their ratings ""would go down the tubes"" if he were not in office 'Incorruptible' G-man stalks Trump presidency Row over Trump team email trove The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Trump's Russia stance 'puts US in peril' Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas?

"This video can not be played George Weah's supporters celebrate in Monrovia Former football star George Weah has been elected as Liberia's president. With nearly all ballots from Tuesday's run-off vote counted, Mr Weah is well ahead of opponent Joseph Boakai with more than 60% of the vote. As news of Mr Weah's victory emerged, his supporters began celebrating in the capital Monrovia. He will succeed Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female president, in Liberia's first democratic handover in decades. ""My fellow Liberians, I deeply feel the emotion of all the nation,"" Mr Weah wrote on Twitter,externalafter the results were announced. ""I measure the importance and the responsibility of the immense task which I embrace today. Change is on."" Mr Boakai has conceded victory and phoned Mr Weah to congratulate him. Mr Weah, who was raised in a slum in Liberia's capital Monrovia, starred at top-flight European football clubs Paris St-Germain (PSG) and AC Milan, before ending his career in England with brief stays at Chelsea and Manchester City. He is the only African footballer to have won both Fifa World Player of the Year and the prestigious Ballon D'Or. How a footballer became president When sports stars make a run at politics He entered politics after his retirement from the game in 2002 and is currently a senator in Liberia's parliament. His former club, PSG, congratulated him on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Liberia, founded by freed US slaves in the 19th Century, has not had a smooth transfer of power from one elected president to another since 1944. George Weah won the first round of the election - but not by enough to avoid a run-off vote Mrs Sirleaf defeated Mr Weah in the presidential election run-off in 2005 and took office a year later, after the end of a brutal civil war that saw President Charles Taylor forced out by rebels. Taylor is now serving a 50-year prison sentence in the UK for war crimes related to the conflict in neighbouring Sierra Leone. This time Mr Weah's campaign - under the Coalition for Democratic Change banner - appealed to the youth vote, while incumbent Vice-President Boakai was seen as old and out of touch. But Mr Weah's election is not without controversy, as his running mate was Jewel Taylor, former wife of the jailed president. At the scene: Umaru Fofana, BBC News, Monrovia Hundreds of jubilant supporters of George Weah took to the streets shortly after the electoral commission chairman announced the result. Election observers, both domestic and foreign, have praised the conduct of the election and say it showed a marked improvement from the first round in October. This is third time lucky for a man used to winning trophies but who found it hard to win this, the biggest award of his life. And he has his work cut out for him. Liberia has stabilised in the past decade after a long and bloody civil war. But it is still struggling with acute poverty and corruption. From producing Africa's first elected female president, now it has produced its first ex-footballer head of state. Mr Weah, 51, won the first round of the presidential election in October with 38.4% of the vote, compared with the 28.8% won by second-placed Mr Boakai, 73. The failure of any candidate to secure an outright majority forced the run-off. The National Elections Commission (NEC) said on Thursday that with 98.1% of the run-off vote counted, Mr Weah had won 61.5% of the vote while Mr Boakai was far behind with 38.5%. Turnout was low - put at 56% by election officials - for the vote, which had been delayed from its initial date, 7 November, following a legal challenge brought by a representative for the opposition Liberty Party, Charles Brumskine. Mr Brumskine said the first round vote - which he came third in - had been marred by ""massive fraud and irregularities"", but in December the Supreme Court ruled evidence of fraud was insufficient to merit a re-run of the opening round. Election observers have praised the conduct of the poll. More than two million people were eligible to cast their ballots in the nation of 4.6 million people.

"This video can not be played Eyewitnesses say they heard people screaming and saw others waiting to be rescued Four children were among 12 people killed in a fire at an apartment building in the Bronx borough of New York. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the fire was the deadliest in the city for at least 25 years. The victims include a one-year-old child, he added. The cause of the fire, on Prospect Avenue, near Fordham University and the Bronx Zoo, is not yet clear. More than 160 firefighters helped bring the blaze under control. In a statement, the New York Police Department said a boy and three girls, aged one, two and seven, had died. Officials said the first alarm sounded at the five-storey building at about 19:00 local time (00:00 GMT). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The fire started on the first floor and quickly spread. Television footage showed firefighters carrying people to safety from fire escapes. Residents who managed to escape huddled outside in bitterly cold conditions. The Red Cross handed out blankets to those on the street, as some residents fled the building without shoes or coats. New York City is experiencing a severe cold snap, and as temperatures dropped to around -10C (13F) the water from the firefighters' hoses could be seen turning to ice on the ground. Speaking at the scene, Mr De Blasio said a nearby school had been set up to shelter those evacuated from the building. ""We're here at the scene of an unspeakable tragedy,"" Mr De Blasio said. ""Tonight, here in the Bronx there are families that have been torn apart. This is the worst fire tragedy we have seen in this city in at least a quarter century. Based on the information we have now, this will rank as one as the worst losses of life to a fire in many, many years."" He said the fire service had managed to rescue at least 12 people from the building. Ladders were extended into the windows of the damaged building More than 160 firefighters attended the blaze on Prospect Avenue Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro, standing alongside the mayor, described the fire as a ""tragedy... without question historic in its magnitude"". ""People died on various floors of the apartment [block], ranging in age from one to over 50,"" he told reporters. ""In a department that is surely no stranger to tragedy, we're shocked by the lives lost."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Luz Hernandez told the New York Times that her fourth floor apartment had filled with thick smoke. She said she escaped through a fire escape with her husband and two sons as the smoke continued to rise around them. The building contains more than 20 flats and was built just over 100 years ago. The Associated Press said the fire was the deadliest in New York - excluding the 9/11 attacks - since 87 people died at a social club in the Bronx in 1990.

"The company has announced a range of measures to ""regain the trust"" of customers Apple has apologised after facing criticism for admitting it deliberately slows down some ageing iPhone models. The company now says it will replace batteries for less and will issue software in 2018 so customers can monitor their phone's battery health. Some customers had long suspected the company slowed older iPhones to encourage customers to upgrade. Apple admitted slowing some phones with ageing batteries but said it was to ""prolong the life"" of the devices. In a statement posted on its website,external, the firm said it would reduce the price of an out-of-warranty battery replacement from $79 to $29 in the US for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later. In the UK the prices will drop from Â£79 to Â£25. Is Apple getting sloppy? The biggest tech stories of 2017 Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed It said it was pushing ahead with measures to ""address customers' concerns, to recognise their loyalty and to regain the trust of anyone who may have doubted Apple's intentions"". ""At Apple, our customers' trust means everything to us. We will never stop working to earn and maintain it. We are able to do the work we love only because of your faith and support - and we will never forget that or take it for granted,"" it said. The firm has had eight separate lawsuits in the US filed against it over the matter, and had also been facing additional legal action in Israel and France. Apple acknowledged earlier this monththat it does deliberately slow down some models of the iPhone as they age. Apple says it will issue a software update to give users more information about battery health It said it had made changes to the iOS operating system to manage ageing lithium-ion batteries in some devices, because the batteries' performance diminishes over time. ""Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, [when they] have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,"" the company said. It also emerged on Thursday that the tech giant's chief executiveTim Cook had been ordered by the firm to only use private jets for both business and personal transport for security reasons. In November,Apple was forced to release an update to fix a security issue with its Mac operating systemthat made it possible to gain entry to a device and administrative powers without a password.

"The North desperately needs fuel imports but sanctions are biting hard US President Donald Trump has said he's ""very disappointed"" with China following a report that it had allowed oil to be shipped into North Korea. In a tweet, Mr Trump said China had been ""caught red-handed"". He said there could never be ""a friendly solution"" to the North Korea crisis if oil was allowed to be exported to Pyongyang. China earlier denied there had been any breaking of UN oil sanctions between China and North Korea. Last week,Beijing supported a US-drafted UN resolutionthat included measures to slash the North's petrol imports by up to 90%. Allow Twitter content?

China, North Korea's main trading partner, has repeatedly said it fully enforces all UN resolutions against Pyongyang.

"The Italian president's role is largely ceremonial Italy's President Sergio Mattarella has dissolved parliament, to pave the way for a general election on 4 March. The government met shortly after Mr Mattarella's decree was announced, and confirmed the election date. The ruling centre-left Democratic Party (PD) faces a strong challenge from anti-establishment Five Star (M5S) and right-wing Forza Italia, who want tough measures to curb immigration. The influx of migrants - mostly from sub-Saharan Africa - is a major issue. Paolo Gentiloni is the third prime minister to have served in the outgoing legislature, elected in 2013. Opinion polls suggest the main rivals - PD, M5S and Forza Italia - will split the vote, making an overall majority for any party unlikely. According to the polls, M5S has the most voter support - about 28%, ahead of PD on about 23% and Forza Italia, on about 16%, Reuters news agency reports. Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, despite a 2013 conviction for tax fraud, appears to be gaining ground as leader of Forza Italia, and the party is expected to form an election alliance with other right-wing parties. Mr Gentiloni told a news conference on Thursday that Italy ""has started moving again, we will continue to govern"". He said the PD would stay in office up until the election, and warned against ""any sharp or painful interruptions at a very delicate time for the Italian economy"". Italy's growth was picking up again, he said, with ""a million jobs restored, most of them long-term ones"". Mr Gentiloni also lamented his government's failure to pass a law - called ""ius soli"" (birthright citizenship) - that would make citizens of many of the 800,000 children born in Italy to foreign parents. Italy has had the largest influx of asylum seekers in the EU this year He stressed that it would not apply to the many Africans who have arrived by boat from North Africa in recent years. Citizenship could be granted to the children of parents with long-term residency, or those under 12 who complete at least five years of formal education. ""The truth is we didn't manage to put together sufficient numbers [in parliament] to approve the law,"" he said. The problem was not the law's contents, he said. Not enough senators attended the final session of the upper house - the Senate - to vote on the draft law. Opinion polls suggest that many Italians oppose the draft law on citizenship. This year Italy experienced the EU's biggest influx of migrants crossing the Mediterranean, most of them sent by people-smuggling gangs in Libya, packed aboard rickety boats. Data from the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) shows that 119,247 arrived in Italy by boat,external, while Greece - previously the EU's main immigration hotspot - took in 29,085. More than 3,000 drowned at sea. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Chia Chia (left) had to find another flight from London to Washington to make its date with Ching Ching Margaret Thatcher once refused to share a flight to Washington with London Zoo's giant panda, newly-released National Archives' files have revealed. Lord Zuckerman, president of the London Zoological Society, suggested that Chia Chia the panda could share the prime minister's Concorde flight in 1981. Washington's Smithsonian Institution had asked to borrow Chia Chia, to mate it with US-based Ching Ching. But Mrs Thatcher said pandas were not ""happy omens"" for politicians. Cabinet secretary Sir Robert Armstrong wrote: ""Lord Zuckerman sees this as a signal demonstration of the special relationship and would be very happy to time the announcement of the loan or the delivery of the panda in any way that the prime minister thought would be most likely to benefit Anglo-American relations. ""He even suggested that the prime minister might like to take the panda in the back of her Concorde, when she goes to Washington next month."" How Thatcher was briefed on Sex Pistols Thatcher considered suing BBC Today show Thatcher and Major clashed over economy But Mrs Thatcher's  private secretary, Clive Whitmore replied: ""She has commented that she is not taking a panda with her - 'Pandas and politicians are not happy omens!""' The file also showed Mrs Thatcher's initial response. On a briefing note about the idea, she had written in blue felt tip pen: ""I am not taking a panda with me"". To emphasise her point she underlined the word ""not"" twice and also underlined the word ""me"". She then added: ""Lord Z knows more about pandas than I do - I am sure he can arrange these things.""

"Iuliana Tudos, 22, had been missing since Christmas Eve A woman was murdered in a public park on her way home on Christmas Eve, police have said. The body of Iuliana Tudos, 22, was found in an outbuilding near the sports ground in Finsbury Park, north London, at about 16:30 GMT on Wednesday. Scotland Yard said she died from a stab wound to the abdomen and a head injury. No arrests have been made. The barmaid was last seen at about 20:00 on Sunday as she headed for a bus home from Camden. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Ms Tudos, who police said was of Russian and Greek origin, was due to meet at a friend's home in Enfield later that evening before spending Christmas Day there. However, she never arrived and a missing person appeal was launched by Scotland Yard. The body was found near the sports ground in Finsbury Park A member of the public found Ms Tudos's body, police said. Det Ch Insp Nicola Wall said: ""Iuliana's body was discovered in an outbuilding next to a sports pitch."" ""We believe that she may have been attacked on Christmas Eve but we want to hear from anyone who saw anything suspicious in that part of Finsbury Park over the Christmas period."" Residents have been laying flowers near where Iuliana Tudos's body was found On Thursday, an area of the north-east corner of Finsbury Park, close to a baseball pitch, was cordoned off and forensics officers marked out what appeared to be clothing scattered on the grass. Ms Tudos's home in nearby Upper Tollington Park was also searched by police.

"Cannabis companies stocks jumped after the panel's report was released Canadians spent about C$6bn ($5.6bn, Â£3.5bn) on cannabis in 2015 - almost as much as they did on wine. The estimate comes from Canada's bureau of statistics, which studied marijuana consumption between 1960 and 2015. The government has promised to research the drug's effect on the economy and society as it ramps up its plans to legalise cannabis next summer. The report also found that use has gone up over the years as it has become more popular with adults. In the 1960s and 1970s cannabis was primarily consumed by young people, according to Statistics Canada. But in 2015, only 6% of cannabis users were between between 15 and 17 years old, while two thirds of users were over 25. Canadians consumed about 697.5Â tonnes of pot inÂ 2015, which the report estimated to be worth between C$5.0bn to C$6.2bn. Canada and provinces reach pot deal Meet Canada's ""weed sommelier"" Canada's plan to legalise recreational pot Since marijuana is not legal yet, the researchers had to estimate its market value, pegging it between C$7.14Â to C$8.84 a gram. Many Canadian provinces have discussed charging about $10 a gram for cannabis once it is legalised. The government's plan, which has been championed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, would legalise marijuana consumption throughout the country but leave its method of sale up to the provinces. In November, the federal government said it planned to levy a 10% excise tax of C$1 per gram of the final retail price, whichever is higher. The provinces will take home 75% of those revenues. Under that scheme, the government could stand to rake in almost C$700m a year, if Statistics Canada's estimate proves correct.

"The agriculture minister said he thought prayers could help resolve the crisis Israel's Agriculture Minister, Uri Ariel, has joined with the country's religious leaders in an attempt to use the power of prayer to end a drought. Severe drought for four years has left water supplies at low levels. Mr Ariel led prayers at Jerusalem's Western Wall. Critics said he should tackle the crisis more practically. The drought has had a big impact on farming communities and caused Israel to become reliant on desalination plants on its Mediterranean coast. Orthodox Jews gathered to pray for an end to the shortages ""We significantly lowered the cost of water, we are carrying out many studies on how to save water in different crops, but prayer can certainly help,"" Mr Ariel said. The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth wrote: ""Prayer is not a bad thing, but the minister has the ability to influence [matters] in slightly more earthly ways"" - such as promoting policies to reduce climate change, it suggested.

" It was a good day to spend in the garden - hot and sunny.Trevor Wainwright, Hungerford’s usual bobby on the beat, was on a day off. He was making his way to a part-time gardening job in the nearby village of Inkpen. As he drove the three-and-a-half miles a news report came on the radio about a suspected armed robbery at a petrol station in Froxfield. Someone had shot at the cashier, Kakoub Dean. Luckily she hadn't been injured. The young policeman wondered whether he should see if he could do anything to help. After all, he was in the area and knew Mrs Dean. But, he reasoned, it was his day off. Later that day, his parents were driving up from their home in Kent to visit him. And strictly speaking, it was not his responsibility; Froxfield, though just outside Hungerford, was in Wiltshire rather than Berkshire and beyond the jurisdiction of Thames Valley Police. So he continued to Inkpen and Mrs Roland-Clarke's garden. I could smell cordite in the air."" About half an hour later, Mrs Roland-Clarke called him to the telephone. It was Jane, PC Wainwright's then-wife. She told him someone was shooting across the back gardens of their road. ""I put two and two together and assumed that the armed robbers from Froxfield had been cornered in Hungerford,"" he said. ""I rushed back to check on Jane and on the way I saw smoke coming up from South View [a nearby street]. People were sheltering in doorways and I pulled up and asked what was going on. ""'Some bloke’s gone mad with a gun', they said. I hurried home and got out of the car. I could smell cordite in the air. Sharp, acrid and smoky."" He told his wife to stay indoors with the little girl she was babysitting and headed off to Hungerford town centre, first to a newsagent to buy some maps and then to the police station. ""The station was locked, so I let myself in with a key. It was absolute panic stations. ""I effectively put myself on duty and thought because of my local knowledge I could show the armed response team the back routes around the town. Ambulances lined the main street. ""Members of the public were in the station with the police. I saw Robert Clements – he’d been walking the dog with his dad, Ken, and just witnessed him shot dead in South View. I knew I had to help."" When PC Wainwright, wearing his off-duty clothes of shorts and a Fred Perry polo shirt, was called into his superior's office, he thought he was going to be told to put his uniform on. Instead, Sgt Ryan said: ""I don’t know how to tell you this. Your dad's been shot. He's dead."" Trevor Wainwright still lives in Hungerford The elder Mr and Mrs Wainwright had been about 300 yards from their son's house when Douglas Wainwright was shot in the head and Kathleen Wainwright in the chest and the hand. Mrs Wainwright had the presence of mind to get out of the car and cower behind it. She knew her husband was dead. The gunman was reloading his weapon and Mrs Wainwright thought he would shoot at her again. This time, close-up. There was no way he would miss. Maybe he was distracted; maybe he enjoyed the power of sparing Mrs Wainwright's life. Either way, he turned away. Two more vehicles driving along the road were shot at. One man was injured. Another, Eric Vardy, was killed. Back at the police station, PC Wainwright was told his mother had been taken to hospital in Swindon. He headed straight there and was greeted by a nurse who said Kathleen was fine and Douglas was in the operating theatre. Over the moon at the news of his father's survival, PC Wainwright telephoned his brothers and sister. Then the nurse came back. ""She asked me what my dad looked like,"" he says. ""I told her he had tattoos, was about 6ft 1in and had grey hair. And she said ‘I'm really sorry. That's not him’. ""He was dead after all. That was possibly even worse than hearing it the first time."" By now, the name of the gunman was circulating. When PC Wainwright heard it was Michael Ryan from South View, he couldn't put a face to the name. ""In fact, I first thought it was another lad who lived there. A right little sod. Michael Ryan was just so, so insignificant. ""And then I remembered the name. I had been the one to carry out the checks for Ryan’s firearms licence."" The primary school where Marjorie Jackson was a caretaker had broken up for the summer holidays. She had been to check on the building, which was just the other side of the street from her South View home, and was returning to her house for lunch when a springer spaniel ran past. It was being chased up the road by Michael Ryan. The dog and its pursuer rounded a bend before disappearing from view. Mrs Jackson had known Ryan all of his life. They lived a few doors from each other and their families were friends. He was as good as gold."" Dorothy Ryan, Michael’s mother, was a lunchtime supervisor at the primary school where Mrs Jackson worked. Michael used to play at Mrs Jackson's home with one of her sons. She remembers Michael as quiet and polite. ""He was as good as gold. Wouldn't hurt a fly."" Having chased the spaniel away, Ryan returned. Mrs Jackson noticed he was holding a gun in each hand. He looked at her. His face, she says, was expressionless. ""I just started to run. I've never run so fast. He was shooting at me. The dust was flying up from the ground around my feet as the bullets hit. ""I was desperate to get into the house. He chased me all the way. ""I got into the house and slammed the door. I thought I was safe."" I didn't want to worry anyone."" But she wasn't. Ryan looked in through the kitchen window and pointed his gun at her. ""I turned to move away and he shot me. He got me in my lower back. ""I knew I’d been hit. There was a terrible burning pain. I couldn't walk. I couldn’t move my legs. I was on the floor. All I could think of was the dogs. I thought he'd come in and kill them."" Mrs Jackson, a bullet lodged in the base of her spine, crawled through the blood and glass on her linoleum and managed to lock Katie and Raffles, a Pekingese and a Tibetan spaniel, into a kitchen cupboard. Then she phoned the building firm where her husband Ivor was a bricklayer, and asked for a message to be passed on. ""I said I needed a bit of help at home but I didn't say what had happened. I should have said but I didn’t want to worry anyone. ""I didn’t know the Masons at No. 6 were already dead."" Their friend George White, who worked with Ivor, said he'd drive him home. ""I didn’t know by doing that, by asking him to come home, I was just leading them both into danger."" While Ryan roamed Hungerford, murdering and maiming people he'd known for years, a woman lay dead in Savernake Forest. The beauty spot near Marlborough is a popular place with dog walkers, picnickers and ramblers. It was one of the young Ryan's favourite places, where he enjoyed tracking wildlife through the undergrowth and practising survival skills. He also had a more sinister motivation for visiting the woodland. A former school friend remembers a teenage Ryan boasting of spying on and stalking people there. ""He used to say he could follow anyone and they wouldn’t notice,"" said the friend. ""I think he used to do it quite often, but then with him… he used to say lots of things. But this did actually ring true. ""He used to wear camouflage gear, that sort of thing. He took it seriously."" Prof Craig Jackson, a psychologist who specialises in spree killers, thinks there was also a sexual motive. He believes Ryan would get an illicit sexual thrill during his woodland trips and obtain pleasure and a sense of accomplishment from following and watching people unseen. It's not known whether Ryan spent a long time watching Sue Godfrey, a 35-year-old nurse who had stopped with her two young children for a picnic lunch. It is known that he made her put her son and daughter, aged two and four, in her car. He then shot her in the back with a Beretta pistol. Susan Godfrey was shot dead in Savernake Forest Pathologists determined she was killed by the first three bullets. Ryan hadn’t stopped there, though. He carried on, shooting Mrs Godfrey 13 times until he ran out of ammunition. Her children, who were 85 yards away from where her body was found, were later reunited with their father. The investigation into Mrs Godfrey's death found she had not been raped. However, Prof Jackson said it was likely Ryan had intended to do so. A groundsheet was found nearby, which could have been laid by Ryan in order to contain DNA evidence. ""I think she either refused to [have sex] or resisted,"" he said. ""Perhaps he killed her in panic when she attempted to run away."" Prof Jackson's colleague at Birmingham City University, Dr Elizabeth Yardley, has a different theory. Prof Craig Jackson believes Ryan had a sexual motive She thinks he saw Mrs Godfrey and her children having a picnic and enjoying themselves. ""It was a happy occasion and I think he felt resentful and victimised and wanted to seize control. ""If he did have a sexual crime in mind, then that would have been about control too."" What happened in the woods is the clue to why the shootings happened, Prof Jackson believes. ""I don't think he fully intended to commit a killing spree that day. I believe Ryan had probably been fantasising about it on a low level, but the events that day - and his personality type - led to it. ""He certainly had no 'manifesto' or message to the world."" Prof Jackson also considers Ryan was heavily influenced by a mass shooting occurring 10 days earlier in Melbourne, Australia, that was reported on television in the UK. Julian Knight killed seven people in Melbourne The Hoddle Street massacre was committed by a former soldier who wore combat fatigues. Having murdered Mrs Godfrey, Ryan headed back to Hungerford in his Vauxhall Astra GTE, stopping at Froxfield filling station. He put some petrol in his car and some in a canister. Then he shot at Mrs Dean and sped back to South View where he set fire to his home and shot dead his dog, Blackie. ""I think he fully intended to fake his own death at home and disappear at that point,"" says Prof Jackson. ""He was going to set fire to his mother's house and drive away, leaving the police to believe he'd died in the fire."" If this was his plan, it fell to pieces when his car would not restart. Prof Jackson says it was at this point Ryan changed his plans. ""He was trapped and didn't have a viable way out of his situation."" He left his shotguns in his broken-down car, grabbed a pistol and two automatic rifles and almost immediately shot dead Roland and Sheila Mason, who were in their garden at the back of 6 South View. What had led Ryan to this point? He had what appeared to be a normal upbringing, although he was perhaps overindulged by his mother. Ryan was a shy child with a keen interest in the military An investigation after the shootings found both Dorothy and Michael Ryan had been overdrawn on their bank accounts - in Dorothy's case largely because she bought her only child a new car every two years. Not academically gifted nor particularly driven, Ryan was unremarkable at school. Classmates remember he was quiet, seemed shy, ""kept himself to himself"" and was keen on the military. Leaving school he embarked on a series of casual labouring jobs and was often unemployed. His real passions were cars and guns. Semi-automatic rifles Ryan used during his rampage When he was 13 his mother bought him an air rifle. The boy enjoyed pointing his weapon at cows, birds and even other children, says Dr Yardley. He became a skilled shooter and member of two gun clubs. He legally owned several semi-automatic weapons and told people he had been in the SAS - just one strand of a fantasy life woven by him and apparently perpetuated by his mother. Mrs Jackson can remember Mrs Ryan telling her about a mysterious ""friend"" Michael had made. He claimed he had been taken under the wing of a retired colonel who was going to buy him a house and a Ferrari. There was also a made-up girlfriend - a delusion which went far enough for Mrs Ryan to invite people to the wedding. She'd just say she'd fallen over."" Whether Mrs Ryan truly believed her son's imaginings is impossible to tell. But it appears she never contradicted him in public. Alfred Ryan, Michael's father, had become a parent in his mid-50s and was about 20 years older than Dorothy. The Jacksons remember him as being a model-railway enthusiast and ""a lovely man who would help you with anything"". Although many neighbours described Mr Ryan as a pleasant man, there were rumours he was especially strict with his son. Ryan’s school friend remembers his mother would buy the boy whatever he wanted, but his father ""couldn’t be played"" and ""wore the trousers"" in the house. It was following Alfred's death in 1985 that Mrs Ryan began appearing at work with visible bruises, Mrs Jackson says. ""She'd just say she'd fallen over or something. It just seemed to happen quite a lot."" Dr Liz Yardley says Ryan felt victimised Dr Yardley says Ryan would have learned how to treat women from how his father treated his mother. ""[Mr Ryan] was quite the bully. Ryan's mother consistently pandered to her husband and son so Michael saw her as someone who was there to do things for him and essentially serve him - so he felt a sense of entitlement to treat her however he wanted."" Prof Jackson says violence towards his mother would fit in with Ryan's psychological profile as a narcissist who could not cope with being disobeyed, disagreed with or challenged. He adds that an overindulgent mother could also have led to Ryan never taking responsibility for his actions - a personality trait common to many spree killers. Despite his elaborate fantasies, however, Ryan was not mentally ill. Medical reports show he had no history of mental illness - in fact, his doctor had countersigned Ryan's gun applications. Ryan was a member of two gun clubs On 19 August 1987, the 27-year-old loner was in licensed possession of two shotguns, three pistols and two semi-automatic rifles. Dr Yardley and Prof Jackson both believe that Ryan did not ""snap"" and carry out the killings. Dr Yardley thinks he planned them well in advance. The speed with which he carried out his agenda indicates an element of forethought. Mrs Godfrey was killed at about 12:30 BST and Mrs Dean was shot at just five minutes later at the petrol station. Ryan was well-known for driving ""like a bat out of hell"" - the only time he had been in trouble with the police was for breaking the speed limit. He arrived back in South View in time to set fire to his home, shoot his dog, chase another dog, and take three guns from his car before killing Mr and Mrs Mason at 12:47. The final shooting took place at about 13:45. ""It's difficult to ascertain exactly how much he planned it, but I think it was well in advance and right down to minor details,"" says Dr Yardley. ""If it had happened today, there would probably be some sort of trail on a computer as perpetrators tend to do a lot of research."" Because Ryan burned down his home, any evidence of planning was destroyed. Dr Yardley believes Ryan was attempting to wrest some sort of control from society. A single man, unemployed and living with his mother, with no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship in his life, he perhaps had precious little to be happy about. ""What he did was the ultimate taking back of control. He also knew the day would end in the loss of his own life, so in effect he was choosing when to die."" George White was driving Ivor Jackson back from work. It was about 10 minutes since Mrs Jackson had asked her husband to return home and the two men had no idea of the danger into which they were heading. Ryan was on the loose in South View. Armed with three guns, he had already murdered six people and seriously injured seven more. As Mr White turned his Toyota Crown into South View, he was shot in the head and died instantly. Next to him, in the passenger seat, Ivor Jackson was also shot in his arm, chest and head. Their car smashed into the back of another car. It was a police vehicle which had its blue lights flashing. Mr Jackson decided to play dead. Oh no Ivor, not you."" With blood running down his face, he could only watch through half-closed eyes as Dorothy Ryan, Michael’s mother, arrived home from the Wednesday market. ""Dorothy came past me, and she looked into the car and I remember it as clear as day. She said: 'Oh no Ivor, not you.'"" Ryan was holding one of his most prized possessions - a Chinese copy of a Kalashnikov semi-automatic rifle. Could she talk some sense into her son? Dorothy Ryan tried to reason with her son ""She tried to tell Michael to stop and he shot her at close range,"" Mr Jackson adds. ""She was dead on the ground, on her front just by the drive of our house. ""Then he shot her again, twice, in the back, from about four inches away."" As smoke filled the air from Ryan’s burning house, more people were hiding inside their homes. A few doors down, a 14-year-old girl was staring at her legs. She had started the day wearing yellow trousers, borrowed from her sister. They were turning red with blood. Lisa Mildenhall had been in the garden with her sister and two children from another house. The other three ducked down on the floor but Ryan fired at Lisa. She was hit in the legs and the hips. One of the boys she was with went to fetch his mother, Sylvia Pascoe, a qualified first-aider who lived at No 14. Sylvia Pascoe still lives in South View ""I assumed it had been some sort of accident with glass and that Lisa had been cut,"" she says. ""I went to help and she said Michael Ryan had shot her. ""I just thought she was delirious from blood loss."" Her training with St John Ambulance had led her to believe she could not have been shot, as bullets typically leave a large exit wound. ""There were no big wounds at the back of Lisa's legs. I later realised that was because the bullets were still in her. I could see her hip bone."" The teenager was still standing up when Mrs Pascoe arrived to help her. She seemed more concerned about her trousers than her wounds. Mrs Pascoe stemmed the bleeding and stayed with the girl until an ambulance arrived. Ambulance driver Hazel Haslett arrived minutes later. Ryan shot at her, making a hole in the side window. Hazel Haslett escaped with minor injuries Ms Haslett reversed rapidly and she and her partner escaped with only minor injuries. Still shooting, Ryan then walked to the end of the road, went along a footpath and made his way across some playing fields. He wasn't finished yet. 1 - Roland Mason2 - Sheila Mason3 - Kenneth Clements4 - PC Roger Brereton5 - Abdul Khan6 - George White7 - Dorothy Ryan8 - Francis Butler9 -  Marcus Barnard10 - Douglas Wainwright11 - Eric Vardy12 - Sandra Hill13 - Victor Gibbs14 - Myrtle Gibbs15 - Ian Playle ● Susan Godfrey was shot and killed in Savernake Forest Shortly after Ms Haslett escaped South View, her colleague Derek Whiting arrived in a second ambulance, completely unaware that a gunman was at large. He noticed the blue flashing light on the police car and decided to stroll up to ask the officer what was going on. Moving closer, he noticed the rear window of the police car had been shot out. Inside, PC Roger Brereton, a traffic officer who had volunteered to investigate, was slumped against the steering wheel, clearly dead. Mr Whiting did not understand. He was still labouring under the impression that there might have been a shooting accident. Gunshots were often heard from Hungerford Common, at one end of South View. Both recreational and agricultural shooting were normal occurrences in the area. Then he realised the policeman’s wounds had not been caused by a shotgun but by a semi-automatic rifle. Shell cases were littering the ground. He saw Mrs Ryan lying dead on the road. He saw the Masons, dead in their garden. He saw Mr White and Mr Jackson in the car and Mr Clements - who had been walking his dog with his family - lying dead on the footpath. George White and PC Roger Brereton were in their cars when they were shot Rather than getting away from the carnage in South View, he started to check the houses to find and help the injured. ""When you work for the ambulance service, you do your best to help people,"" Mr Whiting says. Because the road was blocked by PC Brereton and Mr White's car, he and his partner could not drive their ambulance up, so he went on foot. He pulled the wheeled stretcher with him and managed to load both Mr and Mrs Jackson and Lisa Mildenhall into the ambulance. But what he did not realise was he was personally affected by the shootings. As his wife, Mary, says: ""So many of our family were shot that day."" Several of Derek and Mary Whiting's relatives were shot She had been at work in Hungerford when the news about the shootings came on the radio. ""We were all told to lie down and not move. Then the radio announced the names of some of the people who’d been shot, but didn't say if they were dead or alive. ""My brother and sister-in-law were on the list."" Alan Lepetit, Mrs Whiting's brother, was a neighbour of Ryan's, living in South View. The week before the shootings he had helped Ryan bring a heavy cabinet down the stairs. It was his gun cupboard. Mr Lepetit said: ""I gave him a hand one week, and the next he shot me and set fire to my house."" Linda Chapman and her teenage daughter Alison - Mr Whiting's sister and niece - were hit. They survived, although Alison still has a bullet inside her. Then Ryan had shot and killed Abdul Khan, a hard-of-hearing 84-year-old who was gardening. It is thought he might not have heard the commotion. Ryan headed across the playing fields, still shooting. As he approached a playground near Bulpit Lane he shot and killed dog walker Francis Butler. The Whitings' son Matthew, who was 11 at the time, was with his childminder in the playground and saw Mr Butler being shot. Mrs Whiting remembers: ""He was very upset for weeks afterwards. He would insist on lying down on the back seat of the car if we ever went out, so he couldn't be seen. ""I always encouraged him to talk about what happened, and one day he whispered to me and asked if he could use a rude word. ""I said he could, and he said: 'When that man shot that man, all of the birds flew out of the trees and shat themselves'. ""You know, it's funny. Everyone remembers the silence. The birds didn't sing again for five days."" Helicopters were hovering over Hungerford. Ryan had murdered 16 people and seriously injured 15 more, but his whereabouts were unknown. The phone lines were inundated with people trying to call police - journalists were taking up many of the lines - and the police radio system, which only had three channels, was similarly overloaded. Typically, by the time people got through to the 999 system, Ryan had gone elsewhere. Some reports were inaccurate, giving the wrong location. The result was police were often up to 40 minutes behind his movements. Marcus Barnard, a local taxi driver, had been a father for just five weeks when he was shot dead. Sandra Hill, who'd moved away from the town, was visiting former school friends. With her window open and radio on in her Renault 5, she became Ryan’s 13th murder victim, dying from a single shot. Ryan had been targeting people he happened across in streets and gardens. Now, he added a new dimension. As he went along Priory Road, Ryan stopped at the home of Myrtle and Victor Gibbs, whose door was, as usual, locked. He used his semi-automatic rifle to strafe the front door and open it. Ryan broke into the Gibbs' house on Priory Road Mr Gibbs tried to protect his wife, who was a wheelchair user. He died instantly from chest wounds. Mrs Gibbs died several days later, in hospital. ""Breaking in or shooting into a house and killing the inhabitants and then holding the position for a while before moving on, would have appealed to his military ideals and fantasies,"" says Prof Jackson. Ian Playle, the last victim to be fatally shot, had in fact been warned of the danger in South View by police. Knowing his way around the streets, he had tried to drive home by another route. But Ryan had moved. As Mr Playle rounded a bend in Priory Street, Ryan fired a single shot. Two days later, Mr Playle died from his injuries. Mr Playle's blue Ford Sierra crashed after he was shot by Ryan His wife and children had been in the car but were unhurt. Police were still hunting for the gunman in their midst. Eventually, shots were heard coming from John O'Gaunt School. Ryan had holed himself up in a second-floor classroom and was shooting through the window at both police and press helicopters. Ryan fired at helicopters from this window At about 16:45, police entered the playground. Ryan was finally cornered and an armed officer trained his sights on him. At 17:25, Ryan threw a semi-automatic rifle from the classroom window. A police negotiator managed to engage him in conversation. Ryan intimated he might be prepared to give himself up. He expressed sorrow over shooting his mother and his dog, and then said: ""Hungerford must be a bit of a mess. ""It's funny, I've killed all those people but I don't have the guts to blow my own brains out."" Seven minutes after saying this, at 18:52, he shot himself in the head. For Michael Ryan, it was over. Later that night, the clear-up began. Fifteen vehicles were taken away for forensic examination. Seventy-eight bullet holes were found. Mrs Pascoe, safe with her neighbours in a community centre, was playing cards with the children to distract them from the horror outside. At about 02:00 she looked out of the window and saw the bodies from South View being collected and driven away. Later, police told her they believed her life had been saved by the fact she'd kept her curtains drawn as she pottered about, doing her housework in her nightgown. She was still wearing it, soaked now with Lisa Mildenhall's blood, when she was finally allowed back home. Four houses, including Ryan's home at the far right, were later demolished In the ambulance on the way to hospital in Swindon, Ivor Jackson's heart had twice stopped beating. He had lost lots of blood, had bullets in his head and chest, his lung had been shot through and his arm was barely attached to his body. He needed numerous operations and still suffers, both physically and mentally. His wife, who had a bullet in her spine, was not expected to walk again. It's testament to her own strength of mind that she did. Marjorie Jackson recuperating in hospital in 1987 ""I just thought to myself, I'm a mother. I need to get better and I will walk again. I knew I had to be the strong one of the family, I knew Ivor wouldn't cope."" Even now Mr Jackson has not been back to South View. He cannot even pass the end of the road. He can barely speak about his friend, George White. ""He was a good man. We were good friends,"" he says. ""I’ll never forget what I saw that day, what happened to him, but I can't tell you. ""Nothing's been right since."" South View became a popular haunt for tourists The Jacksons had loved their home on South View, with its large garden, and were in the process of buying it. But, although the house was cleaned and modernised and made available for them, they could not bear to return. The couple and their two grown-up sons now live in a two-bedroom council house a few streets away. ""After what happened, lots of people split up,"" says Ivor Jackson. ""They couldn’t cope. But we've stuck by each other."" The couple have been married for 60 years and celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary in January. ""We got a letter from the Queen,"" Mr Jackson adds. ""My daughter arranged it."" PC Roger Brereton's funeral was held near Newbury The letter, complete with golden tassel, is still in its recorded delivery envelope and is kept in a basket in the Jacksons' kitchen. They keep meaning to frame it and put it up on the wall. Their younger son Trevor, who had been 18 in 1987, is being treated for PTSD while his older brother Peter, who was in the same year as Ryan at school, refuses to talk about that day. If it comes up, he leaves the room or goes to sit in the greenhouse. Large crowds attended the funerals of Ryan's victims Trevor Jackson had first heard of the shootings when a colleague asked: ""What's happened to your parents?"" He returned to South View to find bodies on the ground and was asked by police to identify them. Then he and his brother Peter went into their home, released the dogs from the cupboard, and started to clean the blood and glass from their kitchen. As the brothers were cleaning up, a reporter burst in. There was a police guard on the front door so he had sneaked through the garden and into the house through the back door. Another reporter followed their sister home from the hospital. I just broke down in tears."" Press intrusion is something the Jacksons continue to feel very strongly about. They usually hang up if a journalist approaches them and refuse to have their photograph taken in connection with the shooting. Similarly the Whitings, for years, simply drew their curtains and refused to answer the door. When, in March 1996 Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Stirling town of Dunblane, Trevor Wainwright decided to write to the Scottish police. Thomas Hamilton murdered 17 people in Dunblane in 1996 He explained who he was and his experience, and offered sympathy. Then he tore his heartfelt letter up. ""I just thought: 'They don’t want outsiders. They'll do what we did. The help will come from within the community'. ""Writing the letter did me good, but I don't think it would have helped the people of Dunblane."" A few days after the murders, Mr Wainwright - who had carried out the routine checks for Ryan's firearms licence - was astonished to see the Today newspaper’s front page splash. ""PC Signs Own Father’s Death Warrant"". Trevor Wainwright says he is ""haunted"" by his father's death ""I just broke down in tears,"" Mr Wainwright says. ""It hit at the heart of my professionalism, of everything I'd ever done for the town. I probably did three or four of these checks a week. ""It was just routine. Hungerford is a big shooting area, farmers and gun clubs and that sort of thing. I mean, there's no legitimate reason anyone would need to have a Kalashnikov - but it was legal. ""There was a picture of my dad, dead in a car with a blanket over him. ""And I kept thinking, if it was true that I'd signed my dad's death warrant, it meant I'd also signed all those other people's too. At the time,  the idea crucified me. ""At the hospital, where my mum was, everyone who'd been shot had been put into the same ward. I was due to go and visit her, but I thought I couldn't. ""I thought: 'How the hell can I go and see her if they're all blaming me?' ""She told me to get my arse straight down there. No-one blamed me."" Kathleen Wainwright later moved to Hungerford to be near her son He says he was helped by a discovery made at the post-mortem examination - that his father had developed lung cancer. ""If he had the choice - to die from a horrible disease like that, or be shot, I know he'd choose the bullet. Every single time."" He is still haunted, he says, by the photograph of his father dead in his car. If there is a shooting elsewhere in the world, he braces himself for his phone to ring. ""As soon as there's been a shooting, some journalist will call. ""And I hear the arguments of the gun lobby, who want to preserve the right to bear arms, and I think: 'You should come here and see what guns did to Hungerford.'"" Chief Inspector Laurie Fray and PC Colin Lilley hold Ryan's murder weapons The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 was passed in the wake of the massacre. It banned the ownership of semi-automatic firearms and pump-action weapons and made registration mandatory for shotgun owners. A Thames Valley Police report to the Home Office found that - given the limitations imposed by the remote location and the difficulties in radio and telephone communication - the force's response ""went well"". The local police station had only two working phone lines that day and the police helicopter was being repaired, delaying its deployment. Further delays were caused by the firearms squad being in training about 40 miles away. The report also said the operation was hampered by press helicopters making so much noise it was difficult for police on the ground to hear or relay instructions. Hungerford is a pretty canalside town famous for its antiques shops and upmarket boutiques. Its inhabitants refer to the shooting as ""The Tragedy"", almost as if it were a natural disaster. The names of the 16 people who were killed are listed on a stone set into the wall of the town's war memorial garden, with no mention of how they died. The town had long been a tourist destination. After the murders, though, visitors were less satisfied by remaining in the attractive main street. ""The tourist buses would just park where they usually did and then people used to come up here on foot,"" Trevor Jackson says. ""They were looking for bullet holes and spent shell cases to collect. Whenever they asked me where it all happened I'd say it was down the A4. Sent them away."" The description of the shootings as a ""tragedy"" doesn’t sit well with Mrs Jackson. ""It was a massacre,"" she says. ""There’s no two ways about it. ""We cope by taking every day as it comes. It's difficult. Healthwise, we're struggling. ""Ivor has very limited mobility, and his lungs are damaged from the bullet. I still get dreadful pain in my back. Trevor can't move out to his own place. ""It hasn't got any easier. We’re just waiting until life gets back to normal. ""It hasn't happened yet."" Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.6161863
"This video can not be played Eyewitnesses say they heard people screaming and saw others waiting to be rescued Four children were among 12 people killed in a fire at an apartment building in the Bronx borough of New York.

"The agriculture minister said he thought prayers could help resolve the crisis Israel's Agriculture Minister, Uri Ariel, has joined with the country's religious leaders in an attempt to use the power of prayer to end a drought. Severe drought for four years has left water supplies at low levels. Mr Ariel led prayers at Jerusalem's Western Wall. Critics said he should tackle the crisis more practically. The drought has had a big impact on farming communities and caused Israel to become reliant on desalination plants on its Mediterranean coast. Orthodox Jews gathered to pray for an end to the shortages ""We significantly lowered the cost of water, we are carrying out many studies on how to save water in different crops, but prayer can certainly help,"" Mr Ariel said. The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth wrote: ""Prayer is not a bad thing, but the minister has the ability to influence [matters] in slightly more earthly ways"" - such as promoting policies to reduce climate change, it suggested.

"Doug Jones was formally declared the winner on Thursday Democrat Doug Jones has been certified as the winner of the Alabama senate race despite a last-ditch legal case by the defeated Republican Roy Moore. Republican state officials confirmed the 12 December special election result, one day after Mr Moore claimed election fraud and called for a re-run. Mr Moore had been expected to win the conservative state but he was dogged by allegations of child sexual misconduct. Mr Jones will be sworn in by Vice-President Mike Pence on 3 January. The former Alabama supreme court judge's legal case, filed late on Wednesday, alleged that there were voting irregularities in 20 precincts, which amounted to ""systemic election fraud"". The case, which was dismissed by a judge on Thursday, called for a fraud investigation and a new election. This video can not be played Defiant Roy Moore says 'the battle rages on' A spokesman for the Jones campaign, Sam Coleman, called it a ""desperate attempt by Roy Moore to subvert the will of the people"". ""The election is over, it's time to move on,"" he added. Republicans ponder 'humbling' Alabama vote Donald Trump tumbles to earth with a bump Mr Moore, who was the first Republican to lose an Alabama senate race since 1992, never conceded defeat. The election result was certified by the state canvassing board, which is made up of the governor, secretary of state, and the attorney general - all elected Republicans. Secretary of State John Merrill said that all allegations of voter fraud were properly investigated, and were determined to be unfounded. This video can not be played What the Alabama upset will mean for Donald Trump's agenda Conspiracy theories have spread in online conservative groups since the election, alleging without evidence that black voters were bussed in from other states to vote for Mr Jones. Mr Merrill said that one report of a suspiciously high voting turnout in a community that does not exist was perpetuated by ""somebody [who] just made that up and started circulating it on the internet"". The final tally finds that Mr Jones won by a margin of 21,924 votes out of more than 1.3 million cast. The election result was a blow to President Donald Trump, who gave Mr Moore his full-throated support, even as other Republicans distanced themselves following the misconduct allegations. This video can not be played Why did Black Alabamians vote for Doug Jones? Four women allege that Mr Moore, then in his early thirties, assaulted, molested or pursued them when they were teenagers, including sexually touching one when she was 14. He denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated. His supporters, including his wife Kayla Moore, have promoted unfounded theories that his accusers were paid. Mr Moore has provoked controversy throughout his political career, suggesting that 9/11 happened because of declining Christian values, calling for Muslims to be barred from office, and strongly opposing gay marriage.

"Drunk tanks may have to become the norm in towns and cities to keep ""selfish"" revellers out of A&E, the head of the NHS in England says. Simon Stevens said he would be closely monitoring how the mobile units cope on New Year's Eve before deciding whether they should become a regular feature. Drunk tanks provide a safe place for those who have over-indulged to be checked over and sleep it off. They are often used over the festive period to stop people ending up at A&E. There are around 16 mobile units - also known as booze buses - across the UK, according to a recent survey, and a number of cities operate them all year round, including Newcastle, Cardiff, Manchester and Bristol. Mr Stevens said he may start recommending others follow suit, given an estimated 15% of attendances at A&E are due to alcohol consumption. This rises to about 70% on Friday and Saturday nights. A number of cities have already introduced drunk tanks He said he was thinking about the move after spending time with ambulance crews in London and the West Midlands in recent weeks. ""I've seen first-hand how paramedics and A&Es are being called on to deal with drunk and aggressive behaviour."" Why is gin and tonic getting pricier? Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality?,external Parents give children alcohol 'too young' But Dr Katherine Henderson, a consultant in emergency medicine from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, said it might be better to have a conversation about people drinking less on a night out. She told the BBC: ""By making this facility, it's like saying 'you can depend on the NHS to provide you with a safe place to sober up'"". ""You're saying 'there's a safety net for you', rather than saying 'how are you going to get yourself and your friends home safely'?"" Dr Henderson also said she was concerned that NHS frontline staff were working in the mobile units, when ""they could be helping others"". But she conceded that the last thing busy hospitals needed was more patients coming in to A&E. ""We are seeing people who are so intoxicated that they need to be on a trolley - which takes up a whole cubicle space; people who need cleaning up - which takes up a lot of nursing time; and people with serious injuries, who may be difficult to spot among the many that are extremely drunk. ""It's something we just don't need."" In Newcastle on a Friday and Saturday night, a Safe Haven van already operates to help vulnerable people - not just people who are drunk. Dame Vera Baird, the Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner, whose office part funds the van, said: ""It's a safe location to help anybody who needs any support. It saves an enormous amount of money and time."" Prof Simon Moore, from Cardiff University, is carrying out a study into the impact of different types of drunk tanks based in six cities in relieving pressure on the emergency services. He said: ""The very, very drunk with head injuries and similar will still need to go to A&E, but the health service is very risk-averse so they have a tendency to refer to A&E if they suspect something is wrong. ""So all you need is a good trained person - a paramedic or nurse - in the city centre to say 'we can hold off for a bit, this person is going to be fine in an hour or so', and then they can go home and sleep it off."" Prof Moore said it should be ""a joined-up service"" that refers people for treatment for their underlying drink problems. In Northern Ireland, Belfast operates an NHS-run unit and an SOS bus, which helps anyone who is vulnerable. In Scotland, there are no drunk tanks in operation and the government said they had no plans to introduce them. Bristol launched the UK's first drunk tank three years ago in a partnership between the police, ambulance and local hospital. Known officially as an alcohol recovery centre, it is a state-of-the-art medical facility contained in a 60ft-long converted articulated lorry. The vehicle has beds and seats as well as two showers. It comes with medical drips, oxygen, blood testing equipment and a pump system for the worst-affected revellers. It is staffed by paramedics who provide basic treatment, although those who need it can still be sent to A&E. Since it was launched, other cities including Manchester, Cardiff and Newcastle, have tried their own versions. The National Institute for Health Research is now looking at how effective they are at dealing with drunks. As the nation prepares to see in the new year, Simon Stevens reminded revellers to be responsible. ""When the health service is pulling out all the stops to care for sick and vulnerable patients who rightly and genuinely need our support, it's frankly selfish when ambulance paramedics and A&E nurses have to be diverted to looking after revellers who have overindulged. ""NHS doesn't stand for 'National Hangover Service',"" he added. Minimum price 'will affect 70% of alcohol' Should there be a word for an 'almost alcoholic'?

"For many, 2017 will be defined by fake news and the fight-back against it. Others will point to the blog that uncovered sexism and sexual harassment at Uber, helping force the resignation of the ride-hailing firm's founder and paving the way for other controversies to be uncovered. Gamers may prefer instead to celebrate Nintendo's revival thanks to its Switch console, and motorists to highlight Elon Musk's desire to electrify the trucking industry. But you, BBC Tech's readers, focused your attention elsewhere - at least as far as our figures on what you clicked on suggest. Below are the stories you made most popular for each month of the year. January:Undesired dimension The quiet death of 3D TV was the first of the year's big stories. When Sony and LG unveiled their new television ranges at the CES Las Vegas tech expo, it soon became apparent none of the models supported the format. Samsung and Philips had already ditched the technology the previous year. Strictly speaking, 3D-on-the-home-screen wasn't totally extinct -Panasonic came out with a new set,externalin February - but a combination of consumer apathy,  frumpy glasses and uninterested streaming services had clearly doomed the extra dimension. With CES 2018 just around the corner, the question is whether we'll soon be able to call time on curved screens too. February:Nokia's retro relaunch This video can not be played Rory Cellan-Jones swaps his smartphone for a retro Nokia 3310 HMD Global pulled off a marketing coup when it unveiled a new Nokia-branded 2G phone with the same name as one of the most iconic models of yesteryear. The ""reimagined"" 3310 featured the classic game Snake, offered extended battery life and kind of resembled the original design. But it lacked access to Snapchat, WhatsApp and countless other apps. Moreover, once owners got over the nostalgia factor, they discovered the photos it took were both pixelated andhard to get off the device,external. Even so, there was enough demand to justify a follow-up 3G model in September, and the phones appear to have helped raise the profile of other higher-end Nokia handsets. March:Watching the watchers Allegations that the CIA and MI5 had teamed up to hack Samsung TVs were made even juicier by the fact the project had apparently been given a Doctor Who-related codename. According to Wikileaks, the Weeping Angel attack caused compromised TVs to record audio when apparently switched off, before later uploading it to the cyberspies' computer servers. Effectively, it allowed a room to be bugged without producing giveaway radio signals. One theory for the project's name was that just like the malevolent sci-fi statues, the TVs were still ""alive"" even when they appeared to be inactive. Later in the year, Wikileaks published further details,including how the spyware could be uninstalled,external, as well as claims about other CIA-related hacking tools. April:Facebook and Google get scammed Although $100m (Â£76m) might seem like pocket change to Google and Facebook, the two companies missed the funds after they - and a third business, Quanta Computer - were allegedly conned by an email fraudster. The accused is said to have faked messages from an Asian-based manufacturer and convinced his victims to wire payments to his account over a three-year period. The Lithuanian suspect, Evaldas Rimasauskas, was extradited from his home country to New York later in the yearwhere he now faces charges,externalfor wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. He denies the allegations. May:WannaCry wreaks havoc A common refrain with cyber-security alerts is that, despite there being a hullabaloo of expert opinions, there's typically little real impact to the public. WannaCry was the exception. The ransomware attack swept across the world locking out users from tens of thousands of Windows PCs. The assault - later blamed on North Korea - forced NHS trusts in England and Scotland to cancel operations and other appointments. It was subsequently revealed that theyhad ignored earlier government warningsto update their systems, which could have mitigated the problem. The one upside was that aBritish cyber-security researcher, Marcus Hutchins, managed to trigger a ""kill switch"", halting the attack prematurely. More on him in a bit... June:Ukraine attack Just a month after WannaCry, another hack attack caused chaos - and this time the damage proved to be longer-lasting. An infected tax software update sent to businesses in Ukraine spread worldwide, disrupting the operations of some of the world's biggest companies. They included shipping firm Maersk, delivery giant FedEx, advertising conglomerate WPP and the consumer goods-maker Reckitt Benckiser. In some cases it took months before operations returned to normal, and related losses totalling morethan $1bn were declared,external. Ukraine accused Russia of being responsible, but the Kremlin denied involvement. A complicating factor in reporting the cyber-strike was that the security industry struggled to settle on a name for it - with Petya, NotPetya, Pneytna, Petrwrap, SortaPetya and Goldeneye among the variants suggested. July:Bitcoin's big moment Bitcoin's future seemed in doubt when there were rival plans mid-year to tackle a slowdown in the amount of time taken to process transactions in the virtual currency. Without delving too deeply into the proposals - you can read up on Bip 91, Bitcoin Unlimited and Segwit2x if you dare - a compromise deal was eventually struck to make the underlying technology, the blockchain, more efficient. But the plan fell apart before it had a chance to be fully enacted in November. That failure didn't prevent Bitcoin's value from bubbling higher. When the article in question was published, it was worth about $2,400 per coin. By December, it was close to $20,000. Slow processing times, however, remain a headache. Earlier this month, theaverage time taken to confirm a Bitcoin transaction,externalwas close to 24 hours. August:From hero to hounded Marcus Hutchins never wanted to be exposed as the ""Wannacry hack hero"" and his name only became public after British newspapers revealed him to becyber-security blogger Malware Tech,externalagainst his will. That act carried a vicious sting in its tail when the 23 year old was arrested by the FBI after a trip to Las Vegas. The US accused him of having developed banking malware several years ago and of selling it on dark web forums - charges Mr Hutchins denies. The accusations caused fury among other cyber-security professionals, with some vowing to restrict the support they offered the authorities. Mr Hutchins is currently released on bail in Los Angeles where he is awaiting trial. In the meantime, the Trump administration recently acknowledged that it was ""lucky"" Mr Hutchins had thwarted Wannacry, although itavoided mentioning him by name. September:iPhone X exposed Curiously, a major leak about Apple's iPhone X ahead of its official launch managed to attract more eyeballs to BBC Tech than the actual unveiling of the device itself. Details included the phone's name, the set-up process for its facial recognition technology and the inclusion of its animated emoji characters. An extra element of schadenfreude was provided for company critics by the fact that an earlier leak had disclosed that Apple had hired ex-FBI and NSA workers to thwart such spoilers. It's questionable whether the reveal actually dampened demand for the Â£1,000 handset. The US firm has forecast record sales for its current quarter. However, in recent days some analystshave begun to question how robust demand,externalwill be later in 2018. October:Amazon thieves busted When a company gets to be Amazon's size it has to rely on automated systems to deal with items reported as damaged or missing by their intended recipients. A US couple thought that presented them with an opportunity. They used hundreds of fake identities to order gadgets from the online retailer,  reported problems that triggered replacement deliveries, and then sold on all the goods for a profit. The $1.2m scale of their crime, however, meant their activity had in fact been detected and they eventually pleaded guilty to mail fraud and money laundering after being arrested. Erin Joseph Finan and his wife Leah Jeannette Finan were supposed to have been sentenced in November. But that has been delayed after they were accused of defrauding another internet retailer inthe months after the original charges were filed,external. November:Rough start ""The future is here,"" Navya's self-driving shuttle bus had emblazoned on its side as it launched its Las Vegas pick-up service. Unfortunately, less than an hour later, that future involved a delivery lorry backing into its front.As one passenger later recounted,external, the ""crash"" seemed to occur in slow-motion and only caused superficial damage. But the story sped across the world. Although the human driver was ultimately held responsible, the police report - made public earlier this month - told a more nuanced story. The truckersaid they had turned on their hazard lights and sounded a back-up alarm,externalto warn surrounding motorists that they were straightening up the cab. It had never occurred to them that an automated vehicle would respond by remaining stationary in their path without doing more to prevent the accident. December:Slowing down Apple may have had the best of intentions, but its love of secrecy left even some of its biggest fans shaking their heads this time round. It was only after ablog by the makers of the Geekbench app,externalwent viral that the US firm publicly confirmed it had been deliberately slowing down ageing iPhones to help manage performance issues caused by their batteries wearing out. It subsequently emerged that the firmhad apparently privately briefed some analysts on the decision,externala year ago, but had not shared the details with its consumers. Whether those customers would really have preferred thicker handsets with bigger or swappable batteries is open to debate. But the risk it faces is that shoppers suspect it is untrustworthy. At time of writing, Apple is being sued in eight separate cases in the US over the matter, as well as facing legal action in Israel.

"The company has announced a range of measures to ""regain the trust"" of customers Apple has apologised after facing criticism for admitting it deliberately slows down some ageing iPhone models. The company now says it will replace batteries for less and will issue software in 2018 so customers can monitor their phone's battery health. Some customers had long suspected the company slowed older iPhones to encourage customers to upgrade. Apple admitted slowing some phones with ageing batteries but said it was to ""prolong the life"" of the devices. In a statement posted on its website,external, the firm said it would reduce the price of an out-of-warranty battery replacement from $79 to $29 in the US for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later. In the UK the prices will drop from Â£79 to Â£25. Is Apple getting sloppy? The biggest tech stories of 2017 Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed It said it was pushing ahead with measures to ""address customers' concerns, to recognise their loyalty and to regain the trust of anyone who may have doubted Apple's intentions"". ""At Apple, our customers' trust means everything to us. We will never stop working to earn and maintain it. We are able to do the work we love only because of your faith and support - and we will never forget that or take it for granted,"" it said. The firm has had eight separate lawsuits in the US filed against it over the matter, and had also been facing additional legal action in Israel and France. Apple acknowledged earlier this monththat it does deliberately slow down some models of the iPhone as they age. Apple says it will issue a software update to give users more information about battery health It said it had made changes to the iOS operating system to manage ageing lithium-ion batteries in some devices, because the batteries' performance diminishes over time. ""Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, [when they] have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,"" the company said. It also emerged on Thursday that the tech giant's chief executiveTim Cook had been ordered by the firm to only use private jets for both business and personal transport for security reasons. In November,Apple was forced to release an update to fix a security issue with its Mac operating systemthat made it possible to gain entry to a device and administrative powers without a password.

"This video can not be played Stansted Airport passengers stranded as snow and ice grip Essex Up to 300 passengers were stranded overnight at Stansted Airport waiting to re-book flights because of bad weather. The runway was shut twice on Wednesday to clear snow and ice, leading to almost 60 flights being cancelled. Some passengers took to social media to describe the problems, with some saying it was ""chaos"". About 100 passengers remained on Thursday morning, but all have now been dealt with by their airline. In a statement, the airport said things are now ""back to normal"".

"Users are not used to finding major flaws in Apple's products Well, you don't see that every day - Apple hasrushed out a patch,externalto fix a major security bug. It had been revealedthat users of its new MacOS High Sierra operating system can access it without using a password. Just use ""root"" as a username, leave the password field blank and hit ""Enter"" a few times. It's an embarrassing slip-up and not one users are used to from Apple, whose products are often cited as more reliable and secure than its rivals'. Indeed, the firm admitted that it had ""stumbled"" with the release of High Sierra. ""We greatly regret this error and we apologise to all Mac users, both for releasing with this vulnerability and for the concern it has caused. ""Our customers deserve better. ""We are auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again,"" the company's statement said. But the ""root"" password bug is not as isolated a case as it might at first seem. Last month, Apple had to release a patch for another password-related issue in High Sierra. Some users found that when they asked the software for a password hintit simply revealed the password in full instead,external. While High Sierra appears to be falling over itself to give users access, there have also been issues with iOS - the software on iPhones and iPads. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this month, iPhone users werefrustrated by an irritating bugthat caused the letter ""i"" to be inexplicably auto-corrected to a capital ""a"" and a question mark. Again, Apple promptly fixed things. But these cases have left some questioning whether the firm has lowered its standards. ""Apple's quality of business execution is slipping,"" says Neil Mawston, at Strategy Analytics. He believes the company is becoming ""more prone"" to business and product glitches. As a result, Mr Mawston thinks Apple's reputation for offering premium quality and reliability could be at risk. Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, at the University of Surrey, agrees. ""There's definitely a growing perception that perhaps their quality control is not all it should be,"" he says. ""I use Apple products... because of the level of encryption and the attention they pay to apps in their app store. You didn't used to get these sorts of bugs."" He also points out that while Apple was once a niche brand favoured largely by computing connoisseurs in a handful of industries, today it is a true giant. That makes its devices increasingly attractive targets for hackers, who tend to look for vulnerabilities in the most popular systems because that way they have more opportunities to scam people or steal vulnerable data. ""People are clearly probing to see if there are interesting back doors out there [in Apple products],"" says Prof Woodward. ""And, boy, are there."" But perhaps that growth in popularity has also changed how we perceive Apple software bugs, suggests Ian Fogg, at IHS Technology. The company will ship 88 million iPhones this quarter, along with millions more iPads and Macs, he explains. The enormous popularity of Apple's iPhones, iPads and Macs make them attractive to hackers ""At that kind of scale, a problem that affects even a small number of people in percentage terms affects a lot of people in absolute terms - that's the issue Apple faces,"" he says. The company should still be considered a purveyor of high-quality devices, he says, adding that there remain regular reports of security issues with Google and Microsoft products. ""When a patch does come through [for an iPhone] it gets pushed out very quickly,"" points out Mr Fogg. Android phones, in contrast, are not as easy for Google to update en masse becausea wide range of different Android versions,externalare used in the wild and only phones made by Google itself receive the most important security updates immediately. There is aspecific list of handsets,externalthat receive monthly security updates - but this is far from all Android devices out there. Android phones don't all receive security updates at the same time Mr Fogg also says that the iPhone bug that caused the letter ""i"" to be needlessly auto-corrected is particularly interesting because it appears to have been the result of a machine learning-based approach to spell-checking that went wrong. Automating processes will be increasingly common in software development, says Mr Fogg, as it can speed up product delivery - but giving an algorithm control does have its downside. ""It's increasingly hard for companies to know that it will work well as it learns,"" he adds. The bottom line is: perceptions matter and Apple will want to deal with any signs that quality control is slipping quickly, says Ben Wood at CCS Insight. ""Apple has built its business on a reputation for high-quality, easy-to-use devices with great customer service.

"Police tweeted a message to people on the Preseli Hills urging them not to block roads while they ""enjoy the snow fun"" Police officers were called to a mountain pass after snow-lovers caused traffic problems by parking illegally. More than 100 cars were parked at the side of the road by people enjoying snow on the Preseli Hills near Brynberian, Pembrokeshire. Dyfed-Powys officers spent two hours rounding up motorists and asking them to move their vehicles. A public car park off the B4329 road has space for about 30 vehicles but was full. A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman said: ""Officers managed to move the bulk of the vehicles. ""There were more than 100 cars parked up and they were causing a problem."" The spokeswoman said none of the motorists received a penalty charge notice, adding: ""There just wasn't time"". 115 hit with A470 snow parking fines Tickets for inconsiderate parkers Met Office weather maps show exact time temperatures will fall to -6C in Wales Former mayor died after being hit by car while crossing the road Fit and Fed project supports more than 2000 Pembrokeshire kids Food hygiene ratings handed to seven Pembrokeshire establishments Pembrokeshire theatre group starting new term for young people Woman in court accused of manslaughter over paddleboarder deaths At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This video can not be played ""My face was burning"", one man told reporters At least 41 people have been killed and more than 80 wounded in a suicide bomb attack in the Afghan capital, Kabul. A Shia cultural organisation was the target but the Afghan Voice news agency was also hit. So-called Islamic State said it was behind the attack. The interior ministry told the BBC an explosion at the Shia centre was followed by at least two more blasts. IS has been behind a number of attacks on Shia targets across the country in recent months. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new ""Great Game"" IS in Afghanistan: How successful has the group been? The main blast went off inside the Tabayan cultural centre, but offices of Afghan Voice are also at the location of the attack. Dust blows down a street after one of the explosions Students were among those who had gathered at the Shia centre for a discussion forum. The interior ministry said the event was to mark the 38th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The initial explosion was followed by at least two others, although the ministry said these did not cause any fatalities. The health ministry's latest figures say 41 people died and 84 were hurt, with women and children among the casualties. Student Mohammad Hasan Rezayee told Tolo News: ""We were inside the hall in the second row when an explosion from behind took place. After the blast there was fire and smoke inside the building and everyone was pleading for help."" Another witness, Sayed Jan, told reporters from his hospital bed: ""There was a book reading event and academic discussion, and I was one of the participants. During the speech a huge bang was heard and smoke rose from inside the hall. ""My face was burning. I fell down from the chair and I saw the other colleagues around me on the ground. The smoke was everywhere."" Sayed Abbas Hussaini, a journalist at Afghan Voice, told Reuters that one reporter at the agency had been killed and two wounded. Distraught relatives gathered at local hospitals, which are treating the dozens of wounded people. The Islamic State group said on its propaganda outlet Amaq that it had targeted the Shia centre with a suicide bomber and other bombs. The Taliban had earlier issued a statement saying they were not involved. The Taliban are not known to specifically target Shias, although both militant groups have carried out frequent attacks across the country. Analysis: Zia Shahreyar, BBC Persian, Kabul In recent months IS has attacked many Shia targets in the west of Kabul, where the majority of the city's Shia population live. The Tabayan centre also has offices in the Iranian cities of Tehran and Mashhad and is believed to have close ties with religious and cultural centres in Iran. There are growing fears that IS is trying to spark a Sunni-Shia sectarian war in Afghanistan and the Shia community is increasingly dissatisfied with President Ashraf Ghani's government for failing to protect them. US-led foreign forces meanwhile continue to engage IS in eastern Afghanistan and President Trump, in his new Afghan strategy, has pledged to root out IS in the country, as it has been in Iraq and Syria. IS announced the establishment of its ""Khorasan"" branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It initially gained ground in the east and north, although it has lost territory there and was largely eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Taliban and operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces. Afghan security forces have been battling IS fighters, but the group has survived the onslaught IS has since resorted mainly to guerrilla tactics and is estimated to have a force of between  1,000 and 5,000 fighters. IS considers Shia apostates and aims to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war between Sunnis and Shias. In October, at least 39 people were killed in an attack on a mosque belonging to the Shia minority. In April, the US said it haddropped the ""Mother of All Bombs"" on IS in eastern Afghanistan, but the group continues its attacks. President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman issued a statement describing the latest attack as an ""unpardonable"" crime against humanity. Amnesty International's South Asia director, Biraj Patnaik, said: ""This gruesome attack underscores the dangers faced by Afghan civilians. In one of the deadliest years on record, journalists and other civilians continue to be ruthlessly targeted by armed groups."" Nato's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan called the attack ""heinous"". It is unclear whether Afghan Voice was a specific part of the target, but it has been a difficult year for the media. Afghanistan remains one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists and media workers. In November, IS said it was behinda gun attack on the Shamshad TV station that killed one staff member. In May, two media workers, including a BBC driver, were killed in a massive bomb attack in Kabul. The first six months of 2017 saw a surge in violence against journalists, with local monitorthe Afghan Journalists Safety Committee,externalrecording 73 cases, an increase of 35% in comparison to the same period in 2016. Last year seven members of staff from the private Tolo television station were killed in a Taliban suicide bombing in Kabul. Who has troops in Afghanistan?
