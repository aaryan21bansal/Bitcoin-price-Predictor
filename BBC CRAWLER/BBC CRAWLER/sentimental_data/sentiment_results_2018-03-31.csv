"A UK soldier killed in Syria while in combat against the Islamic State group has been named as Sgt Matt Tonroe. The 33-year-old, from the 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, was killed by a roadside bomb on Thursday. He had been embedded with US forces as part of a counter-terrorism operation. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""his sacrifice, unflinching commitment and bravery"" would never be forgotten, while his commanding officer said his bravery was matched by his compassion. It is believed Sgt Tonroe was killed near the town of Manbij in northern Syria in a night-time operation against IS. An American soldier was also killed and five other personnel wounded, US officials said. Sgt Tonroe, who was born in Manchester, enlisted in the Army in 2004 and joined the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in Colchester on completion of his training, where he served as part of the Sniper Platoon. During his career he was deployed on operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: ""He was well known within his unit, well-liked by all and he will be sorely missed. ""When talking of Matt, his colleagues recount his humour, mischief and endless endeavours.  Laid back, but a consummate professional, Matt was utterly selfless and always strived to achieve excellence."" His commanding officer said Sgt Tonroe had been ""destined for great things"" in their unit. ""Without Matt, our company has lost some of its humour; some of its warmth; and some of its sheer opportunism."" The war against 'Islamic State' in maps and charts The rise and fall of Islamic State Another commanding officer said: ""Matt Tonroe was a deeply intelligent man and one of life's characters. ""He was a caring and considerate soul, a loving and dutiful son and a friend to many. ""Yet he had a steel core, served his country with pride and was a first-class soldier, proven in combat, faced risk willingly and was ever ready for more."" Mr Williamson said from the tributes it was clear Sgt Tonroe was ""exceptionally dedicated and courageous"" and a ""gifted and intelligent instructor"". ""Sgt Tonroe fought to protect British values, our freedoms and to keep us back at home safe,"" he said. Sgt Tonroe is survived by his mother, Michelle, his brother, Alex, and girlfriend, Olivia.

"Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces The daughter of a man killed by Islamic State militants has expressed anger at complaints by his alleged killers that they will not get a fair trial. Bethany Haines, whose father David died in Syria, said Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh had shown ""no remorse"". The pair, who say their UK citizenship has been illegally withdrawn, allegedly belonged to an IS group dubbed ""The Beatles"" because of their UK accents. Now jailed in Syria, they called the murder of IS hostages ""regrettable"". Who were the Islamic State group 'Beatles' cell? Families of IS victims say 'Beatles' pair 'should face trial' Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? Ms Haines, whose father was held hostage for 18 months by the group, said: ""It shocks me that two individuals who have committed such heinous crimes have been treated like guests with access to the media and are allowed access to smartphones. ""As for them saying that their actions in Syria are regrettable is an understatement."" In an interview with Associated Press from northern Syria, Elsheikh said the ""illegal"" withdrawal of their UK citizenship put them at risk of ""rendition and torture"". ""Being taken to any foreign land and treated in any way and having nobody to vouch for you,"" he said. ""When you have these two guys who don't even have any citizenship... if we just disappear one day, where is my mum going to go and say, 'Where is my son?'"" He said he could have ""no fair trial"" when he was ""the Beatle"" in the media. UK security minister Ben Wallace said the government had always been clear that people who went to fight for terrorist groups overseas would face prosecution. He said Britain would work with its international allies to make sure terrorist suspects who were detained were brought to justice wherever was most appropriate. Ms Haines questioned whether the men could ask for their rights when they had ""stripped"" her father of his by holding him ""with his family not knowing whether he was dead or alive"". She said: ""In my opinion they should be given an orange jumpsuit and stripped of all the things they hold dear and left to rot in Guantanamo Bay."" Her views were echoed by Diane Foley, whose son James, an American journalist, was beheaded by the group in Syria in 2014. She said she wasn't interested in their opinions and doubted the sincerity of what they had said. ""I am interested in them being held accountable for their horrific crimes and right now, they look like they're on vacation,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. ""I know it's complicated but if someone doesn't take the leadership and take them to trial I fear they'll get away."" Sarah El Deeb, the journalist who interview the pair, described the men as ""very smart"" and ""very religious"". ""I don't think they were very apologetic about being members of Islamic state,"" she told the BBC. US officials believe the so-called ""Beatles"" cell beheaded more than 27 Western hostages and tortured many more. Kotey told the Associated Press that he ""didn't see any benefit"" to the killings. ""It was something that was regrettable,"" he said. He also said many people in IS would have opposed the murders ""on the grounds that there is probably more benefit in them being political prisoners"". The other cell members were Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"", and Aine Davis. All four were from west London. Left to right: Mohammed Emwazi, Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh Emwazi, who was the alleged ringleader and appeared in videos showing hostages being beheaded,was killed by a drone strike in 2015. Davis was convicted of being a senior IS member andwas jailed in Turkey last year. Profile: Mohammed Emwazi aka 'Jihadi John' Aine Davis, the gangster who ditched drugs for jihad Captives killed by the cell are thought to have included Alan Henning as well as Mr Haines. The men, both British aid workers were beheaded. Last month, Home Secretary Amber Ruddsaid the two remaining suspects in the 'Beatles' gang should go on trial. She said the US and UK were in talks about what to do with the two men. Both Kotey and Elsheikh have been designated terrorists by the US, which says they used ""exceptionally cruel"" torture methods. UK defence minister Tobias Ellwood said he believed the men should be tried in an international criminal court. The families of some of the victimsalso said the pair ""should face trial"".

"This video can not be played Clashes took place along Gaza's border with Israel The Israeli military has warned it could take action against ""terrorist targets"" inside the Gaza Strip. Brig Gen Ronen Manelis told journalists that Hamas - the militant group that controls Gaza - was using Palestinian protests as a cover for launching attacks on Israel. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said Israel bears ""full responsibility"" for bloodshed on Friday. Sixteen Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers at the Gaza border. It was the single deadliest day in the Israel-Palestine conflict since the 2014 Gaza war. The UN Security Council condemned the violence after an emergency session. Thousands of Palestinians had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest, dubbed the Great March of Return. The protest comes ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel and the exodus of many Arabs - which Palestinians refer to as the ""Nakba"" (Catastrophe). Israeli officials said soldiers opened fire after rioting broke out. The UN says hundreds of people were injured. Who are Hamas? Has Hamas changed? Will unity deal end Palestinian feud? On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised soldiers for ""guarding the country's borders, allowing Israelis to celebrate the holiday [of Passover] in peace"". The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent inquiry into Friday's violence. UN deputy political affairs chief Taye-Brook Zerihoun told the council that ""Israel must uphold its responsibilities under international human rights and humanitarian law"". Thousands of Palestinians attended funerals for some of the dead, including Hamdan Abu Amsheh Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, blamed the bloodshed on Hamas. Later Gen Manelis said Friday's events were ""not a protest demonstration"" but ""organised terrorist activity"" by Hamas. ""If it continues, we shall have no choice but to respond inside the Gaza Strip against terrorist targets which we understand to be behind these events,"" he said according to AFP news agency. On Saturday Palestinians observed a day of national mourning for those killed and thousands of people attended funerals. Palestinians also called a general strike. A few hundred protesters returned to a tent city put up near the border in preparation for the demonstration to resume, said AFP. At least 15 people were wounded in renewed clashes along the Gaza border on Saturday, said Gazan health authorities. The first to die was Omar Samour, 27 - a Palestinian farmer killed in Israeli shelling as he worked his land near Khan Younis early on Friday, before the protests began. Most of the other dead - reported to be mainly men under 40 - were shot dead at points along the length of the 65km (40-mile) fenced border, from Jabalia in the north to Rafah in the south, Hamas said five of them were members of its military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, reported Israeli media. Thousands of Palestinians had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest. Its aim is to assert what the protesters regard as their right to return to towns and villages from which their families fled, or were driven out, when the state of Israel was created in 1948. There were clashes near Ramallah Hamas does not recognise Israel, but last year said it was ready to accept an interim Palestinian state limited to Gaza and the West Bank. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah near the Egyptian border. Map showing the position of the five protest camps. Source: Haaretz The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which enforces a no-go zone along the Gaza border, doubled its troop presence for the protest. The IDF said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations near the border fence. It said it had ""enforced a closed military zone"" in the area around Gaza. Although most protesters stayed in the encampments, some groups of youths ignored organisers' calls to stay away from the fence and headed closer to Israeli positions. The IDF said troops were ""firing towards the main instigators"" to break up rioting, in which petrol bombs and stones were thrown at the fence. A spokesman said all those who were killed had been trying to breach or damage the border fence, the Jerusalem Post reports. The Palestinian side accused Israel of using disproportionate force. Tanks and snipers were deployed, and witnesses said a drone was used to drop tear gas in at least one location. The Palestinian envoy to the UN Riyad Mansour told the council that more than 1,400 Palestinian civilians had been injured.

"President Trump (right) accuses Amazon, owned by Jeff Bezos, of not paying enough for deliveries President Donald Trump has stepped up his attacks on Amazon, suggesting the online retail giant is ripping off the US Postal Service. The US Post Office would lose $1.50 (Â£1.07) ""on average for each package it delivers for Amazon"", he tweeted, but supporters of Amazon dispute this. Mr Trump also said the Washington Post newspaper was a ""lobbyist"" for Amazon. Amazon owner Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which publishes stories unpalatable to the president. Like most mainstream media, the Post has reported on stories including Special Counsel Robert Mueller's continuing investigation into links between the Trump election campaign and Russia, as well hashis alleged relationship with porn star Stormy Daniels. Saturday's edition details how three different legal teams are scrutinising the Trump Organization's accounts. Mr Trump's attacks on Amazon have seen its share price fall in recent days, amid concern that he might push for its power to be curbed by anti-trust laws. The president tweeted thatthe US Post Office was losing ""billions of dollars"",externalin its contract with Amazon. ""If the P.O. 'increased its parcel rates, Amazon's shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.' This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!"" he continued, quoting the New York Times. Amazon has not commented. But supporters of Amazon point out that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the industry, has found that the US Postal Service makes a profit from its contract with the company. This in turn helps subsidise the costs of letter delivery, which avoids the need for price rises. It is unprecedented for a sitting president to single out one company for such vicious attacks, says the BBC's Business Correspondent, Joe Lynam. Friends of Mr Trump in the commercial property sector have also been urging him to protect them from digital retail giants as they see shopping malls closing and rents falling, our correspondent adds.

"This video can not be played Crowds bid farewell to Stephen Hawking at Cambridge funeral The legacy of Prof Stephen Hawking will live forever, mourners at the theoretical physicist's funeral heard. Prof Hawking, who had motor neurone disease,died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. Actor Eddie Redmayne was one of several speakers at a service at the university church, Great St Mary's. The professor's eldest son Robert, former student Prof Fay Dowker and Astronomer Royal Martin Rees also gave addresses to the congregation. As the funeral cortege arrived at the church, the bell rang out 76 times - once for each year of Prof Hawking's life. His close family, including his three children Lucy, Robert and Tim, followed behind the hearse carrying the professor's coffin. As it pulled up, the vehicle was met with applause from the hundreds gathered outside the church. An arrangement of white lilies, to represent the universe, and another of white roses representing the polar star was placed on top of his coffin. It was carried into the church by six porters from Gonville and Caius College, where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years.

Jane Hawking, the professor's first wife and their son, Timothy, attended During the service the choir of Gonville and Caius performed the choral work Beyond the Night Sky, which was originally composed as a gift to Prof Hawking for his 75th birthday party at the college last year. Other guests seen arriving at the servicewere Queen guitarist Brian May and actress Anita Dobson, and television presenter and comedian Dara O Briain. Entrepreneur Elon Musk and playwright Alan Bennett had also been on the guest list. Stephen shared his work and his zest for the fundamental questions it addressed with wide audiences. He inspired people with the excitement and importance of pure scientific enquiry and was admired and revered for his devotion, as a scholar, to the pursuit of knowledge. This high regard was demonstrated wherever in the world he gave a public lecture: the auditorium was always packed, the atmosphere electric and the applause thunderous. Stephen was my teacher, mentor and friend. I, like many who knew and loved him, had come to think of him as immortal and our sorrow is tinged with a feeling of disbelief that he is no longer here. But his influence and legacy will live forever. Actor Eddie Redmayne, who portrayed Prof Hawking in the film The Theory of Everything, gave a reading during the service People gathered outside the church ahead of the funeral cortege's arrival Among the hundreds of people gathered outside the church, many said they had braved the chilly temperature and drizzle to pay their respects to a man they regarded as ""an inspiration"".

"This video can not be played Declan Donnelly joked he had ""twice the amount of work to do"" Declan Donnelly joked he had ""twice the amount of work to do"" as he presented Saturday Night Takeaway without Ant for the first time. The decision to host alone was made after Ant McPartlinwas charged with drink drivingfollowing a collision in south-west London. Ant still had some screen time in a pre-recorded comedy sketch. Show regulars Scarlett Moffatt and Stephen Mulhern also took on greater presenting roles. Coming down the steps to loud applause, Dec thanked the audience for the ""very, very warm welcome"". ""I've got twice the amount of work to do so we're going to crack on,"" he joked. Guest announcer and comedian Stephen Merchant told Dec: ""I can't help but notice a little bit of space on the stage there - any chance I can come down?"" But he added: ""You don't want me standing next to you because I'm 6ft 7in and you're considerably smaller."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The pre-recorded Saturday Knight Takeaway sketch segment - featuring Ant with Dec, Joanna Lumley, Emilia Fox and Michael Sheen - was shown. After the sketch was played, referring to Ant, Merchant joked: ""That other bloke was good - you should do more stuff with him, he was good."" By Ben Sutherland, BBC News Could Dec cope without Ant? The answer was - yes, generally very well. There's no denying that he was nervous to begin with - the tension visible in his body language; his speech was that slight bit quicker than usual. But he was welcomed to the stage with a massive roar from the audience, and having got into the groove with the usual catchphrases, he nodded to Ant's absence, noting: ""I've got twice the amount of work to do."" And the nerves were understandable. He had no more idea than anyone else how Ant's future might pan out - and he could hardly afford for the general impression to be that he is useless without his partner. At the very least, he isn't.

"The plane was inspected on Friday at Heathrow The UK has rejected a complaint from Russia over a search of one of its aircraft at London's Heathrow Airport, as a row over the poisoning of a former Russian spy deepens. The British government described the search of the Aeroflot plane on Friday as ""routine"" after  Russia suggested it was ""illegal"". Dozens of diplomats have been expelled on both sides in the poisoning dispute. Moscow wants UK representation in Russia cut by a further 27 diplomats. Twenty-three had already been expelled by Russia in response to the UK's announcement of 23 Russian expulsions on 14 March. Ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned on 4 March in Salisbury with what UK investigators have concluded was a Russian nerve agent called Novichok. Russian denies involvement. He is critically ill, but stable, while she is now said to be conscious and talking.

The pilot maintains they ""gave no reasons"" for the inspection, and he was not allowed to ""observe their actions"" or accompany them in their work.

Former chief executive of the UK Border Agency Rob Whiteman said intelligence would have been a factor.

""These searches are routine - they don't happen every day, but they do happen fairly regularly."" The Russian embassy in London accused Mr Wallace of trying to ""divert attention from the provocative actions by British law enforcement officers who have tried to search the aircraft without the captain present, in violation of the existing rules"". ""Mr Wallace's logic is difficult to comprehend. Aeroflot and Russian airports observe strict international security standards and didn't give rise to doubts in that respect. Moreover, it is quite strange to search for 'drugs and firearms' intended to be 'brought into the country' in an empty airplane ready to welcome departing passengers.""

Moscow has been taken aback by the strength of support for Britain by mainly Western countries, who announced the expulsion of 150 Russian diplomats over the course of three days earlier this week. Moscow responded in kind and then added to the number of British diplomats told to leave Russia. On Friday the British ambassador, Laurie Bristow, was told that the UK had a month to cut its diplomatic mission in Russia to the same size as the Russian mission in Britain.

"The UK's two biggest teaching unions have moved closer to national strikes over pay, backing ballots on action if substantial rises are not agreed. The National Education Union (NEU) agreed a motion for a strike ballot, while the Nasuwt backed calls for a rolling programme of industrial action. If ballots go ahead and are supported, it could mean disruption in schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The government defended teacher pay, saying they get Â£37,400 on average. That rises to Â£41,900 in London, it said. Both the National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers and the NEU - formerly the National Union of Teachers - are meeting for their annual conferences this weekend. The unions represent the vast bulk of teachers who belong to a trade union in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scottish teachers reject 3% pay rise Teachers' pay declining, says OECD In Birmingham, the Nasuwt is debating plans which could include ""rolling strike action if governments, administrations and employers fail to agree to substantial, above-inflation and across-the-board pay increases next year"". While the NUT motion, being heard in Brighton, claimed teachers' pay has fallen 20% in real terms since 2010. It instructs the union to ""launch a vigorous campaign on teachers' pay"", calling for salaries to be restored to 2010 levels over the next three years. An amendment that was passed ""committed to a ballot of all members for strike action"". It also urged the union's executive to work with other teaching unions on submitting a joint pay claim for school workers - along the lines of that given to health workers - and for an initial pay hike of 5% ""to begin restoring the cuts in living standards all school staff have suffered"". In both cases, the issue will be referred to each union's executive to take forward. In its report last year, the School Teachers Review Body (which advises government on teachers' pay levels) said schools were facing substantial pressures in recruiting and retaining staff, and many were facing reductions in funding and growing cost pressures. A number of unions have called on the STRB to recommend a 5% rise for teachers from this September, fully funded by the government. Previous limited rises have had to be found from school budgets. NEU general secretary Kevin Courtney said: ""The funding crisis is really playing into the workload crisis which is really playing into the teacher recruitment and retention crisis."" Nasuwt general secretary Chris Keates said radical and urgent action was needed to close the gap between teaching and other graduate professions. The Nasuwt has 280,000 members while there are 400,000 in the NEU, which was formed after a merger between the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We have a record 15,500 more teachers in our classrooms than in 2010 and this generation of teachers is better qualified than ever before. ""It is thanks to these teachers' hard work and our reforms that 1.9 million more children are being taught in good or outstanding schools since 2010. ""We want to continue to attract and keep the best and brightest people in our schools.""

"Migrants from Guinea don winter clothes donated by a charity in Bardonecchia Armed French customs officers have provoked widespread anger by entering a migrant clinic at a railway station over the border in Italy. Five officers forced one individual to undergo a urine test at the premises west of the city of Turin on Friday evening, Italian reports say. The facility is located about 1km (0.6 miles) inside the Italian border. Political figures in Italy, which has received over 600,000 migrants in the last four years, condemned the move. The French ambassador, Christian Masset, was called into the Italian foreign ministry in Rome on Saturday to explain what had happened. ""French border agents entered - armed - the clinic run in Bardonecchia, forcing a migrant to a urine test,externaland intimidating our doctor and the mediators and lawyers,"" the medical organisation which operates a clinic at the premises, Rainbow for Africa, said.

The organisation said the actions of the French officers ""seriously interfered"" with the work of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Italian institutions. It added that the French border was becoming ""increasingly militarised"" and called for a change in France's strict policy in rejecting migrants. However,the French government responded by saying the officials had asked for permission to enter the centre,externalat the station in the Italian ski resort and were allowed in. It said that a team of French customs officers on board a train travelling into Italy suspected a Nigerian train passenger with Italian residency was carrying drugs. French customs officials waited for the passenger to alight from the train and were allowed to use the station at Bardonecchia to obtain a urine sample under a bi-national agreement, it added, insisting that the officers had followed procedure. The test results came back negative. Migrants in the Mediterranean - anatomy of a sea rescue in 360 video Italy may stop ships unloading migrants No relief in migrant crisis for Italy Bardonecchia mayor Francesco Avato said he was ""very upset"" by the news, adding that the French officers ""had no right"" to go into the property. Former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said the incident was ""yet another mistake on the issue of migrants"". An MP with the far-right Brothers of Italy, Augusta Montaruli, said the behaviour of the French officers at Bardonecchia was ""very serious"". ""This is an unprecedented lack of respect towards Italy,"" she said. ""We are not Macron's toilet,"" she added, suggesting that the French president was treating his neighbour with contempt. French media suggest that the country's customs officers frequently return migrants to the centre in Bardonecchia if they are found attempting to enter France. Bardonecchia is the first stop in Italy on the high-speed rail route from Paris to Milan. Migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean and arrived in Italy sometimes try to reach France by crossing the Italian Alps despite the snow, bad weather conditions and terrain. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Divers from Sri Lanka's navy had to reinforce the vessel's frame before raising it A British passenger ship that sank after it was bombed in a Japanese air strike in World War Two has been raised off the Sri Lanka coast after 75 years. The SS Sagaing, whose passengers and cargo were largely saved back in 1942, has been refloated with the help of a team of divers from Sri Lanka's navy. It had been resting about 35ft (10.7m) under the water at Trincomalee harbour. The salvage operation took several months and was carried out by Sri Lanka's Eastern Naval Command unit. The operation to bring the wreck to the surface took several months It required the strengthening of the 452ft long vessel's main structural framework, which began on 11 September 2017, Sri Lanka's navy said in a statement on Saturday. The team of divers also erected an artificial side to the ship in order to seal an area before ""dewatering"" it to recover lost buoyancy. Stunning pictures of Black Sea shipwrecks Prior to the ship's refloat, the damaged sunken vessel was used as a pier for other naval ships in the harbour.

"Migrants from Guinea don winter clothes donated by a charity in Bardonecchia Armed French customs officers have provoked widespread anger by entering a migrant clinic at a railway station over the border in Italy. Five officers forced one individual to undergo a urine test at the premises west of the city of Turin on Friday evening, Italian reports say. The facility is located about 1km (0.6 miles) inside the Italian border. Political figures in Italy, which has received over 600,000 migrants in the last four years, condemned the move. The French ambassador, Christian Masset, was called into the Italian foreign ministry in Rome on Saturday to explain what had happened. ""French border agents entered - armed - the clinic run in Bardonecchia, forcing a migrant to a urine test,externaland intimidating our doctor and the mediators and lawyers,"" the medical organisation which operates a clinic at the premises, Rainbow for Africa, said.

The organisation said the actions of the French officers ""seriously interfered"" with the work of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Italian institutions. It added that the French border was becoming ""increasingly militarised"" and called for a change in France's strict policy in rejecting migrants. However,the French government responded by saying the officials had asked for permission to enter the centre,externalat the station in the Italian ski resort and were allowed in. It said that a team of French customs officers on board a train travelling into Italy suspected a Nigerian train passenger with Italian residency was carrying drugs. French customs officials waited for the passenger to alight from the train and were allowed to use the station at Bardonecchia to obtain a urine sample under a bi-national agreement, it added, insisting that the officers had followed procedure. The test results came back negative. Migrants in the Mediterranean - anatomy of a sea rescue in 360 video Italy may stop ships unloading migrants No relief in migrant crisis for Italy Bardonecchia mayor Francesco Avato said he was ""very upset"" by the news, adding that the French officers ""had no right"" to go into the property. Former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said the incident was ""yet another mistake on the issue of migrants"". An MP with the far-right Brothers of Italy, Augusta Montaruli, said the behaviour of the French officers at Bardonecchia was ""very serious"". ""This is an unprecedented lack of respect towards Italy,"" she said. ""We are not Macron's toilet,"" she added, suggesting that the French president was treating his neighbour with contempt. French media suggest that the country's customs officers frequently return migrants to the centre in Bardonecchia if they are found attempting to enter France. Bardonecchia is the first stop in Italy on the high-speed rail route from Paris to Milan. Migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean and arrived in Italy sometimes try to reach France by crossing the Italian Alps despite the snow, bad weather conditions and terrain. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok A request by the Russian Embassy to visit Yulia Skripal in hospital is being considered by the UK government. The UK holds Russia responsible for the poisoning of Ms Skripal and her father, ex-spy Sergei Skripal,by a nerve agentin Salisbury on 4 March. The Russian Embassy in London says it ""insists on the right to see"" Ms Skripal, who is a Russian citizen. The rights and wishes of Ms Skripal will be taken into account, the UK said. The Foreign Office said it would consider Russia's request in line with its obligations under international and domestic law. The BBC understandsMs Skripal, 33, is now consciousand talking. Salisbury District Hospital has said that she was no longer in a critical condition, adding that her father, 66, remained critically ill but stable. The teenager sentenced to 241 years in prison 'BBC helped me find family who never knew me' French children to start school at three Meanwhile, Russia hasannounced more measures against UK diplomats, insisting that a total of more than 50 diplomats will have to leave. Moscow initially expelled 23 British diplomats after 23 Russian diplomats were ordered out by London. Russia denies any involvement in the nerve agent attack which resulted in the Skripals being exposed to Novichok on March 4. Twenty-nine countries have expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato has also ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network?

And in another development,Russia accused British customs officers of trying to search an Aeroflot airliner arriving from Moscowat London's Heathrow airport without allowing the crew to be present. The Russian embassy called it ""a blatant provocation"". However, security minister Ben Wallace said it was ""routine"" for Border Force officers ""to search aircraft to protect the UK from organised crime and from those who attempt to bring harmful substances like drugs or firearms into the country"".

"A UK soldier killed in Syria while in combat against the Islamic State group has been named as Sgt Matt Tonroe. The 33-year-old, from the 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, was killed by a roadside bomb on Thursday. He had been embedded with US forces as part of a counter-terrorism operation. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""his sacrifice, unflinching commitment and bravery"" would never be forgotten, while his commanding officer said his bravery was matched by his compassion. It is believed Sgt Tonroe was killed near the town of Manbij in northern Syria in a night-time operation against IS. An American soldier was also killed and five other personnel wounded, US officials said. Sgt Tonroe, who was born in Manchester, enlisted in the Army in 2004 and joined the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in Colchester on completion of his training, where he served as part of the Sniper Platoon. During his career he was deployed on operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: ""He was well known within his unit, well-liked by all and he will be sorely missed. ""When talking of Matt, his colleagues recount his humour, mischief and endless endeavours.  Laid back, but a consummate professional, Matt was utterly selfless and always strived to achieve excellence."" His commanding officer said Sgt Tonroe had been ""destined for great things"" in their unit. ""Without Matt, our company has lost some of its humour; some of its warmth; and some of its sheer opportunism.""

""He was a caring and considerate soul, a loving and dutiful son and a friend to many. ""Yet he had a steel core, served his country with pride and was a first-class soldier, proven in combat, faced risk willingly and was ever ready for more."" Mr Williamson said from the tributes it was clear Sgt Tonroe was ""exceptionally dedicated and courageous"" and a ""gifted and intelligent instructor"". ""Sgt Tonroe fought to protect British values, our freedoms and to keep us back at home safe,"" he said. Sgt Tonroe is survived by his mother, Michelle, his brother, Alex, and girlfriend, Olivia.

"Jeremy Corbyn had been under pressure to sack Christine Shawcroft from the NEC The Labour official at the centre of an anti-Semitism row has resigned from the party's ruling committee. Christine Shawcroft said her membership of the NEC had ""become a distraction for the party and an excuse for endless intrusive media harassment of myself, my family and friends"". The row erupted after it emergedshe had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. Ms Shawcroft will be replaced on the NEC by comedian Eddie Izzard. Dozens of Labour MPs and peers had urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to suspend Ms Shawcroftfrom the NEC. In a statement announcing her resignation on Saturday night, she said: ""I reaffirm my complete opposition to anti-Semitism and my abhorrence of Holocaust denial, and support all measures to tackle this within the party."" She added that she would ""pledge my full energy to securing for our country the Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn that it so desperately needs."" How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded On Thursday, Ms Shawcroft - who is a director of the Corbyn-backing campaign group Momentum - resigned from another position as chair of Labour's disputes panel. The furore over her defence of Alan Bull, who was standing in Peterborough in May's local elections, comes amid a wider row in which Mr Corbyn has been accused of failing to tackle anti-Semitism within his party - particularly within its left flank. Mr Corbyn himself was criticised last weekfor opposing the removal of an anti-Semitic muralin east London in 2012. Christine Shawcroft is one of the most influential people in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour movement that - until this week at least - you had probably never heard of. Her CV read like this: a director of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group, the head of Labour's disputes committee, and the occupier of a chair on the party's ruling National Executive Committee. It's not quite so wordy any more. Two of those three jobs have gone. In the last few days, she has become the focus of the noisy, bitter and very public row within the party about anti-Semitism. I'm told that given her position on the NEC was elected, rather than appointed, it was her decision to stand down, but Jeremy Corbyn had spoken to her and supported her decision to go. Izzard has campaigned for a seat on the NEC twice, most recently in 2017. As he came second behind Ms Shawcroft in that election, he now assumes her position until a new vote in the summer. He had previously said he wanted to stand for the executive to ""break down barriers"" and make the party more welcoming to groups who feel ""isolated or excluded"".

"Actor Eddie Redmayne gave a biblical reading at the funeral, conducted by Reverend Dr Cally Hammond, Dean of Gonville and Caius A host of famous faces turned out for Prof Stephen Hawking's funeral in Cambridge. Hundreds of people gathered in the city for the private serviceat the university church, Great St Mary's. Prof Hawking, who died aged 76, had many friends and admirers in the entertainment world, and made cameos in a number of productions. Eddie Redmayne, who played the scientist in 2014 biopic The Theory of Everything, gave an address. Other guests from the worlds of music, comedy, film and television also attended. Actress Felicity Jones, who starred opposite Redmayne in the 2014 biopic arrived at the funeral with her partner Charles Guard. She portrayed Hawking's first wife, Jane, in the critically-lauded film. Model and actress Lily Cole, a Cambridge graduate, mourned the death of her friend at the service, which included an address from Astronomer Royal Martin Rees Queen guitarist Brian May and his wife, actress Anita Dobson, were among the 500 invited guests who heard a eulogy from the professor's eldest son, Robert. Others who had been on the guest list include SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and playwright Alan Bennett. Newsreader Charlotte Hawkins, whose father also suffered from motor neurone disease, arrived at Great St Mary's where the church bell tolled 76 times - once for each year of the professor's life. Prof Hawking's ashes will be interred at Westminster Abbey later this year. Comedian and Stargazing Live host Dara O Briain met his boyhood hero Prof Hawking during filming of a 2015 documentary. O Briain was in Cambridge for the funeral, which was followed by a private reception at Trinity College.

"Stephen Hawking, who was born in 1942, studied physics in Oxford and later went on to Cambridge for his postgraduate research in cosmology. At the age of 22, he was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. As he was preparing to marry his first wife Jane (pictured), doctors predicted he did not have long to live. They were married for 26 years and went on to have three children together. He used a wheelchair and was largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser. Hawking shot to fame with his 1988 book A Brief History of Time, which sold over 10 million copies. The physicist appeared on Desert Island Discs in 1992 with Sue Lawley. His chosen luxury was crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e Hawking later went on to marry one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, in 1995. They were married for 11 years before they divorced. In 2004, Benedict Cumberbatch became the first actor to portray the physicist on screen. The BBC TV film, Hawking, was critically acclaimed. The world-famous physicist often delivered lectures at universities around the world, like this one he gave at the George Washington University in 2008. Hawking met many famous world figures, including Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg in 2008 He won many awards in the fields of mathematics and science and in 2009, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then-US President Barack Obama. He also went on to meet Queen Elizabeth in 2014 during a charity event at St James' Palace. His life story was made into a 2014 film, The Theory of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne who is pictured here with Hawking.

"The UK's two biggest teaching unions have moved closer to national strikes over pay, backing ballots on action if substantial rises are not agreed. The National Education Union (NEU) agreed a motion for a strike ballot, while the Nasuwt backed calls for a rolling programme of industrial action. If ballots go ahead and are supported, it could mean disruption in schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The government defended teacher pay, saying they get Â£37,400 on average. That rises to Â£41,900 in London, it said. Both the National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers and the NEU - formerly the National Union of Teachers - are meeting for their annual conferences this weekend. The unions represent the vast bulk of teachers who belong to a trade union in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scottish teachers reject 3% pay rise Teachers' pay declining, says OECD In Birmingham, the Nasuwt is debating plans which could include ""rolling strike action if governments, administrations and employers fail to agree to substantial, above-inflation and across-the-board pay increases next year"". While the NUT motion, being heard in Brighton, claimed teachers' pay has fallen 20% in real terms since 2010. It instructs the union to ""launch a vigorous campaign on teachers' pay"", calling for salaries to be restored to 2010 levels over the next three years. An amendment that was passed ""committed to a ballot of all members for strike action"". It also urged the union's executive to work with other teaching unions on submitting a joint pay claim for school workers - along the lines of that given to health workers - and for an initial pay hike of 5% ""to begin restoring the cuts in living standards all school staff have suffered"". In both cases, the issue will be referred to each union's executive to take forward. In its report last year, the School Teachers Review Body (which advises government on teachers' pay levels) said schools were facing substantial pressures in recruiting and retaining staff, and many were facing reductions in funding and growing cost pressures. A number of unions have called on the STRB to recommend a 5% rise for teachers from this September, fully funded by the government. Previous limited rises have had to be found from school budgets. NEU general secretary Kevin Courtney said: ""The funding crisis is really playing into the workload crisis which is really playing into the teacher recruitment and retention crisis."" Nasuwt general secretary Chris Keates said radical and urgent action was needed to close the gap between teaching and other graduate professions. The Nasuwt has 280,000 members while there are 400,000 in the NEU, which was formed after a merger between the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We have a record 15,500 more teachers in our classrooms than in 2010 and this generation of teachers is better qualified than ever before. ""It is thanks to these teachers' hard work and our reforms that 1.9 million more children are being taught in good or outstanding schools since 2010.

Sgt Tonroe, who was born in Manchester, enlisted in the Army in 2004 and joined the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in Colchester on completion of his training, where he served as part of the Sniper Platoon. During his career he was deployed on operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: ""He was well known within his unit, well-liked by all and he will be sorely missed. ""When talking of Matt, his colleagues recount his humour, mischief and endless endeavours.  Laid back, but a consummate professional, Matt was utterly selfless and always strived to achieve excellence."" His commanding officer said Sgt Tonroe had been ""destined for great things"" in their unit. ""Without Matt, our company has lost some of its humour; some of its warmth; and some of its sheer opportunism."" The war against 'Islamic State' in maps and charts The rise and fall of Islamic State Another commanding officer said: ""Matt Tonroe was a deeply intelligent man and one of life's characters. ""He was a caring and considerate soul, a loving and dutiful son and a friend to many. ""Yet he had a steel core, served his country with pride and was a first-class soldier, proven in combat, faced risk willingly and was ever ready for more."" Mr Williamson said from the tributes it was clear Sgt Tonroe was ""exceptionally dedicated and courageous"" and a ""gifted and intelligent instructor"". ""Sgt Tonroe fought to protect British values, our freedoms and to keep us back at home safe,"" he said. Sgt Tonroe is survived by his mother, Michelle, his brother, Alex, and girlfriend, Olivia.

"Alan Sugar has deleted a tweet depicting Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in a car alongside Adolf Hitler, following calls for him to ""disown"" it. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell had appealed to the businessman to delete it and ""bring people together"". Lord Sugar sent the image asMr Corbyn said his party ""must do better""in dealing with anti-Semitism. It carried the caption: ""When you're pictured at Nuremberg and claim you thought you were going to a car rally"". The city of Nuremberg was host to Nazi propaganda events after Hitler's rise to power. Lord Sugar has not apologised for the tweet but, responding to Mr McDonnell, he said Mr Corbyn needed to ""make a firm statement about anti-Semitism"".

"Schoolchildren should get part-time jobs to help prepare them for the work environment, the work and pensions secretary has said. Esther McVey said she did not think they were ""lazy"" but there had been a ""significant decrease"" in the number of teenagers working on a Saturday. She told the Daily Telegraph,externalthere had been a fall of up to 60% in the numbers of young people with weekend jobs. As a result many lacked the ""soft skills"" needed for work, she said. ""What you've seen from the 1980s, particularly in this country, is far fewer people doing Saturday jobs and doing jobs after school,"" she said in an interview with the newspaper. ""It's about people understanding what a boss wants and what you want out of a job."" Fewer teenagers have part-time jobs My Saturday job started my career Esther McVey worked in a bistro She said the fall in Saturday jobs could partly be as a result of an increased focus on school work. However, she added that as a consequence many youngsters did not have the skills required for the workplace - such as good timekeeping and the ability to detach from their phones. The work and pensions secretary said she had worked in her family's business and a bistro when she was still in education. Marie-Therese, 16, balances working in a pub with her schoolwork Marie-Therese, Oxford:""As a 16-year-old I have been working as a food runner in an upscale pub for a few months now. ""I work Saturdays and some Sundays and honestly, I struggle to balance my A-level work with my paid work. ""The ever increasing pressure from school to focus on schoolwork is really difficult to balance with the stress that comes with working in a very busy pub and I only continue to work due to the need for money."" Pupils 'should revise 7 hours a day' over Easter Man has 'world's worst' super-gonorrhoea NFL cheerleader 'fired for Instagram post' Ann Lipman:""My 14-year-old daughter does a student swim teacher job. She works twice after school for a couple of hours and on a Saturday morning. ""Our local council set this up where they take a course and then they are able to assist a fully qualified teacher. ""She loves the job and it gives her independence and is teaching her to manage money."" Emily, London:""I had a weekend job in a shop until a few years ago, where I worked alongside other sixth-form students. We were paid less than other workers and cash in hand. ""My selective school was furious I was working weekends instead of revising for A-levels, but I had no choice financially. ""Given the unnecessary academic pressures on teenagers, I am not surprised if fewer opt to work on weekends."" Harrison has been working since the age of 14 Harrison Taylor, Bournemouth:""I have had a job since I was 14 working with special needs children in school holidays when I had much less stress on me schoolwork-wise. ""Now I'm 20, I have got a lot of friends who are trying to get their first jobs now after they've left sixth form and they're really struggling because employers want people with working experience. ""I understand students' reluctance to take part-time work during the school term, but I don't understand why many are reluctant to get seasonal work - particularly in the summer."" Matthew Griffin, York:""Owning a cafe in York, I have been approached by more 14/15-year-olds than people over 16 for a job. ""Unfortunately I have had to turn them all down. Being a small employer with three staff in on a Saturday, the much stricter rules around breaks and health and safety stop me employing them."" Darren Lamb, Headley:""I employ nearly 100 14-16-year-olds. The reason there has been a drop in this age group is 100% government increase in restrictions on the hours they can work, what they can and can't do etc. ""Last Tuesday we had an open interview which we only advertised on our company Facebook page and had 74 14-16-year-olds attend. ""Very few employers employ this age group due to all the restrictions and it gets worse year on year. ""Whoever decides on this child employment policy never takes into account the life skills they are attaining."" Research released in December suggestedthe number of schoolchildren with a part-time job had fallen by a fifth over the previous five years. The findings came from a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by the BBC to all local authorities across the UK responsible for issuing child employment permits. Employers need to apply for a licence to hire staff under the age of 16. Ms McVey's comments follow the release of a report earlier this week from the government's immigration advisers, which said that Britons were seen as less hard-working and less reliable than EU workers. UK firms 'fearful' for post-Brexit workers UK unemployment falls to 1.44 million The interim report is part of a review assessing the impact of Brexit on the UK labour market. Ms McVey said: ""Lets not put ourselves down, we've got a very hard working nation, we've now got record numbers of people in employment and nine out of 10 are UK nationals doing those jobs, that has increased significantly. ""But what we've got to make sure we do for business leaders is to say we've got to support you, we've got to make sure we've got the right people you want to employ going into your business.""

"The driver of the Tesla Model X died shortly after the crash Electric carmaker Tesla says a vehicle involved in a fatal crash in California was in Autopilot mode, raising further questions about the safety of self-driving technology. One of the company's Model X cars crashed into a roadside barrier and caught fire on 23 March. Tesla says Autopilot was engaged at the time of the accident involving the driver, 38, who died soon afterwards. But they did not say whether the system had detected the concrete barrier. Will we be able to trust self-driving cars? Tesla Autopilot update seeks better safety Uber barred from self-drive trial ""The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive,""a statement on the company's website,externalsaid. ""The driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision."" ""The driver had about five seconds and 150m (490ft) of unobstructed view of the concrete divider... but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken,"" the statement added. Tesla's Autopilot system does some of the things a fully autonomous machine can do. It can brake, accelerate and steer by itself under certain conditions, but it is classified as a driver assistance system, is not intended to operate independently and as such the driver is meant to have their hands on the wheel at all times. In 2016,a Tesla driver was killed in Floridawhen his car failed to spot a lorry crossing its path. It led the company to introduce new safety measures, including turning off Autopilot and bringing the car to a halt if the driver lets go of the wheel for too long. Federal investigators said last year thatTesla ""lacked understanding"" of the semi-autonomous Autopilot's limitations. This video can not be played Uber dashcam footage shows moment before fatal impact The accident in California comes at a difficult time for self-driving technology. Earlier this month, Uber was forbidden from resuming self-driving tests in the US state of Arizona. It followeda fatal crash in the statein which an autonomous vehicle hit a woman who was walking her bike across the road. It was thought to be the first time an autonomous car had been involved in a fatal collision with a pedestrian. The company suspended all self-driving tests in North America after the accident.

"The RNLI said it was a sequence of events which ""could so easily have led to multiple deaths"" Would-be rescuers attempting to pull out people who had fallen into the sea had to then be saved by passersby. A man fell from the slipway at Dundas Street in Redcar at about 16:00 BST on Good Friday and was battered by large waves close to the sea wall. A man he was with attempted to rescue him but also got into difficulty. A man and a woman who attempted to rescue the pair then also ended up in the sea. Members of the public were able to get all four to safety by forming a chain. Redcar RNLI said it was only through ""good fortune"" they were all saved and urged against copycat behaviour. All four were taken to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough for treatment Spokesman Dave Cocks said: ""This was a sequence of events which could so easily have led to multiple deaths. ""The sea at Redcar is very rough as a result of the combined effects of strong winds and a particularly high tide, and the situation ended up with four adults in trouble in the sea, all needing rescue. ""It is only through good fortune that all four were rescued alive. ""If you see someone in trouble, alert the lifeguards... do not enter the water yourself.""

"This video can not be played Police have released footage showing the confrontation that led to the shooting A white police officer who shot and killed a black man in the US state of Louisiana has been dismissed from the force. A second white officer involved in the deadly shooting of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge in 2016 has been suspended. Video footage showing the officers holding down Mr Sterling, 37, as one fired his gun, sparked days of protests in the city. Earlier this week it was announced the pair would not face criminal charges. Mr Sterling was shot after a resident reported being threatened by a black man selling CDs. Police said Mr Sterling was trying to pull a loaded gun out of his pocket when he was shot. The case was one of a series of incidents that led to protests across the US and the launch of the Black Lives Matter campaign. Why do US police kill unarmed black men? Stephon Clark case: Police shot unarmed man '7 times in back' Cases where US police have faced charges over killings Police Chief Murphy Paul told a news conference on Friday that officer Blane Salamoni, who shot Mr Sterling during a confrontation outside a shop, had been dismissed for violating department standards on the use of force and for losing his temper. Officer Howie Lake has been suspended for three days for failing to maintain his composure. The police department has released a series of videos - from the officer's body cameras, a police car dash camera and a store security camera - showing the confrontation and deadly shooting. Chief Paul described them as ""graphic and shocking to the conscience"". Federal officials agreed there was ""insufficient evidence"" to show Mr Sterling's rights were violated He said the measures he was announcing aimed ""to bring closure to a cloud that has been over our community for far too long"". He added that both officers planned to appeal. In deciding to bring no criminal charges, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said the officers had acted reasonably under ""existing law and were justified in their use of force"". This video can not be played Pinned down and shot in Louisiana The US Department of Justice came to a similar conclusion last May. Federal officials said there was ""insufficient evidence"" to show Mr Sterling's civil rights had been violated. Toxicology and urine test results showed Mr Sterling tested positive for cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids and other drugs at the time of his death, according to a report released by Mr Landry's office. US police: 'We are not punching bags' Protests over police shooting shut NBA arena The Louisiana prosecutor said the results could indicate that ""Sterling was under the influence and that contributed to his noncompliance"". The report also revealed Mr Sterling had been shot six times, including three times in the chest. After the shooting, officers removed a handgun from his pocket, according to Mr Landry's office. This video can not be played The story behind this photo at Baton Rouge protests At the time of Mr Sterling's death, a series of fatal police shootings involving African-Americans had sparked a debate about police use of force.

"Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces Two men accused of being Islamic State members have complained they will not get a fair trial because the UK government has stripped them of their British citizenship. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, from west London, were captured in Syria in January. They are accused of being the last two members ofan IS foursome dubbed ""The Beatles""because of their UK accents. The pair also said the murder of IS hostages was ""regrettable"". Who were the Islamic State group 'Beatles' cell? Families of IS victims say 'Beatles' pair 'should face trial' Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? In an interview with Associated Press from northern Syria, Elsheikh said the ""illegal"" withdrawal of their UK citizenship put them at risk of ""rendition and torture"". ""Being taken to any foreign land and treated in any way and having nobody to vouch for you,"" he said. ""When you have these two guys who don't even have any citizenship... if we just disappear one day, where is my mum going to go and say where is my son?"" He said he could have ""no fair trial when I am 'the Beatle' in the media"". But Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was beheaded by the cell in Syria in 2014 - said she wasn't interested in their opinions and doubted the sincerity of what they had said. ""I am interested in them being held accountable for their horrific crimes and right now, they look like they're on vacation,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. ""I know it's complicated, but if someone doesn't take the leadership and take them to trial I fear they'll get away."" Sarah El Deeb, the journalist who interview the pair, described the men as ""very smart"" and ""very religious"". ""I don't think they were very apologetic about being members of Islamic State,"" she told the BBC. US officials believe the cell beheaded at least 27 Western hostages and tortured many more. Kotey told the Associated Press that he ""didn't see any benefit"" to the killings. ""It was something that was regrettable,"" he said. He also said many people in IS would have opposed the murders ""on the grounds that there is probably more benefit in them being political prisoners"". The other two cell members  - also from west London - were Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"", and Aine Davis. Left to right: Mohammed Emwazi, Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh Emwazi, who was the alleged ringleader and appeared in videos showing hostages being beheaded,was killed by a drone strike in 2015. Davis was convicted of being a senior IS member andwas jailed in Turkey last year. Profile: Mohammed Emwazi aka 'Jihadi John' Aine Davis, the gangster who ditched drugs for jihad Among the captives thought to have been killed by the cell were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, who were beheaded. Last month, Home Secretary Amber Ruddsaid the two men should go on trial. In a statement on Saturday, the Foreign Office said: ""We do not comment on individual cases, but we are working closely with partners to ensure that justice is served. ""We continue to work extremely closely with the US government on this issue, sharing our views, as we do on a range of national security issues and in the context of our joint determination to tackle international terrorism and combat violent extremism."" Both Kotey and Elsheikh are designated terrorists by the US, which says they have used ""exceptionally cruel"" torture methods. UK defence minister Tobias Ellwood said he believed the men should be tried in an international criminal court. The families of some of the victimsalso said the pair should face trial. Bethany Haines, David Haines' daughter, said she hoped they die a ""slow, painful death"". Who were the IS 'Beatles'? Which countries have IS fighters gone to?

"This video can not be played Crowds bid farewell to Stephen Hawking at Cambridge funeral The legacy of Prof Stephen Hawking will live forever, mourners at the theoretical physicist's funeral heard. Prof Hawking, who had motor neurone disease,died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. Actor Eddie Redmayne was one of several speakers at a service at the university church, Great St Mary's. The professor's eldest son Robert, former student Prof Fay Dowker and Astronomer Royal Martin Rees also gave addresses to the congregation. As the funeral cortege arrived at the church, the bell rang out 76 times - once for each year of Prof Hawking's life. His close family, including his three children Lucy, Robert and Tim, followed behind the hearse carrying the professor's coffin. As it pulled up, the vehicle was met with applause from the hundreds gathered outside the church. An arrangement of white lilies, to represent the universe, and another of white roses representing the polar star was placed on top of his coffin. It was carried into the church by six porters from Gonville and Caius College, where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years. Obituary: Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking: A life in pictures Cambridge remembers Stephen Hawking Famous guests attend Hawking funeral As the hearse made its way past King's College, crowds strained to take photographs Porters from the professor's college acted as pallbearers The funeral cortege went through Cambridge city centre The porters, who often assisted him when he visited the college for formal dinners, were asked to be pallbearers by the professor's family. Up to 500 invited family, friends and colleagues attended the private service. Student Haskan Kaya had a bird's eye view of the funeral cortege from the top floor of Gonville and Caius College The choir of Gonville and Caius College performed during the ceremony Among those inside the church was Eddie Redmayne, who played the role of the professor in the 2014 biographical drama The Theory of Everything. He read from Ecclesiastes 3.1-11, while eulogies were delivered by Robert Hawking and Prof Dowker. The service was officiated by the Reverend Dr Cally Hammond, Dean of Gonville and Caius College. Jane Hawking, the professor's first wife and their son, Timothy, attended During the service the choir of Gonville and Caius performed the choral work Beyond the Night Sky, which was originally composed as a gift to Prof Hawking for his 75th birthday party at the college last year. Other guests seen arriving at the servicewere Queen guitarist Brian May and actress Anita Dobson, and television presenter and comedian Dara O Briain. Entrepreneur Elon Musk and playwright Alan Bennett had also been on the guest list. Stephen shared his work and his zest for the fundamental questions it addressed with wide audiences. He inspired people with the excitement and importance of pure scientific enquiry and was admired and revered for his devotion, as a scholar, to the pursuit of knowledge. This high regard was demonstrated wherever in the world he gave a public lecture: the auditorium was always packed, the atmosphere electric and the applause thunderous. Stephen was my teacher, mentor and friend. I, like many who knew and loved him, had come to think of him as immortal and our sorrow is tinged with a feeling of disbelief that he is no longer here. But his influence and legacy will live forever. Actor Eddie Redmayne, who portrayed Prof Hawking in the film The Theory of Everything, gave a reading during the service People gathered outside the church ahead of the funeral cortege's arrival Among the hundreds of people gathered outside the church, many said they had braved the chilly temperature and drizzle to pay their respects to a man they regarded as ""an inspiration"". Cambridge PhD Student Daisy Dixon, 28, said Prof Hawking had been an ""amazing person"". ""It's exciting that someone like that lived in my lifetime,"" the philosophy scholar said. ""It's a very sad day but it's lovely to see everyone here today to pay our respects."" Rod Crozier, who travelled from Boston, Lincolnshire, said: ""He's a very inspirational person... for what he's done in his life and what he's achieved. ""You're never going to see another like him, to be honest."" The funeral was followed by a private reception at Trinity College. The professor was photographed clutching his college's teddy bear mascot A condolence book, which was opened on the morning of Prof Hawking's death, was available to members of the public in the porters' lodge of Gonville and Caius College. A service of thanksgiving for his life will take place at Westminster Abbey in London on 15 June during which timethe professor's ashes will be interrednext to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton who was buried there in 1727, and close to that of Charles Darwin, who was buried in 1882. The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, said it was ""entirely fitting"" the professor's final resting place should be ""near those of distinguished fellow scientists"".

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital since the attack Russia has told Britain a total of more than 50 of its diplomats will have to leave, amid a deepening row over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK. Moscow initially expelled 23 British diplomats after 23 Russian diplomats were ordered out by London. But now the Russians are insisting that even more UK diplomats should leave. It says the UK and Russian diplomatic missions should be the same size in each country. In practice that would mean at least another 27 UK officials being sent home, the BBC's Paul Adams reports from Moscow. But it is also possible that some of the additional reduction could be made up by laying off local staff. The British government blames Russia for the nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in southern England on 4 March. Moscow denies it. Mr Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition.Yulia's condition is said to be improving. Russia asks to visit Yulia Skripal in UK What the diplomat expulsions tell us What next for Russiaâs spy networks? Full coverage of the Russia spy poisoning On Friday the British ambassador in Moscow, Laurie Bristow, was told that the UK had a month to cut its diplomatic mission in Russia to the same size as the Russian mission in Britain. On Saturday, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Reuters news agency that meant Britain would have to cut ""a little over 50"" of its diplomats in Russia. ""We asked for parity,"" she said. The Russian consulate general in Seattle is among the diplomatic representations closing A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""The Russian response is regrettable but in light of Russia's previous behaviour, we anticipated a response. ""However, this doesn't change the facts of the matter: the attempted assassination of two people on British soil, for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable."" Some 150 Russian diplomats have been expelled by mainly Western countries as their governments have rallied behind Britain. Russia initially hit back at the UK, but then announced 60 US expulsions in reaction to Washington's expulsion of a similar number of Russian diplomats. On Friday, Russia called in a string of foreign ambassadors with news that their own countries' measures were being matched. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday issued a warning over ""a situation that is similar, to a large extent, to what we lived during the Cold War"". Russia's ministry of transport has meanwhile demanded an official explanation over the searching of an Aeroflot passenger plane by UK officials at London's Heathrow airport on Friday. ""If there is no explanation, the Russian side will deem the actions towards our plane as illegal and also reserve the right to take similar action against British airlines,"" it said in a statement. UK Security Minister Ben Wallace said in a statement that it was ""routine for Border Force to search aircraft to protect the UK from organised crime and from those who attempt to bring harmful substances like drugs or firearms into the country"". He added: ""Once these checks were carried out the plane was allowed to carry on with its onward journey."" A man identified as the pilot, Vitaly Mitrofanov, has told Russian TV he refused to leave the aircraft and was confined to the cockpit while British officials accompanied by a sniffer dog searched it. By Paul Adams, BBC News, Moscow British diplomats left Moscow a week ago, but ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned back to the foreign ministry for additional punishment. Beyond the issue of parity, the Russian side hasn't really explained why it's made the latest demand. But it's clear that Russia sees Britain as the ringleader of an international conspiracy which resulted in the biggest mass expulsion of Russian diplomats in history. Britain's ""provocative and unjustified actions"", the ministry said, had ""inspired the unfounded expulsion of Russian diplomats"". It's a backhanded compliment to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has successfully corralled a wider international coalition than anyone would have thought possible a month ago. Russia has railed against the British government over its efforts to internationalise what officials here call ""the so-called Skripal affair"". The solidarity expressed by so many countries has been dismissed as a result of financial and political pressure, orchestrated in tandem with the US. Twenty-nine countries expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato also ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. The US expelled the largest single number - 60 diplomats - and closed the Russian consulate general in Seattle. Russia is closing the US consulate in St Petersburg as part of its retaliatory measures Russia reciprocated on Thursday declaring 58 US diplomats in Moscow and two in the city of Yekaterinburg to be ""personae non gratae"". It also announced the closure of the US consulate in St Petersburg. The US said it had been expecting the move and warned it may take further action. On Friday, ambassadors from Albania, Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine were told to send home staff from their missions - corresponding to the same number of Russians their countries had expelled. A statement by the Russian foreign ministry also said that Russia ""reserves the right to take retaliatory measures"" against Belgium, Hungary, Georgia and Montenegro - countries that had joined the co-ordinated action against Russia ""at the last moment"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed ""harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so-called Skripal case"". He reiterated Russian calls for consular access to Yulia Skripal - a Russian citizen. The UK Foreign Office says it is considering this ""in line with our obligations under international  and domestic law, including the rights and wishes of Yulia Skripal"". Russia, Mr Lavrov said, was also seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ""establish the truth"".

"This video can not be played Clashes took place along Gaza's border with Israel The Israeli military has warned it could take action against ""terrorist targets"" inside the Gaza Strip. Brig Gen Ronen Manelis told journalists that Hamas - the militant group that controls Gaza - was using Palestinian protests as a cover for launching attacks on Israel. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said Israel bears ""full responsibility"" for bloodshed on Friday. Sixteen Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers at the Gaza border. It was the single deadliest day in the Israel-Palestine conflict since the 2014 Gaza war. The UN Security Council condemned the violence after an emergency session. Thousands of Palestinians had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest, dubbed the Great March of Return. The protest comes ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel and the exodus of many Arabs - which Palestinians refer to as the ""Nakba"" (Catastrophe). Israeli officials said soldiers opened fire after rioting broke out. The UN says hundreds of people were injured. Who are Hamas? Has Hamas changed? Will unity deal end Palestinian feud? On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised soldiers for ""guarding the country's borders, allowing Israelis to celebrate the holiday [of Passover] in peace"". The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent inquiry into Friday's violence. UN deputy political affairs chief Taye-Brook Zerihoun told the council that ""Israel must uphold its responsibilities under international human rights and humanitarian law"". Thousands of Palestinians attended funerals for some of the dead, including Hamdan Abu Amsheh Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, blamed the bloodshed on Hamas. Later Gen Manelis said Friday's events were ""not a protest demonstration"" but ""organised terrorist activity"" by Hamas. ""If it continues, we shall have no choice but to respond inside the Gaza Strip against terrorist targets which we understand to be behind these events,"" he said according to AFP news agency. On Saturday Palestinians observed a day of national mourning for those killed and thousands of people attended funerals. Palestinians also called a general strike. A few hundred protesters returned to a tent city put up near the border in preparation for the demonstration to resume, said AFP. At least 15 people were wounded in renewed clashes along the Gaza border on Saturday, said Gazan health authorities. The first to die was Omar Samour, 27 - a Palestinian farmer killed in Israeli shelling as he worked his land near Khan Younis early on Friday, before the protests began. Most of the other dead - reported to be mainly men under 40 - were shot dead at points along the length of the 65km (40-mile) fenced border, from Jabalia in the north to Rafah in the south, Hamas said five of them were members of its military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, reported Israeli media. Thousands of Palestinians had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest. Its aim is to assert what the protesters regard as their right to return to towns and villages from which their families fled, or were driven out, when the state of Israel was created in 1948. There were clashes near Ramallah Hamas does not recognise Israel, but last year said it was ready to accept an interim Palestinian state limited to Gaza and the West Bank. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah near the Egyptian border. Map showing the position of the five protest camps. Source: Haaretz The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which enforces a no-go zone along the Gaza border, doubled its troop presence for the protest. The IDF said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations near the border fence. It said it had ""enforced a closed military zone"" in the area around Gaza. Although most protesters stayed in the encampments, some groups of youths ignored organisers' calls to stay away from the fence and headed closer to Israeli positions. The IDF said troops were ""firing towards the main instigators"" to break up rioting, in which petrol bombs and stones were thrown at the fence. A spokesman said all those who were killed had been trying to breach or damage the border fence, the Jerusalem Post reports. The Palestinian side accused Israel of using disproportionate force. Tanks and snipers were deployed, and witnesses said a drone was used to drop tear gas in at least one location. The Palestinian envoy to the UN Riyad Mansour told the council that more than 1,400 Palestinian civilians had been injured.

"This video can not be played Crowds bid farewell to Stephen Hawking at Cambridge funeral The legacy of Prof Stephen Hawking will live forever, mourners at the theoretical physicist's funeral heard. Prof Hawking, who had motor neurone disease,died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. Actor Eddie Redmayne was one of several speakers at a service at the university church, Great St Mary's. The professor's eldest son Robert, former student Prof Fay Dowker and Astronomer Royal Martin Rees also gave addresses to the congregation. As the funeral cortege arrived at the church, the bell rang out 76 times - once for each year of Prof Hawking's life. His close family, including his three children Lucy, Robert and Tim, followed behind the hearse carrying the professor's coffin. As it pulled up, the vehicle was met with applause from the hundreds gathered outside the church. An arrangement of white lilies, to represent the universe, and another of white roses representing the polar star was placed on top of his coffin. It was carried into the church by six porters from Gonville and Caius College, where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years. Obituary: Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking: A life in pictures Cambridge remembers Stephen Hawking Famous guests attend Hawking funeral As the hearse made its way past King's College, crowds strained to take photographs Porters from the professor's college acted as pallbearers The funeral cortege went through Cambridge city centre The porters, who often assisted him when he visited the college for formal dinners, were asked to be pallbearers by the professor's family. Up to 500 invited family, friends and colleagues attended the private service. Student Haskan Kaya had a bird's eye view of the funeral cortege from the top floor of Gonville and Caius College The choir of Gonville and Caius College performed during the ceremony Among those inside the church was Eddie Redmayne, who played the role of the professor in the 2014 biographical drama The Theory of Everything. He read from Ecclesiastes 3.1-11, while eulogies were delivered by Robert Hawking and Prof Dowker. The service was officiated by the Reverend Dr Cally Hammond, Dean of Gonville and Caius College. Jane Hawking, the professor's first wife and their son, Timothy, attended During the service the choir of Gonville and Caius performed the choral work Beyond the Night Sky, which was originally composed as a gift to Prof Hawking for his 75th birthday party at the college last year. Other guests seen arriving at the servicewere Queen guitarist Brian May and actress Anita Dobson, and television presenter and comedian Dara O Briain. Entrepreneur Elon Musk and playwright Alan Bennett had also been on the guest list. Stephen shared his work and his zest for the fundamental questions it addressed with wide audiences. He inspired people with the excitement and importance of pure scientific enquiry and was admired and revered for his devotion, as a scholar, to the pursuit of knowledge. This high regard was demonstrated wherever in the world he gave a public lecture: the auditorium was always packed, the atmosphere electric and the applause thunderous. Stephen was my teacher, mentor and friend. I, like many who knew and loved him, had come to think of him as immortal and our sorrow is tinged with a feeling of disbelief that he is no longer here. But his influence and legacy will live forever. Actor Eddie Redmayne, who portrayed Prof Hawking in the film The Theory of Everything, gave a reading during the service People gathered outside the church ahead of the funeral cortege's arrival Among the hundreds of people gathered outside the church, many said they had braved the chilly temperature and drizzle to pay their respects to a man they regarded as ""an inspiration"". Cambridge PhD Student Daisy Dixon, 28, said Prof Hawking had been an ""amazing person"". ""It's exciting that someone like that lived in my lifetime,"" the philosophy scholar said. ""It's a very sad day but it's lovely to see everyone here today to pay our respects."" Rod Crozier, who travelled from Boston, Lincolnshire, said: ""He's a very inspirational person... for what he's done in his life and what he's achieved. ""You're never going to see another like him, to be honest."" The funeral was followed by a private reception at Trinity College. The professor was photographed clutching his college's teddy bear mascot A condolence book, which was opened on the morning of Prof Hawking's death, was available to members of the public in the porters' lodge of Gonville and Caius College. A service of thanksgiving for his life will take place at Westminster Abbey in London on 15 June during which timethe professor's ashes will be interrednext to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton who was buried there in 1727, and close to that of Charles Darwin, who was buried in 1882. The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, said it was ""entirely fitting"" the professor's final resting place should be ""near those of distinguished fellow scientists"". A condolence book was made available for members of the public to sign Pupils 'should revise 7 hours a day' over Easter Camera rescued after two years lost at sea Church sign proclaims 'Chris is Risen' Stephen Hawking's funeral takes place.

"Mohammed Emwazi, Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh (l to r) A man who was alleged to have been part of an Islamic State group known as the Beatles has been charged and remanded in custody in the UK. Aine Davis, from west London, had just returned from Turkey, where he had served seven and a half years for terrorism offences. He has been charged with offences related to funding terrorism. Members of the group, known as the Beatles because of their British accents, murdered hostages while fighting with the IS in Syria. Davis denied being a member of the group. The four members who are said to be part of the group all grew up in west London and volunteered to fight for the Islamic State group in Syria. They ended up guarding Western hostages. US authorities say the group beheaded 27 hostages. Videos of the murders were sent around the world, causing outrage. Hostages also recall the group torturing with electric shocks, waterboarding and mock executions. They were""thugs with no knowledge of what is religion at all"", Spanish journalist and former hostage Javier Espinosa told BBC News, in 2017. Three are still living - Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey, El Shafee Elsheikh. Mohammed Emwazi, who was nicknamed Jihadi John, was killed in Syria, in 2015. Aine Davis Davis, who lived in Hammersmith, had a number of drug convictions and was jailed in 2006 for possessing a firearm. After converting to Islam, Davis changed his name to Hamza and met Emwazi. The two were part of a group that radicalised Muslims living in London. Davis left the UK to join IS in 2013. Davis was jailed for seven and a half years in Turkey Davis was arrested near Istanbul in 2015 and in 2017 he was convicted by a Turkish court of being a senior member of a terrorist organisation. At his trial in Turkey, Davis admitted knowing Mohammed Emwazi from praying in the same mosque in west London, but denied being his friend, or a member of the ""IS Beatles"" group. He served seven and a half years in prison. Arriving back in Britain at Luton Airport in August 2022, Davis was arrested by counter-terrorism officers from the Met Police and charged with offences including possession of a firearm for a purpose connected with terrorism, and charges related to funding terrorism. Alexanda Kotey Alexanda Kotey was sentenced in April 2022 to life imprisonment in the US, having pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges including lethal hostage-taking and conspiracy to support terrorists. He admitted involvement in the deaths of four Americans - journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. Sentencing him, thejudge described his actions as ""egregious, violent and inhumane"". Kotey was one of two men reportedly ""unmasked"" by media reports in 2016 These offences carry the death penalty - but US authorities have told Britain they will not execute Kotey, who is 38. Instead, he faces life imprisonment. He has been stripped of his British citizenship. Living in west London, Kotey - who is of Ghanaian and Greek Cypriot background - had attended the al-Manaar mosque with Mohammed Emwazi. He was captured in Syria by Kurdish forces, alongside El Shafee Elsheikh. Clockwise from top left: Aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig, and journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley The cell is also blamed for the deaths of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. El Shafee Elsheikh The son of Sudanese refugees who came to Britain, Elsheikh, went to Syria in 2012 and joined al-Qaeda before signing up with IS. Hostages called him Jihadi George and say as the main guard, he carried out most of the torture. Elsheikh was captured by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, in January 2018, as they overran the last pieces of IS-controlled territory in Syria. El Shafee Elsheikh is said to have earned a reputation for ""waterboarding, mock executions and crucifixions"" He wasfound guilty of lethal hostage taking and conspiracy to commit murder. He was stripped of his British citizenship in 2018. Mohammed Emwazi Emwazi, dubbed Jihadi John, fronted a number of videos showing executed hostages. Born in Kuwait, his family moved to the UK when he was six years old, in 1988. He studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, graduating in 2009. Emwazi, thought to be the group's ringleader, was killed after an intensive manhunt in 2015 Throughout 2014, Emwazi was shown, with his face disguised, in a number of videos where Western hostages appeared to be beheaded. A top target for intelligence services,he was killed in a joint US-British drone strike in Syria, in November 2015.

"Driven out of their de facto capital of Raqqa after three brutal years, IS fighters have lost much of the territory they once held. How real is the danger they will now travel to other countries to carry out attacks, asks Dr Lorenzo Vidino. As the self-declared Islamic State steadily crumbles in Iraq and Syria, security officials throughout the world are asking themselves a crucial question: what will happen to its fighters? Roughly30,000 foreign fighters joined IS,externaland there is concern that these battle-hardened individuals will return home, or move elsewhere, carrying out terrorist attacks to avenge the demise of the ""caliphate"". While difficult to forecast, the changing fortunes of IS will undoubtedly have major implications for global security. There are indications, including anassessment by US counter-terrorism officials,external, that some foreign fighters will stay in Syria and Iraq. The head of the UK security service MI5 said this week that fewer than expected of the 800 Britons who joined IShad returned recentlyand that at least 130 had been killed. Those foreign fighters who do remain are likely to continue with IS as the group morphs into what it was in its early days, some 10 years ago: a lethal insurgent force using tactics ranging from terrorist attacks to guerrilla warfare. Foreign fighters have been over-represented among militants making last, desperate stands in thebattles of MosulandRaqqa. And many of them are now being tried in Iraqi courts, creating legal and moral dilemmas for many of their countries of origin, assome may face the death penalty.,external However, many other fighters have been leaving the ""caliphate"", mostly through the 822km (510 mile) long border between Turkey and Syria. While Turkish authorities have been patrolling with significantly more zeal than in the past, mountainous terrain and the presence of sophisticated smuggling networks mean the border is quite permeable. IS has a long-established support network throughout Turkey, which is playing a key role in extracting foreign fighters from Syria. Given the scores of attacks that have bloodied the country over the last three years, Turkish authorities are understandably concerned about this influx. Neighbouring countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, have similar fears. The potential end destinations for foreign fighters leaving Syria and Iraq are plentiful. There is evidence that some have joined the official wilayat, or ""provinces"", IS has established inYemen, theSinai Peninsula,external, theNorth Caucasus,externalandEast Asia.,external The group also has a strong presence in Libya, where the US suggested last year that it hadup to 6,500 fighters,external, and several hundred in Afghanistan, where the US reportedkilling at least 94 fighters,externalin an attack on underground tunnels. Marawi in the Philippines has been partly held by fighters linked to IS since May There are also anecdotal indications of militants travelling to conflicts in far flung places such as theDemocratic Republic of Congo,external,Myanmar,externaland thePhilippines,external. The arrival of foreign fighters to these regions could strengthen the capabilities of local jihadist groups and change the course of sometimes devastating conflicts. Many other foreign fighters are choosing to return to their countries of origin. While some returnees may no longer engage in militant activities, others areestablishing clandestine networks,externalseeking to carry out attacks and, according to local circumstances, destabilise the country's political situation. North African countries are particularly vulnerable to the risk - nowhere more so than Tunisia, asabout 6,000 of its citizens left,externalto join IS - the highest per capita rate in the world. Arab Gulf countries may also suffer from this type of blowback. Russia, the Caucasus, and a number of Central Asian countries are also areas of concern, having seen large numbers join IS - many of whom went on to play a prominent role on the battlefield. European authorities consider the return of some of the estimated6,000 European foreign fighters,externala major security concern. To date, fewer than one in five individuals involved in attacks on the West since the ""caliphate"" was declared in 2014 had experience as foreign fighters, according to research by the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) and the George Washington University's Program on Extremism. The Paris attacks were carried out in part by former foreign fighters Who was behind the jihadist attacks on the West? Who are Britain's jihadists? The archaeological treasures IS failed to destroy But this might change as the number of returnees - now estimated at roughly 1,000 -  increases. Many may show no sign of wishing to engage in further violent activities, but there is a valid concern that some may make use of their combat skills. It is plausible that they could use their network of contacts and ""celebrity status"" among unaffiliated jihad enthusiasts to plan terrorist attacks. The territorial losses suffered by IS are not likely to affect the operational ability of these largely independent militants. While significant problems still exist, European authorities have improved intelligence sharing to better detect returning fighters. And thanks to improved co-operation with Turkey, many militants have been arrested before they get any further. A few do manage to reach Europe illegally, or by posing as refugees - as some of theNovember 2015 Paris attackersdid. But most foreign fighters will come to Europe legally, often using their genuine European passports. If detecting them is a problem, working out what to do with them is equally fraught. Arresting them may be the obvious answer, but the reality is significantly more complicated. The UK Home Office, for example, disclosed last year that of the 400 British foreign fighters who had returned from Syria and Iraq,only 54 were convicted,external. Similar dynamics can be observed throughout the continent. Inside Raqqa after IS pushed out The city fit for no one Raqqa's loss seals rapid rise and fall What is preventing authorities from arresting, prosecuting and convicting returning foreign fighters? It is mostly a legal matter, with lawmakers struggling to keep up with a constantly shifting threat environment. While legislations vary from country to country, they share some common problems. In some countries, joining a terrorist organisation or fighting in a foreign conflict were not criminal offences at the time when most individuals travelled to Syria. Several countries have since introduced new laws which, however, cannot be applied retrospectively. Even in countries where such actions have long constituted criminal offences, authorities struggle to gather the evidence needed to build a strong criminal case. Knowing that somebody joined IS or committed atrocities in Syria from an intelligence perspective is one thing. Being able to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law is another. Even more complicated is the issue of children either born or raised in the ""caliphate"" by their foreign fighter parents. While most are not punishable under the law, they deserve attention because of the trauma they have suffered and, in some cases, because they present severe signs of radicalism despite their young age. The result is that authorities are overwhelmed, having to monitor hundreds of battle-hardened fighters, on top of the burgeoning number of home-grown IS sympathisers, in an attempt to determine which pose an immediate security threat. Instead, authorities throughout Europe have increasingly invested in programmes seeking to deradicalise returning foreign fighters. While it might be premature to definitively assess them, there are indications that some, like the one established in the Danish city of Aarhus -offering rehabilitation and inclusion in society,external, are effective. Others, like the French plan to set up 12deradicalisation centres,external, have been shelved. The loss of much of its territory is a major blow to ISIS. Yet the group and its adherents are already surfacing in various parts of the world and are likely to do so with even more frequency and vehemence in the near future. IS will become a more decentralised, amorphous organisation operating in a more asymmetric fashion, but it will not disappear. Moreover, the IS brand and the emotional appeal of its ""caliphate"" are unlikely to vanish any time soon. And, despite critical challenges, the organisation's remarkably strong digital presence, the so-called ""virtual caliphate"", will survive in some form, potentially rekindling the commitment of sympathisers worldwide and prompting some to carry out terrorist attacks in its name. The fall of the ""caliphate"" closes a chapter, but a new one is about to be opened.

"This video can not be played Bethany Haines said the men should face justice for her father's murder They were allegedly members of an Islamic State cell notorious for killing Western hostages and putting their deaths on camera. Western media dubbed them ""the Beatles"" because of their British accents. Today one is dead, killed by a US drone, a second is in prison in Turkey for terrorism, andthe last two are in the custody of US allies in war-torn Syria. The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who are holding them say they have yet to receive a request from any country to hand them over. Victims' families want Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh to face justice, but the question of where justice might best be served is complex. US journalist James Foley was beheaded by IS in 2014- a crime ""beyond imagination"", his mother Diane told BBC News. British fighters Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces She said she would like to see the captured fighters tried in the US. ""But as long as they're brought to fair trial and detained and justice is served, I would be most grateful,"" she added. Two other American hostages, journalist Steve Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig (also known as Abdul-Rahman Kassig), were killed by IS too. Islamic State 'beheads US hostage Steven Sotloff' US hostage Peter Kassig 'killed by IS' The US defence department said it was ""still considering options"" but a spokesman added: ""Our intention is to hold anyone accountable who commits acts like those they are alleged to have committed."" Guantanamo Bay prison remains open The US Congress has been deeply opposed to terror suspects being held on US soil. So one option could be to send the suspects to Guantanamo Bay, the US detention camp in Cuba that was set up to hold jihadists captured in the ""war on terror"". President Donald Trump said during the 2016 election campaign he wanted to ""load it up with some bad dudes"". Last month,Mr Trump signed an order keeping the camp open. Human rights groups argue the very existence of Guantanamo and internment without trial play into the hands of jihadist recruiters, who portray it as an example of US injustice. British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines, who had gone to Syria for humanitarian reasons, were both killed by IS. Mr Haines's daughter Bethany told BBC Scotland she hoped his killers died a ""slow, painful death"" and said she would want to look Kotey and Elsheikh in the eye if they stood trial. French journalist Nicolas Henin was held hostage by IS for 10 months and believes ""the Beatles"" were among those holding him. He told BBC News he wanted Kotey and Elsheikh returned to the UK to face justice. ""I would like to see them brought back to Britain, just like I would like to see all other European jihadis brought back to their home countries, to be judged fairly in their home country,"" he said. ""Because the worst thing we can do with a terrorist is to deprive him from his right because then you make the terrorist a victim."" However, the BBC understands Kotey and Elsheikh, who grew up in west London, have both been stripped of their British citizenship. IS Beatles 'should die slow, painful death' Briton Alan Henning 'killed by IS' A British defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, has called for Kotey and Elsheikh to be tried in an international criminal court. It is important that ""terrorists from any origin are transparently and fairly held to account for their actions"", he said. The International Criminal Court (ICC), based in The Hague, can prosecute suspects for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. However, barring a UN Security Council request, it will prosecute cases only when states are unwilling or unable to do so, and is not intended to replace national criminal systems. It has been accused of focusing too much on war crimes in Africa, such as in Darfur and Democratic Republic of Congo. Judges consider Afghan war crimes inquiry What is the International Criminal Court? The prospect of an international criminal tribunal being set up for Syria, modelled on those for the former Yugoslavia or Rwanda, seems remote. The conflict drags on and deep divisions, most notably between the US and Russia, continue to beset  the UN Security Council. Another country with a potential claim on prosecuting Kotey and Elsheikh is Japan. IS beheaded two of its citizens, Haruna Yukawa and journalist Kenji Goto. Japan PM outrage at 'hostage Haruna Yukawa death' Japan outrage at hostage Kenji Goto 'beheading' The captured IS fighters could just remain in Syria, of course. However, the situation there is fluid as the SDF battles IS remnants, forces loyal to the Syrian government and, increasingly, Turkey. US forces repel attack on Syrian allies Turkey 'will take fight as far as Iraq' This video can not be played The group known as ""The Beatles"" beheaded IS hostages Last year, Turkey jailed the third living member of ""the Beatles"", Aine Davis, for seven-and-a-half years for membership of a terrorist organisation. Spanish journalist Javier Espinosa, who was subjected to mock executions, told BBC News at the time it did not matter where Davis was tried. ""He should face justice wherever it is,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter if it's in England or Turkey or wherever. He should be in jail forever.""

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital since the attack Russia has told Britain a total of more than 50 of its diplomats will have to leave, amid a deepening row over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK. Moscow initially expelled 23 British diplomats after 23 Russian diplomats were ordered out by London. But now the Russians are insisting that even more UK diplomats should leave. It says the UK and Russian diplomatic missions should be the same size in each country. In practice that would mean at least another 27 UK officials being sent home, the BBC's Paul Adams reports from Moscow. But it is also possible that some of the additional reduction could be made up by laying off local staff. The British government blames Russia for the nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in southern England on 4 March. Moscow denies it. Mr Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition.Yulia's condition is said to be improving. Russia asks to visit Yulia Skripal in UK What the diplomat expulsions tell us What next for Russiaâs spy networks? Full coverage of the Russia spy poisoning On Friday the British ambassador in Moscow, Laurie Bristow, was told that the UK had a month to cut its diplomatic mission in Russia to the same size as the Russian mission in Britain. On Saturday, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Reuters news agency that meant Britain would have to cut ""a little over 50"" of its diplomats in Russia. ""We asked for parity,"" she said. The Russian consulate general in Seattle is among the diplomatic representations closing A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""The Russian response is regrettable but in light of Russia's previous behaviour, we anticipated a response. ""However, this doesn't change the facts of the matter: the attempted assassination of two people on British soil, for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable."" Some 150 Russian diplomats have been expelled by mainly Western countries as their governments have rallied behind Britain. Russia initially hit back at the UK, but then announced 60 US expulsions in reaction to Washington's expulsion of a similar number of Russian diplomats. On Friday, Russia called in a string of foreign ambassadors with news that their own countries' measures were being matched. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday issued a warning over ""a situation that is similar, to a large extent, to what we lived during the Cold War"". Russia's ministry of transport has meanwhile demanded an official explanation over the searching of an Aeroflot passenger plane by UK officials at London's Heathrow airport on Friday. ""If there is no explanation, the Russian side will deem the actions towards our plane as illegal and also reserve the right to take similar action against British airlines,"" it said in a statement. UK Security Minister Ben Wallace said in a statement that it was ""routine for Border Force to search aircraft to protect the UK from organised crime and from those who attempt to bring harmful substances like drugs or firearms into the country"". He added: ""Once these checks were carried out the plane was allowed to carry on with its onward journey."" A man identified as the pilot, Vitaly Mitrofanov, has told Russian TV he refused to leave the aircraft and was confined to the cockpit while British officials accompanied by a sniffer dog searched it. By Paul Adams, BBC News, Moscow British diplomats left Moscow a week ago, but ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned back to the foreign ministry for additional punishment. Beyond the issue of parity, the Russian side hasn't really explained why it's made the latest demand. But it's clear that Russia sees Britain as the ringleader of an international conspiracy which resulted in the biggest mass expulsion of Russian diplomats in history. Britain's ""provocative and unjustified actions"", the ministry said, had ""inspired the unfounded expulsion of Russian diplomats"". It's a backhanded compliment to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has successfully corralled a wider international coalition than anyone would have thought possible a month ago. Russia has railed against the British government over its efforts to internationalise what officials here call ""the so-called Skripal affair"". The solidarity expressed by so many countries has been dismissed as a result of financial and political pressure, orchestrated in tandem with the US. Twenty-nine countries expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato also ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. The US expelled the largest single number - 60 diplomats - and closed the Russian consulate general in Seattle. Russia is closing the US consulate in St Petersburg as part of its retaliatory measures Russia reciprocated on Thursday declaring 58 US diplomats in Moscow and two in the city of Yekaterinburg to be ""personae non gratae"". It also announced the closure of the US consulate in St Petersburg. The US said it had been expecting the move and warned it may take further action. On Friday, ambassadors from Albania, Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine were told to send home staff from their missions - corresponding to the same number of Russians their countries had expelled. A statement by the Russian foreign ministry also said that Russia ""reserves the right to take retaliatory measures"" against Belgium, Hungary, Georgia and Montenegro - countries that had joined the co-ordinated action against Russia ""at the last moment"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed ""harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so-called Skripal case"". He reiterated Russian calls for consular access to Yulia Skripal - a Russian citizen. The UK Foreign Office says it is considering this ""in line with our obligations under international  and domestic law, including the rights and wishes of Yulia Skripal"". Russia, Mr Lavrov said, was also seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ""establish the truth"".

"Advanced paramedics in England will be able to prescribe medicines to people who do not need hospital treatment, under new laws starting on Sunday. Up to seven out of 10 people currently seen by advanced care paramedics may need help - but not a hospital visit. Paramedics only have a limited ability to supply medicines at the moment but will now be able to do this without delay or the patient seeing their GP. Rachel Power, The Patients Association chief executive, called it ""good news"". She added: ""It will make it easier for them to receive treatment at home, eliminate the need to see a second professional in many cases, and reduce the need for transportation into hospital that isn't clinically necessary. ""Rather, they will be able to start treatment without delay, which for some will be critical."" Some advanced paramedics already work in GP practices, where they usually look after urgent same-day patient requests, including some home visits. And others who work in emergency departments will also be able to prescribe medicines, allowing doctors to see more needy patients. Around 700 paramedics are going to be trained, to qualify them to write prescriptions. Gemma Walsh, an advanced paramedic who specialises in urgent care, said the ability for paramedics to be able to prescribe was a ""fantastic development for our profession"". She said it would help to reduce pressure on GPs and hospitals and would speed up the time it takes for patients to receive treatments. ""It will allow us to really complete our care. Going to a patient, we already do thorough history assessments, coming up with working diagnoses and management plans, and being able to complete that care will be of complete benefit to the patient."" Paramedic attacked in ambulance 'parking row' in Birmingham Award for paramedics who saved man's life on M1 How do paramedics cope with their 'heart-breaking' job? An NHS England spokesperson said: ""Increasing the range of treatments offered by paramedics closer to people's homes is another significant step in transforming emergency care, as ambulance clinicians increasingly become part of community urgent treatment services. ""In the NHS's 70th year, home visits by advanced paramedics and increasing use of clinical pharmacists and mental health therapists are among the practical ways the health service continues to innovate and adapt to the changing needs of patients and the population."" Dr Ron Daniels, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: ""Timely identification and treatment of sepsis can mean the difference between life and death, so better access to healthcare professionals who can make accurate diagnoses and prescribe antibiotics, where appropriate, is an important provision."" Gerry Egan, chief executive of the College of Paramedics said: ""Independent prescribing legislation is a huge endorsement of the paramedic profession and the role it plays in providing safe, high-quality care for patients in urgent and emergency care. ""This is great news for patients and the profession and is the culmination of many years of preparatory work.""

"This video can not be played Clashes took place along Gaza's border with Israel The Israeli military has warned it could take action against ""terrorist targets"" inside the Gaza Strip. Brig Gen Ronen Manelis told journalists that Hamas - the militant group that controls Gaza - was using Palestinian protests as a cover for launching attacks on Israel. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said Israel bears ""full responsibility"" for bloodshed on Friday. Sixteen Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers at the Gaza border. It was the single deadliest day in the Israel-Palestine conflict since the 2014 Gaza war. The UN Security Council condemned the violence after an emergency session. Thousands of Palestinians had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest, dubbed the Great March of Return. The protest comes ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel and the exodus of many Arabs - which Palestinians refer to as the ""Nakba"" (Catastrophe). Israeli officials said soldiers opened fire after rioting broke out. The UN says hundreds of people were injured. Who are Hamas? Has Hamas changed? Will unity deal end Palestinian feud? On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised soldiers for ""guarding the country's borders, allowing Israelis to celebrate the holiday [of Passover] in peace"". The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent inquiry into Friday's violence. UN deputy political affairs chief Taye-Brook Zerihoun told the council that ""Israel must uphold its responsibilities under international human rights and humanitarian law"". Thousands of Palestinians attended funerals for some of the dead, including Hamdan Abu Amsheh Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, blamed the bloodshed on Hamas. Later Gen Manelis said Friday's events were ""not a protest demonstration"" but ""organised terrorist activity"" by Hamas. ""If it continues, we shall have no choice but to respond inside the Gaza Strip against terrorist targets which we understand to be behind these events,"" he said according to AFP news agency. On Saturday Palestinians observed a day of national mourning for those killed and thousands of people attended funerals. Palestinians also called a general strike. A few hundred protesters returned to a tent city put up near the border in preparation for the demonstration to resume, said AFP. At least 15 people were wounded in renewed clashes along the Gaza border on Saturday, said Gazan health authorities. The first to die was Omar Samour, 27 - a Palestinian farmer killed in Israeli shelling as he worked his land near Khan Younis early on Friday, before the protests began. Most of the other dead - reported to be mainly men under 40 - were shot dead at points along the length of the 65km (40-mile) fenced border, from Jabalia in the north to Rafah in the south, Hamas said five of them were members of its military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, reported Israeli media. Thousands of Palestinians had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest. Its aim is to assert what the protesters regard as their right to return to towns and villages from which their families fled, or were driven out, when the state of Israel was created in 1948. There were clashes near Ramallah Hamas does not recognise Israel, but last year said it was ready to accept an interim Palestinian state limited to Gaza and the West Bank. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah near the Egyptian border. Map showing the position of the five protest camps. Source: Haaretz The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which enforces a no-go zone along the Gaza border, doubled its troop presence for the protest. The IDF said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations near the border fence. It said it had ""enforced a closed military zone"" in the area around Gaza. Although most protesters stayed in the encampments, some groups of youths ignored organisers' calls to stay away from the fence and headed closer to Israeli positions. The IDF said troops were ""firing towards the main instigators"" to break up rioting, in which petrol bombs and stones were thrown at the fence. A spokesman said all those who were killed had been trying to breach or damage the border fence, the Jerusalem Post reports. The Palestinian side accused Israel of using disproportionate force. Tanks and snipers were deployed, and witnesses said a drone was used to drop tear gas in at least one location. The Palestinian envoy to the UN Riyad Mansour told the council that more than 1,400 Palestinian civilians had been injured.

"Sky One's new sitcom, In the Long Run, is a kind-hearted, rose-tinted, lovingly nostalgic 1980s period piece, which is as warm as a fresh Pot Noodle. It feels dated, but then it's supposed to. Great attention to detail has been paid to the look and feel of the London estate on which it is set. The same applies to the soundtrack, which - for anybody who grew up in the 80s - is good enough to be slightly distracting. So frequent are the track changes - from The Cure, to Bowie, to The Clash - you inadvertently find yourself drifting back in time to Peter Powell's Radio One show and playing imaginary Spot-the-Intro. If you've got an old Sony Walkman stashed away somewhere, now might be a good time to pop it on eBay. That the show makes Only Fools and Horses feel edgy came as a bit of a surprise, given its creator is the actor Idris Elba. Elba in the slightly more serious role of Luther This is a man who has made his name playing uncompromising tough guys. First off, there was his superb portrayal as the villainous Stringer Bell in The Wire, and then came Luther, the British detective with a penchant for violence. It's hard playing a hard man, but it's harder still being a funny guy. And maybe even tougher when it is your own story you're sending up, which is the case here. Idris Elba is the show's creator and star. He plays the newly immigrated Walter Easmon, a character based on his own father, while Sammy Kamara is Kobna, his bright-eyed, asthma-suffering 12-year old son who is - to some extent - the young Idris. Sammy Kamara (Kobna), Madeline Appiah (Agnes), Idris Elba (Walter) and Jimmy Akingbola (Valentine) The back story and set-up are dealt with in the opening scenes, in which we see Walter reading a letter from his mother sent from her home in Sierra Leone. She congratulates him for coming to London and starting a new life with his wife and child, and then casually drops in that she is sending his younger brother Valentine (Jimmy Akingbola) to live with him, before signing off with ""look after my little boy please"". At this point a drop of water falls on the letter, suggesting a tear but proving to be a leak from the flat above, inhabited by Walter's best friend, Bagpipes (Bill Bailey) and his partner Kirsty (Kellie Shirley) and an unresolved issue. Walter's neighbour Bagpipes is played by Bill Bailey Cut to Valentine's arrival at the airport, where we discover he is not a ""little boy"" at all, but a very big character with an eye for the ladies and an ear for the decks. Cue much hilarity and some sharp, well-observed scriptwriting as this naÃ¯ve rascal gets stuck into life in a riot-torn inner city where casual racism is the lingua franca. Well, that's what was billed. In reality, there's not that much hilarity. Sammy Kamara (as Kobna) and Mattie Boys (as Dean) That's partly down to the writing and partly down to the acting. Jimmy Akingbola is a very welcome screen presence but has a tendency to over-egg things, while Elba can appear a little stiff at times while he waits to deliver a comic line. The stand-out performance comes from Madeline Appiah as Agnes, Walter's intelligent, responsible wife, who works selling makeup door-to-door to a largely ungrateful clientele. Madeline Appiah, as Agnes, delivers the stand-out performance There are moments where the vibe feels more Grange Hill than a super-sharp 21st century sitcom to compete with the high-quality output regularly produced by Saturday Night Live-hardened writers and performers. But that's okay, because it offers something else. For starters, it's refreshing to have a story told from a black, British, working-class perspective. And secondly, it is only the beginning. The optimistic tone set in the first two episodes might be surprising, but it is also compelling. Added to which, it creates a fertile environment for Bill Bailey's deadpan pathos, and a safety net for Valentine to fall into when he's pushed his luck once too often.

"This video can not be played Malala Yousafzai: ""My focus is only working for the good"" Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has returned to her hometown in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot there by the Taliban. Ms Yousafzai, who now lives in the UK, was shot in the head for campaigning for female education in 2012. Her family's home region of Swat was once a militant stronghold, and she was attacked on a school bus there at 15. It had been unclear if the 20 year old would visit the area because of security concerns. On Thursday, it was announced that Ms Yousafzai had returned to Pakistan for the first time since she was attacked. ""When I gave my first talk... I just could not stop my tears. It is emotional,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm just so happy to be home and to put my feet on this land again."" A helicopter carrying Ms Yousafzai landed not far from her family home in Mingora on Saturday, amid a tight security operation. Ms Yousafzai arrived in the Swat Valley by helicopter She then spoke at an all-boys school just outside of the town. ""My dream has come true. Peace has returned to Swat because of the invaluable sacrifices rendered by my brothers and sisters,"" she said. Her trip to Pakistan is expected to last four days. Officials from her Malala Fund group are travelling with her, local media report. By Usman Zahid, BBC News The timing of Malala's visit is significant, offering an opportunity for Pakistan to show the international community that security in the country has improved since 2012. Some, such as Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, say the country's government will use the moment to show that they have gained control. Yusufzai, however, points out that while the security situation in the country has certainly improved, Malala's visit was always going to be symbolic and as such was likely to invoke special measures, such as a heavy army presence. Furthermore the authorities, aware that Malala's return to her native land - even for a matter of hours - was a cause for concern, deliberately opted not to announce the occasion. The real test of Pakistan's security will come if and when Malala returns to her home town permanently - something she has said she hopes to do many times during her visit. Ms Yousafzai was only 11 years old when she began writing an anonymous diary about life under the Taliban for BBC Urdu that captivated audiences. She wrote about militant suppression and championed the right to education for girls in Pakistan. But she was also unafraid to speak publicly about these issues. This drew the attention of the Taliban militants who were active in the region and her family soon  began receiving death threats. ""I was concerned about her security,"" Pakistani television presenter Hamid Mir told the BBC in 2013. On the afternoon of 9 October 2012, Ms Yousafzai walked out of school as normal and boarded a small bus waiting outside. Soon after two militants boarded the bus before one asked: ""Who is Malala?"" They shot her in the head. Two of her friends were also injured. After initial surgery in Pakistan for her injuries in 2012, she was transferred to the UK for her recovery The teenager sustained life-threatening injuries, and spent weeks in intensive care before having part of her skull removed to relieve swelling on her brain. The attack stunned Pakistan - many people did not believe the Taliban would target a child - and catapulted Ms Yousafzai to international fame. The Pakistani Taliban said they had shot her because she was ""promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas"". Since her recovery, Ms Yousafzai has continued to speak up for children's education and rights around the world. She set up the Malala Fund with her father Ziauddin, with the goal of ""working for a world where every girl can learn and lead without fear"". Allow Twitter content?

In 2014 she became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She and Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi were jointly awarded it for their efforts for children's rights. She has continued campaigning while pursuing her studies, and is now reading Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University. Ms Yousafzai says she plans to return to Pakistan permanently once she has completed her degree. Ms Yousafzai remains a polarising figure in Pakistan. While the majority of people support her, she is the subject of fierce criticism from those who say she is shaming her country. She is often targeted with online abuse by conservatives who believe she is following what they see as a Western agenda. For them, women getting an education is daunting and dangerous, especially in rural areas, where millions of girls drop out of school and end up doing household work, says BBC Urdu editor Haroon Rashid. Ms Yousafzai is often targeted by online abuse A group of private schools in Pakistan declared Friday to be ""I Am Not Malala Day"". A spokesman for the schools said they disagreed with her ""anti-Islam and anti-Pakistan ideology"". But this criticism comes as a surprise to Ms Yousafzai. ""I don't understand. Why do they oppose me? What is the reason behind it?,"" she said in an interview with the BBC. ""I do not even look at these comments. Maybe they would hope that I see but I don't see."" She added: ""The only thing I would say is that I love Pakistan and I am Pakistani and I want a better future for this country.""

"The bus was gutted by the blaze, which also caused damage to the front of the terminal building Flights at Stansted Airport have resumed after a fire on a shuttle bus forced departures to be cancelled. Footage showed black smoke shrouding the terminal building when a bus burst into flames on Friday. No-one was injured but passengers described an atmosphere of confusion in the aftermath as flight details disappeared from departure boards. Extra flights are scheduled and airport bosses apologised but said cancelling departures was the right thing to do. Airport bosses have advised passengers to check flights with their airlines. Stansted's chief operating officer Brad Miller said the decision to cancel flights had been a ""very difficult"" one to take. This video can not be played Parts of its terminal were evacuated The blaze, which started at 16:20 BST on Friday after an electrical fault, ""completely destroyed"" the bus. It caused smoke damage to ""much of the front of the terminal building,"" said firefighters, who had the blaze under control by 17:00. Later that evening Stansted Airport tweeted that all flights up until midnight were cancelled and passengers were asked to leave the airport. Passengers have described chaotic scenes inside the terminal There were few staff to advise passengers of what to do, Stephen Fottrell said Several passengers described chaotic scenes inside the terminal after the fire was put out. BBC journalist Stephen Fottrell was due to fly to Ireland. ""Once flights started to be cancelled they disappeared from the screen and we had a bizarre situation where the screens went blank. My flight came up as cancelled for just a couple of minutes and then it disappeared,"" he said. ""People were going to the airline website checking their flights and all the information had gone from there too."" Mr Fottrell told BBC 5Live he had ""never seen anything like it"". ""The level of confusion among people stood out - they just didn't know what was happening,"" he said. ""It was the usual situation of very few staff on the ground and they were doing their best but they were saying they didn't work for the airlines."" The shuttle bus fire was caused by an electrical fault It was an experience shared by Taylor Fulton-Ward, 18, from Hertfordshire, who was flying to Dublin with her family for the Easter weekend. She said: ""Our flight disappeared from the board with no communication. We went back through to check in to try and re-book the flight but the crowds were crazy. ""Announcements were telling us to leave the building, but the doors were not open - so people began pushing and panicking."" Stansted chief Brad Miller said his staff dealt with the incident ""correctly"" despite criticism from travellers The airport said flights had resumed and were ""operating as normal"", although it advised passengers to check with their airlines. Mr Miller said: ""Some of the airlines are putting on rescue or repatriation flights so I would encourage everyone to reach out to their airline. ""We should be able to get them to where they are travelling to as quickly as possible."" He added the airport's priority was the ""safety and security of everyone using the airport"". ""We're absolutely satisfied this was dealt with correctly."" About 100 bags left at the airport during the fire are due to be picked up by their owners or dispatched to their destinations by the relevant airlines. Passengers queued to get into Stansted after the fire One of Stansted's biggest carriers, Ryanair, said its flights at the airport were operating normally and it had put on an extra 12 flights. ""We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by these cancellations, which were entirely outside of our control, and we are working hard to re-accommodate all those affected,"" it said. It warned travellers to allow extra time for their journeys and to check its website. This video can not be played Flight delay compensation: When can you claim? Mr Miller said about 100 flights to and from Stansted had been disrupted and staff had made the right decision to cancel further flights after people were moved from the smoke-filled check-in area to the area beyond security. ""The safest place we could get them to in the terminal happened to be airside - that caused some conflict between the people who had been properly screened through security, and people who hadn't. ""We couldn't let anyone fly if we weren't sure that they hadn't mixed with people who hadn't gone through the proper security protocol. While it was a very difficult call, I think [staff] made the right decision.""

"The crisis of school funding in England is turning into a catastrophe, the largest teaching union has said. Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Education Union, said schools were not absorbing budget cuts, instead many were cutting posts and increasing class sizes. He highlighted research with his union suggesting many schools were covering classes with teaching assistants. The government said core school funding was rising to Â£43.5bn by 2020. Mr Courtney said: ""Schools minister Nick Gibb would have us believe that schools have absorbed the cuts. ""We think that's absolutely wrong, schools have not absorbed these cuts and the cuts are going to continue over the lifetime of this government."" He said a generation of children were being made to shoulder the impact of the economic crisis. ""Whoever caused this economic crisis, it wasn't our five-year-olds in schools now,"" he said, adding that they had not even been born when Lehman Brothers collapsed at the start of the financial crisis in 2008. Schools have been struggling as they face rising costs and growing pupil numbers. The survey of 900 teachers presented at the union's conference in Brighton also suggested schools were topping up budgets with parental contributions and by renting out buildings. Ministers have insisted that more money is going into schools, although earlier this month the Education Secretary Damien Hinds did acknowledge that funding was ""tight"". One in five of those questioned said their school had asked parents for money to help with school funding in the current academic year. Nearly two thirds (64%) of secondary school staff polled and just over a third (35%) of those working in primaries said their school was renting out buildings. Some 5.5% of those in secondaries and 3.5% of those in primaries said their school had accepted advertising on its premises. A spokesman for the Department for Education said by 2020 schools would be getting 50% more per pupil in real terms than they got in 2000 - and that the introduction of the National Funding Formula would address historic funding disparities.

"The bus was gutted by the blaze, which also caused damage to the front of the terminal building Flights at Stansted Airport have resumed after a fire on a shuttle bus forced departures to be cancelled. Footage showed black smoke shrouding the terminal building when a bus burst into flames on Friday. No-one was injured but passengers described an atmosphere of confusion in the aftermath as flight details disappeared from departure boards. Extra flights are scheduled and airport bosses apologised but said cancelling departures was the right thing to do. Airport bosses have advised passengers to check flights with their airlines. Stansted's chief operating officer Brad Miller said the decision to cancel flights had been a ""very difficult"" one to take. This video can not be played Parts of its terminal were evacuated The blaze, which started at 16:20 BST on Friday after an electrical fault, ""completely destroyed"" the bus. It caused smoke damage to ""much of the front of the terminal building,"" said firefighters, who had the blaze under control by 17:00. Later that evening Stansted Airport tweeted that all flights up until midnight were cancelled and passengers were asked to leave the airport. Passengers have described chaotic scenes inside the terminal There were few staff to advise passengers of what to do, Stephen Fottrell said Several passengers described chaotic scenes inside the terminal after the fire was put out. BBC journalist Stephen Fottrell was due to fly to Ireland. ""Once flights started to be cancelled they disappeared from the screen and we had a bizarre situation where the screens went blank. My flight came up as cancelled for just a couple of minutes and then it disappeared,"" he said. ""People were going to the airline website checking their flights and all the information had gone from there too."" Mr Fottrell told BBC 5Live he had ""never seen anything like it"". ""The level of confusion among people stood out - they just didn't know what was happening,"" he said. ""It was the usual situation of very few staff on the ground and they were doing their best but they were saying they didn't work for the airlines."" The shuttle bus fire was caused by an electrical fault It was an experience shared by Taylor Fulton-Ward, 18, from Hertfordshire, who was flying to Dublin with her family for the Easter weekend. She said: ""Our flight disappeared from the board with no communication. We went back through to check in to try and re-book the flight but the crowds were crazy. ""Announcements were telling us to leave the building, but the doors were not open - so people began pushing and panicking."" Stansted chief Brad Miller said his staff dealt with the incident ""correctly"" despite criticism from travellers The airport said flights had resumed and were ""operating as normal"", although it advised passengers to check with their airlines. Mr Miller said: ""Some of the airlines are putting on rescue or repatriation flights so I would encourage everyone to reach out to their airline. ""We should be able to get them to where they are travelling to as quickly as possible."" He added the airport's priority was the ""safety and security of everyone using the airport"". ""We're absolutely satisfied this was dealt with correctly."" About 100 bags left at the airport during the fire are due to be picked up by their owners or dispatched to their destinations by the relevant airlines. Passengers queued to get into Stansted after the fire One of Stansted's biggest carriers, Ryanair, said its flights at the airport were operating normally and it had put on an extra 12 flights. ""We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by these cancellations, which were entirely outside of our control, and we are working hard to re-accommodate all those affected,"" it said. It warned travellers to allow extra time for their journeys and to check its website. This video can not be played Flight delay compensation: When can you claim? Mr Miller said about 100 flights to and from Stansted had been disrupted and staff had made the right decision to cancel further flights after people were moved from the smoke-filled check-in area to the area beyond security. ""The safest place we could get them to in the terminal happened to be airside - that caused some conflict between the people who had been properly screened through security, and people who hadn't. ""We couldn't let anyone fly if we weren't sure that they hadn't mixed with people who hadn't gone through the proper security protocol. While it was a very difficult call, I think [staff] made the right decision.""

"This video can not be played Clashes took place along Gaza's border with Israel The Israeli military has warned it could take action against ""terrorist targets"" inside the Gaza Strip. Brig Gen Ronen Manelis told journalists that Hamas - the militant group that controls Gaza - was using Palestinian protests as a cover for launching attacks on Israel. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said Israel bears ""full responsibility"" for bloodshed on Friday. Sixteen Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers at the Gaza border. It was the single deadliest day in the Israel-Palestine conflict since the 2014 Gaza war. The UN Security Council condemned the violence after an emergency session. Thousands of Palestinians had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest, dubbed the Great March of Return. The protest comes ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel and the exodus of many Arabs - which Palestinians refer to as the ""Nakba"" (Catastrophe). Israeli officials said soldiers opened fire after rioting broke out. The UN says hundreds of people were injured. Who are Hamas? Has Hamas changed? Will unity deal end Palestinian feud? On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised soldiers for ""guarding the country's borders, allowing Israelis to celebrate the holiday [of Passover] in peace"". The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent inquiry into Friday's violence. UN deputy political affairs chief Taye-Brook Zerihoun told the council that ""Israel must uphold its responsibilities under international human rights and humanitarian law"". Thousands of Palestinians attended funerals for some of the dead, including Hamdan Abu Amsheh Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, blamed the bloodshed on Hamas. Later Gen Manelis said Friday's events were ""not a protest demonstration"" but ""organised terrorist activity"" by Hamas. ""If it continues, we shall have no choice but to respond inside the Gaza Strip against terrorist targets which we understand to be behind these events,"" he said according to AFP news agency. On Saturday Palestinians observed a day of national mourning for those killed and thousands of people attended funerals. Palestinians also called a general strike. A few hundred protesters returned to a tent city put up near the border in preparation for the demonstration to resume, said AFP. At least 15 people were wounded in renewed clashes along the Gaza border on Saturday, said Gazan health authorities. The first to die was Omar Samour, 27 - a Palestinian farmer killed in Israeli shelling as he worked his land near Khan Younis early on Friday, before the protests began. Most of the other dead - reported to be mainly men under 40 - were shot dead at points along the length of the 65km (40-mile) fenced border, from Jabalia in the north to Rafah in the south, Hamas said five of them were members of its military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, reported Israeli media. Thousands of Palestinians had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest. Its aim is to assert what the protesters regard as their right to return to towns and villages from which their families fled, or were driven out, when the state of Israel was created in 1948. There were clashes near Ramallah Hamas does not recognise Israel, but last year said it was ready to accept an interim Palestinian state limited to Gaza and the West Bank. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah near the Egyptian border. Map showing the position of the five protest camps. Source: Haaretz The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which enforces a no-go zone along the Gaza border, doubled its troop presence for the protest. The IDF said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations near the border fence. It said it had ""enforced a closed military zone"" in the area around Gaza. Although most protesters stayed in the encampments, some groups of youths ignored organisers' calls to stay away from the fence and headed closer to Israeli positions. The IDF said troops were ""firing towards the main instigators"" to break up rioting, in which petrol bombs and stones were thrown at the fence. A spokesman said all those who were killed had been trying to breach or damage the border fence, the Jerusalem Post reports. The Palestinian side accused Israel of using disproportionate force. Tanks and snipers were deployed, and witnesses said a drone was used to drop tear gas in at least one location. The Palestinian envoy to the UN Riyad Mansour told the council that more than 1,400 Palestinian civilians had been injured.

"If approved, the US state department proposal could affect around 14.7 million people a year The Trump administration has said it wants to start collecting the social media history of nearly everyone seeking a visa to enter the US. The proposal, which comes from the state department, would require most visa applicants to give details of their Facebook and Twitter accounts. They would have to disclose all social media identities used in the past five years. About 14.7 million people a year would be affected by the proposals. The information would be used to identify and vet those seeking both immigrant and non-immigrant visas. Applicants would also be asked for five years of their telephone numbers, email addresses and travel history. They would be required to say if they had ever been deported from a country, or if any relatives had been involved in terrorist activity. The proposals would place an additional burden on travellers whose countries do not have a visa exemption deal with the US The proposal would not affect citizens from countries to which the US grants visa-free travel status - among them the UK, Canada, France and Germany. However, citizens from non-exempt countries like India, China and Mexico could be embroiled if they visit the US for work or a holiday. Officials defended the proposal by saying it would help to identify potential extremists. Social media came under scrutiny after the shootings in 2015 in San Bernadino, California, in which 14 people died. The authorities said they had missed signs of radicalisation in messages on a messaging platform sent between the attackers. Under rules brought in last May, officials were told to seek people's social media handles only if they felt ""that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting"", a state department official said at the time. The tougher proposal comes after President Trump promised to implement ""extreme vetting"" for foreigners entering the US, which he said was to combat terrorism. ""Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,"" the state department said in a statement, quoted by the New York Times. ""We already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity."" The idea is subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget. The public will have two months to comment on the proposal before it makes a decision. Trump 'in crude outburst about migrants' Trump's immigration plan sparks uproar Civil liberties groups have condemned the policy as an invasion of privacy that could damage free speech. ""People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,"" said Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""We're also concerned about how the Trump administration defines the vague and over-broad term 'terrorist activities' because it is inherently political and can be used to discriminate against immigrants who have done nothing wrong,"" she said. The social media platforms covered in the proposal include US-based entities such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit and YouTube.However, the New York Times reports that overseas platforms such as China's Sina Weibo and Russia's VK social network would also be included,external.

"The couple got married on 18 February A ""wedding bomb"" that killed a newly-married software engineer and left his wife grievously wounded has shattered the peace of a small town in India. Nearly a month after the incident, the police have made no headway. Soutik Biswas travels to the eastern state of Orissa to piece together the story of a killing that has riveted India. On a bright summer afternoon on 23 February, five days after their marriage, Soumya Sekhar Sahu, a 26-year-old software engineer, and his 22-year-old wife Reema, were pottering around in the kitchen at his newly-built family home in Patnagarh, a drowsy, nondescript town in Orissa. They were planning to grill eggplant and make some lentil soup for lunch when Soumya heard the clanging of the latch of their metal gate. A delivery man stood outside, holding a parcel addressed to him. A fraying sticker on the box said it had been sent by SK Sharma from Raipur, some 230km (142 miles) away. Reema remembers her husband opening the box in the kitchen, and finding a parcel covered in green paper with a white thread sticking out of it, while his 85-year-old grand-aunt Jemamani Sahu came up from behind to see what the parcel contained. ""This looks like a wedding gift,"" Soumya Sekhar told his wife. ""The only thing that I don't know is the sender. I don't know anyone in Raipur."" As he pulled the thread, there was a flash of light and a huge explosion rocked the kitchen. The three were knocked off their feet, and collapsed on the tiled floor, bleeding profusely. The blast had ripped the plaster off the ceiling, blown apart the water purifier, sent the kitchen window flying into an adjacent field, and cracked the green painted walls. The three writhed in pain on the blood-splattered floor. Jeemamani Sahu was on fire. ""Save me. I think I am dying,"" Soumya Sekhar groaned before losing consciousness. A video grab of the kitchen moments after the incident That was the last time Reema heard her husband speak. The burns stung her face and arms. With smoke filling her lungs, she struggled to breathe. Her eardrum had punctured, so she barely heard the hum of panicky neighbours rushing in and asking whether the cooking gas cylinder had exploded. Her vision was blurring as debris clogged her eyes. Still Reema managed to crawl to the bedroom, and pick up the phone to call her mother-in-law, a principal in a local college. She passed out before she could make the call. Video footage from the house minutes after the blast shows distraught neighbours carrying away the three wounded residents in bed-sheets to a waiting ambulance. Soumya Sekhar and Jemamani Sahu, who both suffered from 90% burns, died as they were being moved to hospital. Reema is recovering slowly in a cramped room in the burns ward in a government hospital. Deadly Texas parcel bomb attacks 'linked' India groom killed in Odisha after wedding gift explodes More than a month after the horrific murder, no one appears to have the faintest idea who killed Soumya Sekhar, described as a ""genial and god fearing young man who worshipped a guru"" by relatives and friends. ""We are simple people with simple lives. I have no enemies. My daughter has no enemies. My son-in-law had no enemies. I don't suspect anybody, and I don't know who could have done this,"" Sudam Charan Sahu, Reema's father, told me. Their families had introduced them, and the two had been engaged for a little more than a year. Reema's father, a garments trader, adopted her from his younger brother because he wanted a daughter after his two sons, and his brother had three daughters. The cheerful and pretty girl went to a local college and graduated with an Oriya language degree. Soumya Sekhar's parents were both college teachers - his father taught zoology. He had studied computer science and worked with info-tech companies in Mysore and Chandigarh, before joining a Japanese electronics firm in Bangalore two months ago. More than 800 people attended the reception at Mr Sahu's house ""They met a few times before the marriage in presence of their families. They were a happy couple. Why would someone want to kill him?"" Soumya Sekhar's father, Rabindra Kumar Sahu, 57, said. The only indication of something amiss seems to be one mysterious call that Soumya Sekhar received when he was in Bangalore. ""The call came last year,"" Reema told me. ""We were talking on the phone, and he said there was a call coming in. And I vaguely remember he put me on hold, and later told me, 'I got a threatening call. A man on the line told me not to marry.'"" He didn't mention any more calls, and by the time the marriage happened, ""we had completely forgotten about the call"". Two dozen investigators have questioned more than 100 people - friends and relatives of the couple mainly - in four cities in connection with the killing. They have scoured mobile phone records, and scanned laptops and phones belonging to the couple. Hopes were raised when cyber sleuths found the parcel had been tracked online twice from a private computer institute in Kalahandi district, some 119km away, leading to speculation that the killer may have been following it. But eventually they found it was the courier company itself that had been tracking the consignment. The only thing the police know for sure is that the parcel was sent from Raipur, under a false name and address. The killer, who paid 400 rupees ($6.14; Â£4.35) for the delivery, had chosen the courier company carefully: there were no CCTV cameras in their office, and the parcel was not scanned. The parcel then made a 650km journey on three buses and passed through four pairs of hands before reaching Patangarh on 20 February. The delivery man made a run the same evening to Soumya Sekhar's residence, but returned without delivering the package because ""he saw a big marriage reception going on at the place"", Dilip Kumar Das, the local manager of the courier company, explained. Three days later, the man finally delivered the parcel at the gate. Forensic experts are still trying to ascertain how sophisticated the bomb was. On the face of it, investigators say, it appeared to be a fairly crude device wrapped in jute thread which spewed white smoke after the blast. One of the last pictures of the couple at the reception The lack of strong leads means that the investigators are contemplating several motives behind the killing. Was it the work of a spurned or scorned lover? The police still have no clue, but say they are investigating why Soumya Sekhar deleted his Facebook account weeks before his marriage and opened a new one. Was the killing related to a property dispute in the Sahu family, where Soumya Sekhar was the only son and the natural heir? Investigators say they need to question more family members before coming to any conclusions. Did the murder have anything to do with a feud that Reema had in her secondary school, when a classmate harassed her and her parents had to lodge a complaint with the principal? It seems highly unlikely because the incident happened nearly six years ago. Also, how did the sender of the bomb manage to get his hands on an explosive and pack and send it to the target so easily? Was it a contract killing? ""This is a fiendishly complex case,"" Balangir's senior police official Sashi Bhusan Satpathy said. ""This was the work of a fairly knowledgeable person well-versed in the arts of bomb making."" Reema is still in hospital, and her tragedy became a spectacle on Monday when a family member whipped out his mobile phone and recorded her breaking down after she discovered from an old newspaper in her room that her husband had been killed in the blast. For nearly three weeks, her family hadn't broken the news to her. Now, she was crying inconsolably. ""You lied to me, you didn't tell me the truth,"" she wailed at her father, as he broke down. By the evening, the video of this private moment of grief was showing on local TV. ""We thought maybe this would move the government to step up the investigation and arrest the culprit soon,"" her father said. ""That's all we want.""

What are the UK's favourite drinks and how often are adults drinking? In 2016, 500 pubs across the UK called last orders for the final time. Since 2000, the number of pubs in the UK has fallen by 17%, or 10,500 pubs, according to theBritish Beer & Pub Association (BBPA).,external The decline has been blamed on a number of reasons - high taxes on pints,the smoking ban,the price of food and drink going up, and the 2008 recession meaning that consumers had less to spend in their local. But the BBPA say that the rate of pub closures is slowing down. About 1,100 pubs closed their doors in 2015, but fewer than half that number closed in 2016. The volume of beer sold in supermarkets and off-licences (off-trade) in the UK topped the volume sold in pubs, clubs and restaurants (on-trade) for the first time in 2014. Since 2000, the amount of beer people are buying in supermarkets and shops has increased by 27%. The affordability of beer in supermarkets and off-licences has risen by 188% since 1987, according to a study by theInstitute of Alcohol Studies (IAS).,external Measuring affordability using an index which adjusts prices for inflation and income growth, the IAS reports that the affordability of wine and spirits has gone up by 131%. But prices in pubs have been rising steadily. According to the BBPA, the average pub price of a pint of draught lager cost Â£3.58 on average in 2017, up 36% on 2007. The number of adults who say they drink alcohol is at its lowest level since surveys began in 2005, according to theOffice for National Statistics (ONS).,external In 2016, 57% of British adults said they drank alcohol in the week before being interviewed. Since 2005, there has also been a 2% increase in the number of adults who say they don't drink alcohol at all - around 10.6 million people in the population of Great Britain. Young people are the least likely to have drunk alcohol in the last week, and 27% of 16-24 year olds describe themselves as teetotal. But that age group is also the most likely to ""binge drink"" on their heaviest drinking day. Most women surveyed (27%) reported drinking between three and six units of alcohol on their heaviest drinking day - down from 33% a decade before. Among men in Great Britain, most (33%) drank between four and eight units of alcohol on their heaviest day. This was a drop from 40% in 2006. For women, binge drinking was defined as exceeding six units, whereas for men it meant consuming more than eight units of alcohol. The ONS also note that the survey data is likely to underestimate drinking levels, because people might underestimate their alcohol consumption. This video can not be played ""People are drinking less, but they're drinking better quality,"" says William Chase In 2016, England had the highest percentage of people who said they drank alcohol in the week before they were surveyed, at 57%. This was down from 59% in 2015. Three in four people in the south-west of England had drunk alcohol in the previous week, higher than all of the other English regions, while fewer than half of Londoners had partaken. Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? A total of 55% of drinkers in Wales enjoyed a tipple in the previous week according to the 2016 figures, a drop from 58% in 2015. The survey also found that people in Scotland drink the least often in Great Britain - 53% of adults had drunk in the previous week in 2016, compared with 57% surveyed the year before. The Scottish were however the most likely to report that they ""binged"" on their heaviest day of drinking, at 32% of drinkers, followed by Wales (30%) and England (26%). Sales of gins and craft beers have increased recently. Last year, theONS,externalput gin in the basket of goods it monitors to measure inflation (how much the cost of living is changing in the UK). Once known as ""mother's ruin"", gin sales topped Â£348m in the UK in 2016, almost three times the Â£126m total in 2009. As demand for artisan-style beers has increased, more microbreweries have been popping up across the country. There are now 2,000 breweries in the UK - the highest number on record since the 1930s, according toCamra.,external The number rose by 64% in four years, from 1,218 in 2012, to 1,994 in 2016. Children are now an accepted presence in many pubs - something that would have seemed unthinkable a few generations ago. In 1995, the ban on children under 14 going into pubs in England and Wales was lifted. Many pubs took this as an opportunity to remodel themselves as more family-friendly and food-focused. According to retail researchersMintel,,externalpub meals recorded an estimated 3% increase in sales to Â£7.4bn in 2016, while the volume of alcoholic drinks consumed in bars and pubs went down in the same year. Pubs are now becoming all-day dining destinations, with special offers for younger visitors. Children's menus, play areas and separate dining rooms for families are often seen in British pubs. However, this change has not gone entirely without resistance. Children's behaviour topped the list of complaints by pub regulars in 2016, according toThe Good Pub Guide.,external Details of organisations offering information and support with issues relating to alcohol are available atbbc.co.uk/actionline Pubs to stay open later for Royal wedding Man completes 20,000-mile pub adventure Pubs facing triple tax whammy, says Camra Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played BBC report reunites HK actor with brothers Hong Kong actor Anthony Wong spent decades looking for the father who left him as a child. Now, he says a BBC report on his search has helped him find a family who never knew him. It's late March, and three men are gathered for a meeting they'd never thought they would have. One man is Anthony Wong, one of the most famous actors in the Chinese-speaking world, known for his roles in films like Infernal Affairs and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. The other two are silver-haired, 74-year-old Englishmen - Anthony's two half-brothers that he had never met until last week. ""Amazing, impossible - a miracle"" is how the actor, 56, described it. For decades, the celebrity looked for traces of his British father, who left him when he was four. Fragmented information from his Cantonese mother about the former Hong Kong government official had led him nowhere. He knew only his name - Frederick William Perry - and had some basic biographical details and a handful of photographs. Anthony Wong with his parents Frederick William Perry and Wong Juen-yee Earlier this year, Anthony spoke to BBC Chinese about his search. He described how, without his father, he had grown up feeling ""trapped in between"" his British and Hong Kong identities, and how he hoped the internet would help bring him some answers. The day after the BBC published his story, a Facebook thread was set up by people wanting to help him. Three separate women following the page around the world began looking for information and passing it on to him. ""New clues came almost every day,"" Anthony said. On 2 March, he sent another post saying that someone had found biographical information of his possible father and his English family. He could hardly dare to believe they were his relatives, but the names and years seemed to match perfectly. ""I was like, 'no way!'"" he says. Meet me on the bridge: Discovering the truth after 20 years Argentina stolen baby found after 40 years 'I found the man who saved my life' Why was I left on a hillside to die? At the same time, John Perry, 74, was on a cruise ship in the Pacific with his twin brother, David. They picked up an email from a cousin in England saying there was ""a rather sensitive matter I should know about"", says John. Meanwhile, David's son sent him a photograph from the film, which showed Perry Sr holding Anthony as a baby. When they got back home to Melbourne, Australia, where they have lived for the past few decades, they watched the BBC story and saw a man who was, without question, their father. ""We were quite amazed about the whole thing,"" John says of the moment they saw that video. Anthony Wong has starred in more than 150 movies Not knowing how to contact Anthony directly, they emailed a company mentioned in the video, Dionysus Contemporary Theatre, saying there was a chance that they and Anthony were ""half-brothers at least"". When they were finally able to get in direct contact with Anthony, David and John were shocked. ""After picking myself off the floor, we talked about it, Dave and I. And we decided we'd better come over and see him,"" said John. On 20 March, the three met in Hong Kong. ""It was just incredible,"" Anthony said. ""After all these years and suddenly it all happened in two weeks!"" ""We hit it off straight away,"" said David. (L-R) Anthony Wong and David and John Perry Sadly, Perry Sr had died in 1988. The Perry brothers say he had never once mentioned his second family. ""We had no inkling about what happened,"" David said. The brothers spent their meeting piecing together the missing parts of their lives. Anthony learned that Frederick William Perry was a Royal Air Force veteran, who served in the Battle of Britain. In 1955, he arrived in Hong Kong - then a British colony - to work in a government logistics office. He brought with him his wife Vera Marjorie, their daughter Vera Ann, and twin sons John and David. A few years later, the family visited the UK. John and David stayed to join the RAF, but Frederick returned to Hong Kong. ""That year or soon after, he must have met Anthony's mother,"" said David. According to Anthony, who was born in 1961, Frederick Perry left him and his mother, Wong Juen-yee, in the mid-60s and moved to Australia with his other family. They exchanged letters for a few years, but all contact was lost when Anthony was 12. After serving in the RAF, David and John moved to Australia to join their father. David said he would've liked to have known about Anthony long ago. But both brothers said they weren't upset at finding out the secret that was kept from them for decades. They believe their mother, who died in 1972, wouldn't have known about it either. (L-R) John, Frederick and David Perry ""We know sad things happen in life to a lot of people,"" said David. ""The main thing was to come over and meet Anthony, and get into some background of what happened."" They believe their father would be pleased they're all finally in touch. Anthony's mother is still alive, but is suffering from dementia. He tried to tell her he had found his father, while he was helping her eat dinner, but she could not give a clear response. ""She suddenly stopped eating,"" said Anthony. ""Then I said 'hey, I'm not leaving you. I'll still be here', and she went on eating."" David and John spent a few days in Hong Kong with Anthony before returning to Melbourne. All three told the BBC that they had formed a bond very quickly, and the ""fairly big"" Perry family would love for him to visit them in Australia. ""We want to have a nice get-together and make Anthony feel part of our family - he is part of our family,"" David said. The brothers knew nothing about Anthony's acting career. Anthony Wong as a boy But they have started delving into the internet to find out about the veteran film and stage actor, who has starred in more than 150 movies and won four Hong Kong Film Awards trophies. They stressed that Anthony's fame was not a factor in their reunion. ""Whether he's being an actor or a labourer, it wouldn't make any difference to us,"" David said, adding they would have still come to meet him. Anthony said their meeting helped him, through knowing more about his family, find out more about himself. ""I played music and it turns out my brother did, too. I trained in boxing and it turns out my father had been a middleweight champion,"" he said. ""It's so amazing - it's like all those things were in your genes."" He called this ""a life lesson"", that when he is finally able to make peace with the past, a new journey can begin. ""Dad used to say in his letters that if I was a good boy, he would take care of everything for me,"" he said. ""I think he knows I've become a good boy since then and he's sent two brothers to me.""

"The (mis)behaviour of French waiters has long been a topic of heated discussions A waiter in Canada has claimed he was discriminated against after being fired for ""rude"" behaviour. After all, he said, he was just being, well, French. Eh bien, it's true that the French have a reputation for being a bit offhand. But are they really? Take meeting a new person. In many cultures, greeting someone you don't know warmly is almost instinctive. Not so for the French - and definitely not for Parisians. But perhaps this isn't intended to be rude, and is instead down to a misunderstanding. Talking to strangers, let alone smiling at them, can be seen as intrusive, says 26-year-old Marie Castelin, from Bordeaux, southern France, who has lived in London for four years. Some people like to use manners as a way to express their identity, says Marie Castelin ""[The French] don't like smiling... They think, 'I don't know you so I'm not going to say hello',"" she says. It doesn't mean they don't like you; they'll probably save that smile (or any other sign of affection) for when you know each other a bit better. Many French are no fans of small talk either - forget about your weather comments. They may cut short unnecessary conversations, and get straight to the point, which could come as a shock to the uninitiated. The French reserve their nice behaviour for those they really know, says AmÃ©lie Cauchella Guillaume Rey, the waiter at the centre of the news story in Vancouver, said his co-workers misinterpreted his ""direct, honest and professional"" French personality. He said French culture ""tends to be more direct and expressive"". But his employers, Milestones restaurant, said he used an ""aggressive tone and nature"" with colleagues. The dying art of tipping in France A Google search of the phrase ""Are the French rude"" reveals dozens of tourists' bad experiences; waiters seem to top the list of offenders. But both French peopleand foreigners are also quick to dispute the stereotype.,external ""It's not that the French are rude but they're not like the English,"" says 21-year-old AmÃ©lie Cauchella, from the western city of Nantes, who has worked as a waitress in London since September. ""You're nicer with friends than with people you don't know, like a customer."" France, of course, has its own obsession with etiquette and formality. It's just thatits complex rules dictating table manners and even how to say ""hello"",externaldiffer from other cultures. But those differences don't always justify people's behaviour, says Marie Castelin. ""I have the feeling that some French use it as an excuse. Some people think 'We're particular, you should know it and that's it',"" she says. Julien Mainguy, co-founder of BC Talents, helps francophones from Europe integrate into the workforce in British Columbia. ""Most of the French-speaking people from Europe, they tend to be very direct,"" he told Canada's CBC News.,external ""The culture in Canada, it's a non-conflict culture, particularly in the professional area."" Pierre Massuard, from central Tours, knows it well. The French approach is not always very friendly, says Pierre Massuard He manages a restaurant in London, where he has lived for seven years, and says: ""Whenever I hire a French waiter it's always really hard. ""Because they have a different approach to the business and it isn't as casual and friendly."" Paris is home to France's elite and many admit that being rude or arrogant there can sometimes seem like a social value. As it's the country's capital, it may also be easy to take the behaviour of Parisians as a snapshot of how people behave in the rest of the country. Not so fast, say the French from elsewhere. In southern France, for example, people are generally known for being warmer than those in the north. ""When you smile to people they give you back the smile. So [being rude] is something ridiculous,"" says Ms Castelin.

"Russia is closing the US consulate in St Petersburg as part of its retaliatory measures Russia has announced further measures against UK diplomats while at the same time declaring tit-for-tat expulsions of officials from 23 other countries. It has told the British ambassador to cut staffing to the size of the Russian mission in the UK. Moscow has rejected UK accusations that it is behind the nerve agent attack on an ex-spy and his daughter in the UK. However, some 150 Russians have since been expelled by mainly Western countries. Russia initially hit back at the UK, but then announced 60 US expulsions. On Friday it called in a string of foreign ambassadors with news that their own countries' measures were being matched. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed in Salisbury, England, on 4 March. Mr Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition.Yulia's condition is said to be improving. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital since the attack How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network? What the diplomat expulsions tell us What next for Russiaâs spy networks? Full coverage of the Russia spy poisoning UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday issued a warning over ""a situation that is similar, to a large extent, to what we lived during the Cold War"". In another development, Russia accused British customs officers of trying to search an Aeroflot airliner arriving from Moscow at London's Heathrow airport without allowing the crew to be present. By Paul Adams, BBC News, Moscow British diplomats left Moscow a week ago, but ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned back to the foreign ministry for additional punishment. It's not immediately obvious what it means in practice, but it's clear that Russia sees Britain as the ringleader of an international conspiracy which resulted in the biggest mass expulsion of Russian diplomats in history. Britain's ""provocative and unjustified actions"", the ministry said, had ""inspired the unfounded expulsion of Russian diplomats"". It's a backhanded compliment to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has successfully corralled a wider international coalition than anyone would have thought possible a month ago. Russia has railed against the British government over its efforts to internationalise what officials here call ""the so-called Skripal affair"". The solidarity expressed by so many countries has been dismissed as a result of financial and political pressure, orchestrated in tandem with the US. Twenty-nine countries have expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato has also ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. The US expelled the largest single number - 60 diplomats - and closed the Russian consulate general in Seattle. Russia reciprocated on Thursday declaring 58 US diplomats in Moscow and two in the city of Yekaterinburg to be ""personae non gratae"". It also announced the closure of the US consulate in St Petersburg. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would respond ""in kind"" The US said it had been expecting the move and warned it may take further action. On Friday, ambassadors from Albania, Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine were told to send home staff from their missions - corresponding to the same number of Russians their countries had expelled. A statement by the Russian foreign ministry also said that Russia ""reserves the right to take retaliatory measures"" against Belgium, Hungary, Georgia and Montenegro - countries that had joined the co-ordinated action against Russia ""at the last moment"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed ""harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so-called Skripal case"". He reiterated Russian calls for consular access to Yulia Skripal - a Russian citizen. Russia, he said, was also seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ""establish the truth"". Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? What was the Cold War? Russian spy: The story so far On Friday, in addition to the new Western expulsions, UK Ambassador Laurie Bristow was handed a protest note that said Britain's ""provocative actions"" had led to the decision by other governments to expel Russians. It is not clear how many more British officials will have to leave. Before the expulsion of the 23 Russians, the UK's Foreign Office listed 60 Russian officials working in the UK. Another four are posted at the Russian consulate general in Edinburgh. UK National Security Adviser Mark Sedwill has said expulsions by Western countries are aimed at rooting out covert Russian intelligence networks. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted an unnamed source as saying British ""police"" had boarded the jet once passengers had disembarked and had ""demanded"" the crew leave so that they could conduct a search. The Russian embassy in London said later in a statement that British customs officers had boarded the plane and tried to search it ""without the crew being present"". ""After an Embassy officer arrived at the airport long negotiations were conducted that allowed to ensure the right of the captain to be take part in the search,"" it added. Russia's foreign ministry called it ""the next provocation"" following the fallout from the Skripal affair. There was no immediate official British comment on the Russian accusations but London's Metropolitan Police denied its officers had searched a plane arriving from Moscow. Allow Twitter content?

Britain says the chemical used in the attack was part of a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union known as Novichok. OPCW has sent a team to the UK to investigate samples of the agent Britain says was used. The results are expected to take a minimum of two weeks, the government says. Police say the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at Mr Skripal's home in Salisbury, with the highest concentration found on the front door.

"This video can not be played Malala Yousafzai: ""My focus is only working for the good"" Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has returned to her hometown in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot there by the Taliban. Ms Yousafzai, who now lives in the UK, was shot in the head for campaigning for female education in 2012. Her family's home region of Swat was once a militant stronghold, and she was attacked on a school bus there at 15. It had been unclear if the 20 year old would visit the area because of security concerns. On Thursday, it was announced that Ms Yousafzai had returned to Pakistan for the first time since she was attacked. ""When I gave my first talk... I just could not stop my tears. It is emotional,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm just so happy to be home and to put my feet on this land again."" A helicopter carrying Ms Yousafzai landed not far from her family home in Mingora on Saturday, amid a tight security operation. Ms Yousafzai arrived in the Swat Valley by helicopter She then spoke at an all-boys school just outside of the town. ""My dream has come true. Peace has returned to Swat because of the invaluable sacrifices rendered by my brothers and sisters,"" she said. Her trip to Pakistan is expected to last four days. Officials from her Malala Fund group are travelling with her, local media report. By Usman Zahid, BBC News The timing of Malala's visit is significant, offering an opportunity for Pakistan to show the international community that security in the country has improved since 2012. Some, such as Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, say the country's government will use the moment to show that they have gained control. Yusufzai, however, points out that while the security situation in the country has certainly improved, Malala's visit was always going to be symbolic and as such was likely to invoke special measures, such as a heavy army presence. Furthermore the authorities, aware that Malala's return to her native land - even for a matter of hours - was a cause for concern, deliberately opted not to announce the occasion. The real test of Pakistan's security will come if and when Malala returns to her home town permanently - something she has said she hopes to do many times during her visit. Ms Yousafzai was only 11 years old when she began writing an anonymous diary about life under the Taliban for BBC Urdu that captivated audiences. She wrote about militant suppression and championed the right to education for girls in Pakistan. But she was also unafraid to speak publicly about these issues. This drew the attention of the Taliban militants who were active in the region and her family soon  began receiving death threats. ""I was concerned about her security,"" Pakistani television presenter Hamid Mir told the BBC in 2013. On the afternoon of 9 October 2012, Ms Yousafzai walked out of school as normal and boarded a small bus waiting outside. Soon after two militants boarded the bus before one asked: ""Who is Malala?"" They shot her in the head. Two of her friends were also injured. After initial surgery in Pakistan for her injuries in 2012, she was transferred to the UK for her recovery The teenager sustained life-threatening injuries, and spent weeks in intensive care before having part of her skull removed to relieve swelling on her brain. The attack stunned Pakistan - many people did not believe the Taliban would target a child - and catapulted Ms Yousafzai to international fame. The Pakistani Taliban said they had shot her because she was ""promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas"". Since her recovery, Ms Yousafzai has continued to speak up for children's education and rights around the world. She set up the Malala Fund with her father Ziauddin, with the goal of ""working for a world where every girl can learn and lead without fear"". Allow Twitter content?

In 2014 she became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She and Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi were jointly awarded it for their efforts for children's rights. She has continued campaigning while pursuing her studies, and is now reading Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University. Ms Yousafzai says she plans to return to Pakistan permanently once she has completed her degree. Ms Yousafzai remains a polarising figure in Pakistan. While the majority of people support her, she is the subject of fierce criticism from those who say she is shaming her country. She is often targeted with online abuse by conservatives who believe she is following what they see as a Western agenda. For them, women getting an education is daunting and dangerous, especially in rural areas, where millions of girls drop out of school and end up doing household work, says BBC Urdu editor Haroon Rashid. Ms Yousafzai is often targeted by online abuse A group of private schools in Pakistan declared Friday to be ""I Am Not Malala Day"". A spokesman for the schools said they disagreed with her ""anti-Islam and anti-Pakistan ideology"". But this criticism comes as a surprise to Ms Yousafzai. ""I don't understand. Why do they oppose me? What is the reason behind it?,"" she said in an interview with the BBC. ""I do not even look at these comments. Maybe they would hope that I see but I don't see."" She added: ""The only thing I would say is that I love Pakistan and I am Pakistani and I want a better future for this country.""

"If approved, the US state department proposal could affect around 14.7 million people a year The Trump administration has said it wants to start collecting the social media history of nearly everyone seeking a visa to enter the US. The proposal, which comes from the state department, would require most visa applicants to give details of their Facebook and Twitter accounts. They would have to disclose all social media identities used in the past five years. About 14.7 million people a year would be affected by the proposals. The information would be used to identify and vet those seeking both immigrant and non-immigrant visas. Applicants would also be asked for five years of their telephone numbers, email addresses and travel history. They would be required to say if they had ever been deported from a country, or if any relatives had been involved in terrorist activity. The proposals would place an additional burden on travellers whose countries do not have a visa exemption deal with the US The proposal would not affect citizens from countries to which the US grants visa-free travel status - among them the UK, Canada, France and Germany. However, citizens from non-exempt countries like India, China and Mexico could be embroiled if they visit the US for work or a holiday. Officials defended the proposal by saying it would help to identify potential extremists. Social media came under scrutiny after the shootings in 2015 in San Bernadino, California, in which 14 people died. The authorities said they had missed signs of radicalisation in messages on a messaging platform sent between the attackers. Under rules brought in last May, officials were told to seek people's social media handles only if they felt ""that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting"", a state department official said at the time. The tougher proposal comes after President Trump promised to implement ""extreme vetting"" for foreigners entering the US, which he said was to combat terrorism. ""Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,"" the state department said in a statement, quoted by the New York Times. ""We already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity."" The idea is subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget. The public will have two months to comment on the proposal before it makes a decision. Trump 'in crude outburst about migrants' Trump's immigration plan sparks uproar Civil liberties groups have condemned the policy as an invasion of privacy that could damage free speech. ""People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,"" said Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""We're also concerned about how the Trump administration defines the vague and over-broad term 'terrorist activities' because it is inherently political and can be used to discriminate against immigrants who have done nothing wrong,"" she said. The social media platforms covered in the proposal include US-based entities such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit and YouTube.However, the New York Times reports that overseas platforms such as China's Sina Weibo and Russia's VK social network would also be included,external.

"Across the UK, people are spending more money on gin and craft beer, and there are more breweries open today than there were in the 1930s. But 18 pubs across the country closed every week in the second half of 2017, according toThe Campaign for Real Ale (Camra).,external So how are UK drinking habits changing? What are the UK's favourite drinks and how often are adults drinking? In 2016, 500 pubs across the UK called last orders for the final time. Since 2000, the number of pubs in the UK has fallen by 17%, or 10,500 pubs, according to theBritish Beer & Pub Association (BBPA).,external The decline has been blamed on a number of reasons - high taxes on pints,the smoking ban,the price of food and drink going up, and the 2008 recession meaning that consumers had less to spend in their local. But the BBPA say that the rate of pub closures is slowing down. About 1,100 pubs closed their doors in 2015, but fewer than half that number closed in 2016. The volume of beer sold in supermarkets and off-licences (off-trade) in the UK topped the volume sold in pubs, clubs and restaurants (on-trade) for the first time in 2014. Since 2000, the amount of beer people are buying in supermarkets and shops has increased by 27%. The affordability of beer in supermarkets and off-licences has risen by 188% since 1987, according to a study by theInstitute of Alcohol Studies (IAS).,external Measuring affordability using an index which adjusts prices for inflation and income growth, the IAS reports that the affordability of wine and spirits has gone up by 131%. But prices in pubs have been rising steadily. According to the BBPA, the average pub price of a pint of draught lager cost Â£3.58 on average in 2017, up 36% on 2007. The number of adults who say they drink alcohol is at its lowest level since surveys began in 2005, according to theOffice for National Statistics (ONS).,external In 2016, 57% of British adults said they drank alcohol in the week before being interviewed. Since 2005, there has also been a 2% increase in the number of adults who say they don't drink alcohol at all - around 10.6 million people in the population of Great Britain. Young people are the least likely to have drunk alcohol in the last week, and 27% of 16-24 year olds describe themselves as teetotal. But that age group is also the most likely to ""binge drink"" on their heaviest drinking day. Most women surveyed (27%) reported drinking between three and six units of alcohol on their heaviest drinking day - down from 33% a decade before. Among men in Great Britain, most (33%) drank between four and eight units of alcohol on their heaviest day. This was a drop from 40% in 2006. For women, binge drinking was defined as exceeding six units, whereas for men it meant consuming more than eight units of alcohol. The ONS also note that the survey data is likely to underestimate drinking levels, because people might underestimate their alcohol consumption. This video can not be played ""People are drinking less, but they're drinking better quality,"" says William Chase In 2016, England had the highest percentage of people who said they drank alcohol in the week before they were surveyed, at 57%. This was down from 59% in 2015. Three in four people in the south-west of England had drunk alcohol in the previous week, higher than all of the other English regions, while fewer than half of Londoners had partaken. Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? A total of 55% of drinkers in Wales enjoyed a tipple in the previous week according to the 2016 figures, a drop from 58% in 2015. The survey also found that people in Scotland drink the least often in Great Britain - 53% of adults had drunk in the previous week in 2016, compared with 57% surveyed the year before. The Scottish were however the most likely to report that they ""binged"" on their heaviest day of drinking, at 32% of drinkers, followed by Wales (30%) and England (26%). Sales of gins and craft beers have increased recently. Last year, theONS,externalput gin in the basket of goods it monitors to measure inflation (how much the cost of living is changing in the UK). Once known as ""mother's ruin"", gin sales topped Â£348m in the UK in 2016, almost three times the Â£126m total in 2009. As demand for artisan-style beers has increased, more microbreweries have been popping up across the country. There are now 2,000 breweries in the UK - the highest number on record since the 1930s, according toCamra.,external The number rose by 64% in four years, from 1,218 in 2012, to 1,994 in 2016. Children are now an accepted presence in many pubs - something that would have seemed unthinkable a few generations ago. In 1995, the ban on children under 14 going into pubs in England and Wales was lifted. Many pubs took this as an opportunity to remodel themselves as more family-friendly and food-focused. According to retail researchersMintel,,externalpub meals recorded an estimated 3% increase in sales to Â£7.4bn in 2016, while the volume of alcoholic drinks consumed in bars and pubs went down in the same year. Pubs are now becoming all-day dining destinations, with special offers for younger visitors. Children's menus, play areas and separate dining rooms for families are often seen in British pubs. However, this change has not gone entirely without resistance.

"The couple got married on 18 February A ""wedding bomb"" that killed a newly-married software engineer and left his wife grievously wounded has shattered the peace of a small town in India. Nearly a month after the incident, the police have made no headway. Soutik Biswas travels to the eastern state of Orissa to piece together the story of a killing that has riveted India. On a bright summer afternoon on 23 February, five days after their marriage, Soumya Sekhar Sahu, a 26-year-old software engineer, and his 22-year-old wife Reema, were pottering around in the kitchen at his newly-built family home in Patnagarh, a drowsy, nondescript town in Orissa. They were planning to grill eggplant and make some lentil soup for lunch when Soumya heard the clanging of the latch of their metal gate. A delivery man stood outside, holding a parcel addressed to him. A fraying sticker on the box said it had been sent by SK Sharma from Raipur, some 230km (142 miles) away. Reema remembers her husband opening the box in the kitchen, and finding a parcel covered in green paper with a white thread sticking out of it, while his 85-year-old grand-aunt Jemamani Sahu came up from behind to see what the parcel contained. ""This looks like a wedding gift,"" Soumya Sekhar told his wife. ""The only thing that I don't know is the sender. I don't know anyone in Raipur."" As he pulled the thread, there was a flash of light and a huge explosion rocked the kitchen. The three were knocked off their feet, and collapsed on the tiled floor, bleeding profusely. The blast had ripped the plaster off the ceiling, blown apart the water purifier, sent the kitchen window flying into an adjacent field, and cracked the green painted walls. The three writhed in pain on the blood-splattered floor. Jeemamani Sahu was on fire. ""Save me. I think I am dying,"" Soumya Sekhar groaned before losing consciousness. A video grab of the kitchen moments after the incident That was the last time Reema heard her husband speak. The burns stung her face and arms. With smoke filling her lungs, she struggled to breathe. Her eardrum had punctured, so she barely heard the hum of panicky neighbours rushing in and asking whether the cooking gas cylinder had exploded. Her vision was blurring as debris clogged her eyes. Still Reema managed to crawl to the bedroom, and pick up the phone to call her mother-in-law, a principal in a local college. She passed out before she could make the call. Video footage from the house minutes after the blast shows distraught neighbours carrying away the three wounded residents in bed-sheets to a waiting ambulance. Soumya Sekhar and Jemamani Sahu, who both suffered from 90% burns, died as they were being moved to hospital. Reema is recovering slowly in a cramped room in the burns ward in a government hospital. Deadly Texas parcel bomb attacks 'linked' India groom killed in Odisha after wedding gift explodes More than a month after the horrific murder, no one appears to have the faintest idea who killed Soumya Sekhar, described as a ""genial and god fearing young man who worshipped a guru"" by relatives and friends. ""We are simple people with simple lives. I have no enemies. My daughter has no enemies. My son-in-law had no enemies. I don't suspect anybody, and I don't know who could have done this,"" Sudam Charan Sahu, Reema's father, told me. Their families had introduced them, and the two had been engaged for a little more than a year. Reema's father, a garments trader, adopted her from his younger brother because he wanted a daughter after his two sons, and his brother had three daughters. The cheerful and pretty girl went to a local college and graduated with an Oriya language degree. Soumya Sekhar's parents were both college teachers - his father taught zoology. He had studied computer science and worked with info-tech companies in Mysore and Chandigarh, before joining a Japanese electronics firm in Bangalore two months ago. More than 800 people attended the reception at Mr Sahu's house ""They met a few times before the marriage in presence of their families. They were a happy couple. Why would someone want to kill him?"" Soumya Sekhar's father, Rabindra Kumar Sahu, 57, said. The only indication of something amiss seems to be one mysterious call that Soumya Sekhar received when he was in Bangalore. ""The call came last year,"" Reema told me. ""We were talking on the phone, and he said there was a call coming in. And I vaguely remember he put me on hold, and later told me, 'I got a threatening call. A man on the line told me not to marry.'"" He didn't mention any more calls, and by the time the marriage happened, ""we had completely forgotten about the call"". Two dozen investigators have questioned more than 100 people - friends and relatives of the couple mainly - in four cities in connection with the killing. They have scoured mobile phone records, and scanned laptops and phones belonging to the couple. Hopes were raised when cyber sleuths found the parcel had been tracked online twice from a private computer institute in Kalahandi district, some 119km away, leading to speculation that the killer may have been following it. But eventually they found it was the courier company itself that had been tracking the consignment. The only thing the police know for sure is that the parcel was sent from Raipur, under a false name and address. The killer, who paid 400 rupees ($6.14; Â£4.35) for the delivery, had chosen the courier company carefully: there were no CCTV cameras in their office, and the parcel was not scanned. The parcel then made a 650km journey on three buses and passed through four pairs of hands before reaching Patangarh on 20 February. The delivery man made a run the same evening to Soumya Sekhar's residence, but returned without delivering the package because ""he saw a big marriage reception going on at the place"", Dilip Kumar Das, the local manager of the courier company, explained. Three days later, the man finally delivered the parcel at the gate. Forensic experts are still trying to ascertain how sophisticated the bomb was. On the face of it, investigators say, it appeared to be a fairly crude device wrapped in jute thread which spewed white smoke after the blast. One of the last pictures of the couple at the reception The lack of strong leads means that the investigators are contemplating several motives behind the killing. Was it the work of a spurned or scorned lover? The police still have no clue, but say they are investigating why Soumya Sekhar deleted his Facebook account weeks before his marriage and opened a new one. Was the killing related to a property dispute in the Sahu family, where Soumya Sekhar was the only son and the natural heir? Investigators say they need to question more family members before coming to any conclusions. Did the murder have anything to do with a feud that Reema had in her secondary school, when a classmate harassed her and her parents had to lodge a complaint with the principal? It seems highly unlikely because the incident happened nearly six years ago. Also, how did the sender of the bomb manage to get his hands on an explosive and pack and send it to the target so easily? Was it a contract killing? ""This is a fiendishly complex case,"" Balangir's senior police official Sashi Bhusan Satpathy said. ""This was the work of a fairly knowledgeable person well-versed in the arts of bomb making."" Reema is still in hospital, and her tragedy became a spectacle on Monday when a family member whipped out his mobile phone and recorded her breaking down after she discovered from an old newspaper in her room that her husband had been killed in the blast. For nearly three weeks, her family hadn't broken the news to her. Now, she was crying inconsolably. ""You lied to me, you didn't tell me the truth,"" she wailed at her father, as he broke down. By the evening, the video of this private moment of grief was showing on local TV. ""We thought maybe this would move the government to step up the investigation and arrest the culprit soon,"" her father said. ""That's all we want.""

"This video can not be played BBC report reunites HK actor with brothers Hong Kong actor Anthony Wong spent decades looking for the father who left him as a child. Now, he says a BBC report on his search has helped him find a family who never knew him. It's late March, and three men are gathered for a meeting they'd never thought they would have. One man is Anthony Wong, one of the most famous actors in the Chinese-speaking world, known for his roles in films like Infernal Affairs and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. The other two are silver-haired, 74-year-old Englishmen - Anthony's two half-brothers that he had never met until last week. ""Amazing, impossible - a miracle"" is how the actor, 56, described it. For decades, the celebrity looked for traces of his British father, who left him when he was four. Fragmented information from his Cantonese mother about the former Hong Kong government official had led him nowhere. He knew only his name - Frederick William Perry - and had some basic biographical details and a handful of photographs. Anthony Wong with his parents Frederick William Perry and Wong Juen-yee Earlier this year, Anthony spoke to BBC Chinese about his search. He described how, without his father, he had grown up feeling ""trapped in between"" his British and Hong Kong identities, and how he hoped the internet would help bring him some answers. The day after the BBC published his story, a Facebook thread was set up by people wanting to help him. Three separate women following the page around the world began looking for information and passing it on to him. ""New clues came almost every day,"" Anthony said. On 2 March, he sent another post saying that someone had found biographical information of his possible father and his English family. He could hardly dare to believe they were his relatives, but the names and years seemed to match perfectly. ""I was like, 'no way!'"" he says. Meet me on the bridge: Discovering the truth after 20 years Argentina stolen baby found after 40 years 'I found the man who saved my life' Why was I left on a hillside to die? At the same time, John Perry, 74, was on a cruise ship in the Pacific with his twin brother, David. They picked up an email from a cousin in England saying there was ""a rather sensitive matter I should know about"", says John. Meanwhile, David's son sent him a photograph from the film, which showed Perry Sr holding Anthony as a baby. When they got back home to Melbourne, Australia, where they have lived for the past few decades, they watched the BBC story and saw a man who was, without question, their father. ""We were quite amazed about the whole thing,"" John says of the moment they saw that video. Anthony Wong has starred in more than 150 movies Not knowing how to contact Anthony directly, they emailed a company mentioned in the video, Dionysus Contemporary Theatre, saying there was a chance that they and Anthony were ""half-brothers at least"". When they were finally able to get in direct contact with Anthony, David and John were shocked. ""After picking myself off the floor, we talked about it, Dave and I. And we decided we'd better come over and see him,"" said John. On 20 March, the three met in Hong Kong. ""It was just incredible,"" Anthony said. ""After all these years and suddenly it all happened in two weeks!"" ""We hit it off straight away,"" said David. (L-R) Anthony Wong and David and John Perry Sadly, Perry Sr had died in 1988. The Perry brothers say he had never once mentioned his second family. ""We had no inkling about what happened,"" David said. The brothers spent their meeting piecing together the missing parts of their lives. Anthony learned that Frederick William Perry was a Royal Air Force veteran, who served in the Battle of Britain. In 1955, he arrived in Hong Kong - then a British colony - to work in a government logistics office. He brought with him his wife Vera Marjorie, their daughter Vera Ann, and twin sons John and David. A few years later, the family visited the UK. John and David stayed to join the RAF, but Frederick returned to Hong Kong. ""That year or soon after, he must have met Anthony's mother,"" said David. According to Anthony, who was born in 1961, Frederick Perry left him and his mother, Wong Juen-yee, in the mid-60s and moved to Australia with his other family. They exchanged letters for a few years, but all contact was lost when Anthony was 12. After serving in the RAF, David and John moved to Australia to join their father. David said he would've liked to have known about Anthony long ago. But both brothers said they weren't upset at finding out the secret that was kept from them for decades. They believe their mother, who died in 1972, wouldn't have known about it either. (L-R) John, Frederick and David Perry ""We know sad things happen in life to a lot of people,"" said David. ""The main thing was to come over and meet Anthony, and get into some background of what happened."" They believe their father would be pleased they're all finally in touch. Anthony's mother is still alive, but is suffering from dementia. He tried to tell her he had found his father, while he was helping her eat dinner, but she could not give a clear response. ""She suddenly stopped eating,"" said Anthony. ""Then I said 'hey, I'm not leaving you. I'll still be here', and she went on eating."" David and John spent a few days in Hong Kong with Anthony before returning to Melbourne. All three told the BBC that they had formed a bond very quickly, and the ""fairly big"" Perry family would love for him to visit them in Australia. ""We want to have a nice get-together and make Anthony feel part of our family - he is part of our family,"" David said. The brothers knew nothing about Anthony's acting career. Anthony Wong as a boy But they have started delving into the internet to find out about the veteran film and stage actor, who has starred in more than 150 movies and won four Hong Kong Film Awards trophies. They stressed that Anthony's fame was not a factor in their reunion. ""Whether he's being an actor or a labourer, it wouldn't make any difference to us,"" David said, adding they would have still come to meet him. Anthony said their meeting helped him, through knowing more about his family, find out more about himself. ""I played music and it turns out my brother did, too. I trained in boxing and it turns out my father had been a middleweight champion,"" he said. ""It's so amazing - it's like all those things were in your genes."" He called this ""a life lesson"", that when he is finally able to make peace with the past, a new journey can begin. ""Dad used to say in his letters that if I was a good boy, he would take care of everything for me,"" he said. ""I think he knows I've become a good boy since then and he's sent two brothers to me.""

"The British soldier was embedded with US forces A UK soldier has been killed in combat in Syria, the Ministry of Defence has said. The serviceman - embedded with US forces as part of a counter-terrorism operation against the Islamic State group - was killed on Thursday by an improvised explosive device. An American soldier was also killed by the roadside bomb, US officials said. The MOD confirmed that his family had been notified, adding ""our thoughts are with them at this difficult time"". BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said the British serviceman is the first UK soldier to be killed in combat fighting IS. He said: ""The MOD and the government has not acknowledged that British forces are involved in combat in Syria before. ""They never comment on the activities of UK special forces either. But in 2017, the then Defence Secretary Michael Fallon did tell MPs that a small number of UK military personnel had been in the country as part of the US-led coalition.""

"If approved, the US state department proposal could affect around 14.7 million people a year The Trump administration has said it wants to start collecting the social media history of nearly everyone seeking a visa to enter the US. The proposal, which comes from the state department, would require most visa applicants to give details of their Facebook and Twitter accounts. They would have to disclose all social media identities used in the past five years. About 14.7 million people a year would be affected by the proposals. The information would be used to identify and vet those seeking both immigrant and non-immigrant visas. Applicants would also be asked for five years of their telephone numbers, email addresses and travel history. They would be required to say if they had ever been deported from a country, or if any relatives had been involved in terrorist activity. The proposals would place an additional burden on travellers whose countries do not have a visa exemption deal with the US The proposal would not affect citizens from countries to which the US grants visa-free travel status - among them the UK, Canada, France and Germany. However, citizens from non-exempt countries like India, China and Mexico could be embroiled if they visit the US for work or a holiday. Officials defended the proposal by saying it would help to identify potential extremists. Social media came under scrutiny after the shootings in 2015 in San Bernadino, California, in which 14 people died. The authorities said they had missed signs of radicalisation in messages on a messaging platform sent between the attackers. Under rules brought in last May, officials were told to seek people's social media handles only if they felt ""that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting"", a state department official said at the time. The tougher proposal comes after President Trump promised to implement ""extreme vetting"" for foreigners entering the US, which he said was to combat terrorism. ""Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,"" the state department said in a statement, quoted by the New York Times. ""We already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity."" The idea is subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget. The public will have two months to comment on the proposal before it makes a decision. Trump 'in crude outburst about migrants' Trump's immigration plan sparks uproar Civil liberties groups have condemned the policy as an invasion of privacy that could damage free speech. ""People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,"" said Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""We're also concerned about how the Trump administration defines the vague and over-broad term 'terrorist activities' because it is inherently political and can be used to discriminate against immigrants who have done nothing wrong,"" she said. The social media platforms covered in the proposal include US-based entities such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit and YouTube.However, the New York Times reports that overseas platforms such as China's Sina Weibo and Russia's VK social network would also be included,external.

"""Your typewriter is hilarious!"" ""No, no, your cigar is side-splitting!"" If you're determined to pull off an elaborate hoax, top tips would seem to include: Be bold, be dedicated - and don't wait for 1 April. But while pulling the wool over the eyes of the general public is one thing - such as thePanorama spaghetti crop hoax of 1957,external- tricking the experts takes another level of cunning. The following people, who among them fooled doctors, scientists, the Royal Navy and historians, deserve a special mention. Fifteen bunnies later, Mrs Toft began to regret her passionate evening with Peter Rabbit Unlikely as it sounds, in the 18th Century a woman called Mary Toft convinced doctors she had given birth to rabbits. Yes, doctors. And yes, rabbits. Mrs Toft, a servant from Godalming in Surrey, surprised her family by going into labour. Even more surprisingly, she produced something resembling a kitten. Her explanation was rooted in the long-discredited theory of""maternal impression"",external- caused by being startled by a rabbit in a field in 1726 . From that moment, she said, she dreamed about, and had a ""constant and strong desire"" to eat, rabbits. An obstetrician named John Howard, who seems to have been less than rigorous with his examinations, was convinced by her story. He wrote to some of England's greatest doctors and King George I, informing them of the miraculous births - including the momentous occasion when his patient produced nine dead bunnies. The King sent his doctor to investigate. The medic, who arrived when Mrs Toft was in labour with her 15th rabbit, was certain she was genuine - and took some of her offspring back to London to show the monarch and Prince of Wales. A surgeon was then sent by the royal household to have a look. The surgeon, apparently more sensible than the others, examined the rabbits and found that dung inside one of them contained corn - proving it could not have developed inside Mrs Toft's womb. Meanwhile, Mrs Toft was busy giving birth to other unusual things, including a cat's legs and a hog's bladder. Medical opinion was divided - until a man was caught sneaking a rabbit into Mrs Toft's room. She was eventually forced to admit she had manually inserted the dead rabbits and then allowed them to be removed as if she were giving birth. The hoaxer was later charged with fraud and imprisoned. She spent a few months in prison then returned to relative obscurity. As for the King's doctor - he met an unhappy end after being convinced by the scam. He published a pamphlet called A Short Narrative of an Extraordinary Delivery of Rabbets but after the ruse was exposed, he lost favour with the court and died a pauper. Actual photograph of Reaper, the Trodmore winner They say the bookie always wins - but in 1898 a mystery syndicate managed to gammon the establishment and make themselves a tidy sum with an audacious scam. The Sportsman, a leading racing paper, was contacted by the Trodmore Hunt Club to tell them of the August Bank Holiday meeting at Trodmore Racecourse in Cornwall. All the information generally provided by racecourses - rules, purses, the names of patrons, stewards, sponsors and officials - were provided. The racecard was a good one, and a man calling himself Mr Martin, from the Trodmore Hunt Club, said he would telegraph the results to the office. The Sportsman printed it. Bookmakers took bets as usual, and when the results came through punters collected their winnings. The following day, rival newspaper The Sporting Life printed the results after seeing them in The Sportsman. However, there was a discrepancy in the odds given on one of the winning horses, called Reaper. The Sportsman had it down as 5-1, while Sporting Life had it at 5-2. The newspapers needed to check which was correct, so tried to contact the racecourse. At the same time, bookmakers were suffering after having to pay out on Reaper - a horse nobody had heard of. Some of them started to investigate its pedigree. It emerged that there was no such place as Trodmore, let alone a racecourse. The people behind the hoax had made themselves hundreds of thousands of pounds by betting on non-existent horses, in non-existent races on a non-existent track in a non-existent village. They were never caught. The BBC ghost spoof that duped a nation Buried diggers and knighted meat Odd laws you may unknowingly break Virginia Woolf (far left) and her merry band of posh pranksters managed to annoy the Admiralty - and presumably, the Abyssinians When not pioneering the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device, Edwardian novelist Virginia Woolf and her Bloomsbury chums were not averse to a practical joke. In 1910, a telegram was sent to HMS Dreadnought which was then moored in Portland Harbour, Dorset. The message, purportedly signed by the Foreign Office, said the ship must be prepared for an imminent visit by a group of Abyssinian princes. Six of the jesters turned up and despite their crude costumes of turbans and beards glued to their chins, the ""princes"" were welcomed with an honour guard and given a 45-minute tour of the vessel. Soon after they left, some of the sailors began to have doubts about the ""Abyssinians"". One of the officers reported that he thought the ""interpreter had a false beard"". The following day, the ringleader of the trick, Horace de Vere Cole, pranced into the Foreign Office and told them of the hoax. He also contacted the press. The Daily Express reported with barely-disguised glee on how ""the 'princes' were shown everything - the wireless, the guns and the torpedoes, and at every fresh sight they murmured in chorus 'bunga bunga'"". For a few days the navy was something of a laughing stock.  Sailors were greeted with cries of ""bunga, bunga"" wherever they went. The Admiralty was embarrassed and annoyed, and wanted the posh pranksters to be prosecuted - but as they had broken no laws, the issue faded. The story of the hoax continued to resonate, nowhere more so than in the navy itself. The mocking phrase even ended up in a Portland music hall song: ""When I went on board a Dreadnought ship, ""Though I looked just like a costermonger, ""They said I was an Abyssinian prince, ""Because I shouted Bunga Bunga."". Of the group, only Cole, who sounds exhausting,continued to revel in such japes,external. ""Just. Look. Natural."" The Hastings Rarities affair was a long-running ornithological fraud eventually exposed by a statistician. A taxidermist called George Bristow was a dab hand at stuffing birds. His glass-eyed aviary was used as a register of the birds that had been found in Hastings and its surroundings, leading to their inclusion on the official list of the British Ornithologists' Union. An extraordinary array of rare species of birds was reported from a very small area in a very short time. Between 1892 and 1930Mr Bristow had stuffed more rare birds,externalthan all other British taxidermists combined. It was later believed he had succeeded in his deception by importing frozen birds from other countries and claiming they were found in his neighbourhood. It wasn't until the August 1962 issue of British Birds magazine that the fraud was exposed. John Nelder published his articleA Statistical Examination of the Hastings Rarities,externalwhich led to many of the birds being removed from the official list. However, Mr Bristow may have known what he was on about - as eventually almost all of the expunged birds were readmitted to the list after they were genuinely proven to be in the country. Although not all in Hastings, all at the same time. Don't tell the Library of Congress The very first newspaper to have existed was a German publication issued in 1594 - but in 1776 an English historian, Dr. Thomas Birch stirred things up when he donated a bundle of documents to the British Museum with no explanation of their origin or context. Included in the bequest was a manuscript and two printed copies of The English Mercurie, dated 23 July, 1588. It contained an account of the English battle with the Spanish Armada. The typeset and archaic spelling led people to accept the document as real. Its existence remained unquestioned for 60-odd years. Then in 1839, the keeper of printed books at the British Museum, Thomas Watts, came upon the original manuscript in the archives. He compared it to other examples of Dr Birch's correspondence and recognised the handwriting as that of Birch's friend Philip Yorke, second Earl of Hardwick. The two had apparently created The English Mercurie as a literary game. However, although the hoax was debunked nearly 200 years ago, copies of the Mercurie are still mistakenly referred to as factual accounts - and both theNational Library of Australia,externaland theLibrary of Congress,externalhave it catalogued among historical documents from the Tudor and Stuart periods. ""I eat wives and snakes, you know. Underground."" George Psalmanazar, a blond-haired man with blue eyes, convinced English intellectuals of the 18th Century that he was the first native of Formosa - modern day Taiwan - to visit Europe. His accounts of life on Formosa were popular with London society and he was persuaded to write a book about his ""homeland"". He spoke in Latin and claimed men in Formosa wore nothing but a metallic disc to preserve their modesty, that husbands were allowed to eat their wives if they were unfaithful, and the hearts of young boys were sacrificed to the gods every year. A healthy Formosan breakfast involved chopping the head off a viper and sucking its blood out. He was invited to speak at public events and was also questioned by Edmund Halley - he of comet fame - at the Royal Society. The eminent astronomer disbelieved Psalmanazar's tale, and asked questions designed to expose him. Undaunted, Psalamanazar replied to them all with a flamboyant insouciance, seemingly having an explanation for everything. When asked why his skin was so pale, he said he was a member of the Formosan aristocracy which lived underground. Psalmanazar never revealed his real name or where he was from - although in his memoirs, which were published posthumously, he admitted his persona and background were entirely made up. His books -  An Historical and Geographical Description of Formosa, and Memoirs of ****. Commonly known by the name of George Psalmanazar; a reputed native of Formosa - are both still available in several languages. Why is Friday 13th considered unlucky?

"Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces Two men accused of being Islamic State members have complained they will not get a fair trial because the UK government has stripped them of their British citizenship. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, from west London, were captured in Syria in January. They are accused of being the last two members ofan IS foursome dubbed ""The Beatles""because of their UK accents. The pair also said the murder of IS hostages was ""regrettable"". Who were the Islamic State group 'Beatles' cell? Families of IS victims say 'Beatles' pair 'should face trial' Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? In an interview with Associated Press from northern Syria, Elsheikh said the ""illegal"" withdrawal of their UK citizenship put them at risk of ""rendition and torture"". ""Being taken to any foreign land and treated in any way and having nobody to vouch for you,"" he said. ""When you have these two guys who don't even have any citizenship... if we just disappear one day, where is my mum going to go and say where is my son?"" He said he could have ""no fair trial when I am 'the Beatle' in the media"". But Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was beheaded by the cell in Syria in 2014 - said she wasn't interested in their opinions and doubted the sincerity of what they had said. ""I am interested in them being held accountable for their horrific crimes and right now, they look like they're on vacation,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. ""I know it's complicated, but if someone doesn't take the leadership and take them to trial I fear they'll get away."" Sarah El Deeb, the journalist who interview the pair, described the men as ""very smart"" and ""very religious"". ""I don't think they were very apologetic about being members of Islamic State,"" she told the BBC. US officials believe the cell beheaded at least 27 Western hostages and tortured many more. Kotey told the Associated Press that he ""didn't see any benefit"" to the killings. ""It was something that was regrettable,"" he said. He also said many people in IS would have opposed the murders ""on the grounds that there is probably more benefit in them being political prisoners"". The other two cell members  - also from west London - were Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"", and Aine Davis. Left to right: Mohammed Emwazi, Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh Emwazi, who was the alleged ringleader and appeared in videos showing hostages being beheaded,was killed by a drone strike in 2015. Davis was convicted of being a senior IS member andwas jailed in Turkey last year. Profile: Mohammed Emwazi aka 'Jihadi John' Aine Davis, the gangster who ditched drugs for jihad Among the captives thought to have been killed by the cell were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, who were beheaded. Last month, Home Secretary Amber Ruddsaid the two men should go on trial. In a statement on Saturday, the Foreign Office said: ""We do not comment on individual cases, but we are working closely with partners to ensure that justice is served. ""We continue to work extremely closely with the US government on this issue, sharing our views, as we do on a range of national security issues and in the context of our joint determination to tackle international terrorism and combat violent extremism."" Both Kotey and Elsheikh are designated terrorists by the US, which says they have used ""exceptionally cruel"" torture methods. UK defence minister Tobias Ellwood said he believed the men should be tried in an international criminal court. The families of some of the victimsalso said the pair should face trial. Bethany Haines, David Haines' daughter, said she hoped they die a ""slow, painful death"". Who were the IS 'Beatles'? Which countries have IS fighters gone to?

"Driven out of their de facto capital of Raqqa after three brutal years, IS fighters have lost much of the territory they once held. How real is the danger they will now travel to other countries to carry out attacks, asks Dr Lorenzo Vidino. As the self-declared Islamic State steadily crumbles in Iraq and Syria, security officials throughout the world are asking themselves a crucial question: what will happen to its fighters? Roughly30,000 foreign fighters joined IS,externaland there is concern that these battle-hardened individuals will return home, or move elsewhere, carrying out terrorist attacks to avenge the demise of the ""caliphate"". While difficult to forecast, the changing fortunes of IS will undoubtedly have major implications for global security. There are indications, including anassessment by US counter-terrorism officials,external, that some foreign fighters will stay in Syria and Iraq. The head of the UK security service MI5 said this week that fewer than expected of the 800 Britons who joined IShad returned recentlyand that at least 130 had been killed. Those foreign fighters who do remain are likely to continue with IS as the group morphs into what it was in its early days, some 10 years ago: a lethal insurgent force using tactics ranging from terrorist attacks to guerrilla warfare. Foreign fighters have been over-represented among militants making last, desperate stands in thebattles of MosulandRaqqa. And many of them are now being tried in Iraqi courts, creating legal and moral dilemmas for many of their countries of origin, assome may face the death penalty.,external However, many other fighters have been leaving the ""caliphate"", mostly through the 822km (510 mile) long border between Turkey and Syria. While Turkish authorities have been patrolling with significantly more zeal than in the past, mountainous terrain and the presence of sophisticated smuggling networks mean the border is quite permeable. IS has a long-established support network throughout Turkey, which is playing a key role in extracting foreign fighters from Syria. Given the scores of attacks that have bloodied the country over the last three years, Turkish authorities are understandably concerned about this influx. Neighbouring countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, have similar fears. The potential end destinations for foreign fighters leaving Syria and Iraq are plentiful. There is evidence that some have joined the official wilayat, or ""provinces"", IS has established inYemen, theSinai Peninsula,external, theNorth Caucasus,externalandEast Asia.,external The group also has a strong presence in Libya, where the US suggested last year that it hadup to 6,500 fighters,external, and several hundred in Afghanistan, where the US reportedkilling at least 94 fighters,externalin an attack on underground tunnels. Marawi in the Philippines has been partly held by fighters linked to IS since May There are also anecdotal indications of militants travelling to conflicts in far flung places such as theDemocratic Republic of Congo,external,Myanmar,externaland thePhilippines,external. The arrival of foreign fighters to these regions could strengthen the capabilities of local jihadist groups and change the course of sometimes devastating conflicts. Many other foreign fighters are choosing to return to their countries of origin. While some returnees may no longer engage in militant activities, others areestablishing clandestine networks,externalseeking to carry out attacks and, according to local circumstances, destabilise the country's political situation. North African countries are particularly vulnerable to the risk - nowhere more so than Tunisia, asabout 6,000 of its citizens left,externalto join IS - the highest per capita rate in the world. Arab Gulf countries may also suffer from this type of blowback. Russia, the Caucasus, and a number of Central Asian countries are also areas of concern, having seen large numbers join IS - many of whom went on to play a prominent role on the battlefield. European authorities consider the return of some of the estimated6,000 European foreign fighters,externala major security concern. To date, fewer than one in five individuals involved in attacks on the West since the ""caliphate"" was declared in 2014 had experience as foreign fighters, according to research by the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) and the George Washington University's Program on Extremism. The Paris attacks were carried out in part by former foreign fighters Who was behind the jihadist attacks on the West? Who are Britain's jihadists? The archaeological treasures IS failed to destroy But this might change as the number of returnees - now estimated at roughly 1,000 -  increases. Many may show no sign of wishing to engage in further violent activities, but there is a valid concern that some may make use of their combat skills. It is plausible that they could use their network of contacts and ""celebrity status"" among unaffiliated jihad enthusiasts to plan terrorist attacks. The territorial losses suffered by IS are not likely to affect the operational ability of these largely independent militants. While significant problems still exist, European authorities have improved intelligence sharing to better detect returning fighters. And thanks to improved co-operation with Turkey, many militants have been arrested before they get any further. A few do manage to reach Europe illegally, or by posing as refugees - as some of theNovember 2015 Paris attackersdid. But most foreign fighters will come to Europe legally, often using their genuine European passports. If detecting them is a problem, working out what to do with them is equally fraught. Arresting them may be the obvious answer, but the reality is significantly more complicated. The UK Home Office, for example, disclosed last year that of the 400 British foreign fighters who had returned from Syria and Iraq,only 54 were convicted,external. Similar dynamics can be observed throughout the continent. Inside Raqqa after IS pushed out The city fit for no one Raqqa's loss seals rapid rise and fall What is preventing authorities from arresting, prosecuting and convicting returning foreign fighters? It is mostly a legal matter, with lawmakers struggling to keep up with a constantly shifting threat environment. While legislations vary from country to country, they share some common problems. In some countries, joining a terrorist organisation or fighting in a foreign conflict were not criminal offences at the time when most individuals travelled to Syria. Several countries have since introduced new laws which, however, cannot be applied retrospectively. Even in countries where such actions have long constituted criminal offences, authorities struggle to gather the evidence needed to build a strong criminal case. Knowing that somebody joined IS or committed atrocities in Syria from an intelligence perspective is one thing. Being able to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law is another. Even more complicated is the issue of children either born or raised in the ""caliphate"" by their foreign fighter parents. While most are not punishable under the law, they deserve attention because of the trauma they have suffered and, in some cases, because they present severe signs of radicalism despite their young age. The result is that authorities are overwhelmed, having to monitor hundreds of battle-hardened fighters, on top of the burgeoning number of home-grown IS sympathisers, in an attempt to determine which pose an immediate security threat. Instead, authorities throughout Europe have increasingly invested in programmes seeking to deradicalise returning foreign fighters. While it might be premature to definitively assess them, there are indications that some, like the one established in the Danish city of Aarhus -offering rehabilitation and inclusion in society,external, are effective. Others, like the French plan to set up 12deradicalisation centres,external, have been shelved. The loss of much of its territory is a major blow to ISIS. Yet the group and its adherents are already surfacing in various parts of the world and are likely to do so with even more frequency and vehemence in the near future. IS will become a more decentralised, amorphous organisation operating in a more asymmetric fashion, but it will not disappear. Moreover, the IS brand and the emotional appeal of its ""caliphate"" are unlikely to vanish any time soon. And, despite critical challenges, the organisation's remarkably strong digital presence, the so-called ""virtual caliphate"", will survive in some form, potentially rekindling the commitment of sympathisers worldwide and prompting some to carry out terrorist attacks in its name. The fall of the ""caliphate"" closes a chapter, but a new one is about to be opened.

British fighters Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces She said she would like to see the captured fighters tried in the US. ""But as long as they're brought to fair trial and detained and justice is served, I would be most grateful,"" she added. Two other American hostages, journalist Steve Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig (also known as Abdul-Rahman Kassig), were killed by IS too. Islamic State 'beheads US hostage Steven Sotloff' US hostage Peter Kassig 'killed by IS' The US defence department said it was ""still considering options"" but a spokesman added: ""Our intention is to hold anyone accountable who commits acts like those they are alleged to have committed."" Guantanamo Bay prison remains open The US Congress has been deeply opposed to terror suspects being held on US soil. So one option could be to send the suspects to Guantanamo Bay, the US detention camp in Cuba that was set up to hold jihadists captured in the ""war on terror"". President Donald Trump said during the 2016 election campaign he wanted to ""load it up with some bad dudes"". Last month,Mr Trump signed an order keeping the camp open. Human rights groups argue the very existence of Guantanamo and internment without trial play into the hands of jihadist recruiters, who portray it as an example of US injustice. British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines, who had gone to Syria for humanitarian reasons, were both killed by IS. Mr Haines's daughter Bethany told BBC Scotland she hoped his killers died a ""slow, painful death"" and said she would want to look Kotey and Elsheikh in the eye if they stood trial. French journalist Nicolas Henin was held hostage by IS for 10 months and believes ""the Beatles"" were among those holding him. He told BBC News he wanted Kotey and Elsheikh returned to the UK to face justice. ""I would like to see them brought back to Britain, just like I would like to see all other European jihadis brought back to their home countries, to be judged fairly in their home country,"" he said. ""Because the worst thing we can do with a terrorist is to deprive him from his right because then you make the terrorist a victim."" However, the BBC understands Kotey and Elsheikh, who grew up in west London, have both been stripped of their British citizenship. IS Beatles 'should die slow, painful death' Briton Alan Henning 'killed by IS' A British defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, has called for Kotey and Elsheikh to be tried in an international criminal court. It is important that ""terrorists from any origin are transparently and fairly held to account for their actions"", he said. The International Criminal Court (ICC), based in The Hague, can prosecute suspects for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. However, barring a UN Security Council request, it will prosecute cases only when states are unwilling or unable to do so, and is not intended to replace national criminal systems. It has been accused of focusing too much on war crimes in Africa, such as in Darfur and Democratic Republic of Congo. Judges consider Afghan war crimes inquiry What is the International Criminal Court? The prospect of an international criminal tribunal being set up for Syria, modelled on those for the former Yugoslavia or Rwanda, seems remote. The conflict drags on and deep divisions, most notably between the US and Russia, continue to beset  the UN Security Council. Another country with a potential claim on prosecuting Kotey and Elsheikh is Japan. IS beheaded two of its citizens, Haruna Yukawa and journalist Kenji Goto. Japan PM outrage at 'hostage Haruna Yukawa death' Japan outrage at hostage Kenji Goto 'beheading' The captured IS fighters could just remain in Syria, of course. However, the situation there is fluid as the SDF battles IS remnants, forces loyal to the Syrian government and, increasingly, Turkey. US forces repel attack on Syrian allies Turkey 'will take fight as far as Iraq' This video can not be played The group known as ""The Beatles"" beheaded IS hostages Last year, Turkey jailed the third living member of ""the Beatles"", Aine Davis, for seven-and-a-half years for membership of a terrorist organisation. Spanish journalist Javier Espinosa, who was subjected to mock executions, told BBC News at the time it did not matter where Davis was tried. ""He should face justice wherever it is,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter if it's in England or Turkey or wherever. He should be in jail forever."" The fourth and most infamous ""Beatle"",Mohammed Emwazi, who appeared in beheading videos, was killed by a drone strike on his carin the IS stronghold of Raqqa in 2016.

"Heartbeat actor Bill Maynard has died at the age of 89 after a career spanning eight decades. Daughter-in-law Jacqueline Reddin said he died in hospital in Leicestershire, shortly after breaking his hip in a fall from a mobility scooter. ""He was larger than life and he just loved showbiz,"" she said. ""He was so proud of the fact that he had been working for 81 years."" He was perhaps best known as Claude Jeremiah Greengrass in Heartbeat. From variety halls to TV success Maynard - whose real name was Walter Williams - starred as the scruffy, eccentric poacher in the police drama for eight years, from 1992 to 2000, and was in its spin-off The Royal until 2003. Other roles included Oh No, It's Selwyn Froggitt!, The Gaffer and In Sickness and In Health. He also made appearances in Carry On films Carry On At Your Convenience, Carry On Matron and Carry On Dick, and was Sergeant Beetroot in TV series Worzel Gummidge in 1980. Maynard's most recent role was a brief appearance in 2017 drama The Moorside, about the disappearance of Shannon Matthews. Maynard, back right, appeared in In Sickness and In Health Outside of acting, Maynard tried his hand at singing - coming second in the British heat of the 1957 Eurovision Song Contest - and politics, standing as an independent against Tony Benn in the 1984 Chesterfield by-election. From 2003 to 2008 he had a BBC Radio Leicester show and he celebrated 60 years since his first TV appearance in 2013 by releasing a version of What a Wonderful World. Speaking at the time, he said that ""making people laugh and smile brings me a lot of personal satisfaction"". ""I am delighted to be still in the entertainment industry doing what I love most - 76 years since I began my career,"" he had said. ""I have had an amazing career and I consider myself to be very lucky to still have the energy and enthusiasm to take on new work."" Maynard's daughter-in-law said he had recently filmed an episode of BBC One quiz show Pointless, which was yet to air. He leaves a daughter and a son, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Bill Maynard in 1970, preparing for a role as Charles Dickens Tributes have been paid to Maynard, with actor Ian Champion saying he ""had the blessing"" to work with the ""colourful, warm and mischievous"" actor on Heartbeat.
