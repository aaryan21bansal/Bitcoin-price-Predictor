"Princess Beatrice has featured in a legal dispute between a Turkish millionaire and her business adviser A Turkish millionaire claims her payment to Prince Andrew was falsely described as a wedding gift for his daughter Princess Beatrice. Nehebat Isbilen is claiming at the High Court in London that her business adviser Selman Turk ""dishonestly misappropriated"" Â£38m of her assets. Mrs Isbilen paid Â£750,000 to Prince Andrew and claims Mr Turk had wrongly told her bank it was a wedding gift. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Princess Beatrice or Prince Andrew. The Duke of York has now returned the Â£750,000 to Mrs Isbilen. Mr Turk has rejected the allegations made against him. This complex court case revolves around accusations that Mrs Isbilen's money was fraudulently used by her business adviser, Mr Turk. Prince Andrew pays back cash in financial dispute Prince Andrew: Where does he get his money from? Mrs Isbilen, aged 77, is from a wealthy Turkish business family, but when her politician husband was jailed she wanted advice on moving her assets out of Turkey. Prince Andrew has returned Â£750,000 But the High Court has heard accusations that Mr Turk ""misappropriated"" her assets - and her lawyers have been trying to track down and recover her money. According to court papers, this revealed that ""substantial sums"" had been paid to Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Mrs Isbilen claims Mr Turk advised her to make a ""gift"" of Â£750,000 to Prince Andrew, which she was misled into believing was for assistance with her passport. This amount was transferred from her account on 15 November 2019. ""The representation that Mrs Isbilen needed to make a gift to the Duke of York in connection with her passport [or for any other purpose] was false,"" says her legal team in their claim of dishonesty against Mr Turk. But Mrs Isbilen's testimony in an affidavit also says that she saw an email from Mr Turk to her bank explaining the Â£750,000 payment as being a ""wedding gift"" for the Duke of York's daughter, Princess Beatrice. This claim was ""entirely false"" says Mrs Isbilen in her affidavit. A week before the payment by Mrs Isbilen, Mr Turk's firm had also been a winner of an award at the Pitch at the Palace business initiative, headed by Prince Andrew. Representatives of Prince Andrew have not commented on the ongoing court case. A spokesman for the Duchess of York said: ""The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him."" The court has heard claims of further payments to the Duke and Duchess of York, via a company called Alphabet Capital. According to court documents, about Â£900,000 of Mrs Isbilen's money was paid into this company in two payments, despite her claim: ""I did not know about or authorise either of these payments."" This company then made payments to Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah, with Peters and Peters, the law firm representing Mrs Isbilen, claiming Prince Andrew received Â£350,000 and the Duchess of York Â£225,000. The discovery of payments to Prince Andrew emerged after a court order allowed a search of Mr Turk's financial dealings. Court papers show that some of the expenditure had been attributed by Mr Turk to professional costs and unsuccessful investments, but there were claims of significant amounts still to be explained. Jonathan Tickner, Mrs Isbilen's lawyer, said she had been ""the victim of serious fraud and financial wrongdoing"", and was determined to pursue her claim against all those involved. Court documents show that Mr Turk has disputed the allegations and disagrees with Mrs Isbilen's understanding of how her assets have been handled.

"On Saturday afternoon, a bright red tanker carrying 33,000 tonnes of Russian diesel sailed up the Thames and delivered its cargo in Grays, Essex. Its arrival - which doesn't violate sanctions - highlights the UK's dependence on Russia, which supplies nearly a fifth of the country's diesel. The UK has pledged to stop importing Russian diesel by the end of the year: until then, the deliveries continue. Russian-owned or flagged vesselsare now banned from UK ports. But the STI Comandante's journey from Primorsk on the Baltic sea does not flout the Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia, because the ship is owned by the US firm Scorpio Tankers and flies the flag of the Marshall Islands, a nation in the Pacific Ocean. Some shipping lines including the global giantsMaersk and MSC have chosen to suspend most deliveriesto and from Russia. Others have decided that as long as the trade is still legal and safe, they will continue. It's a controversial choice. âThis shipment of diesel, along with the other fossil fuels that have been allowed to enter the UK since Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, is filling Putinâs coffers and helping to fund the war. It has to stop,â said Emily Armistead, programme director at Greenpeace UK. Greenpeace has set up an automated tracker to monitor movements of tankers leaving Russia, loaded with oil and diesel. The STI Comandante was chartered by ST Shipping, a subsidiary of the commodity giant Glencore. Glencore doesn't necessarily own the diesel on board, though - it may well have been bought and sold many times while the boat was on the water. Phasing out Russian oil will be extremely hard, and diesel will be particularly difficult. Russia supplies 8% of the UKâs oil needs but 18% of its diesel, according to government figures. Diesel is essential to a modern economy. Besides fuelling more than a third of UK cars, it powers trucks, buses, some trains, farming and construction equipment, and is used for generating electricity. The Ukraine crisis has led to a shortage of diesel across Europe, which depends on Russia for about half of its diesel imports. This shortage has been reflected in the prices that drivers pay for diesel at the pump, which have been rising faster than petrol prices. The average price of diesel in the UK has risen 18% since the start of February, to 177p a litre, while the average cost of unleaded has risen by 11%, according to RAC Fuel Watch. The faster rise âreflects the fact that the biggest immediate problem at the moment for the end user is diesel,â said Neil Crosby, senior oil analyst at OilX. Other countries, including the US and Germany, have also seen sharply rising diesel prices. Diesel supplies were tight before the crisis began, as demand for oil bounced back after pandemic lockdowns faster than producers could keep up. âStocks of lots of fuels are relatively low, but diesel in particular, in Europe, in the US and in Asia as well. The demand for diesel has been very strong up until the crisis, and that also contributed to that. Thereâs just an imbalance between supply and demand,"" said OilXâs Mr Crosby. Finding alternative supplies to replace the diesel Britain buys from Russia will be made harder because many other countries around the world are also trying to wean themselves off Russian energy supplies at the same time. There is no suggestion of pumps in the UK imminently running dry. But last week, the boss of one of the worldâs biggest trading groups warned of possible diesel shortages around the world. ""The diesel market is extremely tight and we're possibly heading to stock-outs. Europe can probably afford to pay. The problem is what happens to Africa and Latin America,"" Jeremy Weir, the chief executive of Trafigura said on 22 March, according to the Reuters news agency. Glencore and Scorpio Tankers declined to comment.

"A banner of Russian President Vladimir Putin next to the Moscow embassy in Riga, Latvia ""Era defining"", ""new reality"", ""historic moment"" - that's where we are right now in Europe. At least, that's what countless European politicians and commentators say, since Russian President Vladimir Putin began his invasion of Ukraine. Are they right? Yes and No, I'd argue. Starting with the Yes. On 24 February, President Putin shocked this continent out of complacency. His assault on Ukraine has brought large-scale death and destruction back to Europe, including whispers of possible nuclear war. His aim: not only to dominate Ukraine, but to roll back Western dominance militarily and - ideally - politically, in terms of liberal democracy, from the former Soviet sphere of influence. The action Western allies take together now will fundamentally affect Europeans' sense of self and safety for years to come. Nato is re-invigorated. The transatlantic military alliance, once dismissed by French President Emmanuel Macron as ""brain dead"", is simultaneously proving Mr Putin wrong to view the West as weak and disunited, while also providing military support, defence and deterrence to Nato's eastern flank that feels so exposed to the Kremlin's expansionist fervour. This - so far - is also proving to be a defining moment for the EU. The bloc had long talked up playing a bigger role on the world stage - and not solely in terms of economics and trade. Until now, that was a failed ambition. But the Russia-Ukraine crisis has unexpectedly elevated the EU into a credible geopolitical player. The speed with which Brussels co-ordinated sanctions against Russia - both within the EU, and with international allies - was frankly impressive. As were the unity of resolve amongst member states, and the bureaucracy-defying EU moves to enact never-before-used mechanisms to help Ukrainian refugees, and the Ukrainian military. Germany, one of the EU's biggest players, also took the world's breath away by suddenly saying goodbye to World War Two sensitivities and announcing huge investments in its military, the Bundeswehr. Key to the decision being applauded in the EU and further afield is that this is not a Germany newly flexing nationalist muscles. ""This is about Germany helping to re-define Europe, not its own role,"" Ricarda Lang told me. She is the co-chair of the German Green Party in the coalition government. ""It's about European sovereignty, not just in security and defence but also in terms of imports and energy."" For years Germany has knowingly been reliant on the US for security, and on Russia for energy and trade. It is not the only EU country in that position. But as the bloc's richest and most powerful nation, Berlin is the most stand-out example. And this has weakened the West's hand when it comes to sanctions against Russia. EU countries pay Moscow up to â¬800m (Â£674m; $884m) for energy every day,which amounts to an estimated 40% of the Kremlin's income.This money goes towards funding the war against Ukraine, that the West is ostensibly fighting. ""It's tragic it took a war like this, but now we Germans have woken up with a bang!"" insists Marie Agnes Strack-Zimmerman, who heads the German parliament's Defence Committee. She assured me Berlin was now ready to take responsibility. 'We Germans have woken up with a bang!' said the chairwoman of the German parliament's Defence Committee The West looked at Germany with suspicion after two world wars, she observed, but that was decades ago, and - to be honest, she said - Germany was pretty comfortable enjoying being a Nato and EU member, without having to invest in its own army. ""Germany's allies have waited too long for us to do our bit."" Berlin has now pledged to build an efficient, modern military, and to keep up defence spending to Nato requirements. Under international pressure, trade and energy ties are being tackled, too. Bear in mind, though, that transforming the currently threadbare German military will take years, as will untangling the country from its deep-seated relations with Russia. For decades, Berlin was the dividing line between East and West Europe. Hopes for European unity were high after the fall of the iconic Berlin Wall, and the ensuing 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. But fast-forward 30 years, and you hear talk of a new ""Berlin Wall"", though further to the east. Tiny Baltic country Latvia has a 200km (124 mile)-long border fence, separating the EU and Nato member on one side from expansionist Russia on the other. Col Sandris Gaugers is the commander of the Latvian Land Forces Mechanized Infantry Brigade. We spoke at his military base, just outside the capital, Riga. The base is also home to Nato forces, which have almost doubled in size since Russia invaded Ukraine. Col Sandris Gaugers said priorities have changed across Europe ""I see a new Iron Curtain coming. Though this time, we'll be on the western side,"" the colonel told me. ""We are living a new reality. For us Latvians the security environment is now gone. We spent 20 years in Iraq, in Afghanistan. Now our main focus is here. How do we defend our freedom and our country?"" Priorities have now changed across Europe, he said. ""People used to focus on economic wealth. Now it's about defending our values and way of life."" Latvians and their Baltic neighbours in Estonia and Lithuania are trying hard not to say ""I-told-you-so"" to the West. They've been warning about President Putin for years. They feel they understand the Russian leader better than most. All three countries were once part of the Soviet Union. Latvia's Prime Minister, Arturs KriÅ¡jÄnis KariÅÅ¡, insists the West has to accept that ""Putin is not like us"". France and German leaders famously went on diplomatic visits to Moscow earlier this year, trying to dissuade President Putin from attacking Ukraine. Prime Minister KariÅÅ¡ says agonising over finding the right words, or turns of phrase to persuade Mr Putin, is pointless. ""He's hell-bent on destroying democracy and our way of life. ""If we don't stop Putin. He will not stop at Ukraine."" Mr KariÅÅ¡ said the one good thing to come out of the current situation is that Nato and the EU are working closer together than they have in 30 years. That, he said, was a game-changer. And here we come back to whether this is an era-defining moment for Europe. Or maybe not. The EU is thrilled to have the US back and engaged in Europe. For all Brussels' talk of the bloc now building ""strategic sovereignty"" in defence and security, EU countries look to Washington when faced with Russian threats. Training session at the Adazi military base in Latvia EU defence plans, designed to complement - or to partly replace - Nato, depending which European politician you speak to, are nothing new. And so far, they've never worked. All EU countries agree that at the very least, it makes sense to pool resources and know-how: cyber, military, equipment and intelligence. Yet, no nation wants to go first. Each EU member has businesses or individuals benefiting from national contracts. The European Commission now wants to oversee the overhaul of defence capabilities. Few in the military are holding their breath, wherever they reside in Europe. As regards the renaissance in EU-Nato co-operation, in all likelihood, once the acute Russia-Ukraine crisis subsides, the US will turn its attention to what it truly sees as its foreign policy priority: the Asia-Pacific, not Europe. But the EU has itsraison d'Ãªtreback. Designed originally as a peace project, its vision fell by the wayside in recent times. Younger Europeans had no memory of war. They saw no urgency in uniting or fighting for peace on their continent. In that regard, this moment really is a new reality.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Fire engulfs a market in Hargeisa the capital city of Somaliland Residents of the capital of Somaliland, Hargeisa, have woken to scenes of devastation after fire tore through the main market overnight. The blaze destroyed hundreds of businesses in the densely crowded market area as firefighters struggled to gain access to the flames. But it appears that nobody was killed though 28 people were injured. The blaze is a setback for the city of 1.2 million people, capital of the unrecognised Republic of Somaliland. Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia just over 30 years ago, has escaped much of the chaos and violence that plague its neighbour. Somaliland profile The unrecognised nation where 15-year-olds vote The fire started around 20:00 (17:00 GMT) on Friday and was not brought under control until Saturday morning, Efe news agency reports. The cause was not immediately known. ""The town has never witnessed such a massive calamity,"" the city's mayor Abdikarim Ahmed Moge told reporters. ""This place was the economic centre of Hargeisa and even though the firefighters did their best to contain the fire, the market is destroyed."" The market - the biggest open-air market in the city - was a hub of activity with hundreds of small businesses. Somaliland has a high rate of unemployment and the market was a lifeline for many poor families who depended on it to make a living. The fire happened just a few hours after the month of Ramadan began, when food business traditionally booms. Somaliland President Muse Bihi Abdi said the fire had destroyed goods worth millions of dollars. Responding to news of the disaster in the former British protectorate,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted,externalhe was ""saddened to see... such destruction in the open market that is the economic heart of the city"". ""Your city will rise again and the UK will do what we can to support Somaliland's rebuilding effort,"" he added. Market trader Bashi Ali told AFP news agency he had possessed several businesses in the market and they had all been burnt to ash. ""All we can learn from this disaster is to plan the market well,"" he said. Dramatic photos of the aftermath of the blaze were posted by journalist Fahad Karie The market used to be home to about 2,000 shops and stalls Officials said it started on Friday but was largely brought under control by dawn on Saturday Somaliland profile The unrecognised nation where 15-year-olds vote Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Corpses and burned out cars litter this stretch of the E-40 highway Footage of Russian troops shooting a man with his hands up on a highway outside Kyiv at the beginning of March was shared around the world. Now the Russians have been pushed out of the area and the BBC's Jeremy Bowen has been to see the grim aftermath of their short-lived occupation. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing We counted 13 bodies on a nightmarish stretch of road not much more than 200 yards long, between Mria and Myla, villages whose Ukrainian names translate as Dream and Sweetheart. Two of the dead are confirmed as Ukrainian civilians who were killed by the Russians. The others have not been identified yet - they lie where they were killed - but only two are wearing recognisable Ukrainian military uniforms. Our BBC team was able to get to the area, on the main E-40 highway as it approaches Kyiv, because Ukrainian forces had captured the sector only 10 hours earlier. The marks of battle and of heavy shelling were everywhere. Petrol stations and a hotel that was well-known for its spa and restaurant were in ruins. Shell holes and craters pockmarked both carriageways. Ukrainian troops changing a wheel in the ruins of a roadside garage said the Russians were about 4km (2.5 miles) away and had pulled their remaining men and armour back after a hard fight, lasting several days, in the early hours of the morning. Warning: Graphic video ahead Left behind in the heart of the desolation were the dead bodies, and a mass of questions and concerns about who they were and how they died. This video can not be played Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv Some answers already exist for a couple who were killed by the Russians and left to decompose on 7 March. Their rusty, shrapnel riddled car lies in the road next to one of the petrol stations, reduced to a shell by fire. Next to it are the burnt and twisted remains of a body that is just about recognisable as the remains of a man. A wedding ring is still on the corpse's finger. Stretched out inside the hulk of their car is what is left of the incinerated body of a woman, the mouth opened in what looks like a scream. Their deaths were filmed by a Ukrainian drone on 7 March, operated by the Bugatti unit of Territorial Defence. The unit released the video, which was republished by news organisations around the world. It caused outrage because it showed the cold-blooded killing of a man who had raised his arms to show he was harmless, in the classic gesture of surrender. The bodies, the BBC discovered in an investigation this month, are of Maksim Iowenko and his wife Ksjena. They were part of a convoy of 10 civilian vehicles who were trying to escape the Russians and get to Kyiv. Ksjena and Maksim Iowenko were civilians and should have been protected As they drove down the road, they spotted a Russian tank in position, dug into the grass verge. The drone video shows it was clearly marked with the letter V, one of the identifiers used by the Russian armed forces. The other cars did quick U-turns and drove away at speed. But Maksim's car stopped, most likely because it was hit. As soon as the car stopped, Maksim leapt out and raised his hands. Within seconds he was shot dead. His wife was killed in the car. Also in the car were their six-year-old son and the elderly mother of one of Maksim's friends. Both of them survived and were eventually released by the Russian soldiers. They were found walking back down the road, and the woman told her family that Maksim was shouting that a child was in the car when he was killed. Both survivors, according to the Bugatti drone unit, are now safe but deeply traumatised. Warning: Graphic images ahead The car is now burnt out, but it was not on fire after the attack. One hypothesis must be that the bodies and the car were set on fire by the Russians to destroy the evidence of what they had done. The Bugatti Unit has submitted its drone video to the Ukrainian authorities and to the Metropolitan Police in London. More burnt cars and dead bodies line the road for the next few hundred yards. No video has emerged to show what happened. A credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by the tank crew, or other Russian soldiers. Some of the evidence the BBC gathered is too disturbing to show in full. Here a dead man has been covered by rubber tyres Here a Ukrainian soldier gestures towards sets of charred human remains by a burned out vehicle Attempts have been made to destroy the other bodies. Some have been left to rot where they were killed. But other corpses have been piled up and surrounded by tyres. Charred clothing indicates attempts were made to set fires around them. Tyres are flammable and must have been placed there as an accelerant. The emplacement where the tank was dug in has a clear arc of fire across the area where the 13 bodies are lying. The tank has gone but debris was left by its crew, including Russian army field rations. In the woods nearby is at least one other tank, which has been burnt out after being hit by an anti-tank missile. A Ukrainian soldier produced a wallet he had found in the tank. He emptied out Russian identity papers, bank notes in the Russian currency, the rouble, and small change in Belorussian coppers. The major thrust to the north-west of Kyiv came from invaders who had crossed the border from Belarus, Moscow's ally. Close by the knocked out tank are the remains of a chaotic camp, with dugouts, chairs and a long table piled high with the remains of food and drink. They are all surrounded by big piles of garbage, rotten food and empty bottles of alcohol. Ukrainian soldiers said shops at the petrol stations were looted. An abandoned Russian camp: the soldiers are said to have looted petrol stations Next to the table is a large pair of bolt-cutters. Piles of unburied rubbish scattered in a forward position are usually a sign of undisciplined soldiers. We decided to drive two or three kilometres further down the road, after Ukrainian soldiers said more Russian armour had been destroyed. In a small village, a Russian tank and two armoured personnel carriers were broken and burnt. Some of the wreckage was still smoking. The force of the weapon that destroyed the tank blew off its turret and main gun, which lay upside down and half buried in a crater around 15 yards away. In the pine woods on either side of the road Ukrainian soldiers were digging trenches and fox holes with shovels. Others were patrolling. It was far too early to say whether the Russians were gone for good, or whether they would be back. What is clear though is that Russian forces, under continued pressure from Ukrainian soldiers, have been forced to yield strategic territory around Kyiv. Every time they move back, the Ukrainian capital and its people become a little safer. This video can not be played Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians As and when the Russians leave, more evidence is likely to emerge of civilians having been killed - backing up the many stories that have emerged of such incidents. The gruesome scenes on the road were more than simply the terrible deaths of human beings who had become victims of President Putin's decision to invade. It is also a crime scene, with evidence that should be collected and preserved for an investigation whenever this war ends. Under the laws of war civilians are protected, and when they are killed in defiance of those laws, their deaths amount to war crimes.

"Children aged between five and 11 in England will be offered a low-dose Covid vaccine, the government says. Northern Ireland has said it will also follow Wales and Scotland in offering young children the vaccine. Our health correspondents Smitha Mundasad and Philippa Roxby answer some of your questions: The benefits of getting a vaccine are likely to apply mainly to a future wave of infection. And we don't know for certain when the next wave will occur or how severe it will be. Most healthy children do not get severely ill from Covid-19 but some do. With this in mind families may decide to take the paediatric dose for their 11-year-olds while their children are eligible  - as this will provide some protection relatively quickly. Experts are advising children to have their vaccines in the school holidays to avoid disruption to their education from any flu-like side effects of the jab. Covid vaccines may not have been around of many years but they have been heavily scrutinised from the moment they were developed. Safety monitoring systems set up around the world - including the UK'sMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority,external- collect and share the very latest information from the hundreds of millions of people who have been vaccinated against Covid so far. This shows most side-effects are mild and short-lived - such as pain at the injection site or a fever. Some more serious side-effects, including inflammation of the heart muscle, are rare. Looking at the history of other vaccines, most side-effects become apparent within the first few months of having a jab. And side-effects need to be weighed against the harms of Covid infection. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? Some medical conditions put children at higher risk of getting severe Covid. This includes chronic heart conditions and in some cases congenital heart disease. If your child's illness is on theat-risk list,external- and it would be best to check with her GP or specialist - then the advice is she should be offered two doses of the vaccine to help protect her from severe disease. Otherwise healthy children are at lower risk of severe Covid but a small number will still get very unwell with it. England to offer Covid jab to five to 11-year-olds Scotland to offer vaccine to children aged five to 11 Wales becomes first UK nation to offer jabs to younger children Natural immunity arising from prior infection will contribute towards protection against future infection and disease. But how strong that protection is can vary highly from person to person. And some studies suggest protection against severe disease is more consistently strong from vaccines. Getting vaccinated - even if someone has had Covid-19 already - means they are more likely to be protected for longer. The potential benefits from vaccination apply mainly to a future wave of infection; the more severe a future wave, the greater the likely benefits. In terms of side-effects,in the United States,external, fewer than two cases of vaccine-related myocarditis have been reported per million doses. The UK's vaccine advisory body has recommended the jab for your daughter but there's no major rush for her to get it. Children are at extremely low risk from the virus and if she has recently been infected, she will have some in-built protection already. She would have to wait for four weeks after her last infection before having a jab in any case. Two vaccine doses on top that would mean she would be well-protected if there was a new variant or a new wave of infections this winter. The vaccines aren't very good at stopping infections but they do provide strong protection against serious disease, and that lasts for some time.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Fire engulfs a market in Hargeisa the capital city of Somaliland Residents of the capital of Somaliland, Hargeisa, have woken to scenes of devastation after fire tore through the main market overnight. The blaze destroyed hundreds of businesses in the densely crowded market area as firefighters struggled to gain access to the flames. But it appears that nobody was killed though 28 people were injured. The blaze is a setback for the city of 1.2 million people, capital of the unrecognised Republic of Somaliland. Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia just over 30 years ago, has escaped much of the chaos and violence that plague its neighbour. Somaliland profile The unrecognised nation where 15-year-olds vote The fire started around 20:00 (17:00 GMT) on Friday and was not brought under control until Saturday morning, Efe news agency reports. The cause was not immediately known. ""The town has never witnessed such a massive calamity,"" the city's mayor Abdikarim Ahmed Moge told reporters. ""This place was the economic centre of Hargeisa and even though the firefighters did their best to contain the fire, the market is destroyed."" The market - the biggest open-air market in the city - was a hub of activity with hundreds of small businesses. Somaliland has a high rate of unemployment and the market was a lifeline for many poor families who depended on it to make a living. The fire happened just a few hours after the month of Ramadan began, when food business traditionally booms. Somaliland President Muse Bihi Abdi said the fire had destroyed goods worth millions of dollars. Responding to news of the disaster in the former British protectorate,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted,externalhe was ""saddened to see... such destruction in the open market that is the economic heart of the city"". ""Your city will rise again and the UK will do what we can to support Somaliland's rebuilding effort,"" he added. Market trader Bashi Ali told AFP news agency he had possessed several businesses in the market and they had all been burnt to ash. ""All we can learn from this disaster is to plan the market well,"" he said. Dramatic photos of the aftermath of the blaze were posted by journalist Fahad Karie The market used to be home to about 2,000 shops and stalls Officials said it started on Friday but was largely brought under control by dawn on Saturday Somaliland profile The unrecognised nation where 15-year-olds vote Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Amazon Labor Union leader Christian Smalls celebrates the landmark win A team of Amazon workers has forced the technology giant to recognise a trade union in the US for the first time. Workers at a New York warehouse voted 55% in favour of joining the Amazon Labor Union. The group is led by former Amazon worker Chris Smalls, who made his name protesting against safety conditions at the retail giant during the pandemic. Mr Smalls' victory marks a major defeat for Amazon, which had fiercely fought against unionisation. However, in Alabama, where Amazon was facing a separate union drive, the company appeared to have fended off activists in a tight contest in which challenged ballots could yet overturn that result. Together, the two elections mark a milestone for activists, who have long decried labour practices at Amazon, the country's second largest employer. Mr Smalls emerged from the vote count looking tired but jubilant, and popped open a bottle of champagne he was handed by supporters. ""We did whatever it took to connect with these workers,"" he told the crowd, recounting an against-the-odds campaign that started with ""two tables, two chairs and a tent"" and relied on an online fundraiser for money. ""I hope that everybody's paying attention now because a lot of people doubted us."" Are we now in a 'golden age' for trade unions? The former Amazon worker who could make history In a statement, Amazon said it was disappointed by the loss in New York and that it was evaluating how to proceed. It also accused regulators of improperly influencing the vote. ""We believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,"" the company said. ""We're evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the [National Labor Relations Board]"". Amazon fired Christian Smalls in 2020 after his protest, citing quarantine violations Rebecca Givan, professor of labour studies at Rutgers University, said Amazon's defeat by Mr Smalls and his team of worker-organisers was a ""really big deal"", calling it a ""David and Goliath story"" that upset the odds. But she warned he will be facing another tough fight when it comes to contract negotiations. ""Amazon will do everything it can do undo this success, to break up these workers and to try to stop the momentum that will inevitably come from this victory,"" she said. After the vote, Chris Smalls was instantly surrounded by supporters and assembled camera crews. He and his team of worker organisers had struck out on their own, creating a brand new, independent labour union to launch their fight against Amazon. Their victory was a moment of vindication for the former Amazon worker, whomthe company once called ""not smart, or articulate""in a leaked strategy memo. But, as he told the crowd, it is far bigger than that. Amazon employs more than one million people in the US and it has extraordinary influence on work practices - even outside its doors. The company has put up a wall of resistance to unions since its inception. With this win, activists are hoping that wall is about to crumble. Amazon has already poured resources into fighting the unionising efforts, which it sees as an obstacle to business flexibility and warehouse efficiency. Officials have said the company offers competitive pay and benefits and believes it is better to work directly with workers. In meetings about the vote, representatives questioned union leaders' ability to win more in contract negotiations. Amazon said it may challenge the results, citing the timing of a decision by the National Labor Relations Board to sue the company last month alleging unfair labour practices in New York. As part of its statement, it shared comments by two of the country's most powerful business lobbies also raising objections, including a letter from the National Retail Federation to congressional leaders that called for an investigation of the matter. More than 4,000 votes were cast in the New York election Mr Smalls said he was undaunted by the challenges ahead. The 33-year-old had worked for Amazon for more than four years before the company fired him in 2020, after his coronavirus protest, citing quarantine violations. He established the Amazon Labor Union last year, calling for higher pay, stronger medical benefits, anti-discrimination policies and better leave among other changes. The 2,654 to 2,131 victory gives his group the right to negotiate a contract with Amazon for the roughly 8,000 workers at the Staten Island warehouse. His team is also behind a second union campaign at a smaller warehouse in the same industrial park, which is scheduled for a vote later this month. ""There's no doubt in my mind we're going to be successful in that one as well,"" he said. Organisers said Amazon made critical mistakes ahead of the vote, such as pushing to reverse policies relaxed under Covid, including allowing workers to keep their mobiles with them while working. Amazon Labor Union secretary Karen Ponce says defeating Amazon wasn't easy Still they said their win in some ways surprised even them, despite the intense efforts they had made to reach out to workers and make their case ahead of the vote. ""Watching all of this come true is pretty crazy,"" said Karen Ponce, Amazon worker and secretary of the Amazon Labor Union. The union drives at Amazon come amid an upswell of labour activism in the US. In recent months, organisers have led successful campaigns at coffee chain Starbucks, media outlets, smaller retailers and others. Analysts say the pandemic galvanised workers worried about their safety. The rapid rebound of the economy since the coronavirus shock has also produced an unusually tight labour market, giving workers more leverage. But across the US, just 6.1% of private sector workers belong to unions. ""It continues to be very difficult for workers to organize collectively,"" Prof Givan said. In Alabama, workers at the Bessemer warehouse voted 993 to 875 against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, regulators said on Thursday. More than 400 challenged ballots have yet to be counted and could change that result. The unofficial tally showed a much closer election than the lopsided victory that Amazon claimed after last year's election, which regulators later declared invalid, ordering a do-over citing labour rule violations by Amazon. Amazon appeared to have headed off a separate union challenge at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama Turnout was also lower, with less than 40% of the more than 6,000 people working at the Bessemer warehouse casting votes in the election. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, which led the unionising drive in Alabama, said he was excited by the possibility of a union victory in New York. Crediting Mr Smalls and his team, he also said their win in part reflected differences between New York - where one in five workers is unionised - and Alabama, which is a notoriously anti-labour state. He said his union's initial union effort at the Amazon warehouse in Alabama last year had ""ignited a movement"". ""Regardless of the final outcome, workers here have shown what is possible,"" he said at a press conference on Thursday following the Alabama count. ""This is a sign of more to come.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv As Russia pulls its forces back from areas around Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the BBC has seen evidence of potential war crimes on the outskirts of the city. Our correspondent Jeremy Bowen counted 13 bodies on one small stretch of highway where, just hours earlier, Russian forces had been in control. We know who two of the dead were: a Ukrainian father and mother who had been fleeing to the capital with their daughter and an elderly woman. We know this because their deaths - as he put his hands up in surrender, trying desperately to stop Russian forces firing on the car they were travelling in - were caught on camera by a drone. In other places along the road, attempts had been made to cover up the bodies. Our correspondent says we don't know what happened to these people, but a credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by either the tank crew seen in the drone video, or other Russian soldiers. The drone footage has been handed to the authorities for investigation. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes made since the start of the invasion in February, and both the UN and the International Criminal Court are looking into them. Read Jeremy Bowen's full report into what he and his team found here Several fuel tanks are ablaze, Russian media report Russia accused Ukraine of being responsible for a huge fire at an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod. Russian officials said two Ukrainian military helicopters had crossed the border from Ukraine and fired missiles at the facility. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Russian city of Belgorod, some 40km (25 miles) from the border, said the early morning rocket attack left eight fuel tanks ablaze. Initial statements from Ukraine would neither confirm nor deny that - but later in the day, the secretary of Ukraine's security council, Oleksiy Danilov, said the Russian version of events ""does not correspond to reality"". But if it is true that Ukraine mounted the attack, our defence correspondent Jonathan Beale notes, it would mark the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target, bringing the war home to Russia. And it isn't impossible: the skills needed - flying low and fast to avoid detection - are ones Ukrainian pilots have been honing in recent years as the country battled separatists in the east. Read more here. A Red Cross team which had hoped to make it to the besieged city of Mariupol to help with an evacuation effort was forced to turn back after ""arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed"". The team of nine from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had been hoping to help evacuate some of the thousands of residents still trapped in the coastal city, large parts of which have been destroyed in the fighting. The regional governor has accused Russia of breaking a promise to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol. The ICRC said it will try again on Saturday. It had initially been planned for Thursday. Moscow has begun shifting its attention from the capital and the north in general, trying instead to encircle Ukraine's forces in the east of the country. Its army is moving south, taking control of the city of Izyum and bombarding a succession of towns to the east. Eventually, it hopes to move further south still, to the town of Slovyansk. But what is it that Russia wants with this region, known as the Donbas? On paper at least, the aim is to ""liberate"" its Russian-speaking majority. The question remains: can Moscow's forces defeat the Ukrainian army here and - crucially - do the people of this former coal and steel-producing region want to be liberated? As the BBC's Paul Kirby has been finding out, a shared language may not be enough to win the region's loyalty. Read more:Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east The row between Europe and Moscow over how to pay for Russian gas continues. However, despite 1 April being the first day that all Russian gas must be paid for in roubles and through Russian bank accounts, the flow of gas has not been stopped. This is because shipments that have already been paid for are not affected. But anything ordered from today onwards will need to follow the new rules, it seems.

"Ukrainians have fled the war across Hungary's eastern border ""Peace or War"" is at stake screams the headline in the tabloid Metropol, handed out to morning commuters flocking through the Western Station in Budapest. And there's a neat blue cross in the box next to the ""peace"" option. That's the slogan of Viktor Orban's Fidesz party, as it battles to win a record fourth consecutive term in office in elections on Sunday. After 12 years in power, they face their first genuine challenge from an opposition alliance of six parties that has united under one candidate: Peter Marki-Zay. And Russia's war in Ukraine has given added impetus to the race. Hungary shares a border with Ukraine and has taken in more than half a million refugees so far. Mr Orban insists that by helping the people, but refusing to supply weapons to Ukraine, only he can keep Hungary out of the war. Viktor Orban's party is seeking a fourth consecutive term in office His party's slogan of peace or war may be simplistic, but it is effective. And it is broadcast, printed, and lit up in bright letters wherever you look in Hungary. It interrupts any music you play on YouTube, and even videos that include international coverage of the war in Ukraine. The government has spent eight times more on its campaign than all the opposition parties combined, according to a group of critical monitoring organisations. It helps that the ruling party has the support of a largely pliant media. The opposition's catch-phrase, on the other hand, is ""Orban or Europe"". Their candidate Peter Marki-Zay argues that Hungary should join Poland, the UK and others in supplying arms to Ukraine. And if called upon, and only within a Nato framework, should even consider sending troops. Peter Marki-Zay has backed Ukraine's fight against Russian invasion The opposition complains that Fidesz has isolated Hungary from the European mainstream, from consensual democracy, fairness and decency. And that in this war Mr Orban has even alienated Hungary's closest allies - Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - the other members of the Visegrad-4 group. A V4 defence ministers' meeting was abruptly cancelled this week, with the Czech defence minister accusing Mr Orban of valuing Russian oil over Ukrainian blood. But it was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky whose message hit home hardest. ""There can be no Russian branches in Europe that divide the EU from within,"" he said in an address to the Danish parliament on Wednesday. ""This must stop, and Europe must stop listening to the excuses of Budapest."" Hungary gets 85% of its gas and 64% of its oil from Russia, through a pipeline that deliberately circumvents Ukraine. However, a Hungary-Russia deal to expand the Paks nuclear power station south of Budapest with Russian finance and technology looks increasingly jeopardised by the war. And with Hungary's election campaign reaching its peak, President Zelensky chose the recent EU summit to address a very personal message to Mr Orban. ""Listen, Viktor, do you know what's going on in Mariupol? And you hesitate whether to impose sanctions or not? And you hesitate whether to let weapons through or not? And you hesitate whether to trade with Russia or not? There is no time to hesitate. It's already time to decide."" Mr Zelensky also made a poignant reference to Budapest's famous shoe monument on the banks of the Danube. The 60 pairs of bronze shoes remember Hungary's Jews, murdered and pushed into the river by Hungarian fascists in the winter of 1944. Days after his speech, Ukrainians in Budapest arranged new shoes among the bronze ones on the Danube embankment, decorated with flowers and the blue and yellow ribbons of the Ukrainian flag - in memory of all the dead in Mariupol and elsewhere in Ukraine, victims of the Russian invasion. Hungarians laid shoes beside the Danube this week in memory of the victims of Russia's bombardment of Mariupol The idea that Hungary is isolated from an otherwise pro-Ukraine Europe is an argument the government side bitterly rejects. Ahead of the vote, Mr Orban told his final campaign rally: ""If the opposition wins on Sunday, the next day they will start delivering weapons to Ukraine, and close the taps on the Russian gas pipelines. Our heart is with [the Ukrainians], but Hungary has to stand up for its own interests."" Peter Marki-Zay, 49: Candidate for six-party opposition, mayor of central town of Hodmezovasarhely since 2018 Backs introduction of euro and joining the European Public Prosecutors Office Practising Catholic who supports LGBT rights ""[Orban] still cannot decide how to keep an equal distance from the killers and the victims [in Ukraine]"" Could this man oust Orban? Viktor Orban, 58: A fierce anti-Soviet campaigner as a student First spell as prime minister 1998-2002; returned to power in 2010, 2014 and 2018 Leads a conservative, nationalist government, preaching ""illiberal democracy"" ""Hungarian policy is neither Ukrainian-friendly nor Russian-friendly: it's Hungarian-friendly"" The man who thinks Europe has been invaded The election arithmetic suggests a closer race than the government would like. According to opposition paper Nepszava, Fidesz is assured of victory in 41 of the country's 106 individual constituencies, while the opposition alliance can count on 33. That leaves 32 battleground districts where the opposition has to break through. The remaining 93 seats in Hungary's 199 seat Parliament are divided according to party lists. Different polling agencies suggest a record turnout - perhaps as high as 80%, compared with 70% four years ago. In a country of 9.7 million, the electorate was split almost evenly - 2.6 million apiece - four years ago. Pollsters reckon that this election will be decided by between 300,000 and 600,000 voters who are either undecided or uncommitted, and who are in the cross-hairs of campaigners from both sides.

"Millions of households are facing a Â£700 a year rise in energy costs, alongside hikes in the cost of council tax, water bills and other utilities. It has led to warnings that many people on lower incomes will be forced to choose between paying for heating, or food. A selection of your questions have been answered by: Kevin Peachey -personal finance correspondent Nicholas Barrett -Reality Check Why do we pay more using a prepayment meter? - Gary Steventon For the 4.5 million people on prepayment meters, the price of energy has now risen by an average Â£708 - to Â£2,017 a year. That compares to an annual rise of Â£693 - to Â£1,971 - for those on standard tariffs, paid by direct debit. Energy regulator Ofgem's argument is that there are higher fixed costs associated with running a prepayment meter. Charities and some suppliers have said that these customers are often among the most vulnerable and should be given more help by the government. Prepayment energy customers feeling the strain Who allowed the price cap to increase by so much, especially when the energy companies have made record profits? - Chris Yaxley The price cap, covering England, Wales and Scotland, is set every six months by energy regulator Ofgem. It is designed to reflect the costs faced by suppliers and to prevent profiteering. There has been a huge rise this time, owing to the rising cost energy companies pay for gas. This is now being passed on to customers. How high could my energy bills go? There has been a debate aboutwhether energy companies should be taxed more, with the money raised used to help those struggling with bills. Energy companies argue that their retail arms are making very little, or no, profit. While the energy generation business is having a much better time of it, they argue that they are already heavily taxed. Gas prices do not increase by themselves. What is causing the increase? - John Ashburn There are a host of reasons why the wholesale price of gas - paid by energy companies - has been volatile. At present it is about six times higher than it was a year ago. One reason is the surge in demand for energy, as businesses and economies get going again after the lifting of Covid restrictions. There is also the ongoing issue of a shortage of gas storage across Europe. A further rise in the price cap - predicted to push up the typical household energy bill by another Â£600 a year - is expected in October. This is mainly because of the potential restriction of Russian gas supplies - linked to the war in Ukraine. While we get very little gas from Russia in the UK, we are affected by the global price of gas. Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? Money tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise Can people forced to work from home ask employers to contribute to energy bills? - Andrew Green There is nothing to stop you asking. What response you get from your employer is down to them. Some employers have offeredtemporary grants and payments, to help their staff pay their energy bills. Unions and employees themselves are likely to point to the rising cost of living - including higher energy bills - to ask for higher salaries. Will giving up Netflix, Amazon Prime, alcohol and mobile phones offset the rising cost? - Leslie Cox The average UK household spends about Â£916 on alcohol each year. The cheapest Netflix plan costs Â£84 a year, while Amazon Prime costs Â£96. Some mobile phone deals exceed Â£80 a month but, depending on your contract, you may be able to switch to a SIM-only deal for as little as Â£36 a year. Giving up all of these costs could save between Â£1,132 and Â£2,056 a year. A 54% rise in the energy price cap means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will now pay Â£1,971 per year. So, going without could make a difference. But even then, a further rise pushing the annual bill up to Â£2,600 should be expected in October, analysts have told the BBC. How is the assistance provided going to help pensioners who have been robbed of a triple-lock increase? Dave The triple-lock, a policy used to set the rise in state pensions, wassuspendedlast year because it followed the average rise in wages and would have meant an increase of 8%. At the time that seemed like a big increase, but inflation is now 6.2%. Instead of the state pension going up by 8%, it's going up by 3.1% - based on the rate of inflation in September last year, which is a much smaller pay rise for state pensioners. Changes announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Spring Statement were mostly aimed at working people who pay National Insurance. There has not been any specific new support for pensioners. What is the triple lock and why has it been 'suspended'? Why have tariffs on 100% renewable electricity gone up? - Karl Oldham Eco providers are still affected by wholesale prices, which are driving bill rises. These providers try to buy in advance from renewable sources, and invest in schemes for renewable generation. But ultimately, at present, they have to source electricity from the National Grid - some of which is generated from gas. As a result, they are not immune to the situation in the wider market, and prices charged by renewable generators have been going up too.
