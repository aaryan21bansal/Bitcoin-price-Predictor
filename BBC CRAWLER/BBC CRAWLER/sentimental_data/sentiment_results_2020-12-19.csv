"The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it was ""the moment of truth"" for the talks There will be no post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and EU unless there is a ""substantial shift"" from Brussels in the coming days, a government source has told the BBC. It is understood there is likely to be a decision before Christmas on whether or not a deal can be reached. The two sides have been in negotiations about how many years it will take to phase in new fisheries arrangements. The EU's Michel Barnier said any deal must be ""balanced and reciprocal"". The talks are expected to continue on Monday, a UK government source has said. Writing on Twitter on Sunday,external, Mr Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said the talks were at a ""crucial moment"" and the two sides were working ""hard"" to try to narrow their differences. ""We respect the sovereignty of the UK and we expect the same. Both the EU and Britain must have the right to set their own laws and control their own waters. And we should both be able to act when our interests are at stake."" Whitehall sources say it is increasingly likely the UK will end its post-Brexit transition period without a free trade agreement with the EU, meaning that on 1 January the two sides will rely on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to govern exports and imports. This could see tariffs introduced on goods being sold and bought - which may lead to increased prices for certain products. A government source told the BBC the EU was ""still struggling to get the flexibility needed from member states"" to make a deal possible. ""We need to get any deal right and based on terms which respect what the British people voted for. ""We're continuing to try every possible path to an agreement, but without a substantial shift from the [European] Commission we will be leaving on WTO terms on 31 December."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said an agreement was in both sides' interests ""given all the problems that are going on on the continent as well as here"" with Covid, but the EU needed to give ground. ""I hope the EU moves on its unreasonable demands, that I don't think anybody could reasonably accept, and then we can get a trade deal,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""But we are ready, whatever's necessary."" Brexit: Can the talks be extended? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to keep talking, but warned gaps had yet to be bridged. Senior MEPs in the European Parliament have said they will not be ""rushed"" into signing off a deal on their side and want to see the text of any agreement by Sunday if they are to approve it by the end of the year. A senior EU source told the BBC's Brussels correspondent Nick Beake: ""The Member States are the EU. And as a former member state, the UK knows well that the EU negotiator is there to protect the interest of Europeans. ""We believe it is in both sides' interest to reach a fair deal, which cannot be the case without a level playing field and sustainable arrangements for fisheries."" This video can not be played Michel Barnier says negotiations have ""just a few hours"" The two sides have been at odds over the length of time it will take to introduce new arrangements once the UK leaves the bloc's Common Fisheries Policy. The UK, led by its chief negotiator, David Frost, has insisted its sovereign rights over its waters must be respected from day one and its fleets must be able to keep a much larger share of their own catch. The EU is insisting on a much longer transition period, with guarantees on access and how catches are distributed. The two sides are reported to have made progress in recent days on the issues of fair competition and what to do if the UK is deemed to get an unfair competitive advantage by moving away from EU rules and standards. What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? If a deal is reached between the two sides, it would need to be agreed by parliaments in the UK and the European Union's member states. UK MPs have now finished for the Christmas break, but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said on Thursday that they could be called back to ratify a deal in the coming days, were one to be agreed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit?

"Gen Gustave Perna: ""Please accept my personal apologies"" The army general in charge of distributing Covid vaccines in the US has admitted he failed over the initial number of doses promised to states. Gen Gustave Perna, the head of Operation Warp Speed, said he took ""personal responsibility for the miscommunication"" to state governors. More than a dozen states have expressed alarm at a cut in the expected number. The Pfizer-BioNTech doses are being rolled out following approval - and a Moderna vaccine is now also approved. What you need to know about vaccine safety When will I get a Covid vaccine in US? How do the Covid vaccines compare? The US has registered more than 17.5 million of the 76 million infections confirmed globally since the pandemic began, along with 315,000 deaths. Both are the highest numbers in the world,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external. Gen Perna apologised several times to state governors during a telephone briefing to reporters. He said he had given out the numbers of doses based on what he believed would be ready, stressing it was his personal fault. ""I'm the one who approved forecast sheets. I'm the one who approved allocations,"" he said. ""There is no problem with the process. There is no problem with the Pfizer vaccine. There is no problem with the Moderna vaccine. ""I failed. I'm adjusting. I'm fixing and we'll move forward from there."" This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered US media said some states had been told the doses they would get next week would be lower. The New York Times listed 14 states by name, including California, New Jersey and Michigan. Governor Jay Inslee of Washington state tweeted on Thursday: ""This is disruptive and frustrating. We need accurate, predictable numbers to plan and ensure on-the-ground success."" Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said the White House was ""slow-walking the process"". Gen Perna said: ""Please accept my personal apologies if this was disruptive to your decision-making."" Gen Perna said he did not know ""with exactness"" when all the vaccines available would be distributed. This video can not be played The day the US began Covid vaccinations The department of health and human services suggested the discrepancy could be between the number of doses manufactured, and the number actually ready for distribution, given that they have to undergo sterility and other tests. Gen Perna said the newly approved Moderna vaccine would begin shipping out on Sunday and that he was on track to get a combined total about 20 million doses of the vaccines to states by the first week of January. He said he hoped to get the system working ""flawlessly"". Both vaccines are said to be about 95% effective. The US vaccination programme aims to reach 100 million people by April. About 5% of the US population are known to have been infected since the pandemic began. Since mid-November, the seven-day rolling average of Covid-related deaths has soared from just over 1,000 to more than 2,500. A number of states are overwhelmed. California is struggling to find beds for patients - some 17,000 people are in hospital, double the previous high in July. About 130,000 people in the US have so far received vaccine shots in the biggest mass vaccination in US history. The first tranche of 2.9 million doses will go to frontline health-care workers and long-term care facility residents, although this initial tranche will not cover those two categories in full. Some 70%-80% of the US population of 328 million would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, officials believe. The other key problem is a $900bn (Â£665bn) coronavirus economic relief package that has been stalled by months of partisan wrangling. The latest stumbling block appears to be the complicated issue of emergency Federal Reserve powers. These are normally used to deal with market turmoil and the Republicans do not want Joe Biden to have the power to use them on Covid after he takes office on 20 January. Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted: ""We're right within reach.""

"The River Towy at Carmarthen flooded on Saturday A landslip at a coal tip is being investigated by engineers following heavy rain. Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said about a 40-50m section had slipped at Wattstown, although he did not believe it posed a risk to the nearby Rhondda bypass. Elsewhere, parts of Carmarthen have flooded after the River Towy burst its banks. Flood warnings and alerts,externalremain in place in some parts of Wales.

"Mike Pompeo said investigators were still ""unpacking precisely what [the cyber-attack] is"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Russia for what is being described as the worst-ever cyber espionage attack on the US government. ""We can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,"" Mr Pompeo said on Friday. President Trump downplayed the attack's severity - saying it was ""under control"" - and cast doubt on Russia's role, hinting at Chinese involvement. The hack, targeting software made by US firm SolarWinds, was found last week. However, it had been going on for months. Russia has denied any involvement in the attack. Among the US agencies targeted was the office that manages nuclear weapons. That government organisation, the US energy department, said however that the arsenal's security had not been compromised. Five Russian hacks that transformed US cyber-security SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack is so serious Hacking the heart of the US government Several other organisations around the world, including in the UK, are understood to have been targeted by hackers using the same network management software. Researchers, who have named the hack Sunburst, say it could take years to fully comprehend what is one of the biggest ever cyber-attacks. In a radio interview with US talk show host Mark Levin on Friday, Mr Pompeo said he believed that Russia had, over a period of months, penetrated several US government agencies and private companies, along with other companies and governments around the world. He said there was ""a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside US government systems"". Along with the US energy department, federal agencies targeted by what has been described as a sophisticated cyber espionage operation include the Treasury and departments of homeland security, state, defence and commerce. Mr Pompeo said that US investigators looking into the attack were still ""unpacking precisely what it is"", and that much of the information would likely remain classified. He said that Russia was trying to ""undermine our way of life"", adding that Russian President ""Vladimir Putin remains a real risk"". In two tweets on Saturday, Mr Trump again turned on what he labels the ""fake news media"" for exaggerating the matter. Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo have not always had identical views on Russia He wrote: ""The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. ""I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!)."" He did not mention his own secretary of state's comments and supplied no evidence on any Chinese involvement. Mr Pompeo has taken a strong line against Russia before. In his time as secretary of state, theUS has pulled out of a key nuclear treatyandthe Open Skies Treaty on aerial surveillance flights. But the president has been far more ambivalent towards Moscow, downplaying such incidents asallegations that Russia offered the Taliban bounties to kill US troops- something Mr Pompeo had issued Moscow a stern warning about. President-elect Joe Biden, who is due to be sworn in on 20 January, has vowed to make cyber-security a ""top priority"" of his administration. ""We need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber-attacks in the first place,"" he said on Thursday. ""We will do that by, among other things, imposing substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks, including in co-ordination with our allies and partners."" Hackers managed to gain access to major organisations by compromising network management software developed by Texas-based IT company SolarWinds. The access could have allowed the hackers to take a high degree of control over the networks of organisations using that software, but appears to have been used to steal data rather than for any disruptive or destructive impact. The US government agencies hacked It is thought that those behind the operation targeted a narrow set of organisationsin an attempt to steal national-security, defence and other related information. However, while software may have been downloaded, that does not necessarily mean data was taken. SolarWinds Orion, the computer network tool at the source of the breach, earlier said that 18,000 of its 300,000 customers might have been affected, but there is no indication that significant theft of customer or citizen data was an aim of the cyber-attack. Investigators have said the months-long operation through SolarWinds could have been launched before March this year. For more than three decades,hackers linked to Moscow are believed to have tried to steal US secrets online. Why US spy world is feeling so uneasy right now US cyber-security firm hit by 'state-sponsored' attack This video can not be played Experts have been warning for years that it's not a matter of if, but when, hackers will kill somebody US energy department caught up in giant cyber-hack More US government agencies hacked US Treasury and commerce department hacked UK assessing impact of major hacking campaign At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The explosion at the Sanko University Hospital caused a fire, which authorities said was quickly extinguished Nine people have been killed after an oxygen ventilator exploded at a hospital treating coronavirus patients in southern Turkey, officials say. The blast caused a fire in the intensive care unit of the private Sanko University Hospital in Gaziantep, the local governor's office said. At least one of the patients died while being transferred to another hospital. Turkey has recorded nearly two million coronavirus cases,externaland 17,610 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. No injuries were reported in relation to the fire, which occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning and was quickly put out.

"The Boeing 737 Max was grounded in March 2019 following two deadly crashes US Senate investigators say that Boeing officials ""inappropriately coached"" test pilots during efforts to recertify the company's 737 Max aircraft. The planes were grounded in March 2019 following two deadly crashes. Investigators accused Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials of ""attempting to cover up important information"". Boeing said it was reviewing the findings and took them ""seriously"", while the FAA defended its conduct. The FAA said the Senate Commerce Committee's report contained ""a number of unsubstantiated allegations"", and that its review of the 737 Max had been thorough. It said it was confident that safety issues with the aircraft had been addressed. The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia came within five months of each other and together killed 346 people. They have been attributed to flaws in automated flight software called MCAS, which prompted the planes to nosedive shortly after take-off. This video can not be played Zipporah Kuria's father Joseph Waithaka was one of 157 people killed when a Boeing 737 Max crashed in March 2019 A simulator test was conducted as part of the FAA's efforts to ensure that the aircraft could be made safe to fly again. The test was designed to see how quickly pilots could react to the faulty software. In its report on Friday,the Senate committee said that based on ""corroborated whistleblower information and testimony during interviews of FAA staff"",external, it concluded that FAA and Boeing officials involved in the test had ""established a pre-determined outcome to reaffirm a long-held human factor assumption related to pilot reaction time"". 'Boeing played Russian roulette with people's lives' ""Boeing officials inappropriately coached test pilots in the MCAS simulator testing contrary to testing protocol,"" it said. ""It appears, in this instance, FAA and Boeing were attempting to cover up important information that may have contributed to the 737 Max tragedies."" The report cited a whistleblower who claimed that Boeing officials prompted test pilots to use a particular control immediately before an exercise. It comes afterthe FAA last month cleared Boeing's 737 Max plane to fly again.It said existing aircraft would need to be modified before going back into service, with changes to their design, while pilots would need retraining. The FAA said the design changes it had required had ""eliminated what caused these particular accidents"".

""She lives in a tier four area and is on her own. She's been isolating for a week, so there's no risk at all. ""I understand what the government is doing to stop the virus, but sure they must be able to make exceptions?"" Lesley and her husband Ian Like many others who contacted the BBC, Lawrence in north London wanted to express his frustration that the announcement came without much notice. He was due to get married on 23 December but is bracing himself for the register office telling him it can no longer go ahead due to tier four restrictions being put in place. ""My wedding is up in the air,"" he said. ""I have emailed the register office in north London and am waiting to see what they say. ""I'll be upset but it won't be the end of the world because it will take place at some point. ""The wedding not going ahead will see us out of pocket by about Â£500-600.

""The government could have done things earlier."" Jonathan Barnes, 40, in Suffolk is facing the prospect of a Christmas alone following the announcement of the Welsh lockdown. ""I'm married with two young children,"" he said. ""Our parents live in Pembrokeshire and we live in Suffolk. ""My wife's mum has a very short period of time left to live so they have gone down to Wales before me to spend some quality time with her. ""I was planning to join on Wednesday after work for the five days over Christmas. The new lockdown in Wales means I shouldn't join my family and instead will be stuck at home in tier two on my own."" His mother-in-law has terminal cancer. And while he says he wants to see her, he thinks it is important to ""err on the side of caution"". ""It's not about getting away with it,"" he said. ""It's about doing the right thing."" ""I'm thinking the wisest thing to do is to spend Christmas alone. ""To announce a Welsh lockdown immediately gives no-one time to plan. The government shouldn't have announced the relaxation of the rules over Christmas originally. ""If they'd have said Christmas is locked down people would have adjusted to that early on. I'm disappointed to be spending Christmas alone but I understand the reasons why.""

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford: New virus variant is ""more aggressive, spreads more quickly and affects more people"" A Wales-wide lockdown has been brought forward to Sunday with festive plans cancelled for all but Christmas Day. First Minister Mark Drakeford told people to ""stay at home"" after urgent talks with ministersover a new variant of coronavirus. Plans to relax rules from 23 to 27 December to allow people to celebrate with loved-ones have been scrapped. Meeting up is now limited to Christmas Day. Announcing the new measures, meaning people have to stay at home and only go out for essential reasons, Mr Drakeford said hundreds of people had already contracted the new, ""more aggressive"" variant of the virus in Wales. ""While we all want to avoid further disruption to businesses and plans for Christmas, our overriding duty is to protect lives here in Wales,"" he said. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Q&A: Which rules are changing and when? What's the advice on travelling over Christmas? The changes mean the Wales-wide lockdown, which was due to come into effect from 28 December, has been brought forward. Boris Johnson has announced similar rules in England for Christmas, as well as tier four restrictionsfor London and the south east of England. In Scotland,Covid restrictions will only be relaxed for one day at Christmasand mainland Scotland will be placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. From Sunday, all of Wales is in the highest level of lockdown -level four,external- with all but essential shops closed, and people being told to ""stay home"" to save lives. Gyms and beauty salons and non-essential shops will have to close at the end of trading today, while bars and restaurants will only be able to open for takeaways, and people will only be allowed to travel for ""essential reasons"". During the level four lockdown period people will not be allowed to mix with anyone they do not live with, with only single person households allowed to form an exclusive support bubble with one other household. From 23 to 27 December restrictions had been due to be eased to allow people from two households in Wales to meet - plus a single person household. But now this period of relaxed rules has been cancelled, for all but Christmas Day. On Christmas Day people will be able meet others to form a so-called ""Christmas bubble"", but people are being advised not to as cases continue to rise. If you live in Wales, you will be able to travel to meet one other household - and a single person household - on Christmas Day anywhere in Wales. You can also leave Wales to meet your household, subject to the local restrictions in the area you would be travelling to. But the rules say you would need to be back at your own home by the end of the day. What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What are the different rules around the UK? Mr Drakeford said people who had already made plans to meet another household on Christmas Day had to do it ""sensibly and in line with the rules"". Leanne Miller, from Swansea, said the news had left her family's Christmas plans in tatters. ""I've got two boys, 12 and 13, and we were supposed to see my husband's mum and dad. But the important thing is keeping them safe,"" she said. The Welsh Government heldan emergency cabinet meetingon Saturday after serious concerns over a new strain of coronavirus, which has been confirmed in Wales. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas introduced tougher rules for London and south-east Englandfor Christmas, in response to rising cases. Shortly afterwards, Mr Drakeford announced the changes for Wales, saying: ""We now know that this new strain is significantly more infectious and spreads more quickly than the original one. ""Throughout the public health emergency, we have had to respond quickly to the rapid changes, which have been so typical of coronavirus. ""Today has been one of those days when new information has required an immediate response."" He said he was told by UK government chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Valance that there was no reason to believe the vaccine would be less effective with the new variant. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said it was clear the rules had to change due to the presence of a new variant of the virus. ""By working together and keeping to the rules we can ensure as many people as possible will be around to celebrate Christmas together in the years to come,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price MS said people would be disappointed but the country had a ""responsibility to keep one another safe"". He added: ""No one wanted a Christmas like this. While we are once again asked to make a sacrifice at what is usually a sociable time of year, our collective effort is necessary, particularly as a new variant of Covid-19 has been identified."" Covid case rates in Wales A total of 120,432 positive cases have now been confirmed in Wales since the start of the pandemic, and 3,046 people have died with Covid-19. The most recent data shows that all of the UK's seven most infected local authorities are in Wales. Almost all health boards in Wales have now suspended some non-emergency services, as the demand on services increases. Chris Williams of Public Health Wales said it was working with other UK organisations to respond to the new variant. ""It is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen.  Although the variant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe,"" he said. ""We are reminding people that all current guidance relating to coronavirus continues to apply to the new variant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination. ""The new variant shows up as positive in Public Health Wales' existing coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual way if they develop coronavirus symptoms. Belinda O'Donnell, owner of Penny Lane Vintage and The Furniture Shop in Cardiff, said the news was ""devastating"". ""I'm really shocked. It's disgusting really,"" she said. ""I recently got Christmas stock in - we're not going to recoup the money lost. They should have stuck to the original plans because we were prepared for that. ""We were working so hard to work towards that date. We haven't had the flow of people through, so we're struggling anyway."" Queues formed outside shops in Talbot Green after the announcement on Saturday CBI Wales director Ian Price said he was not surprised restrictions have been brought forward, ""however painful they may be"". ""Businesses know infection rates must be controlled to save lives and protect against longer-term economic scarring,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, invoking what is effectively a full lockdown at such a crucial time for many businesses - particularly those in the hardest-hit hospitality, retail and tourism sectors - will come as a fresh blow after many months of hardship and once again puts further jobs at risk."" Queues as shops prepare for last-minute lockdown Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? Sara Jones of the Welsh Retail Consortium said it recognised the difficult decisions behind the announcement, but said the consequences would be severe. ""For businesses, the government's stop-start approach is deeply unhelpful - this decision comes in the middle of peak trading which so many are depending on to power their recovery,"" she said. ""Faced with this news - and the prospect of losing Â£100m per week in sales for the third time this year - many businesses will be in serious difficulty and many thousands of jobs could be at risk.""

"Epstein was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges when he was found dead in his cell last year A former associate of deceased US financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has been placed under formal investigation and remanded in custody in France on suspicion of sex crimes. French modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel is accused of sexual harassment and the rape of minors aged between 15 and 18. Mr Brunel, 74, has denied wrongdoing. Epstein died in a New York prison last yearas he awaited trial over allegations he ran a network using underage girls for sex. ""This is what the victims have been waiting for for many years,"" said lawyer Anne-Claire Le Jeune, who is representing Mr Brunel's accusers. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Mr Brunel was detained at Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport on Wednesdayas he was preparing to board a flight to Senegal. He co-founded French modelling agency Karin Models in 1977, and MC2 Model Management in the US with funding from Epstein. US court documents allege that Mr Brunel procured girls for Epstein, flying them from France to the US and promising them modelling contracts. Virginia Giuffre, one of the main complainants in Epstein's prosecution, also claims to have been forced into sex with Mr Brunel. Epstein had an apartment on Paris's exclusive Avenue Foch, near the Arc de Triomphe His arrest is the result of an inquiry by French prosecutors into rape and sexual assault allegations against Epstein, focusing on potential crimes committed against French victims and suspects who are French citizens. French police last year raided the offices of Karin Models and a flat near the Arc de Triomphe owned by Epstein. Before his death, Epstein was charged in New York with sex trafficking and conspiracy and was awaiting trial. He was already a convicted sex offender, having pleaded guilty to prostitution charges involving a minor in Florida in 2008.

"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days.

They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period.

"This video can not be played 'Tier 4 residents must stay at home' as PM announces tighter restrictions The planned relaxation of Covid rules for Christmas has been scrapped for large parts of south-east England and cut to just Christmas Day for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales. From midnight, a new tier four will be introduced in areas including London, Kent, Essex and Bedfordshire. Those in tier four cannot mix indoors with anyone not from their household. Elsewhere in England, Scotland and Wales, relaxed indoor mixing rules are cut from five days to Christmas Day. What is tier four and who is in it? Should you see your family at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the changes for England at a Downing Street briefing after scientists said a new coronavirus variant was spreading more rapidly. Tier-four restrictions - similar to England's second national lockdown - will apply in all areas in the South East currently in tier three, covering Kent, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey (excluding Waverley), Gosport, Havant, Portsmouth, Rother and Hastings. It will also apply in London (all 32 boroughs and the City of London) and the East of England (Bedford, Central Bedford, Milton Keynes, Luton, Peterborough, Hertfordshire, Essex (excluding Colchester, Uttlesford and Tendring). In Scotland, Covid restrictions willonly be relaxed on Christmas Day, with mainland Scotland being placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. Outlining the changes, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wished she had acted quicker to curb the virus in February, adding: ""Standing here saying this actually makes me want to cry."" A ban on travel to the rest of the UK will also apply over the festive period. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced that thecountry will be placed under lockdown from midnight. In Northern Ireland,no changes have been made to Christmas restrictions,with three households allowed to meet from 23 to 27 December. The country is set to entera six-week lockdown from 26 December. For tier-four areas in England, a stay-at-home order has been issued, with exemptions for those who have to travel to work or for education. Social mixing will be cut to meeting one person in an open public space, unless you live with them or they are part of your existing support bubble. All non-essential retail will have to close, along with hairdressers, nail bars, indoor gyms and leisure facilities. People elsewhere will be advised not to travel into a tier-four area. The restrictions will last for two weeks, with the first review due on 30 December. NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' UK's R number back above one 'I won't have next summer let alone next Christmas' Mr Johnson told the Downing Street briefing he knew how ""disappointing"" the news would be, but said he believed there was no alternative open to him. When the virus changes its methods of attack, he said, ""we must change our method of defence"". Mr Johnson acknowledged it was ""unquestionably a difficult moment"" in the coronavirus crisis but insisted that things would be ""radically different"" by Easter due to the vaccine. He did not confirm whether police would be told to stop people travelling home over the festive period or knock on doors on Christmas Day. Mr Johnson said analysis suggested the new variant could increasethe the R numberby 0.4 or more. Although there is ""considerable uncertainty"", it may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant, he said. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said that while the new variant of coronavirus will make things much worse, if the vaccine works against it there was room for optimism. He has previously said there is no current evidence to suggest the new variant causes a higher mortality rate or that is affected any differently by vaccines and treatments. Speaking at the Downing Street briefing, he added: ""I think this is a situation which is going to make things a lot worse, but there are some really optimistic things if you look once we get the vaccine out, assuming the vaccine works against this, which at the moment is the working assumption."" Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, urged the public to assume they might be infectious when considering meeting others over Christmas. The steep increase in the proportion of coronavirus cases linked to this new variant is strong evidence that it is driving transmission. In London, 28% of cases were as a result of this new mutation in mid-November, but that has now increased to more than 60%. It may explain why, during the second lockdown, cases started to increase in London, while in Kent the tier three measures appear to have had little impact in recent weeks. As England's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says, this is a bad moment, but there is also some hope. Mutations happen all the time - there have been thousands of variations to this coronavirus since it emerged - and there is nothing to suggest this causes more serious illness or will hamper the effectiveness of the vaccine. The prime minister announced 350,000 people had been given the first dose of the vaccine in the first two weeks of the programme. In the coming weeks, the number of GP-led vaccination clinics should increase six-fold, while approval of a second vaccine made by Oxford University could pave the way for mass vaccination centres to be set up in sports stadiums and conference centres. That could see two million people a week being vaccinated. Within a matter of months all the over-65s could have been offered a jab. This could then start to feel very different. But for now, the slog of the pandemic continues - and for many it just got harder. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""millions of families will be heartbroken by having Christmas plans ripped up"". Mark Harper, the chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, which has been highly critical of the government's strategy, called for Parliament to be recalled so MPs could debate and vote on the changes. ""This is a very sad day,"" he said. ""Lockdowns and increasingly severe tiered restrictions have failed in their goal of slowing the transmission of Covid."" Tony Symons, owner of Rogers Menswear, said the tier-four announcement was ""devastating"" Tony Symons, owner of Rogers Menswear in Herne Bay, Kent, told the BBC the tier-four announcement was ""devastating"".

""What support will there be for companies whose cash flow projections have once again been thrown into chaos?"" NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said hospital trust chiefs had wanted tough restrictions to curb infection rates and described the changes as ""inevitable"".

"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December.

"This video can not be played Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made the changes to restrictions in the wake of a new faster-spreading variant of Covid Covid restrictions will only be relaxed on Christmas Day and mainland Scotland will then be placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said ""firm preventative action"" was needed after the emergence of a faster-spreading strain of coronavirus. It had been planned to ease the rules between 23 and 27 December - but that will now only apply on Christmas Day. A ban on travel to the rest of the UK will apply over the festive period. Scotland's toughest level four rules will come into effect across mainland Scotland from 26 December. Until then, local authority areas are expected to remain under their current level of restrictions. Live coverage of the first minister's briefing What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? Christmas rules tightened for millions Schools will return later than originally planned after the Christmas holidays. Ms Sturgeon said they should resume from 11 January, with learning taking place online until at least 18 January. Thelevel four restrictions,external- which mean the closure of non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms - will last for three weeks. They will apply across Scotland, with the exception of Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and other island communities where restrictions have recently been reduced. These areas will be placed inlevel three,external. The first minister said,externaldecisive action was required because of a new strain of Covid which public health officials believe could be 70% more transmissible than previous strains. At this stage she said there was no evidence to suggest the new strain made people sicker than earlier variants, or that it would change the effectiveness of the vaccine. The new variant was first seen in mid-September in London and Kent - but by December it had become the ""dominant variant"" in London. Government advisers believe the new variant could increase the R number - or reproductive rate of the virus - by 0.4 or more. Ms Sturgeon said the speed at which it could spread meant this was ""probably the most serious and potentially dangerous juncture we have faced"" in the pandemic. But, she said Scotland still had the opportunity to act on a preventative basis. Where are the latest cases in Scotland? How worried should we be about the new Covid strain? So far 17 cases of the new strain had been identified in Scotland through genomic sequencing. ""We do not yet know how widely this new strain of virus is circulating in Scotland, but I think we have to be realistic that that is likely to be an understatement of its true prevalence right now,"" she added. There was a ""concern"", however, that this strain may be driving what appears to be faster transmission of Covid in some hospitals and care homes. Covid figures published at 14:00 on Saturday,externalshowed Scotland had recorded 41 new deaths and 572 positive tests over the previous 24 hours. The first minister said Scotland's case numbers did not look as bad as those elsewhere in the UK, and that she understood why people might not understand that these steps were necessary. But she said the new strain of the virus could very quickly ""overwhelm us"". ""Please believe me when I tell you... I would not be standing here on the Saturday before Christmas announcing this if I did not think this was necessary,"" Ms Sturgeon added. Scotland has the lowest case rate in the UK, with 112.6 cases per 100,000 of the population. This compares with 571.7 in Wales, 219.6 in England and 174.9 in Northern Ireland. Restrictions have also been tightened up over the Christmas period in England and Wales. The planned relaxation of the rules has beenscrapped for large parts of south-east England, and cut to just Christmas Day for the rest of England and Wales.A fourth tier has also been created for some of the worst affected areas in England. The first minister said maintaining a ""strict travel ban"" would prevent more of the new strain entering Scotland from other parts of the UK, and reduce the risk of it spreading further within Scotland. This ban will remain in place throughout the festive period, meaning that cross-border travel will only be allowed for essential purposes. Ms Sturgeon said she would be asking the police to consider how the enforcement of the ban could be strengthened. Indoor mixing will be allowed on Christmas Day only. A maximum of eight people from three households will be allowed in law but theadvice is to keep numbers to a minimum,external, celebrate in your own home, and meet others outdoors. But Ms Sturgeon said: ""If you can't make it there and back in the same day, please don't go - and we're asking you not even to do that unless you feel there is genuinely no alternative."" Police Scotland said they would not be routinely stopping vehicles or setting up road blocks. ""However, officers may in the course of their duties come across people who are travelling from one local authority area to another,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs. ""Where travel restrictions apply, officers will continue to use the common sense, discretion and excellent judgement that they have applied since the crisis began."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said families would be ""devastated"", but that he understood why the restrictions were necessary. ""None of us want this, but these sacrifices will save lives,"" he said. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the Scottish government needed to publish ""persuasive evidence"" to avert a ""heightened risk of non-compliance"". The Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens both backed the moves, while calling for schools to close early for Christmas. VACCINE:When will Scots get it?

"Italy has recorded the highest Covid death toll in Europe Italy has ordered a nationwide lockdown over much of the Christmas and New Year period in an effort to combat a rise in coronavirus cases. The country will be under ""red-zone"" restrictions over the public holidays, with non-essential shops, restaurants and bars closed, and Italians only allowed to travel for work, health and emergency reasons. Limited home visits will be allowed. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said it was ""not an easy decision"". ""Our experts were seriously worried that there would be a jump in cases over Christmas... We therefore had to act,"" he said in a news conference. Italy has recorded the highest Covid death toll in Europe, with close to 68,000 fatalities. What is Europe doing about Covid and Christmas? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Did Macron break his own Covid rules? Mr Conte said the launch of the vaccination drive later this month would mark the beginning of ""the end of this nightmare."" The announcement of the Christmas restrictions on Friday followed days of wrangling in the governing coalition between those wanting a complete lockdown and others seeking limited action to help struggling businesses and allow families to meet. Meanwhile in France,President Emmanuel Macron remains in self-isolation in the official presidential residence at La Lanterne at Versailles after testing positive for Covid-19. Mr Macron said he was suffering from fatigue, headaches and a dry cough. The ""red-zone"" restrictions will be in place across Italy on 24 to 27 December, 31 December to 3 January, and 5 to 6 January. During this period people ""can leave the house only for reasons of work, necessity and health,"" Mr Conte said. But, he added, the rules will allow people to receive a maximum of two guests, not including people under the age of 14, in their homes. A curfew from 22:00 to 05:00 will remain in place. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said it was ""not an easy decision"" Slightly looser curbs will be in place from 28 to 30 December and on 4 January. On these days, people will be free to leave their houses but bars and restaurants will remain closed. Mr Conte said the rules were designed to ""allow the minimum socialisation that is suitable for this period"". He said police would not be sent into people's homes to check the rules were being observed, but urged Italians to act responsibly. A number of European countries have been tightening restrictions ahead of Christmas following a surge of infections. TheNetherlandsandGermanyhave imposed lockdowns until January. In Germany, Christmas will see a slight easing, with one household allowed to host up to four close family members. InAustria, the government said on Friday the country would enter its third lockdown after Christmas. From 26 December, non-essential shops will be shut and movement outside homes restricted. Swedenhas recommendedwearing face masks on public transport during the rush hour,reversing its earlier guidance. It will also cut from the current eight to four per table the number of people sitting together in restaurants, and ban alcohol sales after 20:00.

"The UK and EU continue to negotiate as talks on a post-Brexit trade deal enter another critical 48-hour period. Talks in Brussels are understood to be focused on how many years it will take to phase in new fisheries arrangements. With the two sides at odds over access to UK fishing waters and quota levels, the EU's negotiator said the ""moment of truth"" had arrived and there were ""only a few hours left"" to seal an agreement. Boris Johnson has vowed to keep talking but warned gaps had yet to be bridged. Senior MEPs in the European Parliament have said they will not be ""rushed"" into signing off a deal on their side and want to see the text of any agreement by Sunday if they are to approve it by the end of the year. The UK will stop following the EU's trading rules in less than two weeks time. If there is no agreement by 1 January, the two sides will rely on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to govern exports and imports, which could see charges introduced on goods being sold and bought - and could lead to an increase in prices. Brexit: Can the talks be extended? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Speaking in the European Parliament on Friday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""the moment of truth"" for the talks and while there was still a ""chance"" of a deal, the ""path was very narrow"". Earlier, he met fishing ministers from EU states to discuss the continuing divisions over the issue. This video can not be played Michel Barnier says negotiations have ""just a few hours"" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our door is open"" for post-Brexit trade talks The two sides have been at odds over the length of time it will take to introduce new arrangements once the UK leaves the bloc's Common Fisheries Policy. Tony Connelly, RTE's Europe editor, said: ""I think we are really in the final stages because it looks like they are just now talking about fish, perhaps state aid as well, but all of the issues have been boxed off and we are now in final hours focusing on fisheries."" Mr Connelly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although fishing only makes up a small part of the UK economy, for fishing communities in Europe, it is a ""moment of real pain."" ""They have built up an industry, they have invested in boats and they've had access to these waters for decades, if not centuries and it has been taken away from them and they have not real say in the matter, they had no part in the vote - so feelings are running pretty high,"" he said. He added that while both sides would like to come to an agreement this weekend, ""I don't think either side wants to be pressurised into last minute concessions they will regret later."" What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? The UK, led by its chief negotiator David Frost, has insisted its sovereign rights over its waters must be respected from day one and its fleets must be able to keep a much larger share of their own catch. The EU is insisting on a much longer transition period, with guarantees on access and how catches are distributed. Mr Barnier warned on Friday that if the UK wanted to reduce access for EU fishing vessels then it would ""maintain its sovereign right"" to impose new conditions on UK firms' access to its common market for goods. In response, Mr Johnson said the UK side was willing to keep talking but things were looking difficult and urged the EU to ""come to the table"" with new proposals that recognised the UK's autonomy. Why, you might ask, if the EU's priority in negotiations was to protect the single market, is Brussels allowing the issue of fish to endanger the whole deal? The level playing field is worth a lot more in monetary and political terms to the bloc, but it sounds quite abstract to voters. However, fishermen and women losing their jobs, industries dwindling... that would be very visible, very quickly, elevating the importance of fishing rights. It is in coastal countries where governments fear a public backlash if it's perceived they've sacrificed national fishing communities for a deal with UK. Although the majority of EU members are not coastal nations, and although everyone in the bloc would love to finally put this deal to bed - for political and financial reasons, as well as being plain fed up with the process - the EU as a whole won't try to force member states to sign up if they are unhappy. Michel Barnier spoke to EU coastal countries on Friday to try to find a compromise position but, because of the ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" mantra of negotiations, the EU mood is less optimistic about prospect of imminent breakthrough than it was two days ago. The two sides are reported to have made progress in recent days on the issues of fair competition and what to do if the UK is deemed to get an unfair competitive advantage by moving away from EU rules and standards. If a deal is reached between the two sides, it would need to be agreed by parliaments in the UK and the European Union's member states. UK MPs have now finished for the Christmas break, but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said on Thursday that they could be called back to ratify a deal in the coming days, were one to be agreed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit?

"This video can not be played Strictly winner Bill Bailey: 'I never thought we'd get this far' Comedian Bill Bailey has been crowned the winner of this year's Strictly Come Dancing, becoming the oldest celebrity to lift the glitterball trophy. The 55-year-old shared his triumph with partner Oti Mabuse, the first Strictly dancer to win for two years in a row. Bailey beat EastEnders' Maisie Smith and singer HRVY at the end of Saturday's grand final. ""It feel surreal, it feels extraordinary, it feels wonderful,"" Bailey said as he was named the winner. ""I never thought we'd get this far, never thought we'd get to the final. 7 memorable moments from Strictly 2020 ""But I have had the most extraordinary teacher and the most extraordinary dancer,"" he added, paying tribute to Mabuse. ""Someone who believed in me right from the beginning, and she found something in me and turned me into this, into a dancer."" In response Mabuse told him: ""I think you are amazing, remarkable. You just put your heart and soul into everything. Thank you for being a friend, a father figure to me, a brother, and for this [the glitterball trophy]!"" Actor Joe McFadden had been Strictly's previous oldest winner, having won in 2017 at the age of 42. Bill and Oti performed their showdance to The Show Must Go On by Queen Mabuse, who has danced on Strictly since 2015, also won last year's series with Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher. Aliona Vilani is the only other pro dancer to have triumphed twice, having won with Harry Judd and Jay McGuinness in 2011 and 2015 respectively. Made in Chelsea's Jamie Laing also made it to this year's final, having survived an unprecedented four dance-offs throughout the series. Bailey is known for his appearances on QI, Never Mind the Buzzcocks and the Channel 4 sitcom Black Books. Saturday's finale was watched by an average audience of 11.6 million - up from 11.3 million last year. Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter In an interview last week,Craig Revel Horwood said,externalhe ""really thought Bill Bailey would be the Ann Widdecombe of this series"". And that perfectly sums up the attitude many had towards Bill at the beginning of Strictly 2020. At his age, particularly being a comedian, he would surely fall into the novelty category; hired for entertainment value rather than serious dancing. But Bill gradually improved as the weeks went on, with his routine to Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang (who later praised his performance) proving a turning point. Viewers realised he was focused and really putting in the hours to learn complex routines. ""It makes me smile to have confounded people's expectations,""Bailey recently wrote in The Telegraph.,external""I always intended to give it my all, perhaps to offset my pantomime horse role - but what I didn't expect was to be able to dance well, certainly not with a degree of confidence."" Bill Bailey was not the best dancer in this year's Strictly. Until Saturday night's final, he hadn't topped the leaderboard, often trailing behind the younger, more agile, contestants like Maisie and HRVY. But that didn't matter. Being the best dancer is actually not what Strictly is about. Much more important is the journey a celebrity goes on over the series; their effort, their commitment, their improvement. Oti's continuing popularity certainly didn't hurt, but ultimately the British public loves an underdog. Bailey became a firm fan favourite during his time on the show, particularly after his and Oti's dance to Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang, which went viral earlier in the series. Their Couple's Choice routine was one of three the pair performed on Saturday night. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Speaking ahead of the final, Bailey said it was ""wonderful"" if he had come to be seen as a role model for mature would-be hoofers. ""Blokes sometimes feel a bit self-conscious, particularly blokes of my age,"" the hirsute funnyman told journalists. ""They feel like they're going to be called the dad dancer. ""I think if me showing I can get out there and look a little bit more than somebody shuffling about, then why not?"" This year's series was shorter than usual due to the coronavirus pandemic, though that did not prevent the virus having an impact. HRVY tested positive for coronavirus 10 days before the launch show was filmed, while boxer Nicola Adams was forced to withdraw when her partner Katya Jones tested positive. The Duchess of Cornwall made an appearance on the final to pay tribute to the Strictly cast and crew The couple had made Strictly history by becoming the first same-sex duo to compete on the programme. They returned for a special performance in Saturday's final. There was also a musical performance from Robbie Williams and an appearance from the Duchess of Cornwall, who paid tribute to the cast and crew of Strictly for ""lifting the whole country's spirits"". ""I'd like to, on the behalf of everybody who watches Strictly, to say an enormous thank you to everybody,"" she said. ""Everybody who has been involved in this production, in this particularity difficult year, you have given everybody so much pleasure and you've uplifted the nation."" Concerns over Transatlantic travel meant Bruno Tonioli could only appear virtually this year, while judge Motsi Mabuse - Oti's older sister - had to take two weeks off in order to self-isolate. That was good news for Anton Du Beke who, having been eliminated in week two along with his partner Jacqui Smith, got to sit on the judging panel while Motsi was away. The BBC received more than 150 complaints from viewers after three of the other professional dancers appeared in drag during a Priscilla, Queen of the Desert routine. Claudia Winkleman, meanwhile, was forced to make an on-air apology after The Wanted's Max George was heard uttering a profanity after one of his dance routines.

"Bailey has become the oldest ever winner, while Mabuse is the first pro to win in two consecutive years Strictly Come Dancing 2020 concluded on Saturday after a shorter but largely successful series amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bill Bailey fended off competition from HRVY, Maisie Smith and Jamie Laingto be crowned this year's winnerwith his partner Oti Mabuse. Aged 55, he has taken the title of the oldest Strictly winner from Joe McFadden, who won in 2017 aged 42. Mabuse also becomes the first professional to triumph two years in a row. The final featured music from Robbie Williams and a group performance from the show's professional dancers. It has been an eventful and unusual series. Here are seven of the most memorable moments: Anton had to be dragged kicking and screaming on to the judging panel ""After much persuasion, Anton has reluctantly agreed to step in,"" joked Claudia Winkleman when Motsi Mabuse had to take two weeks off from judging to self-isolate. It's no secret that Anton is keen to join the Strictly panel after clocking up more than 15 years as one of the show's pro dancers, but so far he hasn't made the leap. That finally changed this year and many viewers were surprised that he was actually rather good, if a little generous with his scores. Allow YouTube content?

Bill and Oti's dance to Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang was the biggest viral moment of this series by some distance - it was the only routine tocross the million mark on YouTube,external, with several million morewatching it on Twitter.,external It's easy to see why - Bailey could easily have fallen into the trap of embarrassing dad dancing, but instead he fully committed to a routine which packed in lots of content and detail. He even found time to rap along with the lyrics at one point. His dancing wasn't perfect, but it didn't matter. This was a turning point for both him and the series. ""All three members of the actual Sugarhill Gang sent me a personal video message of congratulations, and thanks for using their song,"" Baileywrote in The Telegraph afterwards.,external""I am still a little dazed by it all to be honest, but in a good way. I've even become a Gif."" The year is 2039. Coronavirus is long eradicated. Humans travel by hovercraft. All parcels are delivered by drones. And Jamie and Karen have survived another week in Strictly's bottom two. Last week's semi-final saw Ranvir Singh eliminated despite never previously being in the dance-off, much to the bafflement of viewers who had also just put Jamie there for the fourth time. This marked the first time in Strictly history a couple had survived the dance-off four times, overtaking even Mike Bushell last year, who was eliminated on his fourth bottom two appearance. ""I know a lot of people think dance-offs are really bad, but for us they've been one of the best things ever,"" Karen said earlier this week, ""because during a dance-off [Jamie] completely just goes for it, and I've never seen that ever before. Usually people get scared in a dance-off but for us, it was like, 'Come on, let's bring it, we deserve to be here.'"" The Wanted's Max George may not have lasted long in the competition, but thisSimpsons routine from Movie Week,externalwill last long in the memories of Strictly viewers, for better or worse. We loved it, lots of people hated it, but either way, full marks for creativity. The blaze of publicity surrounding the first same-sex couple on Strictly was swiftly extinguished after Nicola Adams wound up in the bottom two early in the series, and then had to drop out entirely. Her partner, Katya Jones, tested positive for Covid-19, which meant both she and Nicola had to go into self-isolation for two weeks, making their continued participation in the show unviable. But fortunately that was the only coronavirus casualty of the series, with HRVY just managing to return in time for the show's launch after testing positive during rehearsals. The Strictly team overbooked this series to allow for a few celebrities to pull out due to Covid, but as only one has, we were left with an unusual (although not unprecedented) four-way final. Away from the competitive dancing, there were plenty of notable group and guest performances this year. The group dances were all filmed in advance so the professionals could knock them all off in one go while isolating together in a hotel. Plus, we had guest performances on the results shows from The Vamps, Gary Barlow and the cast of & Juliet. But the BBC received more than 150 complaints after pro dancers Gorka, Johannes and Giovanni appeared in drag during a Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert routine in Musicals week. It's actually not the first time the show has dabbled in drag. Although, to be fair,Craig Revel Horwood's drag performance in last year's series,externalwas so impressive and convincing we bet a lot of viewers didn't even realise it was him. Social distancing meant the contestants couldn't all cuddle up with Claudia as usual, so the upstairs area's informal name changed from the already brilliant Clauditorium to the possibly-even-better Chatterpillar. Other changes this year included the dramatically increased use of CGI. From Bill kneeling in front of a huge digital elephant to Clara Amfo dancing on a gigantic virtual record player, it added a new dimension to the dancing, although not all viewers were keen on it. And finally, this was the year that street dancing really reigned supreme. Having only been introduced in 2018, it's basically become the default option for Couple's Choice. That has sparked disapproval from traditional ballroom fans, but we're totally here for it. Earlier this week, the four finalists spoke to BBC News and other outlets about their experiences on this year's show. One of the most noticeable things forHRVYis how much the experience has aged him. ""It's a really weird thing, I'm doing what my dad and granddad do now, which I really hate: every time I get up and down I make noises, it's just because my body and my knees are in agony,"" he says. HRVY says he hopes he has inspired other young people to take up dancing Despite his aching muscles, the 21-year-old's participation in the series has prompted interest in dancing from younger viewers. ""I've had so many comments and DMs from younger people who have watched the show saying they want to dance. And not just cool street dancing, the Latin stuff, the salsa and the cha-cha, that whole generation of dance is coming back round again. So hopefully we can inspire younger people to dance because we have so much fun."" While HRVY might have inspired other young people to take up dancing, another contestant has the other end of the spectrum taken care of. ""Blokes sometimes feel a bit self conscious, particularly blokes of my age, they feel like they're going to be called the dad dancer,""Bill Baileysays. ""And I think if me showing I can get out there and look a little bit more than somebody shuffling about, then why not?"" On the subject of encouraging older people to try dancing, he adds: ""If that is the consequence of me being on the show then that's wonderful."" His partner Oti Mabuse revealed: ""I had a conversation with Rob Brydon, and he said he's always watched Strictly, and he always sees the older gentleman being a comedic act. But for the first time, when he saw Bill, he thought, 'Oh my goodness, when I watch Strictly, there's a possibility I can go far.' It's just a different take, because he's a respected man and is a respectable character in English society if he ever came on to Strictly he would be taken seriously."" Smith said being in the bottom two gave her and her partner Gorka Marquez extra motivation Jamie Lainghas made it to the finale in spite of struggling any time he hasn't had Karen Hauer by his side. ""If I'm by myself on the dancefloor, that is a no-no, I have to be connected with Karen most of the time, because if I'm by myself doing a solo dance, that is when things go wrong,"" he laughs. Laing has landed in the dance-off several times, as has fellow finalistMaisie Smith. But, she says, that has only served to motivate her. ""Being in the bottom two, it kind of made me realise how much this meant to me, and it did give me a massive push to just keep working as hard as I can,"" she says. ""And I think that was the turning point for me that made me just think, 'I've got to put my all into this,' and I think it's been paying off ever since."" The dances and songs in Saturday's final were: Maisie and Gorka:Samba (performed to Conga! by Gloria Estefan), Showdance (We Need A Little Christmas by Idina Menzel), Quickstep (When You're Smiling by Andy Williams) HRVY and Janette:Jive (Faith by Stevie Wonder feat.

"Face masks are no longer legally required in Welsh shops The last Covid restrictions are set to end in Wales on Monday after 26 months. The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in health and social care services from Monday 30 May. It will be the first time there will be no Covid restrictions in Wales since the first lockdown in March 2020. The country is currently atalert level zero,external, the lowest tier of Covid rules, with numbers testing positive having fallen in recent weeks. The UK's last remaining Covid restrictions New Zealand to scrap some Covid vaccine mandates The lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic. We were last in alert level zero at Christmas. Under it, most curbs to our daily life have been removed, and all businesses have been allowed to reopen. Self-isolation rules did still apply, but were scrapped from 28 March. It is no longer a legal requirement but people are still strongly recommended to use face coverings in any health setting to protect the most vulnerable. The Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Since 22 December, those identified as being a close contact of someone who tests positive for Covid-19 in Wales have not had to self-isolate automatically, if they are fully vaccinated, aged between five and 18, or participating in a vaccine clinical trial. Instead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests. Since 28 January, people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests required on days five and six. Until then, the self-isolation period was seven days,down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on days six and seven. The Welsh government put the measures in place on 26 December to protect customers and staff in businesses The Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive. It advised meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated. People, it said, should leave at least a day between social events. From 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. But under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January. The rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended. People are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped. While wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing. Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August and remain the same Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August. For important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. All guests will need to take a lateral flow test. People attending weddings, civil partnerships or alternative wedding ceremonies or receptions, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero. The Welsh government advised people to wear face coverings indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing. You can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply. On 25 January 2022, theWelsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidaysfor the first time since the start of the pandemic. Nightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four-stage plan, they have been allowed to open since 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. Covid passes were scrapped on 18 February for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. As cases continued to remain low, sports fans were allowed to return to events From 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500. On 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. Gyms, swimming pools, leisure centres, community centres and fitness facilities are open Pupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January. From 18 February, they were no longer required to wear face coverings and schools could decide their own rules. Working from home is no longer law in Wales A legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with Â£60 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, was scrapped on 28 January. You have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April 2021, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations. It also means people from other parts of the UK can come here. All holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May.

"The Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil is seeing ""unprecedented"" demand The number of people in hospital with Covid is the highest since the pandemic began, with a top doctor saying it could get ""significantly worse"". There are 2,231 coronavirus patients in hospitals and Wales' lead respiratory doctor said hospital pressures were ""much worse than the first wave"". It comes as Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said Covid patients were occupying all its intensive care beds. Hywel Dda will delay routine care due to a record number of Covid inpatients. Intensive care units across Wales are treating the highest number of coronavirus patients since April. TheUK's seven most infected local authoritiesare all in Wales - Merthyr Tydfil tops the list with 1,128.9 cases per 100,000 people - while Bridgend, in second, has the highest Covid test positivity rate in the country with 28%. Cwm Taf Morgannwg, the health board that covers Merthyr Tydfil, Pontypridd and Bridgend, hassuspended some non-emergency servicesand is treating 500 coronavirus patients in an ""unprecedented demand"" on services. Cwm Taf pauses non-urgent services over Covid NHS staff sickness having 'huge impact' on care Behind the scenes on the coronavirus front line Now Hywel Dda, the health board that covers parts of west and mid Wales, will temporarily postpone routine appointments from Monday as it is ""treating the highest number of inpatients with confirmed Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic"". Two other south Wales health boards -Aneurin Bevanin the south-east andSwansea Bay- have also suspended non-urgent care. Wales has the highest infection rate of the UK nations - 530.2 cases per 100,000 people over seven days - and Dr Simon Barry, the national respiratory lead doctor in Wales, has warned the pressure on Welsh hospitals will get worse. ""It is fair to say, and this belief is reflected by my colleagues in other parts of Wales, it is exceptionally busy and much worse than it was during the first wave,"" said Dr Barry. ""The hospitals are full - they are full of general medical patients. The difference with the first wave is that both streams are busy so we basically don't have capacity in the hospitals."" Almost 18,000 of Wales' 117,367 Covid cases have been reported by Public Health Wales in the past seven days and patients with the virus make up 28% of all patients in hospital. More than3,000 people have died in Wales with CovidandWales' R numberhas risen to between 0.9 and 1.2 - and Dr Barry believes that is reflected in the number of patients in hospital. While hospitals are filling up, Dr Barry said the impact of staff sickness and isolation was affecting the care that can be delivered, with a shortage of intensive care nurses a ""major issue"". The intensive care unit at Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend is also full of Covid patients ""On intensive care there are a lot of nurses who are sick or are shielding,"" said the consultant chest physician from Cardiff. ""You have to have one-to-two nursing, and they can't achieve that. Similarly, if you are managing patients on respiratory wards where you have got sick people, and it is essentially a high-dependency ward, we don't have enough nurses. ""That is reflected across every hospital in Wales. That is the major issue, it is about staffing."" Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board has seen a 28% rise in coronavirus patients over the past week and 42% of all its patients in hospital beds have the virus. The numbers of patients with Covid-19 in hospital beds in Wales set another record on Thursday - 2,231 across Wales - up 13% on the week before. Earlier, Cwm Taf's medical director Dr Nick Lyons said people's behaviour was going to make a bigger difference, especially around Christmas, than the new Welsh Government rules. ""When I see our hospitals under the pressure they're under, the difficulties that are going to be caused to the population we serve by the decisions made, then I think it's as much making that personal link between what our own actions make as we prepare for Christmas,"" he said. ""That's going to make the real difference and that's going to save lives."" Case rates in the areas which make up the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board also include the two highest in Wales - Merthyr Tydfil and Bridgend. Aneurin Bevan health board has the highest number of Covid patients - 43% of its 1,357 patients - while Hywel Dda is using more of its field hospitals to manage ""patient capacity and flow"" in hospitals. ""The measures we are taking are intended to protect patients with the most urgent clinical need whilst allowing us to reprioritise staff to mitigate the increasing risk of harm in acute and emergency care, due to the pressures,"" said Hywel Dda operations director Andrew Carruthers.

"Dr Ceri Hayles said she still loved her job, but the strain was taking its toll One in 10 staff at some Welsh health boards are off sick or self-isolating, BBC Wales has been told. The NHS Confederation said staffing problems were having a ""huge impact"". It said the overall NHS Wales absence rate was between 8% and 9%, but some services have up to half their staff absent. Monthly absence rates in December are usually about 5%, but Aneurin Bevan, Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Betsi Cadwaladr health boards have rates of about 10%. Welsh NHS Confederation director Darren Hughes told Wales Live the NHS was in ""the same storm but different parts will definitely be in different boats"", with absence rates higher in areas hit hardest by coronavirus. This video can not be played ""Covid patients are sicker during the second wave,"" says consultant ""We're seeing staff having to self-isolate because family members have got Covid, or people with caring responsibilities for people self-isolating, so it's having a big impact on the front line if you have one in 10 staff roughly off, but in some services a third or half the staff off,"" he said. The Welsh Ambulance Service has 12.6% of staff off sick for all reasons. It said its absence rate was always historically higher than other services because of the nature of emergency work and its physical and emotional challenges. Wales only part of UK without falling Covid rates Medics describe 'perfect storm' at hospital Swansea Bay Covid cases could be 'catastrophic' Mr Hughes said there had been a ""huge impact"" on NHS activity, with staff shortages making things such as communication with patients' families harder. ""I think we're running at the moment - because it's much more difficult to provide the services we ordinarily would provide - at about 50 to 60% of capacity,"" he said. ""The staff would really like to be doing more than they are. But to provide services in this Covid-adjusted way is a huge challenge."" On Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething saidthere were 1,800 Covid-related patients in Welsh hospitals, the highest number recorded. ""We're seeing infection rates going up, and this is going to have a real serious impact on our ability to care for you at home, for your family,"" Mr Hughes added. ""But it's also having a big impact on the wellbeing of staff who've been working tirelessly for over eight months in providing care for people across Wales."" Helen Whyley, the director of the Royal College of Nursing Wales, called for action following the figures of self-isolating NHS staff ""It's clearly a very pressurised situation,"" she said. ""Staff are being asked to move from dealing with the first wave, administering vaccines, then the second wave, covering people, double shifts and they're becoming exhausted."" Mark Henwood, consultant at Hywel Dda health board, said staff are ""desperate"" for the public to follow coronavirus rules ""certainly over the Christmas period"". Mr Henwood also said people should ""avoid"" coming to hospital if they could, following an appeal from the health board for public support to reduce pressure on hospitals. Last week, Llandovery community hospital closed after Covid outbreaks meantseveral staff from there and Amman Valley hospital in Ammanford had to self-isolate. On Tuesday, staff at Morriston Hospital said a ""perfect storm"" was developing with the combination ofincreasing numbers of patients, decreasing capacity and fewer staff. A photo of Ceri Hayles showing the effects of protective equipment on her face was used in an exhibition Dr Ceri Hayles - a registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at the Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, Torfaen - said staff were ""spread thinner"" than usual. ""We're sort of backed into a corner where we don't have any option because we never want to put our patients in a position where they're not being looked after safely. ""The service is still being provided, but there is a little bit less time to do all those extra things you'd want to do for people. ""Those bits where you go above and beyond for people which we all try and do. It's just draining and we're all exhausted."" Gail Parry said staffing levels led to poor communication about her husband's care Gail Parry's husband David, 72, has emphysema and was in Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, last week. Mrs Parry, a retired psychiatric nurse, believes staff being overstretched led to poor communication with her about her husband's treatment and the plan for him to return home for palliative care. ""When he ended up on the ward I tried and tried phoning with no response. I knew very little about what was going on. ""It's very distressing and it was distressing for him, because he wanted to come home and I felt as if I was doing nothing to help the situation, because I couldn't find anything out. ""So it was a bit of a black hole as far as knowing things or being able to communicate with him, really."" A lack of communication was ""distressing"" for patient David Parry and his wife Gail Aneurin Bevan health board said: ""We would like to apologise to Mrs Parry and her husband for their experience whilst Mr Parry was in Nevill Hall Hospital last week.

"The New York Times has returned an award and had another withdrawn after it found discrepancies in its podcast on the Islamic State group. After a two-month investigation, the newspaper said the podcast, Caliphate, failed to meet its editorial standards. In the 2018 series, Shehroze Chaudhry, one of its central figures, claims he travelled to Syria and joined IS. But the Times said on Friday that it found ""a history of misrepresentations"" about his involvement with the group. As a result, it hasreturned a Peabody Award,externalfor the podcast.The Overseas Press Club said it had also rescinded its Lowell Thomas Award,externalgiven to the show's producers. 'How I survived an IS massacre' How do countries deal with people returning from IS? Is Islamic State defeated? Is Africa the new jihadist battleground? Dean Basquet, the Times' executive editor,said in a podcast on Friday that ""this failing wasn't about any one reporter,external. I think it was an institutional failing."" The podcast's host Rukmini Callimachi - a four-time Pulitzer Prize finalist - has been reassigned from her duties covering terrorism. In a statement on Twitter, Ms Callimachi apologised for ""what we missed and what we got wrong."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The paper began its review of Caliphateafter Pakistan-born Mr Chaudhry was arrested by Canadian police in September, and charged with hoax-terrorist activity. The Canadian broadcaster CBC used his alleged IS name, Abu Huzaifa al-Kanadi, in a 2017 report, in which he described lashing a man with a whip as part of his duties for the violent Islamic group, but said he never killed anyone. IS once controlled swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq His account prompted a debate in Canada's House of Commons, when the opposition questioned why he was allowed to still live in the country. Then, in 2018, the New York Times aired an interview with Mr Chaudhry on the Caliphate podcast, in which he said he'd executed people for IS. But after its latest internal investigation, the Times said it had found ""no corroboration"" that he committed the atrocities he described. It said at least one photo posted on his social media, allegedly showing him in Syria, was a copy of widely available news photography, published by Russian news agency Tass. Other images had been posted on Twitter by Syrian anti-war activists years before his claim. According to the Times, Canadian and US officials have said they are confident Mr Chaudry is a fabulist,externalwho never travelled to Syria, and concocted stories to escape from his more mundane life in a Toronto suburb. Mr Chaudhry, who works at his family's restaurant in Oakville, near Toronto, has not publicly commented on the charge against him. His lawyer told the New York Times that Mr Chaudhry  was not guilty and would contest the ""hoax-terrorist activity"" charge, which carries a sentence of up to five years.

"Relaxation of Christmas Covid rules scrapped for much of south-east England as tier four restrictions announced And people in England in tiers one to three can only mix indoors on Christmas Day Festive bubbles in Scotland and Wales also restricted to just Christmas Day PM says spread in cases 'being driven by the new variant of the virus' Wales brings forward lockdown to start from midnight Nicola Sturgeon announces travel ban between Scotland and rest of UK from Boxing Day Northern Ireland lockdown to start on Boxing Day A second vaccine is being rolled out in the US after regulators approved a jab developed by Moderna Italy has ordered a nationwide lockdown over much of the Christmas and New Year period Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Penny Spiller and Owen Amos We're going to wrap up our live coverage for the day. To find out how today's announcement will affect you, put your postcode into our lockdown look-uphere. For more details on England's new tier four, including what it means and who will be in it, readthis. Today's live page was brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Owen Amos, Penny Spiller, Joshua Nevett, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Emily Young. Thanks for joining us. Weâre wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic shortly. Before we do, hereâs a reminder of the headlines on this, the 283rd day since the pandemic was confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the UK:  Elsewhere in the world: French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week We can bring you some business reaction to Boris Johnson's announcement of tier four restrictions in the south and east of England, including London. ""The consequences of this decision will be severe,"" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium said. She said the governmentâs ""stop-start approach"" to coronavirus restrictions has been ""deeply unhelpful"" for retailers ahead of the usually busy and lucrative Christmas period. Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce echoed Dickinson, calling on the government to ""address the economic consequences of its actions"". He said that retailers needed extra financial support to get through the winter and beyond. Federation of Small Businesses vice-chair Martin McTague said tier four restrictions would be a ""hammer blow"" to non-essential retailers. ""From shops to hairdressers, this would normally the one of the busiest times of the year,"" he said. ""Many will have bought extra stock and increased staff hours, now their takings are to disappear literally overnight."" Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said retailers had ""lost all confidence"" in the UK government's strategy for tackling coronavirus. ""The unrelenting closing and reopening of businesses is costing owners hundreds of thousands of pounds, and coupled with the erratic decision-making around restrictions, is rapidly destroying the ability of the sector to bounce back,"" he said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says moving the capital under tier four restrictions is ""a bitter blow for Londoners who were hoping to spend time with loved ones safely this Christmas"". ""This continued chaos and confusion could all have been avoided had the government not made irresponsible promises to the public and raised expectations about the Christmas period,"" he says. ""London faces its toughest Christmas since the war and the whole city will need to pull together to see us through this terrible period."" Mr Khan said implementing restrictions was not enough, and the government needed to increase testing capacity, provide greater financial support and make face coverings mandatory in all busy outdoor public spaces. As Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, explained in the press conference earlier, coronavirus infections and deaths have been rising rapidly since the start of December in the UK. There was a dip in November, when England went into a four-week lockdown, and restrictions remained tight in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But UK-wide infections have now gone back up to the levels seen in October, with more than 27,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed on Saturday. Another 534 deaths were also recorded in the UK on Saturday, up from 489 a day before. Those increases bring the UKâs total number of infections to 2,004,219 and deaths to 67,075, the latest figures show. That means the UK has the sixth-highest number of deaths and infections of any country in the world,according to tallies kept by Johns Hopkins University,external. There have been big changes announced to the Christmas rules for England, Wales and Scotland.  Read more details here Tier four restrictions will come into force from midnight tonight and will apply in all tier three areas across the south and east of England. In south-east England, the areas affected are: In the east of England, the areas affected are: Read more about tier four and what it meanshere. You can also check what the rules are in your areahere. Ms Sturgeon answers a question about people having to cancel Christmas plans. She says her ""message to everybody is: I'm desperately sorry"". She says it ""breaks my heart"", and acknowledges ""there will be heartbroken people listening to this right now"". She says this is a ""once in a century pandemic"" that ""we just have to get through"". She asks people to ""hunker down"" and repeats a line from Irish poet Seamus Heaney she used in the Scottish Parliament previously: ""If we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere."" Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter England, Scotland and Wales have all announced changes to their Christmas restrictions this afternoon, but at the moment there are no plans to change the rules in Northern Ireland. However, the first and deputy first ministers as well as the health minister have been holding various meetings today to discuss their response to the new variant of the virus. BBC Scotland's chief political correspondent Glenn Campbell asks Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon whether with hindsight she wishes she hadn't bothered to relax restrictions over Christmas. ""No,"" she says. ""I've always agonised over this. From the moment we announced relaxations... I've advised against using them unless absolutely essential. ""In my view they were only ever there in recognition of the fact that some people would find it impossible to leave loved ones alone"". She adds that she wouldn't have changed track ""if it wasn't for what I'd been told today about this new strain"". Ms Sturgeon says all of the Scottish mainland will move to level four restrictions from 26 December. Level four is the highest ofScotland's five levels- it stops households mixing, shuts pubs and restaurants and closes non-essential retail. Level four will last for at least three weeks. Schools will not resume until 11 January, with online only until 18 Janaury - apart from key workers' children and the most vulnerable. Ms Sturgeon says the new rules ""make me want to cry"". ""I know how harsh it is,"" she says, adding ""but this virus doesn't care about anything apart from spreading as far and wide as possible"". Her message, she says, is stay home and stay safe this Christmas. The planned five-day relaxation of Covid restrictions over the festive periodhas been cut back to just Christmas Dayfor the whole of Scotland â with advice to avoid any social mixing. Indoor mixing in a bubble in Scotland will be allowed to take place on Christmas Day only, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. ""We will allow Christmas Day to go ahead, but as we have said from the start, only use this flexibility if you really, truly need to,"" she says. ""Our advice is still not to meet indoors even on Christmas Day with other households if you can possibly avoid it."" A maximum of eight people from three households will be allowed to meet on Christmas Day, ""but again our advice will be to minimise those numbers as much as possible"", Ms Sturgeon says. Cross-border travel will no longer be permitted, but travelling within Scotland will be allowed on Christmas Day only.  Ms Sturgeon says there will be a strict travel ban from Scotland to the rest of the UK throughout the Christmas period. ""People from Scotland should not visit other parts of the UK, and vice versa,"" she says. International travel advice will be issued next week - but Ms Sturgeon strongly advises against it. Ms Sturgeon says if we don't act ""firmly and decisively"" to stop the new variant taking hold in Scotland, ""by January our NHS could potentially be overwhelmed"". Ms Sturgeon says there have been 17 cases of the new fast-spreading variant confirmed in Scotland - but, she says, that is likely to be an understatement. It may be at low levels, but it does pose a real risk, she says, ""if we do not act and act firmly"". She says Scotland must act ""firmly and deceisvely now, or it will take hold"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has taken to the podium for her press conference. She says the new variant of the virus means ""very firm preventative action is now necessary"", adding that this is ""probably the most serious and potentially most dangerous juncture"" since the beginning of the pandemic. The prime minister held a Covid briefing at Downing Street a short time ago. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key announcements: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says ""millions of families will be heartbroken by having Christmas plans ripped up"", after this evening's announcement by the prime minister. Sir Keir says he was frustrated as he had raised the issue of Christmas with Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, where the prime minister told people to have ""a merry little Christmas"". The Labour leader says ""today's announcement will only lead to confusion when people need certainty"" and called on the government to display ""decisive leadership"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is about to give a news conference. There was earlier a call between leaders of all four UK nations, after which Ms Sturgeon held a meeting of the Scottish cabinet. The first minister will be joined at the news conference by interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith and national clinical director Jason Leitch.

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford: New virus variant is ""more aggressive, spreads more quickly and affects more people"" A Wales-wide lockdown has been brought forward to Sunday with festive plans cancelled for all but Christmas Day. First Minister Mark Drakeford told people to ""stay at home"" after urgent talks with ministersover a new variant of coronavirus. Plans to relax rules from 23 to 27 December to allow people to celebrate with loved-ones have been scrapped. Meeting up is now limited to Christmas Day. Announcing the new measures, meaning people have to stay at home and only go out for essential reasons, Mr Drakeford said hundreds of people had already contracted the new, ""more aggressive"" variant of the virus in Wales. ""While we all want to avoid further disruption to businesses and plans for Christmas, our overriding duty is to protect lives here in Wales,"" he said. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Q&A: Which rules are changing and when? What's the advice on travelling over Christmas? The changes mean the Wales-wide lockdown, which was due to come into effect from 28 December, has been brought forward. Boris Johnson has announced similar rules in England for Christmas, as well as tier four restrictionsfor London and the south east of England. In Scotland,Covid restrictions will only be relaxed for one day at Christmasand mainland Scotland will be placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. From Sunday, all of Wales is in the highest level of lockdown -level four,external- with all but essential shops closed, and people being told to ""stay home"" to save lives. Gyms and beauty salons and non-essential shops will have to close at the end of trading today, while bars and restaurants will only be able to open for takeaways, and people will only be allowed to travel for ""essential reasons"". During the level four lockdown period people will not be allowed to mix with anyone they do not live with, with only single person households allowed to form an exclusive support bubble with one other household. From 23 to 27 December restrictions had been due to be eased to allow people from two households in Wales to meet - plus a single person household. But now this period of relaxed rules has been cancelled, for all but Christmas Day. On Christmas Day people will be able meet others to form a so-called ""Christmas bubble"", but people are being advised not to as cases continue to rise. If you live in Wales, you will be able to travel to meet one other household - and a single person household - on Christmas Day anywhere in Wales. You can also leave Wales to meet your household, subject to the local restrictions in the area you would be travelling to. But the rules say you would need to be back at your own home by the end of the day. What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What are the different rules around the UK? Mr Drakeford said people who had already made plans to meet another household on Christmas Day had to do it ""sensibly and in line with the rules"". Leanne Miller, from Swansea, said the news had left her family's Christmas plans in tatters. ""I've got two boys, 12 and 13, and we were supposed to see my husband's mum and dad. But the important thing is keeping them safe,"" she said. The Welsh Government heldan emergency cabinet meetingon Saturday after serious concerns over a new strain of coronavirus, which has been confirmed in Wales. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas introduced tougher rules for London and south-east Englandfor Christmas, in response to rising cases. Shortly afterwards, Mr Drakeford announced the changes for Wales, saying: ""We now know that this new strain is significantly more infectious and spreads more quickly than the original one. ""Throughout the public health emergency, we have had to respond quickly to the rapid changes, which have been so typical of coronavirus. ""Today has been one of those days when new information has required an immediate response."" He said he was told by UK government chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Valance that there was no reason to believe the vaccine would be less effective with the new variant. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said it was clear the rules had to change due to the presence of a new variant of the virus. ""By working together and keeping to the rules we can ensure as many people as possible will be around to celebrate Christmas together in the years to come,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price MS said people would be disappointed but the country had a ""responsibility to keep one another safe"". He added: ""No one wanted a Christmas like this. While we are once again asked to make a sacrifice at what is usually a sociable time of year, our collective effort is necessary, particularly as a new variant of Covid-19 has been identified."" Covid case rates in Wales A total of 120,432 positive cases have now been confirmed in Wales since the start of the pandemic, and 3,046 people have died with Covid-19. The most recent data shows that all of the UK's seven most infected local authorities are in Wales. Almost all health boards in Wales have now suspended some non-emergency services, as the demand on services increases. Chris Williams of Public Health Wales said it was working with other UK organisations to respond to the new variant. ""It is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen.  Although the variant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe,"" he said. ""We are reminding people that all current guidance relating to coronavirus continues to apply to the new variant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination. ""The new variant shows up as positive in Public Health Wales' existing coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual way if they develop coronavirus symptoms. Belinda O'Donnell, owner of Penny Lane Vintage and The Furniture Shop in Cardiff, said the news was ""devastating"". ""I'm really shocked. It's disgusting really,"" she said. ""I recently got Christmas stock in - we're not going to recoup the money lost. They should have stuck to the original plans because we were prepared for that. ""We were working so hard to work towards that date. We haven't had the flow of people through, so we're struggling anyway."" Queues formed outside shops in Talbot Green after the announcement on Saturday CBI Wales director Ian Price said he was not surprised restrictions have been brought forward, ""however painful they may be"". ""Businesses know infection rates must be controlled to save lives and protect against longer-term economic scarring,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, invoking what is effectively a full lockdown at such a crucial time for many businesses - particularly those in the hardest-hit hospitality, retail and tourism sectors - will come as a fresh blow after many months of hardship and once again puts further jobs at risk."" Queues as shops prepare for last-minute lockdown Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? Sara Jones of the Welsh Retail Consortium said it recognised the difficult decisions behind the announcement, but said the consequences would be severe. ""For businesses, the government's stop-start approach is deeply unhelpful - this decision comes in the middle of peak trading which so many are depending on to power their recovery,"" she said. ""Faced with this news - and the prospect of losing Â£100m per week in sales for the third time this year - many businesses will be in serious difficulty and many thousands of jobs could be at risk.""

"The ""festive magic"" promised by the organisers did not materialise, according to angry visitors Families have demanded refunds from a ""shambolic"" drive-through Santa's grotto after queuing for hours. It opened on Friday night and promised a 1km (0.6 mile) sparkling light trail through the grounds of Taverham Hall, near Norwich. The event's Facebook page was later flooded with complaints about traffic chaos, ""creepy"" performers who scared children, and ""Poundland"" gifts. ""It was an absolute fiasco from start to finish,"" said visitor Louise Purdy. Organiser We Make Events has been approached for comment. People commenting on social media said they queued for up to three hours in rush-hour traffic, having bought tickets for a time slot. A Scrooge character prompted a warning on a parenting site after he gave one young visitor nightmares Many turned away with tired, upset children, with one parent stating: ""Would've been quicker to get to the North Pole."" Another said: ""Three very grumpy children and four disappointed adults down Â£110."" Some of those who did make it inside were unhappy with what had been billed as ""huge amounts of festive magic"". A ""scary"" Scrooge-like character prompted one mum to post a warning on a parenting site after her child had nightmares. Louise Purdy said she told her three-year-old son the inflatables were having a sleep Ms Purdy, who was there with her two-year-old and five-year-old nephews and son, aged three, said the whole thing was comically awful. ""We wanted the sparkle, the magic of Christmas, but I actually started laughing because I couldn't comprehend how rubbish it was. ""The Scrooge guy called us all mutants, said Santa has crashed his sleigh and the presents are in the mud, and there was a man in chains by a tree just staring at the car. ""It was creepy, but was meant to be for little kids. ""The light tunnel at the end wasn't even switched on and the Santa couldn't be less interested."" Another parent said: ""The gifts were rubbish, not even wrapped, just in brown paper bags and they were things probably bought in Poundland."" The Purdy family queued for almost two hours Kerry Prentice from Norwich, who paid Â£68 for three tickets, told BBC Radio Norfolk she left after 90 minutes having been told she would probably have to wait a further two hours. ""It was absolutely shocking. ""We wanted something really nice to do as a family, but it was appalling and we've had no response from the organisers."" We Make Events is yet to respond to complaints but has issued a statement asking visitors to adjust their route ""to ease traffic worries"".

"Relaxation of Christmas Covid rules scrapped for much of south-east England as tier four restrictions announced And people in England in tiers one to three can only mix indoors on Christmas Day Festive bubbles in Scotland and Wales also restricted to just Christmas Day PM says spread in cases 'being driven by the new variant of the virus' Wales brings forward lockdown to start from midnight Nicola Sturgeon announces travel ban between Scotland and rest of UK from Boxing Day Northern Ireland lockdown to start on Boxing Day A second vaccine is being rolled out in the US after regulators approved a jab developed by Moderna Italy has ordered a nationwide lockdown over much of the Christmas and New Year period Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Penny Spiller and Owen Amos We're going to wrap up our live coverage for the day. To find out how today's announcement will affect you, put your postcode into our lockdown look-uphere. For more details on England's new tier four, including what it means and who will be in it, readthis. Today's live page was brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Owen Amos, Penny Spiller, Joshua Nevett, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Emily Young. Thanks for joining us. Weâre wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic shortly. Before we do, hereâs a reminder of the headlines on this, the 283rd day since the pandemic was confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the UK:  Elsewhere in the world: French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week We can bring you some business reaction to Boris Johnson's announcement of tier four restrictions in the south and east of England, including London. ""The consequences of this decision will be severe,"" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium said. She said the governmentâs ""stop-start approach"" to coronavirus restrictions has been ""deeply unhelpful"" for retailers ahead of the usually busy and lucrative Christmas period. Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce echoed Dickinson, calling on the government to ""address the economic consequences of its actions"". He said that retailers needed extra financial support to get through the winter and beyond. Federation of Small Businesses vice-chair Martin McTague said tier four restrictions would be a ""hammer blow"" to non-essential retailers. ""From shops to hairdressers, this would normally the one of the busiest times of the year,"" he said. ""Many will have bought extra stock and increased staff hours, now their takings are to disappear literally overnight."" Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said retailers had ""lost all confidence"" in the UK government's strategy for tackling coronavirus. ""The unrelenting closing and reopening of businesses is costing owners hundreds of thousands of pounds, and coupled with the erratic decision-making around restrictions, is rapidly destroying the ability of the sector to bounce back,"" he said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says moving the capital under tier four restrictions is ""a bitter blow for Londoners who were hoping to spend time with loved ones safely this Christmas"". ""This continued chaos and confusion could all have been avoided had the government not made irresponsible promises to the public and raised expectations about the Christmas period,"" he says. ""London faces its toughest Christmas since the war and the whole city will need to pull together to see us through this terrible period."" Mr Khan said implementing restrictions was not enough, and the government needed to increase testing capacity, provide greater financial support and make face coverings mandatory in all busy outdoor public spaces. As Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, explained in the press conference earlier, coronavirus infections and deaths have been rising rapidly since the start of December in the UK. There was a dip in November, when England went into a four-week lockdown, and restrictions remained tight in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But UK-wide infections have now gone back up to the levels seen in October, with more than 27,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed on Saturday. Another 534 deaths were also recorded in the UK on Saturday, up from 489 a day before. Those increases bring the UKâs total number of infections to 2,004,219 and deaths to 67,075, the latest figures show. That means the UK has the sixth-highest number of deaths and infections of any country in the world,according to tallies kept by Johns Hopkins University,external. There have been big changes announced to the Christmas rules for England, Wales and Scotland.  Read more details here Tier four restrictions will come into force from midnight tonight and will apply in all tier three areas across the south and east of England. In south-east England, the areas affected are: In the east of England, the areas affected are: Read more about tier four and what it meanshere. You can also check what the rules are in your areahere. Ms Sturgeon answers a question about people having to cancel Christmas plans. She says her ""message to everybody is: I'm desperately sorry"". She says it ""breaks my heart"", and acknowledges ""there will be heartbroken people listening to this right now"". She says this is a ""once in a century pandemic"" that ""we just have to get through"". She asks people to ""hunker down"" and repeats a line from Irish poet Seamus Heaney she used in the Scottish Parliament previously: ""If we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere."" Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter England, Scotland and Wales have all announced changes to their Christmas restrictions this afternoon, but at the moment there are no plans to change the rules in Northern Ireland. However, the first and deputy first ministers as well as the health minister have been holding various meetings today to discuss their response to the new variant of the virus. BBC Scotland's chief political correspondent Glenn Campbell asks Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon whether with hindsight she wishes she hadn't bothered to relax restrictions over Christmas. ""No,"" she says. ""I've always agonised over this. From the moment we announced relaxations... I've advised against using them unless absolutely essential. ""In my view they were only ever there in recognition of the fact that some people would find it impossible to leave loved ones alone"". She adds that she wouldn't have changed track ""if it wasn't for what I'd been told today about this new strain"". Ms Sturgeon says all of the Scottish mainland will move to level four restrictions from 26 December. Level four is the highest ofScotland's five levels- it stops households mixing, shuts pubs and restaurants and closes non-essential retail. Level four will last for at least three weeks. Schools will not resume until 11 January, with online only until 18 Janaury - apart from key workers' children and the most vulnerable. Ms Sturgeon says the new rules ""make me want to cry"". ""I know how harsh it is,"" she says, adding ""but this virus doesn't care about anything apart from spreading as far and wide as possible"". Her message, she says, is stay home and stay safe this Christmas. The planned five-day relaxation of Covid restrictions over the festive periodhas been cut back to just Christmas Dayfor the whole of Scotland â with advice to avoid any social mixing. Indoor mixing in a bubble in Scotland will be allowed to take place on Christmas Day only, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. ""We will allow Christmas Day to go ahead, but as we have said from the start, only use this flexibility if you really, truly need to,"" she says. ""Our advice is still not to meet indoors even on Christmas Day with other households if you can possibly avoid it."" A maximum of eight people from three households will be allowed to meet on Christmas Day, ""but again our advice will be to minimise those numbers as much as possible"", Ms Sturgeon says. Cross-border travel will no longer be permitted, but travelling within Scotland will be allowed on Christmas Day only.  Ms Sturgeon says there will be a strict travel ban from Scotland to the rest of the UK throughout the Christmas period. ""People from Scotland should not visit other parts of the UK, and vice versa,"" she says. International travel advice will be issued next week - but Ms Sturgeon strongly advises against it. Ms Sturgeon says if we don't act ""firmly and decisively"" to stop the new variant taking hold in Scotland, ""by January our NHS could potentially be overwhelmed"". Ms Sturgeon says there have been 17 cases of the new fast-spreading variant confirmed in Scotland - but, she says, that is likely to be an understatement. It may be at low levels, but it does pose a real risk, she says, ""if we do not act and act firmly"". She says Scotland must act ""firmly and deceisvely now, or it will take hold"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has taken to the podium for her press conference. She says the new variant of the virus means ""very firm preventative action is now necessary"", adding that this is ""probably the most serious and potentially most dangerous juncture"" since the beginning of the pandemic. The prime minister held a Covid briefing at Downing Street a short time ago. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key announcements: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says ""millions of families will be heartbroken by having Christmas plans ripped up"", after this evening's announcement by the prime minister. Sir Keir says he was frustrated as he had raised the issue of Christmas with Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, where the prime minister told people to have ""a merry little Christmas"". The Labour leader says ""today's announcement will only lead to confusion when people need certainty"" and called on the government to display ""decisive leadership"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is about to give a news conference. There was earlier a call between leaders of all four UK nations, after which Ms Sturgeon held a meeting of the Scottish cabinet. The first minister will be joined at the news conference by interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith and national clinical director Jason Leitch.

"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary.

"Norton took over from Jonathan Ross, who left the BBC in 2010 Graham Norton told listeners it had been a ""privilege being part of your Saturday mornings"" as he bid an emotional farewell to Radio 2. The star will front a new show on Virgin Radio from January. At the end of his final Radio 2 programme, he said: ""Mostly, I need to say thank you to you, the listeners. ""It's been lovely sharing your lives and hearing your messages, and that's been the greatest joy of being on Radio 2, it really has."" He added 10 years had ""gone by in the blink of an eye"" and closed the programme by playing Reach by S Club 7. ""It has been a privilege to be part of your mornings,"" he said. ""I'm getting emotional now. Someone told me I'd get emotional and I said 'No I won't.'"" He joked that it made him feel better to ""think of the six flights of stairs"" he will no longer need to climb to reach the Radio 2 studios in Wogan House in central London. Norton is not leaving the BBC altogether, and will continue to front his BBC One chat show Earlier in the programme, Norton acknowledged it was ""the end of an era"", and read out messages from listeners who said they would miss him. The chat show host then joked: ""Just bear in mind, as you're doing your sadness, when I leave here today I'm leaving in a taxi not a hearse. We're OK. I'll still be in the world. I just won't be here. That's all."" Norton has signed a three-year contract with Virgin, which will see him present on both Saturday and Sunday mornings. Radio 2's Saturday morning slot, one of the most high-profile on the station, will be taken over by Strictly Come Dancing co-host Claudia Winkleman. BBC Radio 2 confirmed in November that Norton would be leaving at the end of the year - an announcement which took his listeners by surprise. In fact, Norton had only made the decision himself in the preceding few weeks, after a chance encounter with his old colleague, Chris Evans. Chris Evans has presented Virgin's breakfast show for nearly two years In late September, Norton was gearing up for the release of his third novel, Home Stretch. He gave numerous interviews to promote the book, including to Radio 4's Front Row and ITV's Lorraine Kelly. But he was also booked for an interview with Evans, who had himself left Radio 2 for Virgin in 2018. Their conversation would change the course of Norton's radio career, as herecalled recently on The High Low.,external ""I did an interview with Chris Evans on his breakfast show,"" Norton explained, ""and he was sort of teasing me saying, 'You should come to Virgin'. And the studios were lovely, you can see my house from the studio, and I thought, 'Oh actually, this is very nice here, and Chris seems so happy'. ""Then Virgin got in touch, and they mooted this idea of doing SaturdayandSunday. And I always thought on Radio 2 that it would be good to be stripped across the weekend. And I think in a way, at my age, I was so flattered that someone wanted me, and it just seemed exciting to have a new challenge."" One side effect of the move is that Norton will drop down the BBC's star salaries list, which is published every summer as part of the corporation's annual report. The star haspreviously saidthe publication is ""not nice or comfortable"" for those on it. Graham Norton took over the Saturday morning slot in 2010 Norton has presented his Radio 2 programme, broadcast between 10:00-13:00 on Saturdays, since October 2010. The slot is one of the most high profile on the station, attracting more than four million listeners, and traditionally hosted by a big name. The Irish presenter replaced Jonathan Ross, who left the BBC after the ""Sachsgate"" scandal. But, Norton explained at the time, he was initially reluctant to host the programme. ""I didn't want to take over from Jonathan,""he told the Media Talk podcast,external, ""because I think Jonathan is brilliant and I loved that show, and that's what I said to them. And they explained, 'That's all very well, we get that, but if you turn this down now, this job doesn't come up very often. The last time it was 10 or 12 years ago, so you will regret turning this down'."" It was a fair point; Ross had presented the show for 11 years. And unlike youth-orientated stations such as Radio 1, which rotate their DJs quite regularly, presenters on Radio 2 tend to bed in for the long haul. Norton gave in after some persuasion and has now hosted his Radio 2 programme for a decade, although Alan Carr and Melanie Sykes normally sit in during his extended summer break. The show has a very different identity to his BBC One chat show. On Radio 2, there's room for longer, more thoughtful, interviews, and while Norton's red sofa is reserved for Hollywood A-listers telling funny showbiz stories, you're more likely to hear in-depth interviews with authors and theatre stars on his radio programme. Actress and presenter Maria McErlane co-hosts the Grill Graham feature In addition to the music and celebrity guests, the enduring popularity of Norton's show owes much to his weekly agony aunt feature, Grill Graham. For this, he is joined by his superb co-host and long-time friend Maria McErlane. Their pairing is a masterclass in on-air chemistry and a firm favourite with listeners. Members of the public write in each week with a personal problem, and Norton and McErlane offer their advice before asking listeners to send in their own solutions. Reflecting on his favourite letters recently, Norton said: ""I either like them to be so stupid that you get annoyed by the person that's written in, like, 'Really? In the world we live in,that'sthe thing that motivated you to write in and ask for advice?' So I like those ones, 'My kitchen cupboard handles are funny' or something. ""And then I like the really devastating ones,"" he continued. ""I remember one week we got a woman who had a terminal diagnosis, she was going to die, and she was looking for advice about telling her children and also spending time with her children in the time that she had left. ""What I loved about it wasn't that we got to give advice, it was the outpouring of support from the Radio 2 listeners, who are, by and large, a very nice bunch. So I was reading out advice from people who had been through similar things... and just sobbing on the radio."" On Saturday's final programme, McErlane said listeners had shared their ""maddest, funniest, craziest and saddest problems with us, many of which will stay with me and Graham for a long time"". McErlane has since announced she is moving to Virgin with Norton. Norton isn't as keen on all music on Radio 2 as he was on Chrissie Hynde, who he interviewed in 2017 Some of the most glorious moments of Norton's Radio 2 show have come when he is simply riffing off the music he's just played. While Virgin, on the whole, plays rock and indie music, the wildly varying genres on Radio 2 have often prompted humorous asides from the 57-year-old. After playing Billie Eilish's Bad Guy last month, a dark, bass-heavy and haunting song, Norton remarked: ""That just screams Radio 2 doesn't it? Carol celebrating her 70th birthday will have really enjoyed that."" ""This is new from Ty Dolla $ign.You know, Ty Dolla $ign?!"" he joked on another occasion, knowing the hip-hop singer would likely be alien to the Radio 2 demographic. ""Let's just appreciate the magic dust that Ty Dolla $ign spreads on everything he does."" While introducing All Day And Night by Jax Jones, Martin Solveig and Madison Beer, Norton wondered aloud: ""Why does it take SO many people to make a record these days?"" His honest and often sarcastic comments usually reflect perfectly what his audience is thinking, and are a key part of his enduring appeal. Radio 2's mixture of new songs, classic songs, specialist music and the presenter and producer's own choices have provided lots of material for Norton to have fun with over the years. Claudia Winkleman will take over the Saturday morning slot on Radio 2 Norton's producer, Malcolm Prince, told us it had ""been a fascinating and entertaining 10 years"", highlighting the show's outside broadcasts from Azerbaijan (for Eurovision), New York, and inside the Tardis. ""But Graham was always happiest in the studio at Wogan House where he could be himself,"" said Prince. ""No matter how starry his guests have been, he always made them sound almost like one of us. It's been a privilege to produce Graham's show and, just like his millions of listeners, I'll miss his Radio 2 programme."" As we all will. But Norton is looking forward to doubling his airtime with Virgin, as he told Evans during a more recent interviewon the How To Wow podcast,external. ""It will be interesting to find out who that Sunday audience is,"" he said, ""because on Saturdays you get a sense that people are listening as they do things - they're ferrying kids, they're waiting outside a supermarket, whereas Sunday, I feel people are probably in their house more, they're reading the newspapers, they're getting lunch, but the radio is on. ""So I think that will be fun to have that six hours with people over the weekend, and you can carry things over from the Saturday. Those are opportunities that I didn't have before.""

"This video can not be played 'Tier 4 residents must stay at home' as PM announces tighter restrictions The planned relaxation of Covid rules for Christmas has been scrapped for large parts of south-east England and cut to just Christmas Day for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales. From midnight, a new tier four will be introduced in areas including London, Kent, Essex and Bedfordshire. Those in tier four cannot mix indoors with anyone not from their household. Elsewhere in England, Scotland and Wales, relaxed indoor mixing rules are cut from five days to Christmas Day. What is tier four and who is in it? Should you see your family at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the changes for England at a Downing Street briefing after scientists said a new coronavirus variant was spreading more rapidly. Tier-four restrictions - similar to England's second national lockdown - will apply in all areas in the South East currently in tier three, covering Kent, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey (excluding Waverley), Gosport, Havant, Portsmouth, Rother and Hastings. It will also apply in London (all 32 boroughs and the City of London) and the East of England (Bedford, Central Bedford, Milton Keynes, Luton, Peterborough, Hertfordshire, Essex (excluding Colchester, Uttlesford and Tendring). In Scotland, Covid restrictions willonly be relaxed on Christmas Day, with mainland Scotland being placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. Outlining the changes, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wished she had acted quicker to curb the virus in February, adding: ""Standing here saying this actually makes me want to cry."" A ban on travel to the rest of the UK will also apply over the festive period. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced that thecountry will be placed under lockdown from midnight. In Northern Ireland,no changes have been made to Christmas restrictions,with three households allowed to meet from 23 to 27 December. The country is set to entera six-week lockdown from 26 December. For tier-four areas in England, a stay-at-home order has been issued, with exemptions for those who have to travel to work or for education. Social mixing will be cut to meeting one person in an open public space, unless you live with them or they are part of your existing support bubble. All non-essential retail will have to close, along with hairdressers, nail bars, indoor gyms and leisure facilities. People elsewhere will be advised not to travel into a tier-four area. The restrictions will last for two weeks, with the first review due on 30 December. NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' UK's R number back above one 'I won't have next summer let alone next Christmas' Mr Johnson told the Downing Street briefing he knew how ""disappointing"" the news would be, but said he believed there was no alternative open to him. When the virus changes its methods of attack, he said, ""we must change our method of defence"". Mr Johnson acknowledged it was ""unquestionably a difficult moment"" in the coronavirus crisis but insisted that things would be ""radically different"" by Easter due to the vaccine. He did not confirm whether police would be told to stop people travelling home over the festive period or knock on doors on Christmas Day. Mr Johnson said analysis suggested the new variant could increasethe the R numberby 0.4 or more. Although there is ""considerable uncertainty"", it may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant, he said. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said that while the new variant of coronavirus will make things much worse, if the vaccine works against it there was room for optimism. He has previously said there is no current evidence to suggest the new variant causes a higher mortality rate or that is affected any differently by vaccines and treatments. Speaking at the Downing Street briefing, he added: ""I think this is a situation which is going to make things a lot worse, but there are some really optimistic things if you look once we get the vaccine out, assuming the vaccine works against this, which at the moment is the working assumption."" Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, urged the public to assume they might be infectious when considering meeting others over Christmas. The steep increase in the proportion of coronavirus cases linked to this new variant is strong evidence that it is driving transmission. In London, 28% of cases were as a result of this new mutation in mid-November, but that has now increased to more than 60%. It may explain why, during the second lockdown, cases started to increase in London, while in Kent the tier three measures appear to have had little impact in recent weeks. As England's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says, this is a bad moment, but there is also some hope. Mutations happen all the time - there have been thousands of variations to this coronavirus since it emerged - and there is nothing to suggest this causes more serious illness or will hamper the effectiveness of the vaccine. The prime minister announced 350,000 people had been given the first dose of the vaccine in the first two weeks of the programme. In the coming weeks, the number of GP-led vaccination clinics should increase six-fold, while approval of a second vaccine made by Oxford University could pave the way for mass vaccination centres to be set up in sports stadiums and conference centres. That could see two million people a week being vaccinated. Within a matter of months all the over-65s could have been offered a jab. This could then start to feel very different. But for now, the slog of the pandemic continues - and for many it just got harder. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one?

Mark Harper, the chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, which has been highly critical of the government's strategy, called for Parliament to be recalled so MPs could debate and vote on the changes.

"Bailey has become the oldest ever winner, while Mabuse is the first pro to win in two consecutive years Strictly Come Dancing 2020 concluded on Saturday after a shorter but largely successful series amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bill Bailey fended off competition from HRVY, Maisie Smith and Jamie Laingto be crowned this year's winnerwith his partner Oti Mabuse. Aged 55, he has taken the title of the oldest Strictly winner from Joe McFadden, who won in 2017 aged 42. Mabuse also becomes the first professional to triumph two years in a row. The final featured music from Robbie Williams and a group performance from the show's professional dancers. It has been an eventful and unusual series. Here are seven of the most memorable moments: Anton had to be dragged kicking and screaming on to the judging panel ""After much persuasion, Anton has reluctantly agreed to step in,"" joked Claudia Winkleman when Motsi Mabuse had to take two weeks off from judging to self-isolate. It's no secret that Anton is keen to join the Strictly panel after clocking up more than 15 years as one of the show's pro dancers, but so far he hasn't made the leap. That finally changed this year and many viewers were surprised that he was actually rather good, if a little generous with his scores. Allow YouTube content?

Bill and Oti's dance to Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang was the biggest viral moment of this series by some distance - it was the only routine tocross the million mark on YouTube,external, with several million morewatching it on Twitter.,external It's easy to see why - Bailey could easily have fallen into the trap of embarrassing dad dancing, but instead he fully committed to a routine which packed in lots of content and detail. He even found time to rap along with the lyrics at one point. His dancing wasn't perfect, but it didn't matter. This was a turning point for both him and the series. ""All three members of the actual Sugarhill Gang sent me a personal video message of congratulations, and thanks for using their song,"" Baileywrote in The Telegraph afterwards.,external""I am still a little dazed by it all to be honest, but in a good way. I've even become a Gif."" The year is 2039. Coronavirus is long eradicated. Humans travel by hovercraft. All parcels are delivered by drones. And Jamie and Karen have survived another week in Strictly's bottom two. Last week's semi-final saw Ranvir Singh eliminated despite never previously being in the dance-off, much to the bafflement of viewers who had also just put Jamie there for the fourth time. This marked the first time in Strictly history a couple had survived the dance-off four times, overtaking even Mike Bushell last year, who was eliminated on his fourth bottom two appearance. ""I know a lot of people think dance-offs are really bad, but for us they've been one of the best things ever,"" Karen said earlier this week, ""because during a dance-off [Jamie] completely just goes for it, and I've never seen that ever before. Usually people get scared in a dance-off but for us, it was like, 'Come on, let's bring it, we deserve to be here.'"" The Wanted's Max George may not have lasted long in the competition, but thisSimpsons routine from Movie Week,externalwill last long in the memories of Strictly viewers, for better or worse. We loved it, lots of people hated it, but either way, full marks for creativity. The blaze of publicity surrounding the first same-sex couple on Strictly was swiftly extinguished after Nicola Adams wound up in the bottom two early in the series, and then had to drop out entirely. Her partner, Katya Jones, tested positive for Covid-19, which meant both she and Nicola had to go into self-isolation for two weeks, making their continued participation in the show unviable. But fortunately that was the only coronavirus casualty of the series, with HRVY just managing to return in time for the show's launch after testing positive during rehearsals. The Strictly team overbooked this series to allow for a few celebrities to pull out due to Covid, but as only one has, we were left with an unusual (although not unprecedented) four-way final. Away from the competitive dancing, there were plenty of notable group and guest performances this year. The group dances were all filmed in advance so the professionals could knock them all off in one go while isolating together in a hotel. Plus, we had guest performances on the results shows from The Vamps, Gary Barlow and the cast of & Juliet. But the BBC received more than 150 complaints after pro dancers Gorka, Johannes and Giovanni appeared in drag during a Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert routine in Musicals week. It's actually not the first time the show has dabbled in drag. Although, to be fair,Craig Revel Horwood's drag performance in last year's series,externalwas so impressive and convincing we bet a lot of viewers didn't even realise it was him. Social distancing meant the contestants couldn't all cuddle up with Claudia as usual, so the upstairs area's informal name changed from the already brilliant Clauditorium to the possibly-even-better Chatterpillar. Other changes this year included the dramatically increased use of CGI. From Bill kneeling in front of a huge digital elephant to Clara Amfo dancing on a gigantic virtual record player, it added a new dimension to the dancing, although not all viewers were keen on it. And finally, this was the year that street dancing really reigned supreme. Having only been introduced in 2018, it's basically become the default option for Couple's Choice. That has sparked disapproval from traditional ballroom fans, but we're totally here for it. Earlier this week, the four finalists spoke to BBC News and other outlets about their experiences on this year's show. One of the most noticeable things forHRVYis how much the experience has aged him. ""It's a really weird thing, I'm doing what my dad and granddad do now, which I really hate: every time I get up and down I make noises, it's just because my body and my knees are in agony,"" he says. HRVY says he hopes he has inspired other young people to take up dancing Despite his aching muscles, the 21-year-old's participation in the series has prompted interest in dancing from younger viewers. ""I've had so many comments and DMs from younger people who have watched the show saying they want to dance. And not just cool street dancing, the Latin stuff, the salsa and the cha-cha, that whole generation of dance is coming back round again. So hopefully we can inspire younger people to dance because we have so much fun."" While HRVY might have inspired other young people to take up dancing, another contestant has the other end of the spectrum taken care of. ""Blokes sometimes feel a bit self conscious, particularly blokes of my age, they feel like they're going to be called the dad dancer,""Bill Baileysays. ""And I think if me showing I can get out there and look a little bit more than somebody shuffling about, then why not?"" On the subject of encouraging older people to try dancing, he adds: ""If that is the consequence of me being on the show then that's wonderful."" His partner Oti Mabuse revealed: ""I had a conversation with Rob Brydon, and he said he's always watched Strictly, and he always sees the older gentleman being a comedic act. But for the first time, when he saw Bill, he thought, 'Oh my goodness, when I watch Strictly, there's a possibility I can go far.' It's just a different take, because he's a respected man and is a respectable character in English society if he ever came on to Strictly he would be taken seriously."" Smith said being in the bottom two gave her and her partner Gorka Marquez extra motivation Jamie Lainghas made it to the finale in spite of struggling any time he hasn't had Karen Hauer by his side. ""If I'm by myself on the dancefloor, that is a no-no, I have to be connected with Karen most of the time, because if I'm by myself doing a solo dance, that is when things go wrong,"" he laughs. Laing has landed in the dance-off several times, as has fellow finalistMaisie Smith. But, she says, that has only served to motivate her. ""Being in the bottom two, it kind of made me realise how much this meant to me, and it did give me a massive push to just keep working as hard as I can,"" she says. ""And I think that was the turning point for me that made me just think, 'I've got to put my all into this,' and I think it's been paying off ever since."" The dances and songs in Saturday's final were: Maisie and Gorka:Samba (performed to Conga! by Gloria Estefan), Showdance (We Need A Little Christmas by Idina Menzel), Quickstep (When You're Smiling by Andy Williams) HRVY and Janette:Jive (Faith by Stevie Wonder feat. Ariana Grande), Showdance (Boogie Wonderland by Earth, Wind & Fire), American Smooth (One Singular Sensation from A Chorus Line) Bill and Oti:Quickstep (Talk To The Animals by Bobby Darin) Showdance (The Show Must Go On by Queen), Couple's Choice (Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang) Jamie and KarenCharleston (Zero To Hero from Hercules), Showdance (I'm Still Standing by Elton John), Couple's Choice (Gonna Make You Sweat by C+C Music Factory) Strictly judge Bruno unable to fly back for final Strictly's Maisie: EastEnders didn't prepare me for this Covid forces Nicola and Katya out of Strictly Strictly 'difficult' to film without live audience 12 things you need to know about Strictly's stars At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Relaxation of Christmas Covid rules scrapped for much of south-east England as tier four restrictions announced And people in England in tiers one to three can only mix indoors on Christmas Day Festive bubbles in Scotland and Wales also restricted to just Christmas Day PM says spread in cases 'being driven by the new variant of the virus' Wales brings forward lockdown to start from midnight Nicola Sturgeon announces travel ban between Scotland and rest of UK from Boxing Day Northern Ireland lockdown to start on Boxing Day A second vaccine is being rolled out in the US after regulators approved a jab developed by Moderna Italy has ordered a nationwide lockdown over much of the Christmas and New Year period Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Penny Spiller and Owen Amos We're going to wrap up our live coverage for the day. To find out how today's announcement will affect you, put your postcode into our lockdown look-uphere. For more details on England's new tier four, including what it means and who will be in it, readthis. Today's live page was brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Owen Amos, Penny Spiller, Joshua Nevett, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Emily Young. Thanks for joining us. Weâre wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic shortly. Before we do, hereâs a reminder of the headlines on this, the 283rd day since the pandemic was confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the UK:  Elsewhere in the world: French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week We can bring you some business reaction to Boris Johnson's announcement of tier four restrictions in the south and east of England, including London. ""The consequences of this decision will be severe,"" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium said. She said the governmentâs ""stop-start approach"" to coronavirus restrictions has been ""deeply unhelpful"" for retailers ahead of the usually busy and lucrative Christmas period. Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce echoed Dickinson, calling on the government to ""address the economic consequences of its actions"". He said that retailers needed extra financial support to get through the winter and beyond. Federation of Small Businesses vice-chair Martin McTague said tier four restrictions would be a ""hammer blow"" to non-essential retailers. ""From shops to hairdressers, this would normally the one of the busiest times of the year,"" he said. ""Many will have bought extra stock and increased staff hours, now their takings are to disappear literally overnight."" Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said retailers had ""lost all confidence"" in the UK government's strategy for tackling coronavirus. ""The unrelenting closing and reopening of businesses is costing owners hundreds of thousands of pounds, and coupled with the erratic decision-making around restrictions, is rapidly destroying the ability of the sector to bounce back,"" he said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says moving the capital under tier four restrictions is ""a bitter blow for Londoners who were hoping to spend time with loved ones safely this Christmas"". ""This continued chaos and confusion could all have been avoided had the government not made irresponsible promises to the public and raised expectations about the Christmas period,"" he says. ""London faces its toughest Christmas since the war and the whole city will need to pull together to see us through this terrible period."" Mr Khan said implementing restrictions was not enough, and the government needed to increase testing capacity, provide greater financial support and make face coverings mandatory in all busy outdoor public spaces. As Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, explained in the press conference earlier, coronavirus infections and deaths have been rising rapidly since the start of December in the UK. There was a dip in November, when England went into a four-week lockdown, and restrictions remained tight in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But UK-wide infections have now gone back up to the levels seen in October, with more than 27,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed on Saturday. Another 534 deaths were also recorded in the UK on Saturday, up from 489 a day before. Those increases bring the UKâs total number of infections to 2,004,219 and deaths to 67,075, the latest figures show. That means the UK has the sixth-highest number of deaths and infections of any country in the world,according to tallies kept by Johns Hopkins University,external. There have been big changes announced to the Christmas rules for England, Wales and Scotland.  Read more details here Tier four restrictions will come into force from midnight tonight and will apply in all tier three areas across the south and east of England. In south-east England, the areas affected are: In the east of England, the areas affected are: Read more about tier four and what it meanshere. You can also check what the rules are in your areahere. Ms Sturgeon answers a question about people having to cancel Christmas plans. She says her ""message to everybody is: I'm desperately sorry"". She says it ""breaks my heart"", and acknowledges ""there will be heartbroken people listening to this right now"". She says this is a ""once in a century pandemic"" that ""we just have to get through"". She asks people to ""hunker down"" and repeats a line from Irish poet Seamus Heaney she used in the Scottish Parliament previously: ""If we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere."" Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter England, Scotland and Wales have all announced changes to their Christmas restrictions this afternoon, but at the moment there are no plans to change the rules in Northern Ireland. However, the first and deputy first ministers as well as the health minister have been holding various meetings today to discuss their response to the new variant of the virus. BBC Scotland's chief political correspondent Glenn Campbell asks Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon whether with hindsight she wishes she hadn't bothered to relax restrictions over Christmas. ""No,"" she says. ""I've always agonised over this. From the moment we announced relaxations... I've advised against using them unless absolutely essential. ""In my view they were only ever there in recognition of the fact that some people would find it impossible to leave loved ones alone"". She adds that she wouldn't have changed track ""if it wasn't for what I'd been told today about this new strain"". Ms Sturgeon says all of the Scottish mainland will move to level four restrictions from 26 December. Level four is the highest ofScotland's five levels- it stops households mixing, shuts pubs and restaurants and closes non-essential retail. Level four will last for at least three weeks. Schools will not resume until 11 January, with online only until 18 Janaury - apart from key workers' children and the most vulnerable. Ms Sturgeon says the new rules ""make me want to cry"". ""I know how harsh it is,"" she says, adding ""but this virus doesn't care about anything apart from spreading as far and wide as possible"". Her message, she says, is stay home and stay safe this Christmas. The planned five-day relaxation of Covid restrictions over the festive periodhas been cut back to just Christmas Dayfor the whole of Scotland â with advice to avoid any social mixing. Indoor mixing in a bubble in Scotland will be allowed to take place on Christmas Day only, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. ""We will allow Christmas Day to go ahead, but as we have said from the start, only use this flexibility if you really, truly need to,"" she says. ""Our advice is still not to meet indoors even on Christmas Day with other households if you can possibly avoid it."" A maximum of eight people from three households will be allowed to meet on Christmas Day, ""but again our advice will be to minimise those numbers as much as possible"", Ms Sturgeon says. Cross-border travel will no longer be permitted, but travelling within Scotland will be allowed on Christmas Day only.  Ms Sturgeon says there will be a strict travel ban from Scotland to the rest of the UK throughout the Christmas period. ""People from Scotland should not visit other parts of the UK, and vice versa,"" she says. International travel advice will be issued next week - but Ms Sturgeon strongly advises against it. Ms Sturgeon says if we don't act ""firmly and decisively"" to stop the new variant taking hold in Scotland, ""by January our NHS could potentially be overwhelmed"". Ms Sturgeon says there have been 17 cases of the new fast-spreading variant confirmed in Scotland - but, she says, that is likely to be an understatement. It may be at low levels, but it does pose a real risk, she says, ""if we do not act and act firmly"". She says Scotland must act ""firmly and deceisvely now, or it will take hold"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has taken to the podium for her press conference. She says the new variant of the virus means ""very firm preventative action is now necessary"", adding that this is ""probably the most serious and potentially most dangerous juncture"" since the beginning of the pandemic. The prime minister held a Covid briefing at Downing Street a short time ago. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key announcements: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says ""millions of families will be heartbroken by having Christmas plans ripped up"", after this evening's announcement by the prime minister. Sir Keir says he was frustrated as he had raised the issue of Christmas with Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, where the prime minister told people to have ""a merry little Christmas"". The Labour leader says ""today's announcement will only lead to confusion when people need certainty"" and called on the government to display ""decisive leadership"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is about to give a news conference. There was earlier a call between leaders of all four UK nations, after which Ms Sturgeon held a meeting of the Scottish cabinet. The first minister will be joined at the news conference by interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith and national clinical director Jason Leitch.

"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary. You cannot go to the pub with members of your Christmas bubble. In England, if you have formed asupport bubblewith another household, that counts as one household. In Scotland,guidance,externalsays any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"". People who are self-isolatingshould not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone has to self-isolate. Under-18s whose parents live apart can join two Christmas bubbles, so they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household. University students whotravel homewill be counted as part of their family household straight away. But if a family has three or more grown-up children not at university, they cannot all form a Christmas bubble with their parents, even in areas where mixing is still possible.

"The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. The latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage,is between 0.7 and 0.9,external, up slightly from the week before. It means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average. Measles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. That means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. Coronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading. You can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards. Data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing. But if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. If the R-value is above one then the number of cumulative cases takes off, but if it is below one then eventually the outbreak stops. The further below one, the faster that happens. Governments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one. The R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. Mathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. Before any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. Although the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences. Scotland'sestimated R number isbetween 0.8 and 1.0,external, up slightly on the previous week. InWalesthe number isbetween 0.6 and 0.9,external- while inNorthern Irelandit remains between 0.75 and 0.95. InEngland, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0. What are the latest social distancing rules? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Vaccine passports could discriminate, experts warn TheR numberis one of the big three. Another isseverity- some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. The last is thenumber of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases. A vaccination programme, like the onecurrently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number. A coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.

"Norton took over from Jonathan Ross, who left the BBC in 2010 Graham Norton told listeners it had been a ""privilege being part of your Saturday mornings"" as he bid an emotional farewell to Radio 2. The star will front a new show on Virgin Radio from January. At the end of his final Radio 2 programme, he said: ""Mostly, I need to say thank you to you, the listeners. ""It's been lovely sharing your lives and hearing your messages, and that's been the greatest joy of being on Radio 2, it really has."" He added 10 years had ""gone by in the blink of an eye"" and closed the programme by playing Reach by S Club 7. ""It has been a privilege to be part of your mornings,"" he said. ""I'm getting emotional now. Someone told me I'd get emotional and I said 'No I won't.'"" He joked that it made him feel better to ""think of the six flights of stairs"" he will no longer need to climb to reach the Radio 2 studios in Wogan House in central London. Norton is not leaving the BBC altogether, and will continue to front his BBC One chat show Earlier in the programme, Norton acknowledged it was ""the end of an era"", and read out messages from listeners who said they would miss him. The chat show host then joked: ""Just bear in mind, as you're doing your sadness, when I leave here today I'm leaving in a taxi not a hearse. We're OK. I'll still be in the world. I just won't be here. That's all."" Norton has signed a three-year contract with Virgin, which will see him present on both Saturday and Sunday mornings. Radio 2's Saturday morning slot, one of the most high-profile on the station, will be taken over by Strictly Come Dancing co-host Claudia Winkleman. BBC Radio 2 confirmed in November that Norton would be leaving at the end of the year - an announcement which took his listeners by surprise. In fact, Norton had only made the decision himself in the preceding few weeks, after a chance encounter with his old colleague, Chris Evans. Chris Evans has presented Virgin's breakfast show for nearly two years In late September, Norton was gearing up for the release of his third novel, Home Stretch. He gave numerous interviews to promote the book, including to Radio 4's Front Row and ITV's Lorraine Kelly. But he was also booked for an interview with Evans, who had himself left Radio 2 for Virgin in 2018. Their conversation would change the course of Norton's radio career, as herecalled recently on The High Low.,external ""I did an interview with Chris Evans on his breakfast show,"" Norton explained, ""and he was sort of teasing me saying, 'You should come to Virgin'. And the studios were lovely, you can see my house from the studio, and I thought, 'Oh actually, this is very nice here, and Chris seems so happy'. ""Then Virgin got in touch, and they mooted this idea of doing SaturdayandSunday. And I always thought on Radio 2 that it would be good to be stripped across the weekend. And I think in a way, at my age, I was so flattered that someone wanted me, and it just seemed exciting to have a new challenge."" One side effect of the move is that Norton will drop down the BBC's star salaries list, which is published every summer as part of the corporation's annual report. The star haspreviously saidthe publication is ""not nice or comfortable"" for those on it. Graham Norton took over the Saturday morning slot in 2010 Norton has presented his Radio 2 programme, broadcast between 10:00-13:00 on Saturdays, since October 2010. The slot is one of the most high profile on the station, attracting more than four million listeners, and traditionally hosted by a big name. The Irish presenter replaced Jonathan Ross, who left the BBC after the ""Sachsgate"" scandal. But, Norton explained at the time, he was initially reluctant to host the programme. ""I didn't want to take over from Jonathan,""he told the Media Talk podcast,external, ""because I think Jonathan is brilliant and I loved that show, and that's what I said to them. And they explained, 'That's all very well, we get that, but if you turn this down now, this job doesn't come up very often. The last time it was 10 or 12 years ago, so you will regret turning this down'."" It was a fair point; Ross had presented the show for 11 years. And unlike youth-orientated stations such as Radio 1, which rotate their DJs quite regularly, presenters on Radio 2 tend to bed in for the long haul. Norton gave in after some persuasion and has now hosted his Radio 2 programme for a decade, although Alan Carr and Melanie Sykes normally sit in during his extended summer break. The show has a very different identity to his BBC One chat show. On Radio 2, there's room for longer, more thoughtful, interviews, and while Norton's red sofa is reserved for Hollywood A-listers telling funny showbiz stories, you're more likely to hear in-depth interviews with authors and theatre stars on his radio programme. Actress and presenter Maria McErlane co-hosts the Grill Graham feature In addition to the music and celebrity guests, the enduring popularity of Norton's show owes much to his weekly agony aunt feature, Grill Graham. For this, he is joined by his superb co-host and long-time friend Maria McErlane. Their pairing is a masterclass in on-air chemistry and a firm favourite with listeners. Members of the public write in each week with a personal problem, and Norton and McErlane offer their advice before asking listeners to send in their own solutions. Reflecting on his favourite letters recently, Norton said: ""I either like them to be so stupid that you get annoyed by the person that's written in, like, 'Really? In the world we live in,that'sthe thing that motivated you to write in and ask for advice?' So I like those ones, 'My kitchen cupboard handles are funny' or something. ""And then I like the really devastating ones,"" he continued. ""I remember one week we got a woman who had a terminal diagnosis, she was going to die, and she was looking for advice about telling her children and also spending time with her children in the time that she had left. ""What I loved about it wasn't that we got to give advice, it was the outpouring of support from the Radio 2 listeners, who are, by and large, a very nice bunch. So I was reading out advice from people who had been through similar things... and just sobbing on the radio."" On Saturday's final programme, McErlane said listeners had shared their ""maddest, funniest, craziest and saddest problems with us, many of which will stay with me and Graham for a long time"". McErlane has since announced she is moving to Virgin with Norton. Norton isn't as keen on all music on Radio 2 as he was on Chrissie Hynde, who he interviewed in 2017 Some of the most glorious moments of Norton's Radio 2 show have come when he is simply riffing off the music he's just played. While Virgin, on the whole, plays rock and indie music, the wildly varying genres on Radio 2 have often prompted humorous asides from the 57-year-old. After playing Billie Eilish's Bad Guy last month, a dark, bass-heavy and haunting song, Norton remarked: ""That just screams Radio 2 doesn't it? Carol celebrating her 70th birthday will have really enjoyed that."" ""This is new from Ty Dolla $ign.You know, Ty Dolla $ign?!"" he joked on another occasion, knowing the hip-hop singer would likely be alien to the Radio 2 demographic. ""Let's just appreciate the magic dust that Ty Dolla $ign spreads on everything he does."" While introducing All Day And Night by Jax Jones, Martin Solveig and Madison Beer, Norton wondered aloud: ""Why does it take SO many people to make a record these days?"" His honest and often sarcastic comments usually reflect perfectly what his audience is thinking, and are a key part of his enduring appeal. Radio 2's mixture of new songs, classic songs, specialist music and the presenter and producer's own choices have provided lots of material for Norton to have fun with over the years. Claudia Winkleman will take over the Saturday morning slot on Radio 2 Norton's producer, Malcolm Prince, told us it had ""been a fascinating and entertaining 10 years"", highlighting the show's outside broadcasts from Azerbaijan (for Eurovision), New York, and inside the Tardis. ""But Graham was always happiest in the studio at Wogan House where he could be himself,"" said Prince. ""No matter how starry his guests have been, he always made them sound almost like one of us. It's been a privilege to produce Graham's show and, just like his millions of listeners, I'll miss his Radio 2 programme."" As we all will. But Norton is looking forward to doubling his airtime with Virgin, as he told Evans during a more recent interviewon the How To Wow podcast,external. ""It will be interesting to find out who that Sunday audience is,"" he said, ""because on Saturdays you get a sense that people are listening as they do things - they're ferrying kids, they're waiting outside a supermarket, whereas Sunday, I feel people are probably in their house more, they're reading the newspapers, they're getting lunch, but the radio is on. ""So I think that will be fun to have that six hours with people over the weekend, and you can carry things over from the Saturday. Those are opportunities that I didn't have before.""

"Bailey has become the oldest ever winner, while Mabuse is the first pro to win in two consecutive years Strictly Come Dancing 2020 concluded on Saturday after a shorter but largely successful series amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bill Bailey fended off competition from HRVY, Maisie Smith and Jamie Laingto be crowned this year's winnerwith his partner Oti Mabuse. Aged 55, he has taken the title of the oldest Strictly winner from Joe McFadden, who won in 2017 aged 42. Mabuse also becomes the first professional to triumph two years in a row. The final featured music from Robbie Williams and a group performance from the show's professional dancers. It has been an eventful and unusual series. Here are seven of the most memorable moments: Anton had to be dragged kicking and screaming on to the judging panel ""After much persuasion, Anton has reluctantly agreed to step in,"" joked Claudia Winkleman when Motsi Mabuse had to take two weeks off from judging to self-isolate. It's no secret that Anton is keen to join the Strictly panel after clocking up more than 15 years as one of the show's pro dancers, but so far he hasn't made the leap. That finally changed this year and many viewers were surprised that he was actually rather good, if a little generous with his scores. Allow YouTube content?

Bill and Oti's dance to Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang was the biggest viral moment of this series by some distance - it was the only routine tocross the million mark on YouTube,external, with several million morewatching it on Twitter.,external It's easy to see why - Bailey could easily have fallen into the trap of embarrassing dad dancing, but instead he fully committed to a routine which packed in lots of content and detail. He even found time to rap along with the lyrics at one point. His dancing wasn't perfect, but it didn't matter. This was a turning point for both him and the series. ""All three members of the actual Sugarhill Gang sent me a personal video message of congratulations, and thanks for using their song,"" Baileywrote in The Telegraph afterwards.,external""I am still a little dazed by it all to be honest, but in a good way. I've even become a Gif."" The year is 2039. Coronavirus is long eradicated. Humans travel by hovercraft. All parcels are delivered by drones. And Jamie and Karen have survived another week in Strictly's bottom two. Last week's semi-final saw Ranvir Singh eliminated despite never previously being in the dance-off, much to the bafflement of viewers who had also just put Jamie there for the fourth time. This marked the first time in Strictly history a couple had survived the dance-off four times, overtaking even Mike Bushell last year, who was eliminated on his fourth bottom two appearance. ""I know a lot of people think dance-offs are really bad, but for us they've been one of the best things ever,"" Karen said earlier this week, ""because during a dance-off [Jamie] completely just goes for it, and I've never seen that ever before. Usually people get scared in a dance-off but for us, it was like, 'Come on, let's bring it, we deserve to be here.'"" The Wanted's Max George may not have lasted long in the competition, but thisSimpsons routine from Movie Week,externalwill last long in the memories of Strictly viewers, for better or worse. We loved it, lots of people hated it, but either way, full marks for creativity. The blaze of publicity surrounding the first same-sex couple on Strictly was swiftly extinguished after Nicola Adams wound up in the bottom two early in the series, and then had to drop out entirely. Her partner, Katya Jones, tested positive for Covid-19, which meant both she and Nicola had to go into self-isolation for two weeks, making their continued participation in the show unviable. But fortunately that was the only coronavirus casualty of the series, with HRVY just managing to return in time for the show's launch after testing positive during rehearsals. The Strictly team overbooked this series to allow for a few celebrities to pull out due to Covid, but as only one has, we were left with an unusual (although not unprecedented) four-way final. Away from the competitive dancing, there were plenty of notable group and guest performances this year. The group dances were all filmed in advance so the professionals could knock them all off in one go while isolating together in a hotel. Plus, we had guest performances on the results shows from The Vamps, Gary Barlow and the cast of & Juliet. But the BBC received more than 150 complaints after pro dancers Gorka, Johannes and Giovanni appeared in drag during a Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert routine in Musicals week. It's actually not the first time the show has dabbled in drag. Although, to be fair,Craig Revel Horwood's drag performance in last year's series,externalwas so impressive and convincing we bet a lot of viewers didn't even realise it was him. Social distancing meant the contestants couldn't all cuddle up with Claudia as usual, so the upstairs area's informal name changed from the already brilliant Clauditorium to the possibly-even-better Chatterpillar. Other changes this year included the dramatically increased use of CGI. From Bill kneeling in front of a huge digital elephant to Clara Amfo dancing on a gigantic virtual record player, it added a new dimension to the dancing, although not all viewers were keen on it. And finally, this was the year that street dancing really reigned supreme. Having only been introduced in 2018, it's basically become the default option for Couple's Choice. That has sparked disapproval from traditional ballroom fans, but we're totally here for it. Earlier this week, the four finalists spoke to BBC News and other outlets about their experiences on this year's show. One of the most noticeable things forHRVYis how much the experience has aged him. ""It's a really weird thing, I'm doing what my dad and granddad do now, which I really hate: every time I get up and down I make noises, it's just because my body and my knees are in agony,"" he says. HRVY says he hopes he has inspired other young people to take up dancing Despite his aching muscles, the 21-year-old's participation in the series has prompted interest in dancing from younger viewers. ""I've had so many comments and DMs from younger people who have watched the show saying they want to dance. And not just cool street dancing, the Latin stuff, the salsa and the cha-cha, that whole generation of dance is coming back round again. So hopefully we can inspire younger people to dance because we have so much fun."" While HRVY might have inspired other young people to take up dancing, another contestant has the other end of the spectrum taken care of. ""Blokes sometimes feel a bit self conscious, particularly blokes of my age, they feel like they're going to be called the dad dancer,""Bill Baileysays. ""And I think if me showing I can get out there and look a little bit more than somebody shuffling about, then why not?"" On the subject of encouraging older people to try dancing, he adds: ""If that is the consequence of me being on the show then that's wonderful."" His partner Oti Mabuse revealed: ""I had a conversation with Rob Brydon, and he said he's always watched Strictly, and he always sees the older gentleman being a comedic act. But for the first time, when he saw Bill, he thought, 'Oh my goodness, when I watch Strictly, there's a possibility I can go far.' It's just a different take, because he's a respected man and is a respectable character in English society if he ever came on to Strictly he would be taken seriously."" Smith said being in the bottom two gave her and her partner Gorka Marquez extra motivation Jamie Lainghas made it to the finale in spite of struggling any time he hasn't had Karen Hauer by his side. ""If I'm by myself on the dancefloor, that is a no-no, I have to be connected with Karen most of the time, because if I'm by myself doing a solo dance, that is when things go wrong,"" he laughs. Laing has landed in the dance-off several times, as has fellow finalistMaisie Smith. But, she says, that has only served to motivate her. ""Being in the bottom two, it kind of made me realise how much this meant to me, and it did give me a massive push to just keep working as hard as I can,"" she says. ""And I think that was the turning point for me that made me just think, 'I've got to put my all into this,' and I think it's been paying off ever since."" The dances and songs in Saturday's final were: Maisie and Gorka:Samba (performed to Conga! by Gloria Estefan), Showdance (We Need A Little Christmas by Idina Menzel), Quickstep (When You're Smiling by Andy Williams) HRVY and Janette:Jive (Faith by Stevie Wonder feat.

"Mark Drakeford earlier took part in a call with other UK leaders Welsh ministers are in emergency talks to discuss ""serious concerns"" over the spread of a new strain of Covid-19. First Minister Mark Drakeford took part in a call with representatives of the UK's devolved nations after a surge in cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas introduced tougher rules for Christmas, in response to rising cases. Tier four restrictionshave been announced for London and the south east of England. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said government advisers consider the new strain can spread more quickly. Cases of the newstrain have been confirmed in Wales.. In a tweet, Mr Drakeford said: ""I attended a four nation call earlier today to discuss serious concerns over the spread of a new Covid variant. ""I will chair a meeting of the Welsh Government Cabinet at 2pm today."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies called on Mr Drakeford to address the nation ""urgently"" over the rising case rates, and for an emergency recall of the Senedd. ""Given the speed of spread of this new strain and its presence in south Wales, it's clear Labour ministers are going to have to make some very difficult but swift decisions,"" he said on Twitter. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Q&A: Which rules are changing and when? The first minister had already announced a Wales-wide lockdown, with people being told to ""stay home"", which will begin on 28 December when the Christmas relaxation of rules ends. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warnedmore preventative action may be ""necessary""to stop the strain taking hold. The warning comes as scientists continue to evaluate the spread of the new variant in south-east England, where there are ""growing concerns"" about its transmission. The UK said it had now informed the World Health Organisation it had concluded the strain could spread more quickly. In Wales rules forwho can meet over Christmashad already been tightened, following a surge in coronavirus cases in communities in recent days. The Welsh Government had come under pressure from medical professionals who warned without an urgent lockdown before the festive periodcritical care would be ""unable to cope"". Three households can meet in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland between 23 to 28 December, following a UK-wide agreement. But in Wales this has been reduced to two households, with a further single person household allowed to meet with them, with the rule made law. Viruses do mutate - so this development should not come as a complete surprise. There is nothing to suggest it causes more serious illness or would impact the ability of the vaccines to work. But preliminary investigation suggests it is leading to faster transmission. That clearly is causing concern, especially ahead of Christmas when relaxing restrictions mean there is more opportunity for the virus to spread. It may well explain why infection rates started increasing in London during lockdown - something that has baffled experts. A total of 120,432 positive cases have been confirmed in Wales since the start of the pandemic, and3,046 people have now died with Covid-19. The most recent data shows that all of theUK's seven most infected local authoritiesare in Wales. Almost all health boards in Wales have now suspended some non-emergency services, as the demand on services increases. On Saturday, Swansea Bay Health Board, where the case rate stands at 877.1 per 100,000 of the population, warned emergency departments were extremely busy. The health board, which treats people in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, has urged people not to travel for Christmas but to ""stay home"" on messages on social media. Allow Twitter content?

"Jane Griffiths and her family have been hit hard by the pandemic A mother says one of her children has been asking if he is going to die, as a survey shows almost half of children are struggling with anxiety. Jane Griffiths, 47, said her four children had all been affected by the stress of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes as research for a children's charity showed more than half of children believe their parents are worried about making Christmas nice. More than a third were worried about getting Covid-19 and dying. Of the 1,000 children asked, 47% said they were experiencing anxiety. Coping with coronavirus anxiety How to explain coronavirus to very young children Why are people having lockdown nightmares? Ms Griffiths, from Connah's Quay in Flintshire, said her children's stress increased after her husband Deion lost his job at the local paper mill and money became tight. ""My husband was laid off and we weren't entitled to furlough because he was with an agency,"" she said. ""It has been difficult... you have to cut back and not take the children to as many places. ""They know they won't get the same [for Christmas]. ""Christmas is all about family anyway. That's the main thing."" Brigitte Gater, director of Action for Children Wales which conducted the research with YouGov, said the pandemic has plunged new families into poverty. ""Where children were used to seeing their parents going to work, that new wave of parents are spending their first Christmas on Universal Credit and really struggling with making ends meet,"" she said. ""Making sure that there's toys, presents, Christmas is going to be ok, at the same time as utilities, rent having to be paid, so there's a lot of anxiety about eviction and borrowing money over this time, just to make it a nice time for children. ""Some of the parents we surveyed said that if they could, they would cancel Christmas this year."" Father Dominic Cawdell runs a weekly food club which also helps buy Christmas presents for children Father Dominic Cawdell, of St Peter's Church in Holywell, runs a weekly food club where people can buy up to 15 items for Â£2 and helps find Christmas presents for children. He said people were ""anxious about getting sick, they're anxious about their children getting sick, they're anxious about their finances because many people who only work occasionally or whose work isn't particularly secure haven't been able to take advantage of government schemes"". ""Children are amazingly perceptive and they pick up on their parents' anxieties... it's even bigger for them, they don't understand it, they just know their whole world has changed,"" he added. Anita Igbinoba lost her job in a holiday camp as a result of the pandemic One of the food club customers, Anita Igbinoba who has two young daughters, said there was a lot of worry in her household after her job in a holiday camp ended. ""Panicking, pressure, children asking... I can't get them as much, they feel the anxiety and the pressure of it. It is upsetting really,"" she said. ""When they're handwashing, sanitising, it's become a big control thing."" How can I overcome my anxiety?

"Mark Drakeford earlier took part in a call with other UK leaders Welsh ministers are in emergency talks to discuss ""serious concerns"" over the spread of a new strain of Covid-19. First Minister Mark Drakeford took part in a call with representatives of the UK's devolved nations after a surge in cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas introduced tougher rules for Christmas, in response to rising cases. Tier four restrictionshave been announced for London and the south east of England. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said government advisers consider the new strain can spread more quickly. Cases of the newstrain have been confirmed in Wales.. In a tweet, Mr Drakeford said: ""I attended a four nation call earlier today to discuss serious concerns over the spread of a new Covid variant. ""I will chair a meeting of the Welsh Government Cabinet at 2pm today.""

"The ""festive magic"" promised by the organisers did not materialise, according to angry visitors Families have demanded refunds from a ""shambolic"" drive-through Santa's grotto after queuing for hours. It opened on Friday night and promised a 1km (0.6 mile) sparkling light trail through the grounds of Taverham Hall, near Norwich. The event's Facebook page was later flooded with complaints about traffic chaos, ""creepy"" performers who scared children, and ""Poundland"" gifts. ""It was an absolute fiasco from start to finish,"" said visitor Louise Purdy. Organiser We Make Events has been approached for comment. People commenting on social media said they queued for up to three hours in rush-hour traffic, having bought tickets for a time slot. A Scrooge character prompted a warning on a parenting site after he gave one young visitor nightmares Many turned away with tired, upset children, with one parent stating: ""Would've been quicker to get to the North Pole."" Another said: ""Three very grumpy children and four disappointed adults down Â£110."" Some of those who did make it inside were unhappy with what had been billed as ""huge amounts of festive magic"". A ""scary"" Scrooge-like character prompted one mum to post a warning on a parenting site after her child had nightmares. Louise Purdy said she told her three-year-old son the inflatables were having a sleep Ms Purdy, who was there with her two-year-old and five-year-old nephews and son, aged three, said the whole thing was comically awful. ""We wanted the sparkle, the magic of Christmas, but I actually started laughing because I couldn't comprehend how rubbish it was. ""The Scrooge guy called us all mutants, said Santa has crashed his sleigh and the presents are in the mud, and there was a man in chains by a tree just staring at the car. ""It was creepy, but was meant to be for little kids. ""The light tunnel at the end wasn't even switched on and the Santa couldn't be less interested."" Another parent said: ""The gifts were rubbish, not even wrapped, just in brown paper bags and they were things probably bought in Poundland."" The Purdy family queued for almost two hours Kerry Prentice from Norwich, who paid Â£68 for three tickets, told BBC Radio Norfolk she left after 90 minutes having been told she would probably have to wait a further two hours. ""It was absolutely shocking. ""We wanted something really nice to do as a family, but it was appalling and we've had no response from the organisers."" We Make Events is yet to respond to complaints but has issued a statement asking visitors to adjust their route ""to ease traffic worries"".

"There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

To find out how today's announcement will affect you, put your postcode into our lockdown look-uphere. For more details on England's new tier four, including what it means and who will be in it, readthis. Today's live page was brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Owen Amos, Penny Spiller, Joshua Nevett, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Emily Young. Thanks for joining us. Weâre wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic shortly. Before we do, hereâs a reminder of the headlines on this, the 283rd day since the pandemic was confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the UK:  Elsewhere in the world: French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week We can bring you some business reaction to Boris Johnson's announcement of tier four restrictions in the south and east of England, including London. ""The consequences of this decision will be severe,"" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium said. She said the governmentâs ""stop-start approach"" to coronavirus restrictions has been ""deeply unhelpful"" for retailers ahead of the usually busy and lucrative Christmas period. Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce echoed Dickinson, calling on the government to ""address the economic consequences of its actions"". He said that retailers needed extra financial support to get through the winter and beyond. Federation of Small Businesses vice-chair Martin McTague said tier four restrictions would be a ""hammer blow"" to non-essential retailers. ""From shops to hairdressers, this would normally the one of the busiest times of the year,"" he said. ""Many will have bought extra stock and increased staff hours, now their takings are to disappear literally overnight."" Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said retailers had ""lost all confidence"" in the UK government's strategy for tackling coronavirus. ""The unrelenting closing and reopening of businesses is costing owners hundreds of thousands of pounds, and coupled with the erratic decision-making around restrictions, is rapidly destroying the ability of the sector to bounce back,"" he said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says moving the capital under tier four restrictions is ""a bitter blow for Londoners who were hoping to spend time with loved ones safely this Christmas"". ""This continued chaos and confusion could all have been avoided had the government not made irresponsible promises to the public and raised expectations about the Christmas period,"" he says. ""London faces its toughest Christmas since the war and the whole city will need to pull together to see us through this terrible period."" Mr Khan said implementing restrictions was not enough, and the government needed to increase testing capacity, provide greater financial support and make face coverings mandatory in all busy outdoor public spaces. As Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, explained in the press conference earlier, coronavirus infections and deaths have been rising rapidly since the start of December in the UK. There was a dip in November, when England went into a four-week lockdown, and restrictions remained tight in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But UK-wide infections have now gone back up to the levels seen in October, with more than 27,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed on Saturday. Another 534 deaths were also recorded in the UK on Saturday, up from 489 a day before. Those increases bring the UKâs total number of infections to 2,004,219 and deaths to 67,075, the latest figures show. That means the UK has the sixth-highest number of deaths and infections of any country in the world,according to tallies kept by Johns Hopkins University,external.

Ms Sturgeon answers a question about people having to cancel Christmas plans. She says her ""message to everybody is: I'm desperately sorry"". She says it ""breaks my heart"", and acknowledges ""there will be heartbroken people listening to this right now"". She says this is a ""once in a century pandemic"" that ""we just have to get through"". She asks people to ""hunker down"" and repeats a line from Irish poet Seamus Heaney she used in the Scottish Parliament previously: ""If we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere."" Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter England, Scotland and Wales have all announced changes to their Christmas restrictions this afternoon, but at the moment there are no plans to change the rules in Northern Ireland. However, the first and deputy first ministers as well as the health minister have been holding various meetings today to discuss their response to the new variant of the virus. BBC Scotland's chief political correspondent Glenn Campbell asks Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon whether with hindsight she wishes she hadn't bothered to relax restrictions over Christmas. ""No,"" she says. ""I've always agonised over this. From the moment we announced relaxations... I've advised against using them unless absolutely essential. ""In my view they were only ever there in recognition of the fact that some people would find it impossible to leave loved ones alone"". She adds that she wouldn't have changed track ""if it wasn't for what I'd been told today about this new strain"". Ms Sturgeon says all of the Scottish mainland will move to level four restrictions from 26 December. Level four is the highest ofScotland's five levels- it stops households mixing, shuts pubs and restaurants and closes non-essential retail. Level four will last for at least three weeks. Schools will not resume until 11 January, with online only until 18 Janaury - apart from key workers' children and the most vulnerable. Ms Sturgeon says the new rules ""make me want to cry"". ""I know how harsh it is,"" she says, adding ""but this virus doesn't care about anything apart from spreading as far and wide as possible"". Her message, she says, is stay home and stay safe this Christmas. The planned five-day relaxation of Covid restrictions over the festive periodhas been cut back to just Christmas Dayfor the whole of Scotland â with advice to avoid any social mixing. Indoor mixing in a bubble in Scotland will be allowed to take place on Christmas Day only, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. ""We will allow Christmas Day to go ahead, but as we have said from the start, only use this flexibility if you really, truly need to,"" she says. ""Our advice is still not to meet indoors even on Christmas Day with other households if you can possibly avoid it."" A maximum of eight people from three households will be allowed to meet on Christmas Day, ""but again our advice will be to minimise those numbers as much as possible"", Ms Sturgeon says. Cross-border travel will no longer be permitted, but travelling within Scotland will be allowed on Christmas Day only.  Ms Sturgeon says there will be a strict travel ban from Scotland to the rest of the UK throughout the Christmas period. ""People from Scotland should not visit other parts of the UK, and vice versa,"" she says. International travel advice will be issued next week - but Ms Sturgeon strongly advises against it. Ms Sturgeon says if we don't act ""firmly and decisively"" to stop the new variant taking hold in Scotland, ""by January our NHS could potentially be overwhelmed"". Ms Sturgeon says there have been 17 cases of the new fast-spreading variant confirmed in Scotland - but, she says, that is likely to be an understatement. It may be at low levels, but it does pose a real risk, she says, ""if we do not act and act firmly"". She says Scotland must act ""firmly and deceisvely now, or it will take hold"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has taken to the podium for her press conference. She says the new variant of the virus means ""very firm preventative action is now necessary"", adding that this is ""probably the most serious and potentially most dangerous juncture"" since the beginning of the pandemic. The prime minister held a Covid briefing at Downing Street a short time ago. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key announcements: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says ""millions of families will be heartbroken by having Christmas plans ripped up"", after this evening's announcement by the prime minister. Sir Keir says he was frustrated as he had raised the issue of Christmas with Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, where the prime minister told people to have ""a merry little Christmas"". The Labour leader says ""today's announcement will only lead to confusion when people need certainty"" and called on the government to display ""decisive leadership"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is about to give a news conference. There was earlier a call between leaders of all four UK nations, after which Ms Sturgeon held a meeting of the Scottish cabinet. The first minister will be joined at the news conference by interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith and national clinical director Jason Leitch.

To find out how today's announcement will affect you, put your postcode into our lockdown look-uphere. For more details on England's new tier four, including what it means and who will be in it, readthis. Today's live page was brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Owen Amos, Penny Spiller, Joshua Nevett, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Emily Young. Thanks for joining us. Weâre wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic shortly. Before we do, hereâs a reminder of the headlines on this, the 283rd day since the pandemic was confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the UK:  Elsewhere in the world: French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week We can bring you some business reaction to Boris Johnson's announcement of tier four restrictions in the south and east of England, including London. ""The consequences of this decision will be severe,"" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium said. She said the governmentâs ""stop-start approach"" to coronavirus restrictions has been ""deeply unhelpful"" for retailers ahead of the usually busy and lucrative Christmas period. Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce echoed Dickinson, calling on the government to ""address the economic consequences of its actions"". He said that retailers needed extra financial support to get through the winter and beyond. Federation of Small Businesses vice-chair Martin McTague said tier four restrictions would be a ""hammer blow"" to non-essential retailers. ""From shops to hairdressers, this would normally the one of the busiest times of the year,"" he said. ""Many will have bought extra stock and increased staff hours, now their takings are to disappear literally overnight."" Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said retailers had ""lost all confidence"" in the UK government's strategy for tackling coronavirus. ""The unrelenting closing and reopening of businesses is costing owners hundreds of thousands of pounds, and coupled with the erratic decision-making around restrictions, is rapidly destroying the ability of the sector to bounce back,"" he said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says moving the capital under tier four restrictions is ""a bitter blow for Londoners who were hoping to spend time with loved ones safely this Christmas"". ""This continued chaos and confusion could all have been avoided had the government not made irresponsible promises to the public and raised expectations about the Christmas period,"" he says. ""London faces its toughest Christmas since the war and the whole city will need to pull together to see us through this terrible period."" Mr Khan said implementing restrictions was not enough, and the government needed to increase testing capacity, provide greater financial support and make face coverings mandatory in all busy outdoor public spaces. As Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, explained in the press conference earlier, coronavirus infections and deaths have been rising rapidly since the start of December in the UK. There was a dip in November, when England went into a four-week lockdown, and restrictions remained tight in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But UK-wide infections have now gone back up to the levels seen in October, with more than 27,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed on Saturday. Another 534 deaths were also recorded in the UK on Saturday, up from 489 a day before. Those increases bring the UKâs total number of infections to 2,004,219 and deaths to 67,075, the latest figures show.

"A fourth tier of coronavirus restrictions is expected to be introduced in London and south-east England, sources have told the BBC. There is also expected to be a tightening of the plans to relax the rules around households gathering during the Christmas period. The PM is to hold a press conference at 16:00 GMT as concerns grow about the spread of a new variant of the virus. Boris Johnson hosted a cabinet meeting earlier to discuss what action to take. Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said government advisers ""consider the new strain can spread more quickly"". He will join the prime minister and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, at the press conference. England's current three-tier system of coronavirus measures has faced criticism for not being effective in stopping the surge in cases. Boris Johnson 'hoping to avoid' national lockdown NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' UK's R number back above one The first ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland held talks with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove earlier. Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon, who will hold a press conference later,tweeted:,external""Cases currently at lower level in Scotland than UK - but preventative action may be necessary to stop faster spreading strain taking hold."" Welsh ministers are meeting to discuss ""serious concerns"",while Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Fostertweeted,externalthat the new variant of coronavirus prevalent in south-east England was ""very concerning"". Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced post-Christmas lockdowns. Covid rules were due to be relaxed across the UK between 23 and 27 December, with up to three households being able to meet. Any change of restrictions for London and the South East would not require MPs' approval in a Commons vote, as they are only held for England or UK-wide measures. It was just 72 hours ago that Boris Johnson was resisting pressure to cancel relaxations of restrictions over Christmas. He told a press conference cancelling the festive plans would be ""inhuman"". But concern has grown significantly in the last couple of days; both about the rising number of cases and the new variant of the virus disclosed earlier this week. Ministers met with their scientific advisers on Friday evening - and again on Saturday morning. Things have moved quickly in the last 24 hours. Sources have confirmed a new tier 4 will be introduced in London and the South East of England. That's likely to mean closure of non-essential shops and beauty salons. That's likely to have a significant impact of Christmas plans and what people can do in and around the capital. There are also conversations taking place in the devolved administrations about whether further restrictions are needed there too. Following concern about the rapid spread of a new variant, Prof Whitty said: ""We have alerted the World Health Organization and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding."" That came after advice from the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) - the expert committee that advises the government on pandemics. ""There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments although urgent work is under way to confirm this,"" Prof Whitty added. Chairman of Nervtag, Peter Horby, said they had not found the variant to be more severe but being easier to transmit meant it was harder to control. Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it was a big concern that the new variant seemed to be ""out-competing the other viruses very fast indeed"". He told the BBC News Channel: ""The really worrying thing from my perspective is that this was something we didn't know about at the beginning of this month and it appeared. And from what we hear, it is already becoming one of the dominant strains."" Asked if the transmission would move northwards, he said ""almost certainly"". Viruses do mutate - so this development should not come as a complete surprise. There's already been thousands of different variants of this coronavirus seen globally. There is nothing to suggest this one causes more serious illness or would impact the ability of the vaccines to work. But preliminary investigation suggests it is leading to faster transmission, according to the UK's chief medical adviser. That's clearly causing concern, especially ahead of Christmas when relaxing restrictions means there is more opportunity for the virus to spread. If the preliminary analysis is right it may well explain why infection rates started increasing in London during lockdown - something that has baffled experts. But as yet there has been no detailed data published on this so it is hard to know how clear that evidence is. What is certain, however, is that cases are rising in most quickly in the South East - and that is translating to more pressure on hospitals. While the numbers in hospital has remained stable in recent weeks across the north of England and the Midlands, the number of patients in hospital in the South East is rising, especially in London, which has seen close to a 50% increase over the past week. That in itself is not unusual - the first wave saw surges at slightly different times. What is happening in the South East could just be a repeat of that. But ministers and their officials are clearly not prepared to wait to find out with the country entering such a delicate and potentially risky period with the Christmas relaxations. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on the prime minister to set out ""what action he will be taking"" as the virus was ""out of control in parts of the country"". Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, said the government needed ""to respond to what is happening on the ground"" with hospital admissions rising. Health bosses have warned the NHS is under significant pressure, withnearly 90% of hospital beds in England full. Hospitals in Kent arepostponing non-urgent proceduresas coronavirus cases in the county rise beyond figures seen in the spring. Analysis suggests the R number - which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto -has risen above 1 in the UK. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Meanwhile, tier three Covid rules have come into force for parts of southern England, meaning that 38 million people - more than two-thirds of the nation's population - are now subject to the toughest restrictions. The changes, which came into effect at 00:01 GMT, see Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Hertfordshire and parts of Surrey, East Sussex, Cambridgeshire and Hampshire join the list of areas now in the highest level of England's three-tier system. In tier three, pubs and restaurants must close and different households cannot mix indoors or in most outdoor venues.

"""If you don't prove yourself you're gonna get stepped on. You can't be a wasteman."" Yusuf's been in a gang since he was 15. He wears a stab vest when he leaves the flat he shares with his mum and carries a knife in his boxers because he fears he'll be killed if he can't defend himself. ""I'd rather be judged by 12 than carried by six,"" he says, borrowing a Roddy Ricch lyric to make his point. Homelessness and domestic abuse feature heavily in Yusuf's past and he reckons there's an ""80/20 chance"" his future will involve prison. The 17-year-old - one of London's most notorious gang members - is speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat in a London youth hub. Sitting on a white plastic chair beside his youth worker, Yusuf reels off some of the crimes he's been accused of - carrying acid, attempted murder, arming himself with a knife. It's the first of a number of chats we had with the teenager, as we spent six months last year inside an east London unit set up to tackle gang crime. As we knocked on doors with case workers and walked around Hackney estates with police who are on first name terms with gang members, we started to uncover what life is like for these young people. They told us about stabbings, fights over ""inherited beef"" and the meticulous planning that goes into journeys to avoid running into rivals. ""One minute I'm going to the shop with my mate, the next minute I hear he's been stabbed,"" one 15-year-old says. Like Yusuf, he regularly wears a stab vest underneath his clothes. He tells us he's rarely in bed before 03:00 and struggles to get up in the morning. ""Every other day police knock at the door,"" an 18-year-old says. He's recently been arrested over a murder, but he's been released. He speaks plainly about being knifed in the leg. ""It was like a stab. Knife, blood. Couple of stitches."" As we chat he constantly answers texts and calls on two phones. We later hear he's been jailed forcounty linesdrug dealing. He tells us he'd like to rewind. ""I'd go back in time. I know how everything is gonna end up. I'm here in my yard, it's safe. It's not safe out there."" So how did these young men get here? Yusuf says most of the boys he started secondary school with are now in gangs. He once dreamed of being a footballer, but says he was let down by school and a government that ""only cares about itself"". ""They're not talking to the people in the council estates, they're talking to people in Chelsea,"" he says. He didn't have to look far for a different path. ""I gave up on myself. In the borough like, this is the life. You don't need to look for it, it's there."" The idea behind the Hackney Integrated Gangs Unit- set up 10 years ago - was to bring all the people involved in working with gang crime together. Information is shared between police, probation officers, youth offending workers and mentors, who are often ex-gang members and they all sit in the same office. There also someone from the Department for Work and Pensions, to help with jobs and benefits. Staff at the unit offer all kinds of support for young people in the community, from ""holding their hand"" at a doctor's appointment to booking taxis to take them to school. PC Jamie Preston says the teenagers who end up in gangs are often - not always - from poor backgrounds. ""They've usually not got much family, no money and they're living in London where you're surrounded by wealth. Rich people, flashy cars and all these kids want that,"" says PC Preston. ""You've got young males from estates who've probably got a single-parent income, living in horrible conditions, no money. They see these older males with thousands of pounds in their pocket and they ask them to do something and give them money for it. ""It's a no brainer, of course they're going to do it and this is how they get exploited."" Yusuf's mentor - part of the team at the unit - fills us in on some of his background. He's been run over by a rival gang, caught with a sword and found in a house where drugs were being sold in Devon. He's been arrested a number of times. Youth worker Damion Roberts says: ""He's put himself in that limelight - he wants everyone to know he's a very aggressive young man. He's putting fear in other people's minds. He's becoming very aggressive in this culture."" Yusuf tells us he doesn't want to hurt people but wouldn't hesitate to stab someone if he felt he needed to. ""No-one carries it for fashion - it's not for show. For me it's for my defence, if the time came I'd 100% be prepared to use it. It's either me or them."" ""I'd rather be in jail than dead, that's the reality."" Carrying a weapon makes him feel powerful, he admits. ""Like Superman - until it's time to run."" Yusuf's gang is his family and he'd do anything to protect them. ""I'm not saying I've stabbed someone. [But] in the future or whatever, I've got their back."" When we met Yusuf he was on the Met Police'slist of gang members,externaland was number one on the Hackney unit's list. The gangs violence matrix was set up after the riots in 2011 and is used by officers to identify people likely to be involved in gang crime in London. Once on the list, names are assigned a red, amber or green rating. But it has been controversial -374 people were removed from the matrix this yearwhen the UK's data watchdog found it breached data protection laws. Close bonds are a common feature of the gang mentality, PC Preston says. ""At the same time as being a gang, it's like a family to them. If you've got no family, you've been in care, no-one's ever bothered about you and you've got a group of males who look after you, fight for you, give you money - it is like a family. ""That's what they actually crave, someone to look after them. And obviously they can make a lot of money at the same time."" Damion says similar. ""It's a sense of love and friendship that's supposed to be in the home but it's outside the home."" Yusuf describes clashes with rival gangs as ""war"" and says he tries to get into that mindset. ""People get shot at, stabbed, people are dying. Just gotta think of it like this, 'I'm a soldier, soldiers do it [kill], if a soldier can do it I can do it.'"" He says he only feels safe at home or at the youth hub. His days are filled with ""hyper vigilance"" and ""paranoia"". ""You don't know what you're gonna hear. Who's gonna die next."" He sees threats everywhere. ""I don't like normal cars, speeding cars, cars going the wrong way up a one-way, tints, black cars, old cars, loud cars. I don't like dodgy licence plates."" He wants out. ""You want to leave. It's a sad life. There's nothing to be glamorised, people die, people die you know. Everybody wants to leave it. It's just about timing."" For Michael, that time came after 12 years in and out of custody for drugs offences and robbery. He was first sent to a youth offender institution at just 13 years old. ""I felt like it just reminded me of a youth centre with people I didn't know that I got to know. Besides that, that was it, you just had a bedtime and you couldn't leave and I didn't even think that bothered me. ""Six months later, I got out."" Now 26, he says crime was ""just a way of life"" and when asked if he ever felt bad or remorseful, he says: ""Nah, I need to eat - that's what you're thinking."" When we meet him he's working a 9-5 job and he's been out of prison for eight months. ""Dealing drugs - running from the feds. I can't be doing this. I can't be running."" He says he can't quite believe how much spare time he now has. Being in a gang is 24-7. ""I feel more at ease now."" Michael has changed his life but he knows it's not easy getting others to do the same. He tells us the kind of things designed to steer young gang members away from the streets - like mentors, day trips and restaurant outings -  didn't stop him dealing drugs. PC Preston puts it simply. ""As long as there is drugs and poverty, we'll always have a gang problem."" At the gangs unit, analyst Mani says helping people to get out of the gangs lifestyle is ""a long hard slog"" and can take years. ""It's a difficult lifestyle to get out of once you're fully entrenched. And actually, what we need to do is say to that young person, 'We're not going to leave you'."" That's what happened for Michael, who says he owes a lot to his probation officer at the unit. ""Things are going well and I still got her... still by my side. She's like family... I can't even argue with her, man."" Michael now wants to go into prisons to talk to young people like him. He's even speaking to his MP about it. And what about Yusuf? Our final chat with him is ahead of his sentencing for carrying a knife and taking acid into a council building. He tells us his mindset has shifted. ""The way I think is different. If I carry [a weapon] now and get stopped they know my face. Before, carrying is carrying. There's other ways to feel safe - planning what times I go out and what route. My decision making is different, I'm just gonna be more smart. ""I can't be getting caught with a sword and stuff, that's done"" Six days before Christmas, he stands before magistrates in a suit bought for him on a day out with his case worker, hoping if he's jailed he'll be out before his 18th birthday. He's told his mum not to come - he doesn't want her to see him in the dock - but she calls incessantly. Magistrates give him a 12-month referral order - which means he will stay under the supervision of a youth offending team - and he calls a friend. ""Come get me - I didn't go down."" A year on and PC Preston says Yusuf's not been arrested or come to police notice since. He's still on the gangs matrix and will stay there until his criminal behaviour order ends next December. PC Preston says officers will visit him once a month to check in and ""ask him how he's getting on."" ""He's enrolled in college - I believe he's attending regularly and doing well,"" he tells us. ""He seems to be turning his life around."" Some names in this article have been changed to protect the identity of contributors. Counting the kids in gangs Why are we talking about knife crime?

"The ""festive magic"" promised by the organisers did not materialise, according to angry visitors Families have demanded refunds from a ""shambolic"" drive-through Santa's grotto after queuing for hours. It opened on Friday night and promised a 1km (0.6 mile) sparkling light trail through the grounds of Taverham Hall, near Norwich. The event's Facebook page was later flooded with complaints about traffic chaos, ""creepy"" performers who scared children, and ""Poundland"" gifts. ""It was an absolute fiasco from start to finish,"" said visitor Louise Purdy. Organiser We Make Events has been approached for comment. People commenting on social media said they queued for up to three hours in rush-hour traffic, having bought tickets for a time slot. A Scrooge character prompted a warning on a parenting site after he gave one young visitor nightmares Many turned away with tired, upset children, with one parent stating: ""Would've been quicker to get to the North Pole."" Another said: ""Three very grumpy children and four disappointed adults down Â£110."" Some of those who did make it inside were unhappy with what had been billed as ""huge amounts of festive magic"". A ""scary"" Scrooge-like character prompted one mum to post a warning on a parenting site after her child had nightmares. Louise Purdy said she told her three-year-old son the inflatables were having a sleep Ms Purdy, who was there with her two-year-old and five-year-old nephews and son, aged three, said the whole thing was comically awful. ""We wanted the sparkle, the magic of Christmas, but I actually started laughing because I couldn't comprehend how rubbish it was. ""The Scrooge guy called us all mutants, said Santa has crashed his sleigh and the presents are in the mud, and there was a man in chains by a tree just staring at the car. ""It was creepy, but was meant to be for little kids. ""The light tunnel at the end wasn't even switched on and the Santa couldn't be less interested."" Another parent said: ""The gifts were rubbish, not even wrapped, just in brown paper bags and they were things probably bought in Poundland."" The Purdy family queued for almost two hours Kerry Prentice from Norwich, who paid Â£68 for three tickets, told BBC Radio Norfolk she left after 90 minutes having been told she would probably have to wait a further two hours. ""It was absolutely shocking. ""We wanted something really nice to do as a family, but it was appalling and we've had no response from the organisers."" We Make Events is yet to respond to complaints but has issued a statement asking visitors to adjust their route ""to ease traffic worries"".

"A fourth tier of coronavirus restrictions is expected to be introduced in London and south-east England, sources have told the BBC. There is also expected to be a tightening of the plans to relax the rules around households gathering during the Christmas period. The PM is to hold a press conference at 16:00 GMT as concerns grow about the spread of a new variant of the virus. Boris Johnson hosted a cabinet meeting earlier to discuss what action to take. Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said government advisers ""consider the new strain can spread more quickly"". He will join the prime minister and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, at the press conference. England's current three-tier system of coronavirus measures has faced criticism for not being effective in stopping the surge in cases. Boris Johnson 'hoping to avoid' national lockdown NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' UK's R number back above one The first ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland held talks with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove earlier. Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon, who will hold a press conference later,tweeted:,external""Cases currently at lower level in Scotland than UK - but preventative action may be necessary to stop faster spreading strain taking hold."" Welsh ministers are meeting to discuss ""serious concerns"",while Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Fostertweeted,externalthat the new variant of coronavirus prevalent in south-east England was ""very concerning"". Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced post-Christmas lockdowns. Covid rules were due to be relaxed across the UK between 23 and 27 December, with up to three households being able to meet. Any change of restrictions for London and the South East would not require MPs' approval in a Commons vote, as they are only held for England or UK-wide measures. It was just 72 hours ago that Boris Johnson was resisting pressure to cancel relaxations of restrictions over Christmas. He told a press conference cancelling the festive plans would be ""inhuman"". But concern has grown significantly in the last couple of days; both about the rising number of cases and the new variant of the virus disclosed earlier this week. Ministers met with their scientific advisers on Friday evening - and again on Saturday morning. Things have moved quickly in the last 24 hours. Sources have confirmed a new tier 4 will be introduced in London and the South East of England. That's likely to mean closure of non-essential shops and beauty salons. That's likely to have a significant impact of Christmas plans and what people can do in and around the capital. There are also conversations taking place in the devolved administrations about whether further restrictions are needed there too. Following concern about the rapid spread of a new variant, Prof Whitty said: ""We have alerted the World Health Organization and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding."" That came after advice from the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) - the expert committee that advises the government on pandemics. ""There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments although urgent work is under way to confirm this,"" Prof Whitty added. Chairman of Nervtag, Peter Horby, said they had not found the variant to be more severe but being easier to transmit meant it was harder to control. Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it was a big concern that the new variant seemed to be ""out-competing the other viruses very fast indeed"". He told the BBC News Channel: ""The really worrying thing from my perspective is that this was something we didn't know about at the beginning of this month and it appeared. And from what we hear, it is already becoming one of the dominant strains."" Asked if the transmission would move northwards, he said ""almost certainly"". Viruses do mutate - so this development should not come as a complete surprise. There's already been thousands of different variants of this coronavirus seen globally. There is nothing to suggest this one causes more serious illness or would impact the ability of the vaccines to work. But preliminary investigation suggests it is leading to faster transmission, according to the UK's chief medical adviser. That's clearly causing concern, especially ahead of Christmas when relaxing restrictions means there is more opportunity for the virus to spread. If the preliminary analysis is right it may well explain why infection rates started increasing in London during lockdown - something that has baffled experts. But as yet there has been no detailed data published on this so it is hard to know how clear that evidence is. What is certain, however, is that cases are rising in most quickly in the South East - and that is translating to more pressure on hospitals. While the numbers in hospital has remained stable in recent weeks across the north of England and the Midlands, the number of patients in hospital in the South East is rising, especially in London, which has seen close to a 50% increase over the past week. That in itself is not unusual - the first wave saw surges at slightly different times. What is happening in the South East could just be a repeat of that. But ministers and their officials are clearly not prepared to wait to find out with the country entering such a delicate and potentially risky period with the Christmas relaxations. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on the prime minister to set out ""what action he will be taking"" as the virus was ""out of control in parts of the country"". Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, said the government needed ""to respond to what is happening on the ground"" with hospital admissions rising. Health bosses have warned the NHS is under significant pressure, withnearly 90% of hospital beds in England full. Hospitals in Kent arepostponing non-urgent proceduresas coronavirus cases in the county rise beyond figures seen in the spring. Analysis suggests the R number - which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto -has risen above 1 in the UK. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

Meanwhile, tier three Covid rules have come into force for parts of southern England, meaning that 38 million people - more than two-thirds of the nation's population - are now subject to the toughest restrictions. The changes, which came into effect at 00:01 GMT, see Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Hertfordshire and parts of Surrey, East Sussex, Cambridgeshire and Hampshire join the list of areas now in the highest level of England's three-tier system. In tier three, pubs and restaurants must close and different households cannot mix indoors or in most outdoor venues. On Friday, the UK recorded a further 28,507 cases, along with 489 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

"Mark Drakeford earlier took part in a call with other UK leaders Welsh ministers are in emergency talks to discuss ""serious concerns"" over the spread of a new strain of Covid-19. First Minister Mark Drakeford took part in a call with representatives of the UK's devolved nations after a surge in cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas introduced tougher rules for Christmas, in response to rising cases. Tier four restrictionshave been announced for London and the south east of England. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said government advisers consider the new strain can spread more quickly. Cases of the newstrain have been confirmed in Wales.. In a tweet, Mr Drakeford said: ""I attended a four nation call earlier today to discuss serious concerns over the spread of a new Covid variant. ""I will chair a meeting of the Welsh Government Cabinet at 2pm today."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies called on Mr Drakeford to address the nation ""urgently"" over the rising case rates, and for an emergency recall of the Senedd. ""Given the speed of spread of this new strain and its presence in south Wales, it's clear Labour ministers are going to have to make some very difficult but swift decisions,"" he said on Twitter. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Q&A: Which rules are changing and when? The first minister had already announced a Wales-wide lockdown, with people being told to ""stay home"", which will begin on 28 December when the Christmas relaxation of rules ends. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warnedmore preventative action may be ""necessary""to stop the strain taking hold. The warning comes as scientists continue to evaluate the spread of the new variant in south-east England, where there are ""growing concerns"" about its transmission. The UK said it had now informed the World Health Organisation it had concluded the strain could spread more quickly. In Wales rules forwho can meet over Christmashad already been tightened, following a surge in coronavirus cases in communities in recent days. The Welsh Government had come under pressure from medical professionals who warned without an urgent lockdown before the festive periodcritical care would be ""unable to cope"". Three households can meet in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland between 23 to 28 December, following a UK-wide agreement. But in Wales this has been reduced to two households, with a further single person household allowed to meet with them, with the rule made law. Viruses do mutate - so this development should not come as a complete surprise. There is nothing to suggest it causes more serious illness or would impact the ability of the vaccines to work. But preliminary investigation suggests it is leading to faster transmission. That clearly is causing concern, especially ahead of Christmas when relaxing restrictions mean there is more opportunity for the virus to spread. It may well explain why infection rates started increasing in London during lockdown - something that has baffled experts. A total of 120,432 positive cases have been confirmed in Wales since the start of the pandemic, and3,046 people have now died with Covid-19. The most recent data shows that all of theUK's seven most infected local authoritiesare in Wales. Almost all health boards in Wales have now suspended some non-emergency services, as the demand on services increases. On Saturday, Swansea Bay Health Board, where the case rate stands at 877.1 per 100,000 of the population, warned emergency departments were extremely busy. The health board, which treats people in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, has urged people not to travel for Christmas but to ""stay home"" on messages on social media. Allow Twitter content?

"Mr FitzPatrick said earlier this week that he would continue doing his job despite calls for him to quit Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick has lost his job in government after Scotland recorded its highest ever number of drug deaths. The first minister has appointed Angela Constance as a minister to take charge of the response to the drugs crisis. She will be a full-time drugs minister, reporting directly to Nicola Sturgeon. Labour and the Liberal Democrats had been demanding Mr FitzPatrick's resignation and were preparing a vote of no confidence in him. Figures released this week showed that Scotland again had the worst drug death rate in Europe. The figures for last year showed that the number of deaths increased to a record high of 1,264 - double the number in 2014 and giving the country a death rate three and a half times higher than England and Wales. Scottish drug death rate 'indefensible' - Sturgeon Drug deaths in Scotland rise to record high Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts In a statement, Mr FitzPatrick said he had spoken to the first minister and agreed to leave government. He said the ""most heart-breaking and difficult problems"" he faced as public health minister were the harms and deaths caused by drug use. ""As the minister responsible for this area I, ultimately, take my responsibility,"" he added. ""It is clear that my presence as a minister will become a distraction, when we should be focused on achieving the change we need to save lives."" Ms Sturgeon thanked the Dundee City West MSP and added: ""While the time has now come to make a change in the public health brief, no-one should doubt Joe's hard work, dedication and sincerity. ""He will continue to champion the interests of his constituents at Holyrood, and I wish him well in the future."" She added that Angela Constance, a former social worker who worked with drug users and their families, would work alongside her as drugs minister to help people whose lives were affected by drugs. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that the drugs death figures were ""indefensible"" and that her government had to do more to stop people dying. Joe FitzPatrick was born in Dundee in 1967 and was educated at Whitfield High School. He originally studied forestry at Inverness College and worked for a spell for the Forestry Commission. His political career started when he was elected to Dundee City Council in 1999. He won the Scottish Parliament seat for Dundee West in May 2007, and went on to serve on the Holyrood finance committee and as convener of the local government and regeneration committee. He became minister for parliamentary business in September 2012 and in June 2018 he was appointed minister for public health, sport and wellbeing. Mr FitzPatrick has faced calls to resign since record drugs death numbers were published earlier this week. She also apologised to families who had lost loved ones, and admitted that they had been let down. Ms Sturgeon pledged to work with Mr FitzPatrick to ""to make sure we collectively accept this responsibility and take the actions required to fix the problem"". But she appeared to stop short of openly defending her minister from the criticism that has been directed at him over his performance in role. In his resignation statement, Joe Fitzpatrick said he ""agreed"" to leave the Scottish government. I am not sure there were other options available to him in his talks with the first minister. Nicola Sturgeon stood by him in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, when she said she would work with him to lead change. Today, she decided that change must include replacing the minister who has become the focus for the row over Scotland's rising drug deaths. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats were calling for him to be sacked and it's not clear he would have survived a possible vote of no confidence. The new minister, Angela Constance - who was reshuffled out of government two years ago - has personal experience of working with drug-addicted prisoners as a former criminal justice social worker. Ms Sturgeon hopes she can help to reduce drug deaths in Scotland, which have doubled during her time as first minister to more than 1,200 last year. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr FitzPatrick's resignation ""changes nothing"" and described the government's drug strategy as ""disastrous"". ""If this was about the shocking number of drug-related deaths this year, he would have gone on the day the numbers were released,"" Mr Ross said. He added: ""We urged the first minister to agree to our proposed Â£20m funding for rehabilitation but got no commitment. ""All the focus must be on the urgent public health crisis of Scotland's drugs deaths epidemic so we can finally start to reverse the tragic number of lives being lost from drugs."" Scotland's drug death rate is three and a half times higher than England and Wales Meanwhile, Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman, said it was right that Mr FitzPatrick had resigned and called on ministers to give Scotland's drugs deaths their full attention. ""Urgent funding is needed to boost access to treatment and residential rehab,"" she said. ""The Scottish government must get behind safe consumption facilities, like the voluntary service being run in Glasgow."" She added: ""This must be a turning point. The SNP has failed badly and Joe Fitzpatrick doesn't bear that responsibility alone. Our parliament can lead the world on progressive public health policies when we put our minds to it."" Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said Mr FitzPatrick's departure was ""inevitable"". He said: ""It doesn't ease the pressure on the Scottish government to make up for the terrible failures over the last 13 years on drugs policy. ""Change is needed and fast.""

Her warning followed a meeting of representatives from the UK's four nations to discuss the new strain. The Scottish cabinet was meeting on Saturday to discuss the situation. Boris Johnson has announced tougher Covid restrictions for parts of England and a more limited relaxation of Christmas household mixing rules.

In a news conference the prime minister saidthe new strain ""may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant"" although there was no evidence it was more deadly or led to a more severe illness. The World Health Organisation was notified of the UK's findings on Friday night. According to public health officials, the new variant - which has been identified and is known as VUI - was first seen in mid-September in London and Kent. By December, it had become the ""dominant variant"" in London. Mr Johnsonannounced tougher measures for London, south east, and eastern Englandwith the worst affected areas moved into a new fourth tier of restrictions.

"Stephen Redgewell's actions amounted to gross misconduct, an investigation found An Asian police officer is suing the Met Police for sexual harassment and discrimination after receiving ""hundreds"" of racist and sexist messages from a senior colleague. The woman said she felt ""groomed and violated"" after Stephen Redgewell sent her sexual images over two years. Det Sgt Redgewell represented her through his role as deputy general secretary of the Met Police Federation. The Met said it had ""zero tolerance"" for racist and sexist behaviour. 'Racist' policeman sent sexual images to colleague Black Met inspector 'racially harassed' by PCs Warning: This report includes racist and offensive language Mr Redgewell, now 54, resigned from the force in 2018 following separate reports that he had had sex with a ""dominatrix"" in the headquarters of the Met Police Federation. On Wednesday, an independent panel set up by the Met Police found he had pursued an ""inappropriate relationship"" with the female officer he was supporting about a work issue between 2015 and 2017. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said Redegewell behaved in a ""predatory manner"", following a three year investigation. The Met said, had he not resigned, he would have been dismissed for gross misconduct. Some of the messages sent by Mr Redgewell BBC News has seen dozens of the 2,000 text messages sent between Mr Redgewell and the officer, who cannot be named for legal reasons, which were examined as part of the IOPC's investigation. The messages were found to be sexual, anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic and sexist. Mr Redgewell had repeatedly sent the officer highly-sexualised photos of the comic book characters Catwoman and Batman, including a mask and ""raunchy mug"" with her name on it. In the exchanges, he described her as his ""Asian chippy bird"", a ""bossy Muslim woman"" and suggested she should leave her husband. ""I felt dirty, really dirty, like I literally had a lot of dirt on me,"" she told the BBC. ""I wanted to rip my skin out, it was disgusting. I felt so violated and degraded."" Mr Redgewell sent a fetishised picture of a woman dressed liked a baby to the officer The officer, who has post-traumatic stress disorder owing to a separate event while on the job, said she had become so ill her weight had plummeted to an unhealthy size. Mr Redgewell had been assisting her application for medical retirement as part of his role in the Met Police Federation, a staff association representing officers of senior rank. When she raised her ill health, he told her she had ""serious Stevie withdrawal symptoms"" and said she looked like an ""Asian babe drug addict"". On one occasion, Mr Redgewell replied saying he should buy her nappies and sent a fetishised picture of a woman dressed like a baby. The officer said in her police victim statement, seen by BBC News, that Mr Redgewell had used his high status in the police to ""groom me, manipulate me, use me and emotionally abuse me"". ""I always felt like I couldn't challenge him,"" she wrote. ""I felt trapped by him [and] imprisoned in this situation. He held a lot of power andâ¦made sure I knew it."" Mr Redgewell sent the victim a mask and ""raunchy mug"" with her name on it The woman, in her 30s, has since retired from the force and is taking legal action against the Met, including Mr Redgewell, over racial discrimination and sexual harassment. In her victim impact statement and claim, she accuses the force of not taking the messages seriously at the time and believed his behaviour had been allowed to continue because of ""internal corruption, racism, and homophobic support"". ""[They] had very strong, photographic and electronic evidence yet they sat on it for two months, ignoring me, and refusing to contact me,"" she wrote in her complaint. She had asked the police for safety measures to be put in place for her after Mr Redgewell had called her twice in the middle of the night, but says she was ignored. ""Throughout this whole process, I felt worthless,"" she wrote. ""It is no longer my shame or burden to carry, it is these people who facilitated this, it is for them to carry this."" Mr Redgewell repeatedly sent sexualised photos of the comic book characters Catwoman and Batman Lawrence Davies, of Equal Justice Solicitors, representing the officer, said: ""Despite excellent work by the IOPC, former sergeant Redgewell was permitted to retire by the Met Police prior to the gross misconduct hearing despite abusing his office by his horrendous harassment of our very vulnerable female client."" IOPC regional director for London Sal Naseem said Mr Redgewell had ""abused his position by behaving in a predatory manner"" and was now barred from the profession. ""This type of appalling behaviour corrodes the public's trust in policing and I have no doubt [it] will appal fellow officers, the wider policing community and members of the public,"" he said. Commander Paul Betts, of the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, said the force had a ""zero tolerance policy for any behaviour that is racist, sexist or homophobic"". The Met Police said it would be inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings and was awaiting a date for the final employment tribunal hearing.

"The herbal pill is advertised on websites and in-store as helping with Covid-19 Fake ""Covid-19 immunity boosters"" are being sold over the counter in London shops, a BBC investigation has found. Coronil, a herbal remedy from India, was found on sale in shops in predominantly Asian areas across the capital. Manufacturers Patanjali Ayurved claim the pills protect against ""respiratory tract infections"". Tests carried out for the BBC show the pills offer no protection from coronavirus. A lab test of the drug carried out by Birmingham University for the BBC showed the pills contained plant-based ingredients which cannot protect against Covid-19. Virologist Dr Maitreyi Shivkumar said the idea of ""boosting"" immunity makes no sense in terms of treating coronavirus. ""There are lots of nuances in how our immune system responds to the virus. We do not even know that heightening immunity helps,"" she said. ""It is unclear what Coronil is trying to do to the immune system."" Patanjali Ayurved is a multibillion-pound healthcare brand in India, founded by Acharya Balkrishna (left) and Baba Ramdev UK advertising rules,externalban references to Covid-19 and ""boosting immunity"". Similar claims are permitted in India, where Patanjali Ayurved has a large following. One shop in Wembley advertises Coronil as a ""Covid-19 immunity booster"" both in store and on its website. The BBC has located at least four other stores that sell the pills, claiming they treat Covid-19. One customer told the BBC: ""I take it because I'm 78. ""If I go out shopping I could catch coronavirus from anybody. That's why I take itâ¦ to protect myself."" There are no authorised health claims in the UK that any substance can ""boost"" immunity, according to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Claims to prevent, treat or alleviate the symptoms of coronavirus cannot be made without a product being licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA, which has not approved Coronil for any use, said: ""Appropriate action will be taken where any unauthorised medicinal product is offered or sold on the UK market."" Patanjali Ayurved founder Baba Ramdev claimed in June that Coronil had cured Covid-19 patients. ""Our medicine resulted in 69% of coronavirus patients testing negative after three days and 100% after seven days,"" he said. The Indian government has said Patanjali Ayurved can market Coronil as an immunity booster but not a cure. Patanjali Ayurved has now withdrawn its claim that Coronil is a cure for Covid-19. According to Full Fact, an independent fact-checking organisation, ""misinformation like this can cause harm to people's health and finances"".

"Relaxation of Christmas Covid rules scrapped for much of south-east England as tier four restrictions announced And people in England in tiers one to three can only mix indoors on Christmas Day Festive bubbles in Scotland and Wales also restricted to just Christmas Day PM says spread in cases 'being driven by the new variant of the virus' Wales brings forward lockdown to start from midnight Nicola Sturgeon announces travel ban between Scotland and rest of UK from Boxing Day Northern Ireland lockdown to start on Boxing Day A second vaccine is being rolled out in the US after regulators approved a jab developed by Moderna Italy has ordered a nationwide lockdown over much of the Christmas and New Year period Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Penny Spiller and Owen Amos We're going to wrap up our live coverage for the day. To find out how today's announcement will affect you, put your postcode into our lockdown look-uphere. For more details on England's new tier four, including what it means and who will be in it, readthis. Today's live page was brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Dulcie Lee, Owen Amos, Penny Spiller, Joshua Nevett, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Emily Young. Thanks for joining us. Weâre wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic shortly. Before we do, hereâs a reminder of the headlines on this, the 283rd day since the pandemic was confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the UK:  Elsewhere in the world: French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week We can bring you some business reaction to Boris Johnson's announcement of tier four restrictions in the south and east of England, including London. ""The consequences of this decision will be severe,"" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium said. She said the governmentâs ""stop-start approach"" to coronavirus restrictions has been ""deeply unhelpful"" for retailers ahead of the usually busy and lucrative Christmas period. Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce echoed Dickinson, calling on the government to ""address the economic consequences of its actions"". He said that retailers needed extra financial support to get through the winter and beyond. Federation of Small Businesses vice-chair Martin McTague said tier four restrictions would be a ""hammer blow"" to non-essential retailers. ""From shops to hairdressers, this would normally the one of the busiest times of the year,"" he said. ""Many will have bought extra stock and increased staff hours, now their takings are to disappear literally overnight."" Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said retailers had ""lost all confidence"" in the UK government's strategy for tackling coronavirus. ""The unrelenting closing and reopening of businesses is costing owners hundreds of thousands of pounds, and coupled with the erratic decision-making around restrictions, is rapidly destroying the ability of the sector to bounce back,"" he said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says moving the capital under tier four restrictions is ""a bitter blow for Londoners who were hoping to spend time with loved ones safely this Christmas"". ""This continued chaos and confusion could all have been avoided had the government not made irresponsible promises to the public and raised expectations about the Christmas period,"" he says. ""London faces its toughest Christmas since the war and the whole city will need to pull together to see us through this terrible period."" Mr Khan said implementing restrictions was not enough, and the government needed to increase testing capacity, provide greater financial support and make face coverings mandatory in all busy outdoor public spaces. As Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, explained in the press conference earlier, coronavirus infections and deaths have been rising rapidly since the start of December in the UK. There was a dip in November, when England went into a four-week lockdown, and restrictions remained tight in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But UK-wide infections have now gone back up to the levels seen in October, with more than 27,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed on Saturday. Another 534 deaths were also recorded in the UK on Saturday, up from 489 a day before. Those increases bring the UKâs total number of infections to 2,004,219 and deaths to 67,075, the latest figures show. That means the UK has the sixth-highest number of deaths and infections of any country in the world,according to tallies kept by Johns Hopkins University,external. There have been big changes announced to the Christmas rules for England, Wales and Scotland.  Read more details here Tier four restrictions will come into force from midnight tonight and will apply in all tier three areas across the south and east of England. In south-east England, the areas affected are: In the east of England, the areas affected are: Read more about tier four and what it meanshere. You can also check what the rules are in your areahere. Ms Sturgeon answers a question about people having to cancel Christmas plans. She says her ""message to everybody is: I'm desperately sorry"". She says it ""breaks my heart"", and acknowledges ""there will be heartbroken people listening to this right now"". She says this is a ""once in a century pandemic"" that ""we just have to get through"". She asks people to ""hunker down"" and repeats a line from Irish poet Seamus Heaney she used in the Scottish Parliament previously: ""If we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere."" Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter England, Scotland and Wales have all announced changes to their Christmas restrictions this afternoon, but at the moment there are no plans to change the rules in Northern Ireland. However, the first and deputy first ministers as well as the health minister have been holding various meetings today to discuss their response to the new variant of the virus. BBC Scotland's chief political correspondent Glenn Campbell asks Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon whether with hindsight she wishes she hadn't bothered to relax restrictions over Christmas. ""No,"" she says. ""I've always agonised over this. From the moment we announced relaxations... I've advised against using them unless absolutely essential. ""In my view they were only ever there in recognition of the fact that some people would find it impossible to leave loved ones alone"". She adds that she wouldn't have changed track ""if it wasn't for what I'd been told today about this new strain"". Ms Sturgeon says all of the Scottish mainland will move to level four restrictions from 26 December. Level four is the highest ofScotland's five levels- it stops households mixing, shuts pubs and restaurants and closes non-essential retail. Level four will last for at least three weeks. Schools will not resume until 11 January, with online only until 18 Janaury - apart from key workers' children and the most vulnerable. Ms Sturgeon says the new rules ""make me want to cry"". ""I know how harsh it is,"" she says, adding ""but this virus doesn't care about anything apart from spreading as far and wide as possible"". Her message, she says, is stay home and stay safe this Christmas. The planned five-day relaxation of Covid restrictions over the festive periodhas been cut back to just Christmas Dayfor the whole of Scotland â with advice to avoid any social mixing. Indoor mixing in a bubble in Scotland will be allowed to take place on Christmas Day only, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. ""We will allow Christmas Day to go ahead, but as we have said from the start, only use this flexibility if you really, truly need to,"" she says. ""Our advice is still not to meet indoors even on Christmas Day with other households if you can possibly avoid it."" A maximum of eight people from three households will be allowed to meet on Christmas Day, ""but again our advice will be to minimise those numbers as much as possible"", Ms Sturgeon says. Cross-border travel will no longer be permitted, but travelling within Scotland will be allowed on Christmas Day only.  Ms Sturgeon says there will be a strict travel ban from Scotland to the rest of the UK throughout the Christmas period. ""People from Scotland should not visit other parts of the UK, and vice versa,"" she says. International travel advice will be issued next week - but Ms Sturgeon strongly advises against it. Ms Sturgeon says if we don't act ""firmly and decisively"" to stop the new variant taking hold in Scotland, ""by January our NHS could potentially be overwhelmed"". Ms Sturgeon says there have been 17 cases of the new fast-spreading variant confirmed in Scotland - but, she says, that is likely to be an understatement. It may be at low levels, but it does pose a real risk, she says, ""if we do not act and act firmly"". She says Scotland must act ""firmly and deceisvely now, or it will take hold"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has taken to the podium for her press conference. She says the new variant of the virus means ""very firm preventative action is now necessary"", adding that this is ""probably the most serious and potentially most dangerous juncture"" since the beginning of the pandemic. The prime minister held a Covid briefing at Downing Street a short time ago. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key announcements: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says ""millions of families will be heartbroken by having Christmas plans ripped up"", after this evening's announcement by the prime minister. Sir Keir says he was frustrated as he had raised the issue of Christmas with Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, where the prime minister told people to have ""a merry little Christmas"". The Labour leader says ""today's announcement will only lead to confusion when people need certainty"" and called on the government to display ""decisive leadership"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is about to give a news conference. There was earlier a call between leaders of all four UK nations, after which Ms Sturgeon held a meeting of the Scottish cabinet. The first minister will be joined at the news conference by interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith and national clinical director Jason Leitch.

"A US judge in Michigan has ruled that a 42-year-old man can seek compensation from his parents for destroying his pornography collection. David Werking, who was living with his parents following a divorce, sued them over the items, which he claims were worth over $25,000 (Â£18,500). His parents argued that they told Mr Werking to not bring the items home. The judge said that, even as landlords, Mr Werking's parents had no right to dispose of items owned by their son. Mr Werking had lived with his parents in Grand Haven, Michigan, for 10 months after his divorce, but moved out in August 2017.  He now lives in Indiana. He said he had left his extensive and ""irreplaceable"" collection of magazines and films at his parents' house when initially moving out, and later discovered they were missing,the Holland Sentinel newspaper,externalreported. The parents said they were not willing to help move the items to Indiana and did not want them in their home. Mr Werking filed the lawsuit arguing the items were illegally destroyed in April 2019. Emails between Mr Werking and his father stated that the items included 12 full boxes of ""pornography plus two boxes of sex toys"", according to the Sentinel. Mr Werking said there were over 1,600 DVDs and tapes. In one, Mr Werking's father told him he did him a ""big favour by getting rid of all this stuff"". Following the verdict, an attorney for the parents said she was working to determine the damages, and had hired an expert from the Erotic Heritage Museum in Nevada to help with the process.

"The UK and EU continue to negotiate as talks on a post-Brexit trade deal enter another critical 48-hour period. Talks in Brussels are understood to be focused on how many years it will take to phase in new fisheries arrangements. With the two sides at odds over access to UK fishing waters and quota levels, the EU's negotiator said the ""moment of truth"" had arrived and there were ""only a few hours left"" to seal an agreement. Boris Johnson has vowed to keep talking but warned gaps had yet to be bridged. Senior MEPs in the European Parliament have said they will not be ""rushed"" into signing off a deal on their side and want to see the text of any agreement by Sunday if they are to approve it by the end of the year. The UK will stop following the EU's trading rules in less than two weeks time. If there is no agreement by 1 January, the two sides will rely on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to govern exports and imports, which could see charges introduced on goods being sold and bought - and could lead to an increase in prices. Brexit: Can the talks be extended? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Speaking in the European Parliament on Friday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""the moment of truth"" for the talks and while there was still a ""chance"" of a deal, the ""path was very narrow"". Earlier, he met fishing ministers from EU states to discuss the continuing divisions over the issue. This video can not be played Michel Barnier says negotiations have ""just a few hours"" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our door is open"" for post-Brexit trade talks The two sides have been at odds over the length of time it will take to introduce new arrangements once the UK leaves the bloc's Common Fisheries Policy. Tony Connelly, RTE's Europe editor, said: ""I think we are really in the final stages because it looks like they are just now talking about fish, perhaps state aid as well, but all of the issues have been boxed off and we are now in final hours focusing on fisheries."" Mr Connelly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although fishing only makes up a small part of the UK economy, for fishing communities in Europe, it is a ""moment of real pain."" ""They have built up an industry, they have invested in boats and they've had access to these waters for decades, if not centuries and it has been taken away from them and they have not real say in the matter, they had no part in the vote - so feelings are running pretty high,"" he said. He added that while both sides would like to come to an agreement this weekend, ""I don't think either side wants to be pressurised into last minute concessions they will regret later."" What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? The UK, led by its chief negotiator David Frost, has insisted its sovereign rights over its waters must be respected from day one and its fleets must be able to keep a much larger share of their own catch. The EU is insisting on a much longer transition period, with guarantees on access and how catches are distributed. Mr Barnier warned on Friday that if the UK wanted to reduce access for EU fishing vessels then it would ""maintain its sovereign right"" to impose new conditions on UK firms' access to its common market for goods. In response, Mr Johnson said the UK side was willing to keep talking but things were looking difficult and urged the EU to ""come to the table"" with new proposals that recognised the UK's autonomy. Why, you might ask, if the EU's priority in negotiations was to protect the single market, is Brussels allowing the issue of fish to endanger the whole deal? The level playing field is worth a lot more in monetary and political terms to the bloc, but it sounds quite abstract to voters. However, fishermen and women losing their jobs, industries dwindling... that would be very visible, very quickly, elevating the importance of fishing rights. It is in coastal countries where governments fear a public backlash if it's perceived they've sacrificed national fishing communities for a deal with UK. Although the majority of EU members are not coastal nations, and although everyone in the bloc would love to finally put this deal to bed - for political and financial reasons, as well as being plain fed up with the process - the EU as a whole won't try to force member states to sign up if they are unhappy. Michel Barnier spoke to EU coastal countries on Friday to try to find a compromise position but, because of the ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" mantra of negotiations, the EU mood is less optimistic about prospect of imminent breakthrough than it was two days ago. The two sides are reported to have made progress in recent days on the issues of fair competition and what to do if the UK is deemed to get an unfair competitive advantage by moving away from EU rules and standards. If a deal is reached between the two sides, it would need to be agreed by parliaments in the UK and the European Union's member states. UK MPs have now finished for the Christmas break, but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said on Thursday that they could be called back to ratify a deal in the coming days, were one to be agreed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit?

"Ministers have met to discuss how to contain the rising number of coronavirus infections in England. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""hoping to avoid"" another national lockdown in England. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government needed ""to respond to what is happening on the ground"" with hospital admissions rising. Meanwhile, millions more people in southern England are now living under the toughest Covid restrictions. Government scientists are continuing to evaluate the spread ofa new variant of Covidin south-east England as there are ""growing concerns"" about its transmission. Hospitals in Kent arepostponing non-urgent proceduresas coronavirus cases in the county rise beyond figures seen in the spring. Boris Johnson 'hoping to avoid' national lockdown NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' UK's R number back above one Ewan Birney, deputy director general of European Molecular Biological Laboratory, said the new Covid variant had been growing ""very strongly in the south of England"" but it was not possible to say definitively that it was transmitting faster than others or whether it was because the number of cases in general was growing. However, he added most scientists ""think it is going faster - that it really is a property of the virus"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I must stress how complicated it is to work out, in a situation where things might be growing for other reasons, to really put your finger on that it's actually the virus which is doing it but the evidence is pointing in that direction."" On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancocksaid the variant may be associated with the faster transmission of the virus in the South Eastbut there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. Dr Birney said it was too soon to know whether the variant caused worse disease but scientists should start to get a good idea ""in a matter of weeks"", adding that other viruses had tended to mutate to become faster transmitters but less harmful. This video can not be played ""You don't have to cancel Christmas, just postpone it"", says Chris Lea, who's in hospital with Covid-19 Ministers met on Friday to discuss what action will be necessary to deal with the new variant, but a Downing Street source said the government is ""not there yet"" on rethinking Christmas plans. The decision by all four UK nations to relax restrictions and allow more household mixing for five days over Christmashas prompted concerns about a further surge in case numbers. Analysis suggests the R number - which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto -has risen above 1 in the UK. Northern Ireland and Wales have both announced post-Christmas lockdowns, while the Scottish government has said ""all options"" remain on the table ahead of a review on Tuesday. Health bosses have warned the NHS is under significant pressure, withnearly 90% of hospital beds in England full. Mr Hunt, chair of Parliament's health select committee, told the Today programme that the current situation was ""very serious"" and if the government did change its mind about relaxing the rules ""we should certainly not condemn it as a screeching U-turn but the responsible thing to do in a pandemic when the facts change"". He cited two big developments - the new Covid variant and hospital admissions ""going up very, very sharply"" - adding that ""we have to look at the changing situation"". If ministers did not want to change the law, Mr Hunt said they should consider strengthening the guidance on social distancing, adding: ""It would be an enormous tragedy if we had a spike in deaths at the end of January/February because we took our foot off the pedal this close to having a vaccine."" Asked aboutreports that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could be approved for use in the UK by the end of the year,,externalMr Hunt said that would make ""a massive difference"". He said the UK had doses of the Pfizer vaccine to ""keep us going until the end of January"" but then there wouldn't be another shipment until March so having the Oxford vaccine in January would mean the UK could ""keep the rollout going at its current pace"". A spokeswoman for the UK regulator MHRA said its review of the vaccine was ""ongoing"". Should you see your family at Christmas? Which places are moving into tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Covid rules are due to be relaxed across the UK between 23 and 27 December, with up to three households being able to meet. But the prime minister has urged people to think about elderly relatives to ""avoid spreading the disease"" over the holiday period. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for Mr Johnson to ""toughen up over Christmas"", saying the Welsh government's decision to limit Christmas bubbles to two households - instead of three - was a ""step in the right direction"". Leon Danon - an epidemiologist who sits on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling which advises the government - has been trying to model the impact on the R number of various households getting together at Christmas. He told Today that modelling showed putting three households together had a ""pretty bad"" effect on the R value, however he said over the festive period this would be counterbalanced by schools closing and fewer people going to work reducing people's other contacts. Meanwhile, tier three Covid rules have come into force for parts of southern England, meaning that 38 million people - more than two-thirds of the nation's population - are now subject to the toughest restrictions. The changes, which came into effect at 00:01 GMT, see Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Hertfordshire and parts of Surrey, East Sussex, Cambridgeshire and Hampshire join the list of areas now in the highest level of England's three-tier system. In tier three, pubs and restaurants must close and different households cannot mix indoors or in most outdoor venues. On Friday, the UK recorded a further 28,507 cases, along with 489 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Official figures show Covid-19 cases have risen in the past week in England,driven by sharp increases in London, as well as rises in the South East and East Midlands.

"A fourth tier of coronavirus restrictions is expected to be introduced in London and south-east England, sources have told the BBC. There is also expected to be a tightening of the plans to relax the rules around households gathering during the Christmas period. The PM is to hold a press conference at 16:00 GMT as concerns grow about the spread of a new variant of the virus. Boris Johnson hosted a cabinet meeting earlier to discuss what action to take. Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said government advisers ""consider the new strain can spread more quickly"". He will join the prime minister and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, at the press conference. England's current three-tier system of coronavirus measures has faced criticism for not being effective in stopping the surge in cases. Boris Johnson 'hoping to avoid' national lockdown NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' UK's R number back above one The first ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland held talks with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove earlier. Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon, who will hold a press conference later,tweeted:,external""Cases currently at lower level in Scotland than UK - but preventative action may be necessary to stop faster spreading strain taking hold."" Welsh ministers are meeting to discuss ""serious concerns"",while Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Fostertweeted,externalthat the new variant of coronavirus prevalent in south-east England was ""very concerning"". Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced post-Christmas lockdowns. Covid rules were due to be relaxed across the UK between 23 and 27 December, with up to three households being able to meet. Any change of restrictions for London and the South East would not require MPs' approval in a Commons vote, as they are only held for England or UK-wide measures. It was just 72 hours ago that Boris Johnson was resisting pressure to cancel relaxations of restrictions over Christmas. He told a press conference cancelling the festive plans would be ""inhuman"". But concern has grown significantly in the last couple of days; both about the rising number of cases and the new variant of the virus disclosed earlier this week. Ministers met with their scientific advisers on Friday evening - and again on Saturday morning. Things have moved quickly in the last 24 hours. Sources have confirmed a new tier 4 will be introduced in London and the South East of England. That's likely to mean closure of non-essential shops and beauty salons. That's likely to have a significant impact of Christmas plans and what people can do in and around the capital. There are also conversations taking place in the devolved administrations about whether further restrictions are needed there too. Following concern about the rapid spread of a new variant, Prof Whitty said: ""We have alerted the World Health Organization and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding."" That came after advice from the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) - the expert committee that advises the government on pandemics. ""There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments although urgent work is under way to confirm this,"" Prof Whitty added. Chairman of Nervtag, Peter Horby, said they had not found the variant to be more severe but being easier to transmit meant it was harder to control. Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it was a big concern that the new variant seemed to be ""out-competing the other viruses very fast indeed"". He told the BBC News Channel: ""The really worrying thing from my perspective is that this was something we didn't know about at the beginning of this month and it appeared. And from what we hear, it is already becoming one of the dominant strains."" Asked if the transmission would move northwards, he said ""almost certainly"". Viruses do mutate - so this development should not come as a complete surprise. There's already been thousands of different variants of this coronavirus seen globally. There is nothing to suggest this one causes more serious illness or would impact the ability of the vaccines to work. But preliminary investigation suggests it is leading to faster transmission, according to the UK's chief medical adviser. That's clearly causing concern, especially ahead of Christmas when relaxing restrictions means there is more opportunity for the virus to spread. If the preliminary analysis is right it may well explain why infection rates started increasing in London during lockdown - something that has baffled experts. But as yet there has been no detailed data published on this so it is hard to know how clear that evidence is. What is certain, however, is that cases are rising in most quickly in the South East - and that is translating to more pressure on hospitals. While the numbers in hospital has remained stable in recent weeks across the north of England and the Midlands, the number of patients in hospital in the South East is rising, especially in London, which has seen close to a 50% increase over the past week. That in itself is not unusual - the first wave saw surges at slightly different times. What is happening in the South East could just be a repeat of that. But ministers and their officials are clearly not prepared to wait to find out with the country entering such a delicate and potentially risky period with the Christmas relaxations. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on the prime minister to set out ""what action he will be taking"" as the virus was ""out of control in parts of the country"". Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, said the government needed ""to respond to what is happening on the ground"" with hospital admissions rising. Health bosses have warned the NHS is under significant pressure, withnearly 90% of hospital beds in England full. Hospitals in Kent arepostponing non-urgent proceduresas coronavirus cases in the county rise beyond figures seen in the spring. Analysis suggests the R number - which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto -has risen above 1 in the UK. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

"The explosion at the Sanko University Hospital caused a fire, which authorities said was quickly extinguished Nine people have been killed after an oxygen ventilator exploded at a hospital treating coronavirus patients in southern Turkey, officials say. The blast caused a fire in the intensive care unit of the private Sanko University Hospital in Gaziantep, the local governor's office said. At least one of the patients died while being transferred to another hospital. Turkey has recorded nearly two million coronavirus cases,externaland 17,610 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. No injuries were reported in relation to the fire, which occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning and was quickly put out.

The jab manufactured by US corporation Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech SE requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. Like the Pfizer jab, the Moderna vaccine also requires a second booster shot. Moderna's second injection comes 28 days after the first, compared with 21 for Pfizer. Moderna is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and had previously said that the ""vast majority"" of its doses would be manufactured there. Pfizer/BioNTech is being manufactured in several countries, including Germany and Belgium.

New York nurse Sandra Lindsay was among the first people in the country to receive a coronavirus vaccine when the Pfizer/BioNTech rollout began on Monday. Footage of her being vaccinated was streamed on the Twitter feed of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state was the epicentre of the US epidemic in the first wave earlier this year.

The jab manufactured by US corporation Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech SE requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. Like the Pfizer jab, the Moderna vaccine also requires a second booster shot. Moderna's second injection comes 28 days after the first, compared with 21 for Pfizer. Moderna is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and had previously said that the ""vast majority"" of its doses would be manufactured there. Pfizer/BioNTech is being manufactured in several countries, including Germany and Belgium. Other countries have also ordered the Moderna vaccine: Canadaplans to get two million doses by March - part of a total 56 million doses TheUKhas already pre-ordered seven million doses TheEuropean Unionlast month announced a contract to purchase of 80 million doses - with an option to purchase up to 80 million more - once the vaccine is deemed safe and effective Japanhas signed up for 50 million doses,South Koreafor 20 million, andSwitzerlandhas ordered 7.5 million, according to data compiled by the Duke University Global Health Innovation Center The US vaccination programme aims to reach 100 million people by April. New York nurse Sandra Lindsay was among the first people in the country to receive a coronavirus vaccine when the Pfizer/BioNTech rollout began on Monday. Footage of her being vaccinated was streamed on the Twitter feed of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state was the epicentre of the US epidemic in the first wave earlier this year. ""I hope this marks the beginning of the end of a very painful time in our history. I want to instil public confidence that the vaccine is safe. We're in a pandemic and so we all need to do our part,"" Ms Lindsay said. This video can not be played The day the US began Covid vaccinations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines submitted to US states say healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well Americans living in long-term care homes. Essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientist of federal vaccine distribution programme Operation Warp Speed, says the young and healthy should be at the back of the queue. At least 70% or 80% of the US population need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, he said. In a statement on Friday, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said he hoped that ""all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them"". ""That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward,"" he said. This video can not be played US Vice-President Mike Pence:  ""I didn't feel a thing"" Earlier,Vice-President Mike Pence received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine live on television, with the White House saying the aim was to ""promote the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and build confidence among the American people"".

"The River Towy at Carmarthen flooded on Saturday A landslip at a coal tip is being investigated by engineers following heavy rain. Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said about a 40-50m section had slipped at Wattstown, although he did not believe it posed a risk to the nearby Rhondda bypass.

"Jane Griffiths and her family have been hit hard by the pandemic A mother says one of her children has been asking if he is going to die, as a survey shows almost half of children are struggling with anxiety. Jane Griffiths, 47, said her four children had all been affected by the stress of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes as research for a children's charity showed more than half of children believe their parents are worried about making Christmas nice. More than a third were worried about getting Covid-19 and dying. Of the 1,000 children asked, 47% said they were experiencing anxiety. Coping with coronavirus anxiety How to explain coronavirus to very young children Why are people having lockdown nightmares? Ms Griffiths, from Connah's Quay in Flintshire, said her children's stress increased after her husband Deion lost his job at the local paper mill and money became tight. ""My husband was laid off and we weren't entitled to furlough because he was with an agency,"" she said. ""It has been difficult... you have to cut back and not take the children to as many places. ""They know they won't get the same [for Christmas]. ""Christmas is all about family anyway. That's the main thing."" Brigitte Gater, director of Action for Children Wales which conducted the research with YouGov, said the pandemic has plunged new families into poverty. ""Where children were used to seeing their parents going to work, that new wave of parents are spending their first Christmas on Universal Credit and really struggling with making ends meet,"" she said. ""Making sure that there's toys, presents, Christmas is going to be ok, at the same time as utilities, rent having to be paid, so there's a lot of anxiety about eviction and borrowing money over this time, just to make it a nice time for children. ""Some of the parents we surveyed said that if they could, they would cancel Christmas this year."" Father Dominic Cawdell runs a weekly food club which also helps buy Christmas presents for children Father Dominic Cawdell, of St Peter's Church in Holywell, runs a weekly food club where people can buy up to 15 items for Â£2 and helps find Christmas presents for children. He said people were ""anxious about getting sick, they're anxious about their children getting sick, they're anxious about their finances because many people who only work occasionally or whose work isn't particularly secure haven't been able to take advantage of government schemes"". ""Children are amazingly perceptive and they pick up on their parents' anxieties... it's even bigger for them, they don't understand it, they just know their whole world has changed,"" he added. Anita Igbinoba lost her job in a holiday camp as a result of the pandemic One of the food club customers, Anita Igbinoba who has two young daughters, said there was a lot of worry in her household after her job in a holiday camp ended. ""Panicking, pressure, children asking... I can't get them as much, they feel the anxiety and the pressure of it. It is upsetting really,"" she said.

"The New York Times has returned an award and had another withdrawn after it found discrepancies in its podcast on the Islamic State group. After a two-month investigation, the newspaper said the podcast, Caliphate, failed to meet its editorial standards. In the 2018 series, Shehroze Chaudhry, one of its central figures, claims he travelled to Syria and joined IS. But the Times said on Friday that it found ""a history of misrepresentations"" about his involvement with the group. As a result, it hasreturned a Peabody Award,externalfor the podcast.The Overseas Press Club said it had also rescinded its Lowell Thomas Award,externalgiven to the show's producers. 'How I survived an IS massacre' How do countries deal with people returning from IS? Is Islamic State defeated? Is Africa the new jihadist battleground? Dean Basquet, the Times' executive editor,said in a podcast on Friday that ""this failing wasn't about any one reporter,external. I think it was an institutional failing."" The podcast's host Rukmini Callimachi - a four-time Pulitzer Prize finalist - has been reassigned from her duties covering terrorism. In a statement on Twitter, Ms Callimachi apologised for ""what we missed and what we got wrong."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The paper began its review of Caliphateafter Pakistan-born Mr Chaudhry was arrested by Canadian police in September, and charged with hoax-terrorist activity. The Canadian broadcaster CBC used his alleged IS name, Abu Huzaifa al-Kanadi, in a 2017 report, in which he described lashing a man with a whip as part of his duties for the violent Islamic group, but said he never killed anyone. IS once controlled swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq His account prompted a debate in Canada's House of Commons, when the opposition questioned why he was allowed to still live in the country. Then, in 2018, the New York Times aired an interview with Mr Chaudhry on the Caliphate podcast, in which he said he'd executed people for IS. But after its latest internal investigation, the Times said it had found ""no corroboration"" that he committed the atrocities he described. It said at least one photo posted on his social media, allegedly showing him in Syria, was a copy of widely available news photography, published by Russian news agency Tass. Other images had been posted on Twitter by Syrian anti-war activists years before his claim. According to the Times, Canadian and US officials have said they are confident Mr Chaudry is a fabulist,externalwho never travelled to Syria, and concocted stories to escape from his more mundane life in a Toronto suburb. Mr Chaudhry, who works at his family's restaurant in Oakville, near Toronto, has not publicly commented on the charge against him.

"Norton took over from Jonathan Ross, who left the BBC in 2010 Graham Norton told listeners it had been a ""privilege being part of your Saturday mornings"" as he bid an emotional farewell to Radio 2. The star will front a new show on Virgin Radio from January. At the end of his final Radio 2 programme, he said: ""Mostly, I need to say thank you to you, the listeners. ""It's been lovely sharing your lives and hearing your messages, and that's been the greatest joy of being on Radio 2, it really has."" He added 10 years had ""gone by in the blink of an eye"" and closed the programme by playing Reach by S Club 7. ""It has been a privilege to be part of your mornings,"" he said. ""I'm getting emotional now. Someone told me I'd get emotional and I said 'No I won't.'"" He joked that it made him feel better to ""think of the six flights of stairs"" he will no longer need to climb to reach the Radio 2 studios in Wogan House in central London. Norton is not leaving the BBC altogether, and will continue to front his BBC One chat show Earlier in the programme, Norton acknowledged it was ""the end of an era"", and read out messages from listeners who said they would miss him. The chat show host then joked: ""Just bear in mind, as you're doing your sadness, when I leave here today I'm leaving in a taxi not a hearse. We're OK. I'll still be in the world. I just won't be here. That's all."" Norton has signed a three-year contract with Virgin, which will see him present on both Saturday and Sunday mornings. Radio 2's Saturday morning slot, one of the most high-profile on the station, will be taken over by Strictly Come Dancing co-host Claudia Winkleman. BBC Radio 2 confirmed in November that Norton would be leaving at the end of the year - an announcement which took his listeners by surprise. In fact, Norton had only made the decision himself in the preceding few weeks, after a chance encounter with his old colleague, Chris Evans. Chris Evans has presented Virgin's breakfast show for nearly two years In late September, Norton was gearing up for the release of his third novel, Home Stretch. He gave numerous interviews to promote the book, including to Radio 4's Front Row and ITV's Lorraine Kelly. But he was also booked for an interview with Evans, who had himself left Radio 2 for Virgin in 2018. Their conversation would change the course of Norton's radio career, as herecalled recently on The High Low.,external ""I did an interview with Chris Evans on his breakfast show,"" Norton explained, ""and he was sort of teasing me saying, 'You should come to Virgin'. And the studios were lovely, you can see my house from the studio, and I thought, 'Oh actually, this is very nice here, and Chris seems so happy'. ""Then Virgin got in touch, and they mooted this idea of doing SaturdayandSunday. And I always thought on Radio 2 that it would be good to be stripped across the weekend. And I think in a way, at my age, I was so flattered that someone wanted me, and it just seemed exciting to have a new challenge."" One side effect of the move is that Norton will drop down the BBC's star salaries list, which is published every summer as part of the corporation's annual report. The star haspreviously saidthe publication is ""not nice or comfortable"" for those on it. Graham Norton took over the Saturday morning slot in 2010 Norton has presented his Radio 2 programme, broadcast between 10:00-13:00 on Saturdays, since October 2010. The slot is one of the most high profile on the station, attracting more than four million listeners, and traditionally hosted by a big name. The Irish presenter replaced Jonathan Ross, who left the BBC after the ""Sachsgate"" scandal. But, Norton explained at the time, he was initially reluctant to host the programme. ""I didn't want to take over from Jonathan,""he told the Media Talk podcast,external, ""because I think Jonathan is brilliant and I loved that show, and that's what I said to them. And they explained, 'That's all very well, we get that, but if you turn this down now, this job doesn't come up very often. The last time it was 10 or 12 years ago, so you will regret turning this down'."" It was a fair point; Ross had presented the show for 11 years. And unlike youth-orientated stations such as Radio 1, which rotate their DJs quite regularly, presenters on Radio 2 tend to bed in for the long haul. Norton gave in after some persuasion and has now hosted his Radio 2 programme for a decade, although Alan Carr and Melanie Sykes normally sit in during his extended summer break. The show has a very different identity to his BBC One chat show. On Radio 2, there's room for longer, more thoughtful, interviews, and while Norton's red sofa is reserved for Hollywood A-listers telling funny showbiz stories, you're more likely to hear in-depth interviews with authors and theatre stars on his radio programme. Actress and presenter Maria McErlane co-hosts the Grill Graham feature In addition to the music and celebrity guests, the enduring popularity of Norton's show owes much to his weekly agony aunt feature, Grill Graham. For this, he is joined by his superb co-host and long-time friend Maria McErlane. Their pairing is a masterclass in on-air chemistry and a firm favourite with listeners. Members of the public write in each week with a personal problem, and Norton and McErlane offer their advice before asking listeners to send in their own solutions. Reflecting on his favourite letters recently, Norton said: ""I either like them to be so stupid that you get annoyed by the person that's written in, like, 'Really? In the world we live in,that'sthe thing that motivated you to write in and ask for advice?' So I like those ones, 'My kitchen cupboard handles are funny' or something. ""And then I like the really devastating ones,"" he continued. ""I remember one week we got a woman who had a terminal diagnosis, she was going to die, and she was looking for advice about telling her children and also spending time with her children in the time that she had left. ""What I loved about it wasn't that we got to give advice, it was the outpouring of support from the Radio 2 listeners, who are, by and large, a very nice bunch. So I was reading out advice from people who had been through similar things... and just sobbing on the radio."" On Saturday's final programme, McErlane said listeners had shared their ""maddest, funniest, craziest and saddest problems with us, many of which will stay with me and Graham for a long time"". McErlane has since announced she is moving to Virgin with Norton. Norton isn't as keen on all music on Radio 2 as he was on Chrissie Hynde, who he interviewed in 2017 Some of the most glorious moments of Norton's Radio 2 show have come when he is simply riffing off the music he's just played. While Virgin, on the whole, plays rock and indie music, the wildly varying genres on Radio 2 have often prompted humorous asides from the 57-year-old. After playing Billie Eilish's Bad Guy last month, a dark, bass-heavy and haunting song, Norton remarked: ""That just screams Radio 2 doesn't it? Carol celebrating her 70th birthday will have really enjoyed that."" ""This is new from Ty Dolla $ign.You know, Ty Dolla $ign?!"" he joked on another occasion, knowing the hip-hop singer would likely be alien to the Radio 2 demographic. ""Let's just appreciate the magic dust that Ty Dolla $ign spreads on everything he does."" While introducing All Day And Night by Jax Jones, Martin Solveig and Madison Beer, Norton wondered aloud: ""Why does it take SO many people to make a record these days?"" His honest and often sarcastic comments usually reflect perfectly what his audience is thinking, and are a key part of his enduring appeal. Radio 2's mixture of new songs, classic songs, specialist music and the presenter and producer's own choices have provided lots of material for Norton to have fun with over the years. Claudia Winkleman will take over the Saturday morning slot on Radio 2 Norton's producer, Malcolm Prince, told us it had ""been a fascinating and entertaining 10 years"", highlighting the show's outside broadcasts from Azerbaijan (for Eurovision), New York, and inside the Tardis. ""But Graham was always happiest in the studio at Wogan House where he could be himself,"" said Prince. ""No matter how starry his guests have been, he always made them sound almost like one of us. It's been a privilege to produce Graham's show and, just like his millions of listeners, I'll miss his Radio 2 programme."" As we all will. But Norton is looking forward to doubling his airtime with Virgin, as he told Evans during a more recent interviewon the How To Wow podcast,external. ""It will be interesting to find out who that Sunday audience is,"" he said, ""because on Saturdays you get a sense that people are listening as they do things - they're ferrying kids, they're waiting outside a supermarket, whereas Sunday, I feel people are probably in their house more, they're reading the newspapers, they're getting lunch, but the radio is on. ""So I think that will be fun to have that six hours with people over the weekend, and you can carry things over from the Saturday. Those are opportunities that I didn't have before.""

"A decision on whether stricter measures should be imposed after 27 December will be taken on Tuesday Scotland's health secretary has said all options remain on the table for Covid lockdown rules after the five-day Christmas easing period ends. There has been speculation that some areas of the country could have tighter restrictions imposed after 27 December. Jeane Freeman said nothing could be ""sensibly ruled out"" at this stage - with a decision due on Tuesday. She was speaking as three council areas prepared to move to a higher level of restrictions. Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian will all move from level two to level three of Scotland'sfive-tiered system,externalfrom 18:00 on Friday. It means they will face stricter rules on movement, leisure and hospitality. Boris Johnson 'hoping to avoid' national lockdown Should you see your family at Christmas? What level of restrictions is your council in? The changes were announced on Tuesday, with the country's other 29 council areas remaining in their current levels. The move to level three means 500,000 people across the three areas will no longer be allowed to travel outside their own local authority boundaries unless it is classed as essential. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to completely stop serving alcohol, and must shut at 18:00. Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades will also have to close, and indoor exercise, including gyms, will be restricted to individual workouts. Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian join 18 other councils in level three, meaning 80% of Scotland's population will now be under the level three restrictions. The Scottish Licensed Traders Association has warned that continual uncertainty over the levels was ""hugely unfair"" on businesses which were being expected to ""switch on and off like a tap"". It added: ""It's not just a case of opening the doors - premises have to order supplies and organise staff rotas. Many have already taken the decision to remain closed until 2021 because of this uncertainty."" The Scottish government is considering whether tougher lockdown rules should be imposed when the five-day Christmas easing period ends on 27 December. Cases of the virus are already increasing in some parts of the country, and are widely expected to spike in the new year as a result of the relaxed festive rules. Northern Ireland has already announced a new six-week lockdown from 26 December - while Wales will lockdown from 28 December, with reviews being carried every three weeks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""hoping to avoid"" another national lockdown in England but has admitted that Covid cases have already increased ""very much"" in recent weeks. Ms Freeman told the Scottish government's daily coronavirus briefing on Friday that the situation was currently better in Scotland, where she said hospitals were not under the same pressure as some other parts of the country. Pubs and other licensed premises in level three areas are not allowed to serve alcohol Ministers have previously said there will be no change to the current five-day period of more relaxed restrictions next week. But Ms Freeman said ""all options"" were still on the table after that, with a decision due to be announced on Tuesday. She added: ""I completely appreciate that everyone would love to know today what next week is going to be like. ""But it is not possible in the way that this virus operates, and the importance of looking really closely and carefully at the information we have and then using that to reach the best judgements we can make, for us to be able to do that at this point."" Christmas guidance to be toughened in Scotland What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? Prof James Chalmers, of the University of Dundee, toldthe BBC's Good Morning Scotlandhe believed the Scottish government should have ""reversed"" the decision to relax measures over Christmas - and that Scotland was ""on course"" for another national lockdown. He said: ""I think if we continue on the current course that we have high levels of cases across the UK and Scotland and then we have a relaxation over Christmas, we're looking at a spike in cases in early January. ""The only way we've seen over the last year to control a big spike is to have national lockdowns so I think we're heading in the direction of a lockdown unless there's a change in policy."" New analysis released on Thursday suggested that the R number - effectively the rate at which the virus is spreading in Scotland - was now between 0.9 and 1.1. This was an increase from the previous week's report, which estimated R to be between 0.7 and 0.9. Meanwhile, NHS Borders has also warned that a rise in cases meant the region's infection rates are""no longer consistent"" with level one restrictions. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm is currently Scotland's single largest source of renewable energy Scotland generated enough electricity from renewable sources last year to meet the equivalent of 90.1% of its total electricity consumption, according to latest figures. The Scottish government data for 2019 showed an increase of 13.4% on 2018 - meaning the country generated 30.5 TWh of electricity from renewable sources. That's enough to charge almost 6.7bn mobile phones for a year, or boil about 700bn kettles. The target is for 100% of the country's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by the end of 2020. And good progress is being made - in 2009, it was only 27.2%. But we won't know whether Scotland has met this target or not until more data is published next year. Although electricity only makes up part of the mix of the energy Scotland needs, the amount of energy produced in Scotland from renewable resources increased between 2017 and 2018 to 21.1%. The Scottish government said to decarbonise energy-intensive industries, heating buildings and transport, renewable electricity supplies would need to be further enhanced. By 2030, Scottish ministers want renewable energy generation to account for 50%,externalof energy demand across electricity, heat and transport. In order to achieve the target, Scotland has been moving away from burning fossil fuels, with the last coal-fired power station,Longannet, closing in 2016. The only remaining gas-fired power station is at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire. Can Scotland ever be 'the Saudi Arabia of renewables'? Onshore wind delivers about 70% of capacity, followed by hydro and offshore wind as Scotland's main sources of renewable power. Scotland's largest single source is the Beatrice offshore wind farm. Its 84 turbines - each with three 75m (246ft) blades - went into operation last year. The wind farm isis capable of generating enough power for 450,000 homes.,external The Seagreen Wind Farm, under construction off Angus, will eventually be even bigger andable to power 1.3m homes,external. This video can not be played What is climate change? While the pandemic has led to a temporary dip in greenhouse gas emissions, there is still requirement for fundamental changes in the way we live our lives in order to achieve net zero. Net zero means any emissions will be balanced out by schemes to offset an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - such as planting trees, or using technology to capture carbon and store it. So what are Scotland's climate change targets, and are they the most ambitious in the worldas has been claimed,external? The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target tocut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045, five years ahead of thedate set for the UK as a whole.,external The Scottish government says its targets are ""the toughest anywhere in the world"". They are certainly among the most ambitious. However, other countries -such as Sweden,external- have passed legislation with the same goal. Sweden did so two years before Scotland, and it has also set milestones along the way. But Scotland's milestone targets are more ambitious and include emissions from aviation and shipping. They also don't rely on international credits, which is wherecountries can pay for emissions to be reduced,externalelsewhere instead of reducing their own. Much progress has been made, but the hardest changes are still to come. Emissions of greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide - have been cut toabout half of what they were 30 years ago,external. Answers to your questions about climate change However,experts say,externalmuch of this progress has been accomplished by picking off the ""low hanging fruit"" - the most cost effective or publicly-acceptable changes to make. The areas that need tackling are transport (about a third of all emissions), farming and land use (about a quarter), business and heavy industry (about a fifth) and how we heat our homes. Tricky decisions will have to be made, especially with so much of Scotland's economy based around the oil and gas industry. A Scottish government-appointed commission is grappling with the question of how to protect the economy and ensure a ""just transition"" so oil workers and farmers don't lose out as the world moves away from fossil fuels. The commission has already published some advice to the Scottish government on how to make recovery from the pandemic greener. It saysimmediate actions that can be taken,externalinclude investing in warmer homes, supporting bus travel, and attaching green conditions to funding. This video can not be played Electric vehicles account for more than 2% of all cars and vans on the road in Orkney Transport accounts for about a third of Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions and some steps have been taken to reduce this but the overwhelming majority of vehicles on the road are still greenhouse gas-emitting petrol or diesel engines. The Scottish government has said,externalit wants to have ""phased out"" the need for new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and hopes to reduce the use of cars generally, with the number of kilometres driven to be reduced by 20%. There are now more than 1,500 publicly-available charge points in Scotland for electric vehicles and the number of new EV and hybrid cars registered in the UK was up nearly 40% on the same period last year. Should my next car be an electric one? But for many drivers an EV is prohibitively expensive and concerns over the range the cars can currently offer is a concern for some potential owners. Their popularity is expected to increase significantly as the technology gets better but this will see demand for electricity generation rise too. The UK government'sDepartment for Transport says,externalScotland now has more than 1,500 charging devices, and across the UK there are now more charging locations than petrol stations. Of course, this year has seen some huge changes to everyone's lives. During lockdown, the whole country was asked to stay at home unless leaving was essential. In Scotland, everyone who can work from home was asked to keep doing so. That has had a big impact on how often we travel, how far, and how we get to places - and as the number of Covid cases has risen, travel has dropped again. At the beginning of this month, compared with the same time last year,,externaltrain travel was down by 85%, air by 75%, concessionary bus travel by 60%, and ferry journeys by 55%. Despite the public being advised to avoid public transport where possible and not to car share, car journeys were still down by 25%. But the pandemic doesn't mean planning for a greener future has stopped. Low emission zones,externalthat will see polluting vehicles banned from entering city centres (and receive a penalty notice if they don't comply) are planned for Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Dundee but so far only Glasgow has introduced measures which only apply to 60% of buses that enter the zone. Because of the pandemic, implementing the low emission zones waspaused over the summer,external, but officials have vowed to see the changes through ""at the earliest possible time"". In a bid to discourage commuters from taking their cars to work, the Scottish government brought in theWorkplace Parking Levy. It allows councils to tax businesses on staff parking spaces but, so far, no councils have committed to introducing the levy this year. As well as cutting road transport emissions, the government needs to find a way to stop the growth in emissions from air travel. Since 1990, emissions from international aviation from Scotland have increased by 181% andthe latest data, from 2018,external, showed they were still increasing. The overall statistics have not been released yet to show the impact lockdown had on aviation emissions. But,according to the Global Carbon Project, the mass grounding of flights during the peak of the pandemic saw CO2 emissions from aviation reduced by up to 60%. The Scottish government has alsoscrapped plans to cut the amount of tax paid by passengers flying from Scottish airportsafter facing a backlash over the environmental impact. Electric-powered planes could be a solution to aviation emissions, but they are still at an early stage. Plans for the shortest scheduled flight in the world - the 1.7 mile jump between the Orkney islands of Westray and Papa Westray -to use an electric-powered planecould happen soon. The UN sayshigh consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming, and researchers based in Scotland have been investigating ways of reducing the environmental impact of farming. For example, one group of scientists has found a way ofreducing the methane produced by cattle,external. About 15% of Scotland's emissions come from domestic housing, with most homes (about 80%) still relying on gas central heating systems. Ministers have set a target,externalof having 50% of all new heating systems being installed to be zero-emissions models by 2025. Instead of gas, heating systems should use renewable energy, or rely on low-carbon alternatives such as heat pumps. And20,000 households have benefited,externalfrom better insulation and new, more efficient - although still often gas - heating systems, funded by the Scottish government. Trees are still the most effective way of absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. To meet targets, the UK needsa net increase of 32,000 hectares of woodland,externalplanted every year for the next 30 years - equating to about 1.5bn trees. Figures claim most of the trees planted in the UK were planted in Scotland -11,000 of the 13,700 hectares planted in 2019-20,external. By 2024,the Scottish government aims,externalto be creating 18,000 hectares of new woodlands per year, with the ultimate goal of having 21% of Scotland's land covered by forest by 2032 - compared to 19% today. But there's more to it than just planting trees- it's important that the right trees are planted in the right places, taking into consideration factors such as soil type, water levels, temperatures and the surrounding landscape and tree species.

"Norton took over from Jonathan Ross, who left the BBC in 2010 Graham Norton told listeners it had been a ""privilege being part of your Saturday mornings"" as he bid an emotional farewell to Radio 2. The star will front a new show on Virgin Radio from January. At the end of his final Radio 2 programme, he said: ""Mostly, I need to say thank you to you, the listeners. ""It's been lovely sharing your lives and hearing your messages, and that's been the greatest joy of being on Radio 2, it really has."" He added 10 years had ""gone by in the blink of an eye"" and closed the programme by playing Reach by S Club 7. ""It has been a privilege to be part of your mornings,"" he said. ""I'm getting emotional now. Someone told me I'd get emotional and I said 'No I won't.'"" He joked that it made him feel better to ""think of the six flights of stairs"" he will no longer need to climb to reach the Radio 2 studios in Wogan House in central London. Norton is not leaving the BBC altogether, and will continue to front his BBC One chat show Earlier in the programme, Norton acknowledged it was ""the end of an era"", and read out messages from listeners who said they would miss him. The chat show host then joked: ""Just bear in mind, as you're doing your sadness, when I leave here today I'm leaving in a taxi not a hearse. We're OK. I'll still be in the world. I just won't be here. That's all."" Norton has signed a three-year contract with Virgin, which will see him present on both Saturday and Sunday mornings. Radio 2's Saturday morning slot, one of the most high-profile on the station, will be taken over by Strictly Come Dancing co-host Claudia Winkleman. BBC Radio 2 confirmed in November that Norton would be leaving at the end of the year - an announcement which took his listeners by surprise. In fact, Norton had only made the decision himself in the preceding few weeks, after a chance encounter with his old colleague, Chris Evans. Chris Evans has presented Virgin's breakfast show for nearly two years In late September, Norton was gearing up for the release of his third novel, Home Stretch. He gave numerous interviews to promote the book, including to Radio 4's Front Row and ITV's Lorraine Kelly. But he was also booked for an interview with Evans, who had himself left Radio 2 for Virgin in 2018. Their conversation would change the course of Norton's radio career, as herecalled recently on The High Low.,external ""I did an interview with Chris Evans on his breakfast show,"" Norton explained, ""and he was sort of teasing me saying, 'You should come to Virgin'. And the studios were lovely, you can see my house from the studio, and I thought, 'Oh actually, this is very nice here, and Chris seems so happy'. ""Then Virgin got in touch, and they mooted this idea of doing SaturdayandSunday. And I always thought on Radio 2 that it would be good to be stripped across the weekend. And I think in a way, at my age, I was so flattered that someone wanted me, and it just seemed exciting to have a new challenge."" One side effect of the move is that Norton will drop down the BBC's star salaries list, which is published every summer as part of the corporation's annual report. The star haspreviously saidthe publication is ""not nice or comfortable"" for those on it. Graham Norton took over the Saturday morning slot in 2010 Norton has presented his Radio 2 programme, broadcast between 10:00-13:00 on Saturdays, since October 2010. The slot is one of the most high profile on the station, attracting more than four million listeners, and traditionally hosted by a big name. The Irish presenter replaced Jonathan Ross, who left the BBC after the ""Sachsgate"" scandal. But, Norton explained at the time, he was initially reluctant to host the programme. ""I didn't want to take over from Jonathan,""he told the Media Talk podcast,external, ""because I think Jonathan is brilliant and I loved that show, and that's what I said to them. And they explained, 'That's all very well, we get that, but if you turn this down now, this job doesn't come up very often. The last time it was 10 or 12 years ago, so you will regret turning this down'."" It was a fair point; Ross had presented the show for 11 years. And unlike youth-orientated stations such as Radio 1, which rotate their DJs quite regularly, presenters on Radio 2 tend to bed in for the long haul. Norton gave in after some persuasion and has now hosted his Radio 2 programme for a decade, although Alan Carr and Melanie Sykes normally sit in during his extended summer break. The show has a very different identity to his BBC One chat show. On Radio 2, there's room for longer, more thoughtful, interviews, and while Norton's red sofa is reserved for Hollywood A-listers telling funny showbiz stories, you're more likely to hear in-depth interviews with authors and theatre stars on his radio programme. Actress and presenter Maria McErlane co-hosts the Grill Graham feature In addition to the music and celebrity guests, the enduring popularity of Norton's show owes much to his weekly agony aunt feature, Grill Graham. For this, he is joined by his superb co-host and long-time friend Maria McErlane. Their pairing is a masterclass in on-air chemistry and a firm favourite with listeners. Members of the public write in each week with a personal problem, and Norton and McErlane offer their advice before asking listeners to send in their own solutions. Reflecting on his favourite letters recently, Norton said: ""I either like them to be so stupid that you get annoyed by the person that's written in, like, 'Really? In the world we live in,that'sthe thing that motivated you to write in and ask for advice?' So I like those ones, 'My kitchen cupboard handles are funny' or something. ""And then I like the really devastating ones,"" he continued. ""I remember one week we got a woman who had a terminal diagnosis, she was going to die, and she was looking for advice about telling her children and also spending time with her children in the time that she had left. ""What I loved about it wasn't that we got to give advice, it was the outpouring of support from the Radio 2 listeners, who are, by and large, a very nice bunch. So I was reading out advice from people who had been through similar things... and just sobbing on the radio."" On Saturday's final programme, McErlane said listeners had shared their ""maddest, funniest, craziest and saddest problems with us, many of which will stay with me and Graham for a long time"". McErlane has since announced she is moving to Virgin with Norton. Norton isn't as keen on all music on Radio 2 as he was on Chrissie Hynde, who he interviewed in 2017 Some of the most glorious moments of Norton's Radio 2 show have come when he is simply riffing off the music he's just played. While Virgin, on the whole, plays rock and indie music, the wildly varying genres on Radio 2 have often prompted humorous asides from the 57-year-old. After playing Billie Eilish's Bad Guy last month, a dark, bass-heavy and haunting song, Norton remarked: ""That just screams Radio 2 doesn't it? Carol celebrating her 70th birthday will have really enjoyed that."" ""This is new from Ty Dolla $ign.You know, Ty Dolla $ign?!"" he joked on another occasion, knowing the hip-hop singer would likely be alien to the Radio 2 demographic. ""Let's just appreciate the magic dust that Ty Dolla $ign spreads on everything he does."" While introducing All Day And Night by Jax Jones, Martin Solveig and Madison Beer, Norton wondered aloud: ""Why does it take SO many people to make a record these days?"" His honest and often sarcastic comments usually reflect perfectly what his audience is thinking, and are a key part of his enduring appeal. Radio 2's mixture of new songs, classic songs, specialist music and the presenter and producer's own choices have provided lots of material for Norton to have fun with over the years. Claudia Winkleman will take over the Saturday morning slot on Radio 2 Norton's producer, Malcolm Prince, told us it had ""been a fascinating and entertaining 10 years"", highlighting the show's outside broadcasts from Azerbaijan (for Eurovision), New York, and inside the Tardis. ""But Graham was always happiest in the studio at Wogan House where he could be himself,"" said Prince. ""No matter how starry his guests have been, he always made them sound almost like one of us. It's been a privilege to produce Graham's show and, just like his millions of listeners, I'll miss his Radio 2 programme."" As we all will. But Norton is looking forward to doubling his airtime with Virgin, as he told Evans during a more recent interviewon the How To Wow podcast,external. ""It will be interesting to find out who that Sunday audience is,"" he said, ""because on Saturdays you get a sense that people are listening as they do things - they're ferrying kids, they're waiting outside a supermarket, whereas Sunday, I feel people are probably in their house more, they're reading the newspapers, they're getting lunch, but the radio is on. ""So I think that will be fun to have that six hours with people over the weekend, and you can carry things over from the Saturday. Those are opportunities that I didn't have before.""

"Three quarters of employers want large firms to be forced to release data on the pay gap between staff of different ethnicities, a leaked report shows. The findings, seen by the BBC, came from a consultation exercise on ethnicity pay gap reporting launched by Theresa May in October 2018. The then PM promised to ""help employers identify the actions needed to create a fairer and more diverse workforce"". But two years later, the government has yet to respond. Labour has urged Boris Johnson to ""get on with it"", as it was clear the business community and unions backed the policy. The Business Department said it would respond to the consultation in due course. The document obtained by the BBC shows there were 321 responses to the consultation, including from 93 private sector employers, 42 public sector employers and 67 business organisations. Ethnicity pay gap for academics revealed Firms may have to reveal ethnicity pay gap Of these groups, 73% supported compulsory ethnicity pay gap reporting for organisations with more than 250 staff. A similar requirement is already in place for reporting of firms' gender pay gap, although it has been lifted this year because of coronavirus. A petition calling for the introduction of the policy gained more than 130,000 signatures earlier this year - meaning the issue should be debated in Parliament. Responding to the petition in July, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was still analysing the consultation and promised to respond by the end of the year at the latest. It highlighted what it called ""genuine difficulties in designing a methodology that produces accurate figures, that allows for interpretation and action from employers, employees and the wider public"". A spokesperson for the department said: ""We are working closely with businesses to consider what steps can be taken to build more inclusive workplaces."" Official guidance to departments carrying out consultations says the government should respond within 12 weeks of the consultation or provide an explanation for why this is not possible. Shadow women and equalities secretary Marsha De Cordova said: ""Labour has long been calling for the introduction of mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting. ""The business community and trades unions are all calling for it.  It is time the government get on with it as they are the only one behind the curve on this."" The consultation summary document seen by the BBC said respondents had mixed views on whether pay gap reporting should be between white and all black, Asian and ethnic minority staff, or a breakdown of ethnic groups. A number of businesses already voluntarily publish their data - including professional services firm Deloitte, whose latest figures show a 14.5% mean gap. Consultant Nadine Dyer, the chair of Deloitte's Multicultural Network, is working with leaders at the company to reduce inequality. ""As a black woman, it's not fair that I could be sitting next to someone in the office and they're earning more than me just because of the colour of my skin,"" she said. ""If you really think about it, it can be heartbreaking. I use that to drive me forward."" In October, 30 business leaders wrote to Boris Johnson calling for the mandatory duty to be introduced - saying ""we don't see it as a burden"". CBI president Lord Karan Bilimoria told the BBC the move ""makes business sense and it's the right thing to do"". ""What gets measured gets done,"" he said. ""Our members want to disclose their ethnicity pay gap because they know this is such an important issue ""If they address this issue, they will have companies that are more diverse, more inclusive, more profitable, more innovative.""

"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary. You cannot go to the pub with members of your Christmas bubble. In England, if you have formed asupport bubblewith another household, that counts as one household. In Scotland,guidance,externalsays any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"". People who are self-isolatingshould not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone has to self-isolate. Under-18s whose parents live apart can join two Christmas bubbles, so they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household. University students whotravel homewill be counted as part of their family household straight away. But if a family has three or more grown-up children not at university, they cannot all form a Christmas bubble with their parents, even in areas where mixing is still possible.
