""Inequalities are deepening and many of our people do not have the necessary securities of adequate housing, shelter, health, education, such securities and supports which would allow them to realise their rights and participate with equality."" ""A real republic requires a wide embrace, inclusive of all its members - in our case, all of our Irish from different generations including those who are abroad - and it must be generous in its reach,"" President Higgins added. ""We can and must be advocates for the inclusion of diverse peoples, traditions and belief systems in a peaceful world assisted by strong multilateral institutions, themselves supported by a deeper global consciousness, one derived from the irreducible rights of human dignity.""

"Mrs Leadsom was a prominent Brexit campaigner Any Brexit deal negotiated with the EU must not ""trap"" the UK in a customs arrangement it cannot choose to leave, Andrea Leadsom has told the BBC. The Brexiteer minister urged Tories to back the PM and said she was ""sticking in government"" to work for a good deal. But the UK must not be ""held against its will"" in any ""backstop"" aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border, she said. On Friday, pro-Remain minister Jo Johnson quit the government and called for a new referendum on the final deal. Asked if other ministers might resign, Commons leader Mrs Leadsom told BBC 5 live's Pienaar's Politics she was not expecting any, adding: ""I do urge colleagues to support the prime minister. ""We are at a very difficult stage. What we have to do is hold our nerve and keep negotiating, make sure that we are pointing out to our EU friends and neighbours that it's in all of our interests to get a good deal."" New referendum 'still an option' - Thornberry Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox The government has not yet agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union, ahead of the UK's scheduled exit from the bloc next March. While it says a deal is 95% agreed, they have been unable to agree on a legally binding mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if a future trade deal is not ready in time. Earlier shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberrytold the BBC""all options remain on the table"", including another referendum, if a Brexit deal was voted down in the Commons. Mrs Leadsom, who Theresa May beat to the Conservative leadership in 2016, said there would not be another referendum if MPs rejected the final withdrawal deal. But she said she believed ""most members of Parliament would vote for a deal rather than no deal"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If sufficient progress is made on the ""backstop"" it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit. One option is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border until a free trade deal is ready. But Leave campaigners want a clear exit strategy from any such arrangement - while the EU says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed. By BBC political correspondent Jessica Parker MPs on all sides are readily setting out their conditions and caveats when it comes to a potential Brexit deal. And while Andrea Leadsom made it clear that she still supports Prime Minister Theresa May, there was a hint too that she has her own red lines, saying that the UK must not end up trapped in an EU customs arrangement. This plays into wider fears in some Conservative quarters that Mrs May could end up accepting a compromise too far on the ""backstop"" issue, in order to get a withdrawal agreement with the EU over the line. Mrs Leadsom said while the backstop was not a ""likely scenario"" - because she believed a trade deal could be reached before it would be necessary - it must be ""time limited"" and ""include the entire UK"", rather than just Northern Ireland. And the UK must be able to decide to leave it - without the EU overturning that decision. She added: ""The UK cannot be forced to remain in a customs arrangement. Now how that specifically works is exactly what is being discussed and negotiated on now. The UK cannot be held against its will in a customs arrangement."" Earlier Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""If you have too hard a line about saying, 'Well we must just have a totally unilateral exit, or there's an absolutely fixed, hard end date,' that is... very, very unlikely that is going to be negotiable with the other side. ""On the other hand, people here rightly want comfort and they should be able to have comfort and confidence that it isn't an open-ended thing."" Meanwhile, General Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, was asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show what the military might be called on to do, in the event the UK leaves the EU with no withdrawal deal in place, saying ""we stand ready to help in any way we can"". Defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News the government had to plan for every scenario adding: ""There are contingency plans being made, there are discussions being held behind the scenes as to what support our armed forces will do."" Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union. If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the remaining EU member states.

"This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: 'I'm so scared right now... so terrified' California firefighters face a possible further spread of several huge fires and more damage as winds strengthen. A lull on Saturday allowed some containment of the blazes, in the north and south of the state, but officials warned residents to stay away as they could again spread very rapidly. A search for bodies continues in the devastated northern town of Paradise, where 23 people are known to have died. Two more people were killed in the southern fire, near Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. So far this year an area larger than Belgium and Luxembourg has burned, well above the average. California Governor Jerry Brown asked US President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster to boost the emergency response and help recovery efforts. In pictures: Wildfire rages in Malibu Watch: The long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly In a series of tweets in recent days, Mr Trump has drawn anger by saying that poor forestry management is to blame for the fires. But he has now extended his sympathies to those affected. The blaze known as the Camp Fire started spreading through Butte County on Thursday, and firefighters were powerless to stop it destroying the town of Paradise. Another fire swept into the affluent southern beach resort of Malibu on Friday and had doubled in size by Saturday. Many houses burnt down in Malibu Known as the Woolsey, it had burned more than 83,000 acres (33,500 hectares) by late that day. Among the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, wherea gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday. By James Cook, BBC Los Angeles correspondent In the ruins of Paradise teams are sifting through the ashes, trying to find and identify human remains. The town is no more - more than 6,400 homes were destroyed, in the most destructive wildfire in California's history - and one of the deadliest. Those who fled are desperate for information about their homes and loved ones. In total, 8,000 firefighters are now battling blazes in California. Air quality is atrocious - parents are being warned not to let children play outside. A quarter of a million people are under evacuation orders. The fire started in the Plumas National Forest, north of Sacramento, on Thursday and quickly engulfed the town of Paradise. Residents fled for their lives as more than 6,700 homes and businesses were destroyed, making the fire the most destructive in the state's history. The flames moved so fast that some had to abandon their cars and escape the town on foot. This video can not be played The Camp Fire has been fuelled by strong winds and dry forest It is also the state's third most deadly fire. Nine bodies were found in the immediate aftermath of the destruction, and the remains of another 14 were discovered in later searches. More than 110 people have been reported missing in the area, but officials are confident many of them will be found safe elsewhere. Images from Paradise have showed the sky filled with acrid smoke, almost blotting out the sun. By Saturday night, the Camp Fire had burned 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) and was only 20% contained. Winds of up to 40 mph (64 km/h) were expected on Sunday, and officials say the fire could take up to three weeks to be fully contained. The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. This video can not be played 'How much more can this town endure?' - deadly wildfire hits Thousand Oaks, where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting On Friday, the flames jumped Highway 101 and headed into coastal areas. All residents have been ordered to evacuate. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Chief John Benedict said on Saturday that two people had been found dead but provided no details on the deaths. Malibu and nearby Calabasas are home to many celebrities and some have been forced to flee, including Kim Kardashian West, Caitlyn Jenner, Lady Gaga and Guillermo Del Toro. Firefighters used a respite from strong winds on Saturday to drop fire retardants to strengthen fire lines. But officials warned against complacency, with winds of up to 70 mph expected over the next two days. They said fires could spread quickly and unexpectedly. ""Winds are already blowing. They are going to blow for the next three days. Your house can be rebuilt but you can't bring your life back,"" said Los Angeles County fire chief Daryl Osby. Meteorologist David Gomberg told the Los Angeles Times newspaper that fire tornadoes were possible. The president has previously blamed Californian officials for wildfires and threatened to withhold federal funding. In a tweet on Saturday, he again accused state authorities of ""gross mismanagement"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"As the number of people renting in the UK continues to rise, the BBC has taken a closer look at the state of private renting. The typical one-bed home in England costs Â£600 a month to rent, but this is skewed by soaring costs in London and hides a gaping divide across the country. In parts of Westminster, the average one-bed costs more than Â£3,500 per month. In Argyll and Bute, that sum could cover your rent for a whole year. Let's say you lived in a three-person house-share in SW4, Brixton, London. According to Hometrack, you could expect to pay around Â£767 per month, along with your two flatmates. With that money, you could comfortably rent a one-bedroom flat in Southend or Milton Keynes - both within commuting distance of the capital - all to yourself. In fact, you'd be able to rent a one-bedroom flat in 79% of British postcodes, including locations such as Bristol. Two-thirds of rental market 'unaffordable' for young people Is renting cheaper in the next neighbourhood? If you wanted a bit more space, you could get a two-bedroom home in 65% of Britain's postcodes for Â£767 or less. You could live in L1, in the heart of Liverpool, where rents for a two-bed property are around Â£751. For the same rent or less, you could also get a three-bedroom property in Leeds (LS8) with money to spare. Or, if Leeds isn't for you, around 50% of all British postcode areas have an average price of Â£767 or lower for a three-bed. If you're in particular need of space, for the same price as a room in a Brixton flat-share, you can rent an entire four-bed property to yourself in 410 postcode districts across the country - including in cities such as Birmingham, Newcastle and Swansea and Glasgow. Private renting has more than doubled over the past 20 years, and young people are by far the most likely age group to be renting. During the same period,home ownership among young adults has collapsed. In 1995-96, some 65% of middle-income 25 to 34-year-olds owned a home. Twenty years on just 27% do, with the biggest drop in London and south-east England. Renting a one-bedroom flat in England costs Â£600, yet buddy up with someone, and your share drops to Â£325. Find two flatmates, and you can get away with paying just Â£250 for a room in a three-bed home - less than half the cost of a one-bed flat. This will be no mystery to renters in cities such as London, where for many young people, flat-sharing is the only option. In the capital, the average one-bed costs Â£1,237, but a third of a three-bed property costs Â£582 on average, saving you more than Â£650 each month. Working out what proportion rent makes up of your salary is a good measure of how affordable it is. Housing organisations recommend spending no more than 30% of your income on housing costs. While Londoners earn more than residents of other regions, the city's rental properties still make up a bigger chunk of residents' salaries than renters in other areas. For example, renting just a one-bed flat in the capital eats up nearly half of the average salary. It will come as no surprise to anyone that London's rental market is the priciest. But rents have actually risen by more elsewhere in the country. The median rent for a one-bedroom flat in the East of England rose from Â£495 in 2012-13, to Â£650 in 2017-18, according to official figures. That's an increase of almost a third. In particular, rents in Cambridgeshire rose by two-thirds in that period, from Â£450 to Â£750 a month. Other big increases were found in Barking and Dagenham, Bristol, and Greenwich, where prices rose 40% or more. We don't have local authority data for the other nations, but we do know that across England, there were only eight local authorities where one-bed rents fell. Three were in the North West, four in the North East, and, perhaps surprisingly, Kensington and Chelsea in London. Even within large cities, you might still find rents that are less eye-watering if you look in the right place. The data reveals the importance of location in determining how high your rent is likely to be. The cheapest corner of London's postcode area (SE2, in Greenwich) is more expensive than the priciest areas of most of the country's major cities. However, the number of areas with extremely expensive rents means that it still has the biggest price gap. To rent a one-bed flat in three London postcodes - SW1X, W1J and EC2R - you'd need to fork out more than Â£3,000 every month. But there are still three London postcodes - SE2, SE28, SE9 - where you can rent a one-bed for less than Â£1,000. Shared ownership lets residents part-buy, part-rent a property. This means they'd pay a rent, service charge, and a mortgage on the bit they own (which usually ranges from 35% to 75%). These costs add up, but not - as it turns out - more than renting. We looked at the total costs of all the shared ownership listings within a five-mile radius of central London, and matched them up to the equivalent rent for that postcode. Two-thirds of the shared ownership properties were actually cheaper than renting in that area. But don't get excited that shared ownership is affordable in London - the average shared ownership home listed still takes up almost 70% of young Londoners' incomes. Is rent cheaper in the next street? Where does rent hit young people the hardest?

"Annual celebrations have become a magnet for the far right Huge crowds have been celebrating the centenary of Poland's independence, amid controversy over a decision to include far-right groups. Nationalists were among more than 200,000 people taking part in a march in the capital, Warsaw, which was led by President Andrzej Duda. Opposition parties boycotted the event. It comes as French President Emmanuel Macron urged world leaders marking the centenary of the World War One Armistice to reject nationalism. Poland's National Independence Day commemorates the restoration of the country's sovereignty from the Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian empires in 1918. Most participants in Sunday's march in Warsaw were seen carrying Polish flags and wearing red-and-white armbands, but some were holding banners representing far-right parties from Poland and Italy. Macron urges world leaders to reject nationalism In pictures: Armistice Day Poland profile Many of those attending the march brought red flares that filled the streets with smoke. Red flares filled the streets of Warsaw with smoke President Duda had said he wanted the march to be a proud and joyful celebration and warned that anyone carrying offensive banners or chanting the types of slogans heard at last year's event - such as ""Pure Poland, white Poland"" - would be dealt with by the police. Sunday's events were said to have been peaceful and there were no reports of offensive banners or chanting. President Duda, who led events on Sunday, earlier warned people not to bring offensive banners Last week, a Polish court overturned a ban on nationalists marching in Warsaw. ""We're victorious,"" said the organisers of the annual event, which is partly organised by the far-right National Radical Camp (ONR) and has been marked by violence in recent years. The march is also popular with thousands of ordinary, patriotic Poles, including supporters of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party. An estimated 60,000 people took part in the event last year. This video can not be played These were the scenes in 2017 when a nationalist march and counter-protest took place in Warsaw In Paris,Mr Macron made a speech addressing world leaders in Paris describing nationalism as a ""betrayal of patriotism""and urging others to ""fight for peace"".

"The 2018 poppy appeal has launched, and for two weeks many people will wear them to remember British soldiers who died in wartime. The Royal British Legion chose the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, for its big reveal at the start of the campaign -  a six metre high red poppy installation. The installation in London was unveiled on Thursday It is surrounded by threads with quotes from the World War One generation, marking the centenary since that war came to an end and highlighting how their legacy is ""woven through the fabric of our nation today"". Many will stick to the traditional red paper flower for this period of remembrance, but other colours may catch the eye - white poppies, or perhaps even purple - and there are black poppies too. More people than ever before are wearing white poppies, says the group which makes them. But they are also controversial - earlier this week, Tory MP Johnny Mercercalled white poppies ""attention seeking rubbish"".,external Does he speak for the majority - or are white poppies a valid symbol of remembrance? Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and former prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major wear the red poppy on Remembrance Sunday last year Red poppiesbegan being used as a symbol in 1921 to help to remember those who fought in war. The flower was chosen because it grows wild in many fields in northern France and Belgium - where some of the deadliest battles of World War One took place. Its use was inspired by a poem, written by serving soldier John McCrae, which begins: ""In Flanders' fields the poppies blow ""Between the crosses, row on row..."" Royal British Legion volunteers collect donations and give out poppies in the streets The Royal British Legion, which sells the red poppy, is clear that it is not a sign of support for war and death. Instead, the RBL stresses it is a symbol for remembrance and hope and should not be seen as a symbol of religion or politics. Nonetheless, some people feel the red poppy has become political, and that politicians use it to help justify war. Meanwhile,white poppiesare distributed by the Peace Pledge Union - the UK's oldest secular and pacifist group. Created in 1933 - just 12 years after the red version - many people wore white poppies to stress the ""never again"" message, which emerged after World War One, and which pacifists feared was slipping away. Like the red poppy, the white badge also symbolises remembrance for victims of war. The Peace Pledge Union says the white poppy also represents a lasting commitment to peace and the belief that war should not be celebrated or glamorised. The white poppy remembers all who are killed in war - including victims It says the white poppy remembers ""all those killed in war"" - while the Royal British Legion says it ""advocates a specific type of remembrance connected to the British Armed Forces"". You may also seepurple poppies. These are less common and created to remember the animals who die in war. Black poppiesremember the African, Black and Caribbean communities who contributed to various war efforts. Lots of people feel very strongly about wearing a red or white poppy and the issue comes up every year. This week, Mr Mercer called on people to ""ignore"" those who wear white poppies. ""If you don't want to wear a poppy don't bother; they fought and died so you could choose,"" the MP said. ""But don't deliberately try and hijack its symbolism for your own ends.""

And news presenter Jon Snow famously refused to wear a poppy on air, saying viewer demands for him to wear a poppy were a kind of ""poppy fascism"". He said he would wear a poppy ""not on the telly... but on Remembrance Sunday in concert with others"". The Royal British Legion says it is. It ""defends the right to wear different poppies"" - and some of its volunteers wear different colours side by side. But it will not sell red poppies alongside other colours, because - it says - it may cause confusion. The charity says the red poppy ""is a symbol of peace inclusive of all regardless of race, belief, origin, or sexual/gender identity. ""Remembrance is neutral on both the causes and consequences of individual conflicts and is above partisan and political interpretation,"" it adds. And the Legion highlights that the red poppy raises money to support Britain's Armed Forces, veterans and their families in their time of need. Why do people wear poppies? Has the core message of the Poppy Appeal been diluted? 'Longest-serving' poppy seller dies Orders have risen considerably in recent years said Symon Hill, a co-ordinator at Peace Pledge Union which makes white poppies. ""In the last four years we have sold around 100,000 each year,"" he said. ""The record was in 2015, when we sold 110,000. In 2017, we sold 101,000."" Sales this year - the 100th anniversary of the end of WW1 - have been ""going very well"" and the group has already sold more than 75,000. ""There is a realistic chance we might exceed the record,"" he said. Sales of the white version might be on the rise but they have a long way to go before they match the number of red poppies distributed every year - more than 40 million forecast in 2018, according to the Legion. Last year, House of Lords peer Jenny Jones, from the Green Party, tweeted that she was wearing both. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Indian troops serving with the British army pray outside the Shah Jahan Mosque in Woking, Surrey A hundred years since the end of World War One, historians think recognising the contribution of Muslims can help tackle contemporary issues such as Islamophobia. ""Muslim soldiers have been forgotten about over time,"" Hayyan Bhabha, from the Muslim Experience, says. ""The core far-right narrative is that Muslims have never done anything for us. ""Well, actually, with facts that are over 100 years old, we can say Muslims fought and died for the history and security of Europe."" It is estimated that 1.5 million Indian troops fought to defend Britain. Of those, 400,000 were Muslim soldiers. The Muslim Experience is working to highlight the global contribution of Muslim soldiers to World War One and says raising awareness could silence anti-Muslim rhetoric by far-right groups in Britain today. Mr Bhabha says his team is now opening up documents and discovering new information about their role in the War. ""Accessing archives from 19 countries, we have discovered that more than four million Muslims either fought or served as labourers during the War, from around the world,"" he says. Muslim graves in French military cemetery Notre Dame de Lorette. One of those was Sepoy Khudadad Khan, an Indian soldier who fought alongside British troops. He was the sole survivor of a team assigned to defend vital ports in France and Belgium from German forces. According to accounts, Khan managed to hold off the enemy advance long enough for British reinforcements to arrive. On 31 October 1914, Khan, of the 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis Regiment, became the first South Asian to receive the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military honour. Groups such as the Muslim Experience want stories of soldiers to be heard. They also want more British Muslims to find out if they have a personal connection to World War One. Just as a local GP in Nottingham, Dr Irfan Malik, did after he had a chance conversation with a patient that led him to discover two of his great-grandfathers had fought for Britain. It is estimated that millions of Muslims fought for the Allied forces globally Dr Malik's great-grandparents, Capt Ghulam Mohammad and Subedar Mohammad Khan, were two of 460 soldiers from a tiny village called Dulmial, in modern-day Pakistan, sent to fight in the 1914-18 conflict. ""One of my patients is a researcher of Commonwealth contribution to World War One and I told him about a village in modern-day Pakistan where I'm from that has a cannon commemorating the Great War,"" he says. ""From that point four years ago, my journey began and I found out my two great-grandparents fought for Britain. ""I'm very fortunate to have images from 100 years ago. It means a huge amount to me. It's made me feel more British as we have this shared history in common and I believe it helps community cohesion."" Dr Irfan Malik has collected pictures of his great-grandfather Subedar Mohammed Khan But how connected do British Muslims feel to the War and how aware is the community itself of its links to British military history? Mr Bhabha thinks some young Muslims in particular are not engaged with British military history. ""Most Muslims are not engaged with military history because they can't relate to it,"" he says. ""The way it is taught currently is very European-centric. ""The history that is taught doesn't show the true diversity of everyone that took part in the First World War."" Indian Muslim soldiers in the village of Dulmial, modern-day Pakistan Astudy by think tank British Future,externalfound just 22% of people in Britain knew Muslims had fought in the Great War. So, it has launched a campaign, Remember Together, to raise awareness in schools. Steve Ballinger, from British Future, says: ""Finding out that Muslim soldiers fought and died for Britain to protect us and to protect the freedoms we enjoy today, that's an important history for everyone to know."" Pupils at Eden Girls School learn about the Muslim contribution to World War One It has certainly meant a lot to Daleesha Naz, 14, of Eden Girls School, in east London. ""Today I learned that 400,000 Muslims fought in the British Indian army and it has made me feel closer and more connected to British history,"" she says. As the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One is remembered, historians, campaigners, and descendants of the soldiers are making sure the contribution of Muslims is never forgotten. Luc Ferrier, who chairs Forgotten Heroes 14-19 - the umbrella group for the Muslim Experience - says: ""If the world really wants to reach out to the international Muslim community, then they need to know the enormous contribution these people have made, fighting a war none of their making. ""Only by recognising and honouring the global Muslim sacrifices, not only these of the British colonies, we are reaching out to them and saying a genuine thank you"".

"Shirley Hellyar - pictured at the Baftas in 2017 - had a part in the Netflix film Outlaw King starring Chris Pine A terminally ill woman who raised nearly Â£7,000 for her own funeral after being given weeks to live has died. Shirley Hellyar, 40, from Glasgow, thought she had beaten cancer and travelled to Newcastle to celebrate. She suffered chest pains while visiting friends in October and was told she had less than five weeks to live. The actress said her family had already lost her brother when he was 16 and added ""no parents should have to have funerals for all their children"". She was recently cast as a villager in a Netflix production called Outlaw King, starring Hollywood actor Chris Pine, and had said she hoped to see it broadcast. However, she died on Wednesday - two days before its general release. A statement on her fundraising page said Miss Hellyar ""unfortunately passed away in her sleep"" at St Oswald's Hospice in Gosforth, Newcastle, surrounded by family and friends. ""Shirley was very grateful for everyone's help and donations which made her last few weeks so much better,"" the statement said. ""She said that all the help she had received restored her faith in human kindness. Thank you all once again."" This video can not be played An actress has died after raising Â£7,000 for her funeral Miss Hellyar was first diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma after developing a tumour on her lung in 2017. By September this year, she said the tumour had shrunk and she was well enough to travel to Newcastle where she had lived for years and used to work as a sexual health worker. Just before her death Miss Hellyar said: ""My parents have already had to lose a child - they lost my brother [in 1999], so they've had this sad story before. ""The idea that again they'd been left in this situation again just broke my heart. Nobody should be planning their own funeral and organising stuff but if I can take the pressure off and make it more bearable for my parents, I'll do that."" Miss Hellyar said she had hoped to see the Netflix production before she died More than 300 people donated Â£6,956 to help her parents Elizabeth and Gordon pay for her funeral and help towards their travel costs from Scotland. Many donors left messages of support, while some offered to provide services at the funeral or places for her family to stay in Newcastle. One donor, Martin Robson, said he did not know Miss Hellyar but posted: ""I heard your story on Radio Newcastle and was so shocked at your story and how sad it was for you. ""I sat there numb and in tears whilst hearing you talk of your cancer, well done for being so brave and I hope the money you raised will give you the beautiful, loving funeral you deserve.""

"This video can not be played Alibaba Singles Day: Dollars or data? Internet giant Alibaba has set new sales records on Sunday for its biggest shopping day, the annual Singles Day. The Chinese company hit a record $1bn (Â£774m; â¬883m)  in sales in 85 seconds, and then just shy of $10bn in the first hour of the 24-hour spree. In total, customers spent $30.8bn, up 27% on last year, but the lowest annual increase in the history of Singles Day. Online discounts have been offered on 11 November, Alibaba's informal holiday for singles, since 2009. Alibaba Group chief executive Daniel Zhang said the spending bonanza demonstrated ""customers' continued pursuit to upgrade their everyday lifestyles"". The event was kicked off on Saturday with a gala featuring US singer Mariah Carey, a Japanese BeyoncÃ© impersonator and a shoe-shopping-themed Cirque du Soleil performance. Alibaba invented the occasion to celebrate the unattached as an antithesis to the romantically involved on Valentine's Day. It is now the world's biggest online sales event and this year's total was more than Black Friday and Cyber Monday's totals combined, according to Bloomberg. The shopping spree was kicked off with a gala featuring international acts Some 180,000 brands are available in the shopping blitz, including top technology companies Xaomi, Apple and Dyson. Last year, the Chinese company expanded the event to the Western market, with downloads of its app AliExpress surging in the US and UK. Will Singles Day keep on growing? The shopping frenzy has broken world records in e-commerce sales - surpassing last year's record at 17:34 Hong Kong Time (10:34 GMT). However, observers believe as the event matures, its growth rate will slow down. Alibaba has also faced new challenges this year, such as new rivals in the market, a slowing economy and its stock dropping 16% thanks to China's trade war with the US. The November sale event is expected to be founder Jack Ma's last at the helm of the company. The current chief executive will take over as chairman next year, Alibaba announced in September.

"Glastonbury organiser, Emily Eavis, has hinted that a ""great British artist"" will headline at the 2019 festival. Speaking atBBC Music Introducing Live,externalshe revealed that the Friday headliner ""hasn't had a stage like this before"". She also confirmed that Fleetwood Mac won't be playing, but that they're on her wish list along with Kate Bush, Led Zeppelin and Tom Waits. Emily said: ""It's really easy to get lost in the noise of all that."" When it comes to the balance between showcasing new artists and booking bigger established names she explained: ""We can't keep putting those huge acts on because there aren't many that we haven't had now."" Emily with her dad, Michael Eavis, who founded Glastonbury festival As always, there's been plenty of speculation over who exactly will headline at Worthy Farm. The festival took a gap year in 2018, giving the ground there time to recover from the 135,000 people who turn up for the event. Even though most of the acts haven't been announced when tickets are released,they always sell out in record time. Stormzy's name has come up several times, withNME claiming to have confirmed it,external- along with either Childish Gambino or Liam Gallagher also taking a key slot on the Friday night. Emily, however, isn't giving anything away, saying there's ""nothing we can announce yet."" But she did talk about the kind of ""great,"" ""exciting"" artist that ""he"" is. ""We have got one of the artists that I'm most excited about in Britain right now,"" she said. ""This to me is going to be a moment. And he can become the enormous person that he is, do you know what I mean?"" It's easy to see why Stormzy has been linked to the gig. The last four years have seen the 25-year-old go from a relatively unknown grime artist to having a number one album and multiple Brit Awards. He's already headlined this year's Wireless festival proving that he can handle the pressure and pull in the crowds. In a year when he's released his book, Rise Up, and told Newsbeat thathis new music is ""groundbreaking""maybe Glastonbury is in his sights. He's also just the kind of artist the festival likes to champion. Someone who can transition from a line-up act to becoming huge headline material. ""That's the most exciting stuff for us when you watch a band transition,"" says Emily. ""Sometimes you have other promoters saying why are you putting them on, they're not ready. ""But then it just happens and it's like magic. ""When someone pulls it off and the crowd are behind them. ""When they walk on the stage as a kind of nearly a headliner and they walk off ready to headline any stage in the world."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

The suspect had already killed a cafe owner and injured two other people. He was later shot by police and died in hospital. When tracked down by reporters, Mr Rogers, 46, told 7 News: ""I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn't quite get him down, though."" At the time he was only metres from a burning car full of gas cylinders, which the attacker had set alight near Bourke Street, a busy road in the city centre. This video can not be played The attacker set a car on fire and stabbed three people Footage of Mr Rogers' efforts spread rapidly online, where he was hailed as a hero. A GoFundMe fundraising page was set up by Donna Stolzenberg, founder of the charity Melbourne Homeless Collective, to help get him back on his feet. ""As a person he just deserves it,"" she told Reuters. At time of writing, 3,388 people had donated money, and the page had been shared 11,000 times on Facebook. The attacker had already set a car ablaze and killed an elderly man when Mr Rogers tried to stop him A message from its creator read: ""UPDATE: We've found him! What an absolutely incredible human. We had a long chat on the phone today and we're even more proud of him. Our hero is humble as can be and had no idea about this fundraiser. We'll be catching up tomorrow to hand over his donations. He is amazing."" Ms Stolzenberg's charity will now help Mr Rogers find housing, as well as psychological support to process what he witnessed. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said the Friday attack is being treated as a terrorist incident.

"The strawberry scare spread across Australia, where supermarkets soon pulled the fruit off shelves A woman has been arrested in Queensland in connection with the ""strawberry scare"" where sewing needles were found hidden inside fruit. Police said the 50-year-old was arrested on Sunday ""following a complex... and extensive investigation"". The woman is expected to face unspecified charges on Sunday evening. A nationwide investigation was launched after shocked shoppers first reported the contamination in September. There were over 100 reports of needles being found in strawberries, though many were suspected to be copycat cases or social media stunts. Farmers were forced to dump tonnes of berries, and supermarkets pulled the fruit off sale. The first cases emerged in Queensland, where a man was taken to hospital with stomach pains after eating strawberries. Australia's strawberry needle scare widens Apple and banana in Australia needle scares PM vows crackdown on fruit scare 'idiots' The scare spread to every Australian state and later to New Zealand, raising public alarm. In response, Australia's government raised the maximum prison term for fruit tampering from 10 to 15 years. Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed to ""throw the book"" at anyone responsible, saying: ""It's not funny, putting the livelihoods of hard-working Australians at risk, and you are scaring children. And you are a coward and a grub."" In Queensland, where the strawberry industry is worth A$130m (Â£72m; $93m) a year,external, the local government pledged A$1m to support the state's stricken farmers. An A$100,000 reward was offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of perpetrators. The arrested woman, who has not been named, is set to appear in a Brisbane court on Monday.

"Emma Silk's grandfather, pictured in the photo she holds, lied about his age to join the war in 1917. He was only 17 ""I want to honour the memory of my grandfather - what he did for our freedom,"" says Emma Silk, grand-daughter of Harold Victor Silk, who lost his left arm in battle the day before Armistice Day. Emma was one of 10,000 people given the chance to take part in the People's Procession - a parade through London's streets on the 11th of the 11th, usually the reserve of the military. Exactly 100 years to the day, WWI ended and cheering crowds gathered in Parliament Square and Trafalgar Square where they clambered on to the backs of the stone lions and lit a bonfire at the foot of Nelson's Column. Today, the mood of jubilation has been replaced with a quiet pride and an awe at what our ancestors sacrificed for our freedom. The grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and great uncles killed in bloody and bitter battles - their names remembered but often the circumstances of death still unknown. The mother whose son - barely a man - never returned from the front; the young woman whose sweetheart went missing in action; the baby who was never to know his father. Each one of the 10,000 people walking the length of the Mall towards the Cenotaph has a story to share - a name to remember, a photo in a pocket and often a medal pinned to their winter coat. Many speak of the differences between then and now - the stiff upper lip of the last century, the generations who stayed silent about the impact war had on them and the buttoned-up manner of handling grief. They tell their families' stories, blinking back tears in the low November sun. Even as years pass and the generation gap widens, the emotional connection does not appear to lessen. Roger Miles, 69, a retired interior designer from West Sussex, tells the extraordinary story that he only unearthed - almost by chance - four years ago. His grandfather, Archie Miles, was wounded in the Battle of Cambrai, probably as the Germans launched a counter-attack. Nation marking centenary of WW1's end In pictures: Armistice Day Armistice Day events held around the world His wife, Amelia, was told to get to France to be by her dying husband's side, which she did. But as he lay dying, back home in Worthing their three-month-old baby son Tommy was also dying from whooping cough and pneumonia. The two died on the same day. Roger, a man of faith, said: ""I like to think, maybe, Archie carried Tommy up with him."" Asked if he's marching for them, he replies: ""I'm really here to honour the courage of my grandmother. ""She was obviously traumatised and remained a widow for the rest of her life."" Jeremy Cripps, who attended with his wife Carol and daughter Jessica, wore his grandfather's medals Robert Malin was working at St Pancras Hotel when war was declared. At 27, he was sent to the front and given the job of bearer to send in stretchers and carry away the wounded. But he went beyond the call of duty, says his grandson, Jeremy Cripps, 64, a children's charity boss from South Shields. In the Battle of Amiens, in France, in the last 100 days of war, Robert Malin went out under fire many times to bring back the wounded. Among them was Raymond Trustram, an officer, who made it out but died later from his injuries. Robert Malin, left, went out with a stretcher under fire to save the wounded, including Officer Raymond Trustram, pictured here as a schoolboy In an extraordinary letter of thanks, the officer's father wrote to Robert Malin to commend his ""gallant act"" and invite him to visit them. ""I thank you very much for what you did and feel sure you did everything possible,"" he wrote. Robert Malin was later decorated for bravery. ""Just pinning on the medals makes me feel emotional,"" says his grandson, Jeremy. Jane Harman tells John Parr's story to children in school assemblies Like so many on the parade, Jane Harman only knows the story of John Parr - the very first British soldier to die in WWI - after significant digging. She pulls out her folder of archived documents - copies of the 1901 Census, birth certificates, letters - to tell a story to leave you dumbstruck. John Parr is no relation but he was briefly a pupil at the primary school where she worked. A North Finchley boy, he was 17 when he died two days before the start of the Battle of Mons. It was 21 August 1914 but it was to be another eight months before his mother found out he was dead. In a heartbreaking letter to the War Office, sent in October 1914, she wrote that she had heard from one of his ""chums"" that he had been shot down in Mons. ""I'm very anxious as it is now 10 weeks. If anything has happened to him by this time, someone would have wrote [sic] to me."" ""You just can't imagine that,"" says Jane, a teacher in north London who has been telling his story to children in school assemblies. ""It's important the stories aren't forgotten,"" she says.

"As the number of people renting in the UK continues to rise, the BBC has taken a closer look at the state of private renting. The typical one-bed home in England costs Â£600 a month to rent, but this is skewed by soaring costs in London and hides a gaping divide across the country. In parts of Westminster, the average one-bed costs more than Â£3,500 per month. In Argyll and Bute, that sum could cover your rent for a whole year. Let's say you lived in a three-person house-share in SW4, Brixton, London. According to Hometrack, you could expect to pay around Â£767 per month, along with your two flatmates. With that money, you could comfortably rent a one-bedroom flat in Southend or Milton Keynes - both within commuting distance of the capital - all to yourself. In fact, you'd be able to rent a one-bedroom flat in 79% of British postcodes, including locations such as Bristol. Two-thirds of rental market 'unaffordable' for young people Is renting cheaper in the next neighbourhood? If you wanted a bit more space, you could get a two-bedroom home in 65% of Britain's postcodes for Â£767 or less. You could live in L1, in the heart of Liverpool, where rents for a two-bed property are around Â£751. For the same rent or less, you could also get a three-bedroom property in Leeds (LS8) with money to spare. Or, if Leeds isn't for you, around 50% of all British postcode areas have an average price of Â£767 or lower for a three-bed. If you're in particular need of space, for the same price as a room in a Brixton flat-share, you can rent an entire four-bed property to yourself in 410 postcode districts across the country - including in cities such as Birmingham, Newcastle and Swansea and Glasgow. Private renting has more than doubled over the past 20 years, and young people are by far the most likely age group to be renting. During the same period,home ownership among young adults has collapsed. In 1995-96, some 65% of middle-income 25 to 34-year-olds owned a home. Twenty years on just 27% do, with the biggest drop in London and south-east England. Renting a one-bedroom flat in England costs Â£600, yet buddy up with someone, and your share drops to Â£325. Find two flatmates, and you can get away with paying just Â£250 for a room in a three-bed home - less than half the cost of a one-bed flat. This will be no mystery to renters in cities such as London, where for many young people, flat-sharing is the only option. In the capital, the average one-bed costs Â£1,237, but a third of a three-bed property costs Â£582 on average, saving you more than Â£650 each month. Working out what proportion rent makes up of your salary is a good measure of how affordable it is. Housing organisations recommend spending no more than 30% of your income on housing costs. While Londoners earn more than residents of other regions, the city's rental properties still make up a bigger chunk of residents' salaries than renters in other areas. For example, renting just a one-bed flat in the capital eats up nearly half of the average salary. It will come as no surprise to anyone that London's rental market is the priciest. But rents have actually risen by more elsewhere in the country. The median rent for a one-bedroom flat in the East of England rose from Â£495 in 2012-13, to Â£650 in 2017-18, according to official figures. That's an increase of almost a third. In particular, rents in Cambridgeshire rose by two-thirds in that period, from Â£450 to Â£750 a month. Other big increases were found in Barking and Dagenham, Bristol, and Greenwich, where prices rose 40% or more. We don't have local authority data for the other nations, but we do know that across England, there were only eight local authorities where one-bed rents fell. Three were in the North West, four in the North East, and, perhaps surprisingly, Kensington and Chelsea in London. Even within large cities, you might still find rents that are less eye-watering if you look in the right place. The data reveals the importance of location in determining how high your rent is likely to be. The cheapest corner of London's postcode area (SE2, in Greenwich) is more expensive than the priciest areas of most of the country's major cities. However, the number of areas with extremely expensive rents means that it still has the biggest price gap. To rent a one-bed flat in three London postcodes - SW1X, W1J and EC2R - you'd need to fork out more than Â£3,000 every month. But there are still three London postcodes - SE2, SE28, SE9 - where you can rent a one-bed for less than Â£1,000. Shared ownership lets residents part-buy, part-rent a property. This means they'd pay a rent, service charge, and a mortgage on the bit they own (which usually ranges from 35% to 75%). These costs add up, but not - as it turns out - more than renting. We looked at the total costs of all the shared ownership listings within a five-mile radius of central London, and matched them up to the equivalent rent for that postcode. Two-thirds of the shared ownership properties were actually cheaper than renting in that area. But don't get excited that shared ownership is affordable in London - the average shared ownership home listed still takes up almost 70% of young Londoners' incomes.

Addressing leaders in Paris - including US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin - he described it as a ""betrayal of patriotism"". ""By saying 'our interests first and never mind the others' you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has - its moral values,"" he said. Events are taking place worldwide.

Mr Putin told journalists he had a brief conversation with Mr Trump and that it went well. However, the French organisers of the lunch event changed the lunchtime seating arrangement at the last minute so Mr Trump and Mr Putin would not be sitting next to each other, Russian media reported. Mr Macron and dignitaries walked to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a memorial to France's fallen under the Arc de Triomphe, in the rain under black umbrellas as church bells tolled through the city. In a speech lasting nearly 20 minutes, the French leader called on fellow leaders to ""fight for peace"". Mr Macron urged leaders to ""fight for peace"" ""Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible,"" he said. The service ended with the bugle call that was played at 11:00 on 11 November 1918 to signal the end of hostilities. Mr Putin is also in Paris On Sunday afternoon Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attended a peace conference - the Paris Peace Forum - with leaders including Mr Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mrs Merkel warned that ""blinkered"" nationalism was gaining ground in Europe and elsewhere. On Saturday Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel visited the town of CompiÃ¨gne, north of Paris.They signed a book of remembrancein a railway carriage identical to the one in which the 1918 Armistice was sealed. Mr Trump did not attend the peace conference and left for the US shortly after it began. Earlier he visited a cemetery in Suresnes in western Paris, saying he had gone there ""to pay tribute to brave Americans"" who died in the war. He caused controversy on Saturday by cancelling a trip to another cemetery for the war dead because of bad weather. Protesters from the feminist group Femen also held up placards in front of the Arc de Triomphe before being led away Earlier on Sunday, just before the leaders assembled, a topless female protester with the words ""fake peacemaker"" written on her chest came within a few metres of the US president's motorcade before being apprehended. A group of about 50 activist groups plan to hold a protest in Paris against his visit later. A ceremony was held at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, while in Adelaide an aircraft dropped thousands of red paper poppies. During his speech in Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke of the importance of remembrance, saying people need ""to learn from the past so that we can better navigate the changing currents of our own times"". In New Zealand, a gun salute took place in the capital, Wellington. And in India, memorials were held for the 74,000 troops who died fighting on the other side of the world.

"Mr Trump is in France to mark 100 years since the end of World War One A British minister has appeared to join growing criticism of US President Donald Trump's decision to miss a memorial event on Saturday due to rain. Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood took an apparent swipe at the president on Twitter, saying ""rain did not prevent our brave heroes from doing their job"". Mr Trump is in France to commemorate the centenary of World War One's end. He cancelled a visit to a US military cemetery, but the White House said other senior officials went instead. It said the bad weather grounded the presidential helicopter and cited security concerns in hastily arranging a motorcade for the two-hour drive east of Paris.

"The actress said she would use excuses to avoid the test Michelle Keegan has urged women to go for smear tests in an Instagram post about her own test. The actress admitted she had been putting it off ""for quite a long time"", ignoring numerous letters. ""I was really apprehensive"", she wrote, and would use the excuse of being ""too busy"", before adding: ""Let's face it, it's bloody embarrassing."" But in a video blog after the procedure she said how quick and easy it was, reassuring her fans it was not painful. ""I was in the room for five minutes, on the bed for two, it was really quick,"" the 31-year-old said. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Screening rates rose following the death of reality TV star Jade Goody,externalat the age of 27 in 2009, as her story brought greater awareness. But the numbers have fallen back since and, in England, thescreening rates are at their lowest for two decades, with Public Health England figures for 2017 showing about three million women failing to have a smear test for at least three-and-half-years.

"Shirley Hellyar - pictured at the Baftas in 2017 - had a part in the Netflix film Outlaw King starring Chris Pine A terminally ill woman who raised nearly Â£7,000 for her own funeral after being given weeks to live has died. Shirley Hellyar, 40, from Glasgow, thought she had beaten cancer and travelled to Newcastle to celebrate. She suffered chest pains while visiting friends in October and was told she had less than five weeks to live. The actress said her family had already lost her brother when he was 16 and added ""no parents should have to have funerals for all their children"". She was recently cast as a villager in a Netflix production called Outlaw King, starring Hollywood actor Chris Pine, and had said she hoped to see it broadcast. However, she died on Wednesday - two days before its general release. A statement on her fundraising page said Miss Hellyar ""unfortunately passed away in her sleep"" at St Oswald's Hospice in Gosforth, Newcastle, surrounded by family and friends. ""Shirley was very grateful for everyone's help and donations which made her last few weeks so much better,"" the statement said. ""She said that all the help she had received restored her faith in human kindness. Thank you all once again."" This video can not be played An actress has died after raising Â£7,000 for her funeral Miss Hellyar was first diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma after developing a tumour on her lung in 2017. By September this year, she said the tumour had shrunk and she was well enough to travel to Newcastle where she had lived for years and used to work as a sexual health worker. Just before her death Miss Hellyar said: ""My parents have already had to lose a child - they lost my brother [in 1999], so they've had this sad story before. ""The idea that again they'd been left in this situation again just broke my heart. Nobody should be planning their own funeral and organising stuff but if I can take the pressure off and make it more bearable for my parents, I'll do that."" Miss Hellyar said she had hoped to see the Netflix production before she died More than 300 people donated Â£6,956 to help her parents Elizabeth and Gordon pay for her funeral and help towards their travel costs from Scotland. Many donors left messages of support, while some offered to provide services at the funeral or places for her family to stay in Newcastle. One donor, Martin Robson, said he did not know Miss Hellyar but posted: ""I heard your story on Radio Newcastle and was so shocked at your story and how sad it was for you. ""I sat there numb and in tears whilst hearing you talk of your cancer, well done for being so brave and I hope the money you raised will give you the beautiful, loving funeral you deserve.""

"This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: 'I'm so scared right now... so terrified' The death toll in the wildfires raging through California has risen to 25, according to officials. This comes after 14 more bodies were discovered in or near the decimated town of Paradise in the state's north, bringing the number of confirmed dead there to 23. Two more people were killed in the south, near Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has drawn anger by saying that poor forestry management is to blame for the fires. In pictures: Wildfire rages in Malibu Watch: The long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly The blaze known as the Camp Fire started spreading through Butte County on Thursday, and firefighters were powerless to stop it destroying the town of Paradise. Another fire swept into the affluent southern beach resort of Malibu on Friday and has now doubled in size. Many houses burnt down in Malibu Known as the Woolsey, it had burned more than 83,000 acres (33,500 hectares) by late Saturday. Among the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, wherea gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday. Meteorologists have warned that dangerous conditions may continue well into next week, as hot dry ""devil winds"" blow through the Los Angeles area. ""This is getting bad,"" said Marc Chenard of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. ""It's nothing but bad news."" At a news conference on Saturday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said 10 of the additional victims were found in Paradise with four in the nearby Concow area. Images from Paradise showed the sky filled with acrid smoke, almost blotting out the sun. By Saturday night, the Camp Fire had burned 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) and was only 20% contained. Fire chiefs estimate it will take about three weeks to fully control the blaze. The fire started in the Plumas National Forest, north of Sacramento, on Thursday and quickly engulfed the town of Paradise. Residents fled for their lives as more than 6,700 homes and businesses were destroyed, making the fire the most destructive in the state's history. The flames moved so fast that some had to abandon their cars and escape the town on foot. This video can not be played The Camp Fire has been fuelled by strong winds and dry forest By the BBC's James Cook, Paradise in California Paradise is hell. A smouldering, sepia world in ruins. The air is acrid. Burning chemicals leave a bitter taste in your mouth. Walking among the ashes of people's lives is eerie and awful. There is a profound sadness here. We pass a child's charred swing, a swimming pool filled with filth, and worst of all, a pet dog which did not survive. Such was the intensity of the blaze that much of the debris is hard to recognise. Wafers of ash are drifting down like enormous snowflakes, smothering sound. But it is not quite silent here. A sooty squirrel scrambles up a blackened tree in a panic. There are booms and creaks from burning trees and telegraph poles. And soon, going from ruin to ruin, there will be the sound of those with the hardest job of all, checking to see if anyone was left behind. Fire officials have also issued evacuation notices for parts of Chico, a town of 93,000 people north of Sacramento. The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. Another blaze, the Hill Fire, started at about the same time, also near Thousand Oaks. This video can not be played 'How much more can this town endure?' - deadly wildfire hits Thousand Oaks, where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting On Friday, the flames jumped Highway 101 and headed into coastal areas. All residents have been ordered to evacuate. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Chief John Benedict said on Saturday that two people had been found dead but provided no details on the deaths. Malibu and nearby Calabasas are home to many celebrities and some have been forced to flee, including Kim Kardashian West, Caitlyn Jenner, Lady Gaga and Guillermo Del Toro. The actor Martin Sheen was briefly reported missing but he later said he was on Zuma Beach in Malibu, unharmed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The fire has also reportedly destroyed one of the sets for the TV series Westworld and is threatening Malibu's Pepperdine University, a private residential college with more than 7,000 students. Firefighters have not managed to build containment barriers around the fire. The president has previously blamed Californian officials for wildfires and threatened to withhold federal funding. In a tweet on Saturday, he again accused state authorities of ""gross mismanagement"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Evan Westrub, spokesman for state Governor Jerry Brown, hit back, called Mr Trump's comments ""inane and uninformed"". ""Our focus is on the Californians impacted by these fires and the first responders and firefighters working around the clock to save lives and property,"" he said. Celebrities also criticised Mr Trump's unsympathetic reaction. California-born singer Katy Perry called it an ""absolutely heartless response"", while singer-songwriter John Legend said Mr Trump ""can't bring himself to show some empathy to Californians dealing with a horrific disaster"". There is a total of 16 fires currently active in California,external. Officials have put most of Northern California under a Red Flag Warning, which means ""extreme fire behaviour"" can occur within 24 hours.

"The eight brothers were aged from 43 to 20 when they enlisted Thousands of soldiers fought and died alongside family members in World War One, but Thomas and Eliza Everton watched as all eight of their sons went off to battle. Only one of the couple's boys did not come home. The rarity of the family's situation prompted The Privy Council to send a letter in 1915 on behalf of King George V thanking the parents for their sons' contribution to the war. Signed by the keeper of the Privy purse, it said the King had ""heard with much interest"" about the brothers. ""I am commanded to express to you The King's congratulations and to assure you that His Majesty much appreciates the spirit of patriotism which prompted this example, in one family, of loyalty and devotion to their Sovereign and Empire,"" it read. The framed letter with photos of each serving son has been passed down through generations of the Birmingham family. ""Eight sons all serving at the same time - it's unique, outstanding,"" said John Jones, 76, whose wife Rita is Eliza's great-granddaughter. ""And they were all volunteers. They weren't youngsters - it's tremendous stuff."" Thomas and Eliza Everton pictured alongside their letter from the King Thomas John Everton, born in 1851, married Eliza and went on to have eight sons and two daughters. Originally from Chaddesley Corbett in Worcestershire, Thomas and Eliza Everton moved to Birmingham in search of work but employment was scarce and they fell on hard times. In 1881, Mrs Everton ended up in a workhouse in Aston with her five eldest children after they were evicted from their home. It was not for too long and the family were reunited when Mr Everton secured a job with the City of Birmingham council as a pavier and a house in Bordesley Green. Then came the summer of 1914 and on 4 August, Britain declared war on Germany. Realising a bigger army was needed, Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, made a direct appeal to the men of Britain. So keen was the family to help the war effort, all eight brothers, who at the time the war began ranged in age from 20 to 43, enlisted at some stage. The eldest, Alfred, and his younger brother Francis were married and left their families behind. The women the war turned yellow Sikh soldier statue honours WW1 dead The mother who lost three sons in WW1 All eight served in different regiments and they all saw front line action. Francis, who was known in later life by his middle name Frederick, sent beautifully embroidered silk postcards home from the front line to his wife Gertrude, who he had married in April 1914, just a few months before war broke out. 'A Kiss from France' on a silk postcard sent to Frederick's wife Gertrude Postcards were exchanged between Frederick and his wife Gertrude while he fought on the front line Sadly, the heartfelt messages he wrote in pencil have rubbed off over time. Thirteen months into the war, tragedy struck when the second eldest brother, Thomas William, was killed in action. He died on 25 September 1915 in the Battle of Loos at the age of 38. Frederick Everton served in World War One along with his seven brothers A few months later, in June 1916, Frederick was given 14 days' leave from battle to return to his wife after the death of their daughter Lillian, who was 21 months old. But as the war reached its end, the rest of the Everton brothers came home to their families, and were decorated for their contributions to their country. ""They must have been stars of that community,"" said Mr Jones of the returning heroes. Alfred: Born 1871. Married with one son and two daughters. Served in the Royal Field Artillery, as a gunner Sergeant. Enlisted in August 1914. Was discharged with three war medals. Rosina: Born 1875. Thomas William: Born 1877. Served in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as Lance Corporal. Killed in action in the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. He had previously been listed in north Africa in 1897 for which he received five war medals. He also has a commonwealth grave in France. Francis Frederick: Born 1879. Served in the Royal Garrison Artillery. Married Gertrude Griffiths on 2 May 1914. Rita's mother, Gertrude Rose was born. He was discharged in February 1919 and was awarded three war medals. Died in June 1949. Edwin Charles: Born 1880. Served in the Royal Berkshire Regiment as Corporal. Enlisted July 1915. Discharged in August 1918 with four war medals. Frederick Arthur: Born 1886. Served as Acting Sergeant in the Royal Engineers. Discharged in March 1919 with three war medals. Eliza: Born 1888. Named after their mother. Albert: Born 1891. Served as a gunner in The Worcestershire Regiment. Enlisted in August 1916 suffered a gun shot wound and was discharged in June 1917 with three war medals. Howard: Born 1892. Served in the Duke of Cornwall Light Infantry, then later the Royal Dublin Fusiliers as a Private. Enlisted in August 1914 and discharged with four medals in February 1919. George: Born 1894. Served in the Manchester Regiment. Enlisted in May 1914 and was discharged with four war medals. Linda Withey - Mr and Mrs Jones's daughter, and Frederick Everton's great-granddaughter - said she imagined her ancestors to have been ""quietly proud but at the same time matter of fact with getting on and getting by with everyday life"" during the war. ""For them to have kept the document sent on behalf of the King in such pristine condition and for it to have survived to this day it must have been something that was both treasured but also a reminder that at least one was killed in action,"" she added. ""I also recall being shown these documents on several occasions as a child so it was clearly something that was a matter of pride. ""They were keen to keep the memory of the service given to King and country."" Like so many soldiers who returned from front line action, Francis Frederick Everton never spoke about the horrors he had seen and endured through the war. He lived through World War Two watching one of his daughters, Joan, go through the anguish of seeing her fiancÃ© go to fight but thankfully return safely. Frederick Everton (right) at the wedding of his daughter Joan to Arthur a few years before he died Mrs Jones recalls going to visit her grandfather Frederick every Saturday with her mother Gertrude Rose. ""He was quite a quiet and reserved man (but he was) always there every Saturday,"" she said. Mrs Withey said she had always been aware of the history of her great-grandfather and his brothers. ""Mum said he [Frederick] was a very stout and quite stern man, as was usual at the time I guess."" Frederick Everton - sat third from the right on the seated row - with his comrades of the Royal Garrison Artillery The house stayed in the family and Mrs Withey recalls it ""always smelled of aniseed"". And she fondly remembers a ""treasure trove"" sideboard full of antique glasses. ""I have some of these treasures now myself and they often remind me of that house.""

"Mrs Leadsom was a prominent Brexit campaigner Any Brexit deal negotiated with the EU must not ""trap"" the UK in a customs arrangement it cannot choose to leave, Andrea Leadsom has told the BBC. The Brexiteer minister urged Tories to back the PM and said she was ""sticking in government"" to work for a good deal. But the UK must not be ""held against its will"" in any ""backstop"" aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border, she said. On Friday, pro-Remain minister Jo Johnson quit the government and called for a new referendum on the final deal. Asked if other ministers might resign, Commons leader Mrs Leadsom told BBC 5 live's Pienaar's Politics she was not expecting any, adding: ""I do urge colleagues to support the prime minister. ""We are at a very difficult stage. What we have to do is hold our nerve and keep negotiating, make sure that we are pointing out to our EU friends and neighbours that it's in all of our interests to get a good deal."" New referendum 'still an option' - Thornberry Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox The government has not yet agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union, ahead of the UK's scheduled exit from the bloc next March. While it says a deal is 95% agreed, they have been unable to agree on a legally binding mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if a future trade deal is not ready in time. Earlier shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberrytold the BBC""all options remain on the table"", including another referendum, if a Brexit deal was voted down in the Commons. Mrs Leadsom, who Theresa May beat to the Conservative leadership in 2016, said there would not be another referendum if MPs rejected the final withdrawal deal. But she said she believed ""most members of Parliament would vote for a deal rather than no deal"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If sufficient progress is made on the ""backstop"" it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit. One option is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border until a free trade deal is ready. But Leave campaigners want a clear exit strategy from any such arrangement - while the EU says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed. By BBC political correspondent Jessica Parker MPs on all sides are readily setting out their conditions and caveats when it comes to a potential Brexit deal. And while Andrea Leadsom made it clear that she still supports Prime Minister Theresa May, there was a hint too that she has her own red lines, saying that the UK must not end up trapped in an EU customs arrangement. This plays into wider fears in some Conservative quarters that Mrs May could end up accepting a compromise too far on the ""backstop"" issue, in order to get a withdrawal agreement with the EU over the line. Mrs Leadsom said while the backstop was not a ""likely scenario"" - because she believed a trade deal could be reached before it would be necessary - it must be ""time limited"" and ""include the entire UK"", rather than just Northern Ireland. And the UK must be able to decide to leave it - without the EU overturning that decision. She added: ""The UK cannot be forced to remain in a customs arrangement. Now how that specifically works is exactly what is being discussed and negotiated on now. The UK cannot be held against its will in a customs arrangement."" Earlier Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""If you have too hard a line about saying, 'Well we must just have a totally unilateral exit, or there's an absolutely fixed, hard end date,' that is... very, very unlikely that is going to be negotiable with the other side. ""On the other hand, people here rightly want comfort and they should be able to have comfort and confidence that it isn't an open-ended thing."" Meanwhile, General Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, was asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show what the military might be called on to do, in the event the UK leaves the EU with no withdrawal deal in place, saying ""we stand ready to help in any way we can"". Defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News the government had to plan for every scenario adding: ""There are contingency plans being made, there are discussions being held behind the scenes as to what support our armed forces will do."" Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union. If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the remaining EU member states.

"This video can not be played Emily Thornberry: 'All options on the table' on Brexit Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry has told the BBC ""all options remain on the table"", including a new referendum, if MPs vote down a Brexit deal. She was asked about party leader Jeremy Corbyn's comment to a German newspaper that Brexit cannot be stopped. Labour would prefer a general election, she said, but could campaign for ""a People's Vote"" if it were not possible. Tory cabinet minister Damian Hinds said MPs must ""consider the alternatives"" if they vote down the deal. The government has not yet agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union, ahead of the UK's exit from the bloc next March. UK must not be trapped in Brexit backstop - Leadsom Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Minister quits and calls for new Brexit vote While the UK government says it is 95% agreed - they have been unable to agree on the mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if a future trade deal is not ready in time. On Friday, transport minister Jo Johnson, who voted to remain in the EU, quit the government saying he could not support the deal and called for another referendum. Meanwhile Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker and Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the DUP - whose party's support Theresa May relies on for key Commons votes - have written a joint article in theSunday Telegraph,externalwarning they are prepared to vote down any deal over proposals to manage the Irish border issue. On Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn was quoted in Der Spiegel, having been asked if he would stop Brexit, as saying: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place."" Asked if Brexit could be stopped on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry said the results of the referendum should be ""abided by"" but there had to be an ""injection of democracy"" in between that result and going any further. That should be a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament, she said. But she said Theresa May was only offering a choice between the UK ""falling off a cliff"" - with no deal agreed - or ""get on this bridge to nowhere"", by backing her deal. She said Labour would refuse to ""play that sort of game"" and, if the vote was lost, the party wanted a general election. She added: ""If we don't have a general election, which we think we should have, then yes of course all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a People's Vote but, you know, there are several stages before we get there."" The People's Vote campaign group organised the march in London in October which it said attracted about 700,000 people. The group wants a referendum on the final withdrawal deal. Ms Thornberry said Mr Corbyn's comments had to be seen in context and he was explaining that: ""We had a referendum, that we are democrats over and above everything else."" At the Labour Party conference in September,party members approved a motion that would keep all options- including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. Mr Corbyn has said he would respect the result of the vote. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmerwrote in the Sunday Times,external: ""There is no duty on MPs to surrender to a bad deal."" Instead, he said that MPs would be able to table motions, press amendments and trigger a no-confidence vote in order to prevent the UK leaving without a deal at all. Sir Keir said: ""I remain as convinced as ever that the consequences of no deal would be so severe that it cannot be allowed to happen."" But Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the BBC that people would have to consider a deal as a whole, stating: ""They need to think about what the alternatives are as well. ""It is no good just not liking individual aspects. If you're going to take that view, you have got to have in mind a realistic, viable, deliverable alternative. ""I think people are going to be getting behind this deal and saying 'yeah, let's get on with it'."" He added: ""It is not necessarily going to be something everybody is going to think is absolutely perfectly what they want. ""But that's the nature of these things, there are some trade-offs.""

"This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: 'I'm so scared right now... so terrified' The death toll in the wildfires raging through California has risen to 25, according to officials. This comes after 14 more bodies were discovered in or near the decimated town of Paradise in the state's north, bringing the number of confirmed dead there to 23. Two more people were killed in the south, near Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has drawn anger by saying that poor forestry management is to blame for the fires. In pictures: Wildfire rages in Malibu Watch: The long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly The blaze known as the Camp Fire started spreading through Butte County on Thursday, and firefighters were powerless to stop it destroying the town of Paradise. Another fire swept into the affluent southern beach resort of Malibu on Friday and has now doubled in size. Many houses burnt down in Malibu Known as the Woolsey, it had burned more than 83,000 acres (33,500 hectares) by late Saturday. Among the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, wherea gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday. Meteorologists have warned that dangerous conditions may continue well into next week, as hot dry ""devil winds"" blow through the Los Angeles area. ""This is getting bad,"" said Marc Chenard of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. ""It's nothing but bad news."" At a news conference on Saturday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said 10 of the additional victims were found in Paradise with four in the nearby Concow area. Images from Paradise showed the sky filled with acrid smoke, almost blotting out the sun. By Saturday night, the Camp Fire had burned 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) and was only 20% contained. Fire chiefs estimate it will take about three weeks to fully control the blaze. The fire started in the Plumas National Forest, north of Sacramento, on Thursday and quickly engulfed the town of Paradise. Residents fled for their lives as more than 6,700 homes and businesses were destroyed, making the fire the most destructive in the state's history. The flames moved so fast that some had to abandon their cars and escape the town on foot.

The air is acrid. Burning chemicals leave a bitter taste in your mouth. Walking among the ashes of people's lives is eerie and awful. There is a profound sadness here. We pass a child's charred swing, a swimming pool filled with filth, and worst of all, a pet dog which did not survive. Such was the intensity of the blaze that much of the debris is hard to recognise. Wafers of ash are drifting down like enormous snowflakes, smothering sound. But it is not quite silent here. A sooty squirrel scrambles up a blackened tree in a panic. There are booms and creaks from burning trees and telegraph poles. And soon, going from ruin to ruin, there will be the sound of those with the hardest job of all, checking to see if anyone was left behind. Fire officials have also issued evacuation notices for parts of Chico, a town of 93,000 people north of Sacramento. The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. Another blaze, the Hill Fire, started at about the same time, also near Thousand Oaks.

"The ex-housebuilding executive, Jeff Fairburn - who gave up part of his huge bonus after a public outcry - is facing criticism over the shares he gave back. The former Persimmon boss said he would forego half his shares - but analysis carried out for the BBC found the ones he retained were the most beneficial. The reduction brought the value of his bonus down from Â£100m to Â£75m. Although the method used was legal, a more arbitrary cut across all the stock could have brought him down to Â£60m. Last week,Mr Fairburn was forced outdue to ""distraction"" over his deal. The bonus award was one of the biggest in corporate history and attracted additional controversy because the housebuilding firm's performance has benefitted from low interest rates and the government house-buying incentive scheme Help to Buy. At the firm's annual meeting in April, 48.5% of investors voted against the remuneration report - although 85% had approved the pay scheme when it was unveiled in 2012. Mr Fairburn's bonus - and that of other senior executives at Persimmon - was based on awards of shares in a long-term incentive plan (LTIP). Â£75m bonus boss walks off over pay question Building boss out over Â£75m pay row Â£25m slashed off building chief's bonus The shares were awarded to Mr Fairburn in three tranches, which in turn required him to pay different amounts towards the cost of the shares. One of the tranches required him to pay nothing, another almost Â£4 and another almost Â£10. When Mr Fairburn agreed to halve the number of the shares he had been awarded, it was done on the basis of cancelling the tranche which cost him most to obtain the shares first. Although there was nothing improper about the method used to reduce his shareholding, if the 50% share reduction had taken place equally across the three tranches of shares it would have cost him more to buy the shares and further cut the value of the share awards. The method that was used reduced the total number of shares he was entitled to by 50%, as was announced by the company. The value of the bonus moves with the share price and the BBC calculations are based on rounded estimates. Both Persimmon and Jeff Fairburn declined to comment on the BBC's calculations. This video can not be played Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his pay Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, said it seemed like a ""crafty way"" to reduce the bonus. When Mr Fairburn's departure was announced, the housebuilder said the bonus issue was having a ""negative impact"" on the firm's reputation and on ""Jeff's ability to continue in his role"". Last month, Mr Fairburn walked away from a BBC interview when asked about his pay. ""I'd rather not talk about that,"" he told a BBC reporter when asked in October about the pay award. Mr Fairburn had also attempted to defuse the row by saying he would give a substantial part of the bonus to charity. He has not said how much he will donate. Mr Fairburn has not yet sold any shares so does not immediately have those funds to donate. When his departure was announced, Mr Fairburn said that he had hoped the plans to create a charitable trust and waive part of the share award would allow the company to ""put the issue... behind it"". ""However, this has not been the case and so it is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down,"" he said at the time.

"President Magufuli has accused traders of trying to rip off nut farmers Tanzanian President John Magufuli has sacked both the agriculture and trade ministers, and threatened to deploy the military over a cashew nut crisis. Traders have been given a Monday deadline to buy crops from farmers at an approved price, and not below. If this does not happen, Mr Magufuli said he will send dozens of military trucks to collect the entire crop. Cashew nut exports are a major foreign-currency earner for Tanzania. Farmers have for weeks been refusing to sell their harvests, arguing that the private traders' offers are too low. On Saturday, Mr Magufuli accused traders of attempting to rip off thousands of farmers and ordered them to increase their price offers to around $1.3 (Â£1; â¬1.15) per kilogram (2.2 pounds). The president says he is working to ensure thousands of farmers get a fair price for their cashew nuts and also so that the country does not miss out on vital export earnings. He added that if he is forced to deploy the army to round up the supplies of cashew nuts, his government will buy them. Tanzania riots over cashew nut payments Seed planter helps sesame farmers in Tanzania Following the sackings of the agriculture minister, Charles Tizeba, and the trade and investment minister, Charles Mwijage, Mr Magufuli appointed two other ministers and four deputies. He has also disbanded the Cashewnut Board of Tanzania (CBT) and has revoked the appointment of the board chair, Anna Abdallah. This is not the first time that the country has suffered such a crisis. In 2013,riots by cashew nut farmers and other protesters in southern Tanzanialed to some 20 properties being burned down. The trouble began after traders began paying farmers less for their crop than had been previously agreed. As a result, police were deployed to the region to stop further unrest.

"Demonstrators had earlier gathered outside Florida's elections office to demand a recount Florida has ordered a machine recount of votes for state governor and senator following last week's closely fought mid-term elections, officials say. Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner said that as unofficial results in both races had fallen within a margin of 0.5%, a recount was required by law. The two ballots are among the most important yet to be decided. US President Donald Trump responded to the news by accusing Democrats of trying to ""steal"" the elections. Allow Twitter content?

The state's Republican Governor Rick Scott, who is standing for the Senate, also warned of electoral fraud, but neither he nor President Trump offered any evidence to back their claims. The recounts are expected to take several days, but analysts say possible legal challenges mean it could take weeks for the winners to be confirmed. Mr Detzner has ordered that all 67 Florida counties complete machine recounts for the Senate and gubernatorial races by 15:00 local time on Thursday. If a machine recount shows a difference of 0.25% or less between the candidates, the state will proceed to a hand recount that must conclude by 18 November, local media report. US mid-term results 2018: Maps, charts and analysis When voting goes wrong Lessons US Democrats can learn for 2020 In the race for Florida's Senate seat, unofficial results revealed a gap of just 0.15% between the votes for incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson and Mr Scott. Democrat Andrew Gillum had already conceded the state governorship, but Ron DeSantis's lead for the Republicans later narrowed to 0.41%. This video can not be played How the race for governor played out in the run-up to the vote After the recount was announced, Mr Gillum said: ""I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote."" Mr DeSantis, however, insisted that the results were ""clear and unambiguous, just as they were on election night"". ""It is important that everyone involved in the election process strictly adhere to the rule of law which is the foundation for our nation,"" he added. Mr Trump had earlier said there was ""a lot of dishonesty"" over contested votes. Some candidates have already launched legal action. Mr Scott, who claimed victory on Tuesday, is suing officials over an election recount, while Mr Nelson is suing over uncounted ballots - and there have also been a number of protests outside the elections office. Mr Scott called on sheriffs in every county to closely monitor the recount process, tweeting: ""We will not let unethical liberals steal this election! ""It's time Senator Nelson accepts these results and allows the state of Florida to move forward to a better future."" In one of his three lawsuits against election overseers, Mr Scott has asked a judge to impound voting machines and ballots when they are not in use. Mr Nelson responded to the legal action in a statement on Sunday, saying his rival, the state's outgoing governor, was making ""false and panicked"" voter fraud claims because he was afraid of losing. ""If Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended,"" said the Democratic incumbent. Authorities have meanwhile shot down a conspiracy theory about ballot fraud. Florida Senator Marco Rubio was among those who retweeted a photo showing a box labelled ""provisional ballots"" found at a school, raising concerns about possible foul play. But election officials stated that the box contained only supplies. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump told reporters on Friday, before leaving for Paris to commemoratethe 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, that he believed that Mr Scott had clearly won the election.

In 2000, George W Bush and Al Gore faced an impasse with the presidential vote hanging in the balance amid weeks of legal wrangling. Mr Gore's fate was finally sealed by a US Supreme Court ruling that said in essence that time had run out for recounts in the crucial state, granting Mr Bush the presidency. In Georgia's gubernatorial election, Democrat Stacey Abrams is refusing to concede in her race against Republican Brian Kemp. Mr Kemp declared victory on Wednesday with a narrow lead but campaign officials for Ms Abrams have started a legal challenge to ensure all votes are counted. Stacey Abrams has not yet conceded in Georgia Her supporters have claimed that issues such as ballot machines supplied without power cables and four-hour queues unfairly helped Mr Kemp. An ongoing tally has whittled Mr Kemp's lead slightly to under 60,000 votes,external, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. But Ms Abrams still needs another 22,000 votes to trigger a run-off election next month, and it is unclear how many ballots remain outstanding. In Arizona, another tight senate race has yet to conclude between two US congresswomen - Republican Martha McSally and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. With mail-in votes still being counted, Ms Sinema had widened her narrow lead to more than 30,000 votes by Sunday (1.4|%), US media report.

"This video can not be played Emily Thornberry: 'All options on the table' on Brexit Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry has told the BBC ""all options remain on the table"", including a new referendum, if MPs vote down a Brexit deal. She was asked about party leader Jeremy Corbyn's comment to a German newspaper that Brexit cannot be stopped. Labour would prefer a general election, she said, but could campaign for ""a People's Vote"" if it were not possible. Tory cabinet minister Damian Hinds said MPs must ""consider the alternatives"" if they vote down the deal. The government has not yet agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union, ahead of the UK's exit from the bloc next March. UK must not be trapped in Brexit backstop - Leadsom Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Minister quits and calls for new Brexit vote While the UK government says it is 95% agreed - they have been unable to agree on the mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if a future trade deal is not ready in time. On Friday, transport minister Jo Johnson, who voted to remain in the EU, quit the government saying he could not support the deal and called for another referendum. Meanwhile Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker and Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the DUP - whose party's support Theresa May relies on for key Commons votes - have written a joint article in theSunday Telegraph,externalwarning they are prepared to vote down any deal over proposals to manage the Irish border issue. On Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn was quoted in Der Spiegel, having been asked if he would stop Brexit, as saying: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place."" Asked if Brexit could be stopped on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry said the results of the referendum should be ""abided by"" but there had to be an ""injection of democracy"" in between that result and going any further. That should be a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament, she said. But she said Theresa May was only offering a choice between the UK ""falling off a cliff"" - with no deal agreed - or ""get on this bridge to nowhere"", by backing her deal. She said Labour would refuse to ""play that sort of game"" and, if the vote was lost, the party wanted a general election. She added: ""If we don't have a general election, which we think we should have, then yes of course all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a People's Vote but, you know, there are several stages before we get there."" The People's Vote campaign group organised the march in London in October which it said attracted about 700,000 people. The group wants a referendum on the final withdrawal deal. Ms Thornberry said Mr Corbyn's comments had to be seen in context and he was explaining that: ""We had a referendum, that we are democrats over and above everything else."" At the Labour Party conference in September,party members approved a motion that would keep all options- including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. Mr Corbyn has said he would respect the result of the vote. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmerwrote in the Sunday Times,external: ""There is no duty on MPs to surrender to a bad deal."" Instead, he said that MPs would be able to table motions, press amendments and trigger a no-confidence vote in order to prevent the UK leaving without a deal at all. Sir Keir said: ""I remain as convinced as ever that the consequences of no deal would be so severe that it cannot be allowed to happen."" But Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the BBC that people would have to consider a deal as a whole, stating: ""They need to think about what the alternatives are as well. ""It is no good just not liking individual aspects. If you're going to take that view, you have got to have in mind a realistic, viable, deliverable alternative. ""I think people are going to be getting behind this deal and saying 'yeah, let's get on with it'."" He added: ""It is not necessarily going to be something everybody is going to think is absolutely perfectly what they want. ""But that's the nature of these things, there are some trade-offs.""

""I've got six grandchildren and think its important that we remember if it was not for them, we would not have the freedom that we have today,"" Helen told the BBC. They were wearing his medals but details of his experience are hazy. Julie did try to interview him once for a school project but he got too upset. ""So many men died, he thought he was one of the very lucky ones,"" she said. Robert Malin, whose job it was to carry away the wounded on stretchers, and his grandson Jeremy Cripps wearing his bravery medals Jeremy Cripps, 64 and from South Shields, walked in the parade in honour of his grandfather, Robert Malin.

Dressed in the sombre, dark clothes of remembrance, many wore an ancestor's solitary medal, others row upon row, alongside their poppies. They carried wreaths with carefully crafted messages of thanks and spoke of their pride in their grandfathers, great-grandfathers and great uncles.

"This video can not be played President Trump and President Putin were among the leaders at the ceremony in Paris French President Emmanuel Macron has urged world leaders marking the centenary of the World War One Armistice to reject nationalism. Addressing leaders in Paris - including US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin - he described it as a ""betrayal of patriotism"". ""By saying 'our interests first and never mind the others' you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has - its moral values,"" he said. Events are taking place worldwide. Some 9.7 million soldiers and 10 million civilians died in World War One from 1914 to 1918. Growing criticism as Trump cancels visit due to rain In pictures: Armistice Day Several world leaders also held bilateral meetings at the events. Mr Putin told journalists he had a brief conversation with Mr Trump and that it went well. However, the French organisers of the lunch event changed the lunchtime seating arrangement at the last minute so Mr Trump and Mr Putin would not be sitting next to each other, Russian media reported. Mr Macron and dignitaries walked to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a memorial to France's fallen under the Arc de Triomphe, in the rain under black umbrellas as church bells tolled through the city. In a speech lasting nearly 20 minutes, the French leader called on fellow leaders to ""fight for peace"". Mr Macron urged leaders to ""fight for peace"" ""Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible,"" he said. The service ended with the bugle call that was played at 11:00 on 11 November 1918 to signal the end of hostilities. Mr Putin is also in Paris On Sunday afternoon Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attended a peace conference - the Paris Peace Forum - with leaders including Mr Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mrs Merkel warned that ""blinkered"" nationalism was gaining ground in Europe and elsewhere. On Saturday Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel visited the town of CompiÃ¨gne, north of Paris.They signed a book of remembrancein a railway carriage identical to the one in which the 1918 Armistice was sealed. Mr Trump did not attend the peace conference and left for the US shortly after it began. Earlier he visited a cemetery in Suresnes in western Paris, saying he had gone there ""to pay tribute to brave Americans"" who died in the war. He caused controversy on Saturday by cancelling a trip to another cemetery for the war dead because of bad weather. Protesters from the feminist group Femen also held up placards in front of the Arc de Triomphe before being led away Earlier on Sunday, just before the leaders assembled, a topless female protester with the words ""fake peacemaker"" written on her chest came within a few metres of the US president's motorcade before being apprehended. A group of about 50 activist groups plan to hold a protest in Paris against his visit later. A ceremony was held at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, while in Adelaide an aircraft dropped thousands of red paper poppies. During his speech in Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke of the importance of remembrance, saying people need ""to learn from the past so that we can better navigate the changing currents of our own times"". In New Zealand, a gun salute took place in the capital, Wellington. And in India, memorials were held for the 74,000 troops who died fighting on the other side of the world. ""This was a war in which India was not directly involved, yet our soldiers fought world-over, just for the cause of peace,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Sunday.

"Medical teams are vaccinating people to help stop the spread of the virus The latest outbreak of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the worst in the country's history, the health ministry says. Almost 200 people have died since August, officials say, with more than 300 confirmed or probable cases. A vaccination programme has so far inoculated about 25,000 people. DR Congo has suffered long years of instability and efforts to relieve the disease have been hampered by attacks on medical workers. ""At this point, 319 cases and 198 deaths have been registered,"" health minister Oly Ilunga said. ""In view of these figures, my thoughts and my prayers go to the hundreds of families grieving, to the hundreds of orphans and the families which have been wiped out."" About half the victims were from Beni, a city of 800,000 in the North Kivu region, the national health authority said. Why Ebola keeps coming back Ebola basics: What you need to know The current outbreak is the tenth DR Congo has suffered and the worst since the country's first epidemic in 1976, so early in the disease's history it had yet to be named. The outbreak in 1976 of what was then an unknown disease in a remote part of DR Congo sparked terror,but was brought under control by experts quickly identifying the virus' nature and using quarantines. Ebola is spread via small amounts of bodily fluid and infection often proves fatal. Early symptoms are flu-like, followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, a rash and internal and external bleeding.

"As the UK remembers the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, commemorations will focus on those who fought and died. But Armistice Day wasn't always so sombre. At 11:00 on Tuesday 11 November 1919, ex-service personnel, relatives and friends of the dead and millions of others gave thanks for the sacrifices of the Great War. A year after the conflict had ended, villages, towns and cities held parades, church services and observed two minutes' silence. That was during the day. The evening of 11 November was different. Thousands of people - most of them young - wanted to have fun. ""Victory balls"" - charity fundraising events involving fancy dress, dancing, singing and copious drinking - were held to cater for this need. PathÃ© footage of the biggest ball that year, held at London's Royal Albert Hall,,externalshows partygoers in costumes including turbans, doublets and hose, and a stars-and-stripes dress. One imperious-looking woman poses as Britannia. ""These events often had a celebratory air about them, as soldiers wanted to mark the fact that they had lived through the war,"" says Chris Kempshall, teaching fellow in modern European history at the University of Sussex. ""They celebrated with their comrades and marked the sacrifices of their fellows by living and enjoying their own lives."" The 1918 Armistice saw mass celebrations in the UK The balls continued, raising money for veterans and charities. Victory Dance, a poem by the writer and academic Alfred Noyes published in 1920, showed disgust at the frivolity on show: Shadows of dead men Stand by the wall, Watching the fun Of the Victory Ball. But any criticism remained muted until, on 19 October 1925, the Times newspaper published a letter from Richard ""Dick"" Sheppard, vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, central London. He called for the annual Albert Hall ball to be cancelled. ""Dancing is frequently the obvious and fitting form of gratefully commemorating a glad event,"" he wrote, ""but a fancy dress ball on a vast scale as a tribute to the Great Deliverance which followed on the unspeakable agony of 1914-1918 seems to me not so much irreligious as indecent."" Sheppard, who had been chaplain to a military hospital in France during the war, argued that balls and similar ""thoughtless and ill-conceived"" celebrations in hotels and restaurants ""should not be encouraged, at least while this generation retains the heartache of a tender and thankful remembrance"". Alfred Noyes was an early critic of Armistice balls The Times was inundated with letters agreeing or denouncing Sheppard as a killjoy. One contributor, described as ""Company Commander"", argued that, as the sole survivor of four brothers, ""the last thing that they would wish is that they should stand in the way of our enjoying ourselves"". But another contributor, Roger Lawrence, agreed with Sheppard, saying a fancy dress ball was ""grotesque"" and a ""piece of vulgarity"". The popular press, sensing the value of the controversy, took it further. The Daily Mail campaigned for the balls to end for fear of offending the bereaved. It claimed upper-class socialites, some of whom had not served, were enjoying themselves at the expense of the fallen. However, the Daily Express, engaged in a sales war with its rival, championed the rights of veterans to have a good time and relive their camaraderie, having risked their lives in war. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York took the same position as the Mail. Eventually the Albert Hall Victory Ball's organiser, Lord Northampton, gave in to the appeals, postponing it to 12 November. For 11 November, existing ticket holders could attend a service of remembrance - conducted by Sheppard. Born in Windsor in 1880, Sheppard volunteered for service in the Second Boer War, but was injured on his way to the train station, leaving him unable to serve and disabled for life He took part in the BBC's first religious broadcast, in 1924, but had to stop work on the radio in 1926 because of asthma-related problems In 1927, he announced his conversion to pacifism After Sheppard died in 1937, 100,000 people filed past his coffin Source:Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,external The number of balls dwindled during the late 1920s, when Armistice Day began to take on the more or less entirely sober character it has today. One former officer stopped taking part in commemorations, describing them as ""too much like attending one's own funeral"". ""Set against the sombre nature of these moments is the fact that, in reality, 88% of British soldiers survived the First World War,"" says Dr Kempshall, ""and they wanted to be able to undertake their own commemorations and activities in the light of that fact."" VE Day is remembered for its party atmosphere The debate during the 1920s must be seen in the context of society at the time, argues Elisabeth Shipton, author of Female Tommies: The Frontline Women of the First World War. ""With a rise in pacifism and growing austerity, parties with alcohol, dancing and excess were felt to be increasingly inappropriate,"" she says. ""Furthermore, was it a 'victory' given such a large of loss of life?"" Around 750,000 UK military personnel died during World War One. But, while almost 400,000 UK service personnel died during World War Two, commemorations of Victory in Europe (VE) Day have a far jollier tone, dancers and actors re-enacting famous scenes of the street celebrations of 8 May 1945. What is sometimes forgotten is that UK cities also saw spontaneous parties when the Armistice was announced on 11 November 1918. Thousands massed outside Buckingham Palace, as in 1945. Yet the differences in commemoration continue. ""The two world wars set the tone for how we understand and rationalise wars in this country,"" says Dr Kempshall. The crimes of the Nazi Reich make it easier to see the opponent as ""clearly 'evil'"", while much of the popular memory of World War One is of ""mud, blood, trenches and incompetent generals"", he adds. World War One ""appeared to be less conclusively resolved"", meaning it ""has a huge impact in how we talk about modern wars like Iraq and Afghanistan which have mixed outcomes and, at times, limited popular support"". Charity-supporting balls, held on or around 11 November, are making a slight comeback in the UK, US and around the Commonwealth, notes Ms Shipton. But Sheppard's view of Armistice Day, shaped by his time tending to wounded and dying soldiers on the Western Front, continues to dominate.

"The ex-housebuilding executive, Jeff Fairburn - who gave up part of his huge bonus after a public outcry - is facing criticism over the shares he gave back. The former Persimmon boss said he would forego half his shares - but analysis carried out for the BBC found the ones he retained were the most beneficial. The reduction brought the value of his bonus down from Â£100m to Â£75m. Although the method used was legal, a more arbitrary cut across all the stock could have brought him down to Â£60m. Last week,Mr Fairburn was forced outdue to ""distraction"" over his deal. The bonus award was one of the biggest in corporate history and attracted additional controversy because the housebuilding firm's performance has benefitted from low interest rates and the government house-buying incentive scheme Help to Buy. At the firm's annual meeting in April, 48.5% of investors voted against the remuneration report - although 85% had approved the pay scheme when it was unveiled in 2012. Mr Fairburn's bonus - and that of other senior executives at Persimmon - was based on awards of shares in a long-term incentive plan (LTIP). Â£75m bonus boss walks off over pay question Building boss out over Â£75m pay row Â£25m slashed off building chief's bonus The shares were awarded to Mr Fairburn in three tranches, which in turn required him to pay different amounts towards the cost of the shares. One of the tranches required him to pay nothing, another almost Â£4 and another almost Â£10. When Mr Fairburn agreed to halve the number of the shares he had been awarded, it was done on the basis of cancelling the tranche which cost him most to obtain the shares first. Although there was nothing improper about the method used to reduce his shareholding, if the 50% share reduction had taken place equally across the three tranches of shares it would have cost him more to buy the shares and further cut the value of the share awards. The method that was used reduced the total number of shares he was entitled to by 50%, as was announced by the company. The value of the bonus moves with the share price and the BBC calculations are based on rounded estimates. Both Persimmon and Jeff Fairburn declined to comment on the BBC's calculations. This video can not be played Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his pay Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, said it seemed like a ""crafty way"" to reduce the bonus. When Mr Fairburn's departure was announced, the housebuilder said the bonus issue was having a ""negative impact"" on the firm's reputation and on ""Jeff's ability to continue in his role"". Last month, Mr Fairburn walked away from a BBC interview when asked about his pay. ""I'd rather not talk about that,"" he told a BBC reporter when asked in October about the pay award. Mr Fairburn had also attempted to defuse the row by saying he would give a substantial part of the bonus to charity. He has not said how much he will donate. Mr Fairburn has not yet sold any shares so does not immediately have those funds to donate. When his departure was announced, Mr Fairburn said that he had hoped the plans to create a charitable trust and waive part of the share award would allow the company to ""put the issue... behind it"". ""However, this has not been the case and so it is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down,"" he said at the time.

"The new venue will hope to attract major artists and events like Adele, the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and the world gymnastics championships A 15,000-capacity indoor arena looks set to be built in Cardiff Bay on the site of the Red Dragon Centre. With the Motorpoint Arena holding 7,000 people and Principality Stadium 74,000, city planners wanted a venue with a capacity between the two. Various sites were mooted with an arena suggested as part ofa Â£150m redevelopmentof Cardiff Arms Park. But Atlantic Wharf was chosen - and the Red Dragon Centre will be demolished to make way. The centre opened in 1997 and is home to radio stations Capital FM and Heart FM, a casino, restaurants and cinema. Major events arena 'crucial' for Wales, says minister Â£110m preferred Cardiff arena site unveiled Before demolition work can begin, a new leisure complex will be built next door. ""We want to re-energise Cardiff Bay boosting its profile as a leisure-based destination,"" said Coun Russell Goodway. ""This new development can help to reinvigorate the area."" Cabinet members are set to grant permission for detailed work to begin next week with a planning application expected to be submitted in July 2019. An artist's impression drawn up earlier this year of what the new arena could look like The new arena would face Lloyd George Avenue and the Oval Basin outside the Senedd and Millennium Centre. But work would be completed in stages - starting with a multi-storey car park on the Red Dragon Centre's overflow car park. The new leisure complex would then be built on the main car park, with the existing one knocked down. Economy Minister Ken Skates said the development was ""crucially important"". The Red Dragon Centre leisure complex has been a feature of Cardiff Bay for 20 years Cardiff's and Bristol's councils have been trying to create a venue that would attract major acts and fans from south Wales and the south west of England for a long time. A scheme next to Temple Meads station was first mooted in 2003, butwas scrapped in September, with Bristol's mayor calling the Â£150m project ""too risky"". Coun Goodway said there had been ""significant interest"" from arena operators wanting to run the new Cardiff venture, including Live Nation, who manage the city's Motorpoint venue. ""The additional footfall that the arena and new leisure and retail site will generate will also increase the demand for better transport links between the city centre and the bay,"" he added. ""This should only help to drive the need for the new metro system and putting an arena in the bay could also help speed up the completion of the Eastern Bay Link Road.""

"Medical teams are vaccinating people to help stop the spread of the virus The latest outbreak of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the worst in the country's history, the health ministry says. Almost 200 people have died since August, officials say, with more than 300 confirmed or probable cases. A vaccination programme has so far inoculated about 25,000 people. DR Congo has suffered long years of instability and efforts to relieve the disease have been hampered by attacks on medical workers. ""At this point, 319 cases and 198 deaths have been registered,"" health minister Oly Ilunga said. ""In view of these figures, my thoughts and my prayers go to the hundreds of families grieving, to the hundreds of orphans and the families which have been wiped out."" About half the victims were from Beni, a city of 800,000 in the North Kivu region, the national health authority said. Why Ebola keeps coming back Ebola basics: What you need to know The current outbreak is the tenth DR Congo has suffered and the worst since the country's first epidemic in 1976, so early in the disease's history it had yet to be named. The outbreak in 1976 of what was then an unknown disease in a remote part of DR Congo sparked terror,but was brought under control by experts quickly identifying the virus' nature and using quarantines. Ebola is spread via small amounts of bodily fluid and infection often proves fatal. Early symptoms are flu-like, followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, a rash and internal and external bleeding.

"This video can not be played President Trump and President Putin were among the leaders at the ceremony in Paris French President Emmanuel Macron has urged world leaders marking the centenary of the World War One Armistice to reject nationalism. Addressing leaders in Paris - including US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin - he described it as a ""betrayal of patriotism"". ""By saying 'our interests first and never mind the others' you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has - its moral values,"" he said. Events are taking place worldwide. Some 9.7 million soldiers and 10 million civilians died in World War One from 1914 to 1918. Growing criticism as Trump cancels visit due to rain In pictures: Armistice Day Several world leaders also held bilateral meetings at the events. Mr Putin told journalists he had a brief conversation with Mr Trump and that it went well. However, the French organisers of the lunch event changed the lunchtime seating arrangement at the last minute so Mr Trump and Mr Putin would not be sitting next to each other, Russian media reported. Mr Macron and dignitaries walked to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a memorial to France's fallen under the Arc de Triomphe, in the rain under black umbrellas as church bells tolled through the city. In a speech lasting nearly 20 minutes, the French leader called on fellow leaders to ""fight for peace"". Mr Macron urged leaders to ""fight for peace"" ""Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible,"" he said. The service ended with the bugle call that was played at 11:00 on 11 November 1918 to signal the end of hostilities. Mr Putin is also in Paris On Sunday afternoon Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attended a peace conference - the Paris Peace Forum - with leaders including Mr Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mrs Merkel warned that ""blinkered"" nationalism was gaining ground in Europe and elsewhere. On Saturday Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel visited the town of CompiÃ¨gne, north of Paris.They signed a book of remembrancein a railway carriage identical to the one in which the 1918 Armistice was sealed. Mr Trump did not attend the peace conference and left for the US shortly after it began. Earlier he visited a cemetery in Suresnes in western Paris, saying he had gone there ""to pay tribute to brave Americans"" who died in the war. He caused controversy on Saturday by cancelling a trip to another cemetery for the war dead because of bad weather. Protesters from the feminist group Femen also held up placards in front of the Arc de Triomphe before being led away Earlier on Sunday, just before the leaders assembled, a topless female protester with the words ""fake peacemaker"" written on her chest came within a few metres of the US president's motorcade before being apprehended. A group of about 50 activist groups plan to hold a protest in Paris against his visit later. A ceremony was held at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, while in Adelaide an aircraft dropped thousands of red paper poppies. During his speech in Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke of the importance of remembrance, saying people need ""to learn from the past so that we can better navigate the changing currents of our own times"". In New Zealand, a gun salute took place in the capital, Wellington. And in India, memorials were held for the 74,000 troops who died fighting on the other side of the world. ""This was a war in which India was not directly involved, yet our soldiers fought world-over, just for the cause of peace,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Sunday.

"As the UK remembers the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, commemorations will focus on those who fought and died. But Armistice Day wasn't always so sombre. At 11:00 on Tuesday 11 November 1919, ex-service personnel, relatives and friends of the dead and millions of others gave thanks for the sacrifices of the Great War. A year after the conflict had ended, villages, towns and cities held parades, church services and observed two minutes' silence. That was during the day. The evening of 11 November was different. Thousands of people - most of them young - wanted to have fun. ""Victory balls"" - charity fundraising events involving fancy dress, dancing, singing and copious drinking - were held to cater for this need. PathÃ© footage of the biggest ball that year, held at London's Royal Albert Hall,,externalshows partygoers in costumes including turbans, doublets and hose, and a stars-and-stripes dress. One imperious-looking woman poses as Britannia. ""These events often had a celebratory air about them, as soldiers wanted to mark the fact that they had lived through the war,"" says Chris Kempshall, teaching fellow in modern European history at the University of Sussex. ""They celebrated with their comrades and marked the sacrifices of their fellows by living and enjoying their own lives."" The 1918 Armistice saw mass celebrations in the UK The balls continued, raising money for veterans and charities. Victory Dance, a poem by the writer and academic Alfred Noyes published in 1920, showed disgust at the frivolity on show: Shadows of dead men Stand by the wall, Watching the fun Of the Victory Ball. But any criticism remained muted until, on 19 October 1925, the Times newspaper published a letter from Richard ""Dick"" Sheppard, vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, central London. He called for the annual Albert Hall ball to be cancelled. ""Dancing is frequently the obvious and fitting form of gratefully commemorating a glad event,"" he wrote, ""but a fancy dress ball on a vast scale as a tribute to the Great Deliverance which followed on the unspeakable agony of 1914-1918 seems to me not so much irreligious as indecent."" Sheppard, who had been chaplain to a military hospital in France during the war, argued that balls and similar ""thoughtless and ill-conceived"" celebrations in hotels and restaurants ""should not be encouraged, at least while this generation retains the heartache of a tender and thankful remembrance"". Alfred Noyes was an early critic of Armistice balls The Times was inundated with letters agreeing or denouncing Sheppard as a killjoy. One contributor, described as ""Company Commander"", argued that, as the sole survivor of four brothers, ""the last thing that they would wish is that they should stand in the way of our enjoying ourselves"". But another contributor, Roger Lawrence, agreed with Sheppard, saying a fancy dress ball was ""grotesque"" and a ""piece of vulgarity"". The popular press, sensing the value of the controversy, took it further. The Daily Mail campaigned for the balls to end for fear of offending the bereaved. It claimed upper-class socialites, some of whom had not served, were enjoying themselves at the expense of the fallen. However, the Daily Express, engaged in a sales war with its rival, championed the rights of veterans to have a good time and relive their camaraderie, having risked their lives in war. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York took the same position as the Mail. Eventually the Albert Hall Victory Ball's organiser, Lord Northampton, gave in to the appeals, postponing it to 12 November. For 11 November, existing ticket holders could attend a service of remembrance - conducted by Sheppard. Born in Windsor in 1880, Sheppard volunteered for service in the Second Boer War, but was injured on his way to the train station, leaving him unable to serve and disabled for life He took part in the BBC's first religious broadcast, in 1924, but had to stop work on the radio in 1926 because of asthma-related problems In 1927, he announced his conversion to pacifism After Sheppard died in 1937, 100,000 people filed past his coffin Source:Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,external The number of balls dwindled during the late 1920s, when Armistice Day began to take on the more or less entirely sober character it has today. One former officer stopped taking part in commemorations, describing them as ""too much like attending one's own funeral"". ""Set against the sombre nature of these moments is the fact that, in reality, 88% of British soldiers survived the First World War,"" says Dr Kempshall, ""and they wanted to be able to undertake their own commemorations and activities in the light of that fact."" VE Day is remembered for its party atmosphere The debate during the 1920s must be seen in the context of society at the time, argues Elisabeth Shipton, author of Female Tommies: The Frontline Women of the First World War. ""With a rise in pacifism and growing austerity, parties with alcohol, dancing and excess were felt to be increasingly inappropriate,"" she says. ""Furthermore, was it a 'victory' given such a large of loss of life?"" Around 750,000 UK military personnel died during World War One. But, while almost 400,000 UK service personnel died during World War Two, commemorations of Victory in Europe (VE) Day have a far jollier tone, dancers and actors re-enacting famous scenes of the street celebrations of 8 May 1945. What is sometimes forgotten is that UK cities also saw spontaneous parties when the Armistice was announced on 11 November 1918. Thousands massed outside Buckingham Palace, as in 1945. Yet the differences in commemoration continue. ""The two world wars set the tone for how we understand and rationalise wars in this country,"" says Dr Kempshall. The crimes of the Nazi Reich make it easier to see the opponent as ""clearly 'evil'"", while much of the popular memory of World War One is of ""mud, blood, trenches and incompetent generals"", he adds. World War One ""appeared to be less conclusively resolved"", meaning it ""has a huge impact in how we talk about modern wars like Iraq and Afghanistan which have mixed outcomes and, at times, limited popular support"".

"The 2018 poppy appeal has launched, and for two weeks many people will wear them to remember British soldiers who died in wartime. The Royal British Legion chose the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, for its big reveal at the start of the campaign -  a six metre high red poppy installation. The installation in London was unveiled on Thursday It is surrounded by threads with quotes from the World War One generation, marking the centenary since that war came to an end and highlighting how their legacy is ""woven through the fabric of our nation today"". Many will stick to the traditional red paper flower for this period of remembrance, but other colours may catch the eye - white poppies, or perhaps even purple - and there are black poppies too. More people than ever before are wearing white poppies, says the group which makes them. But they are also controversial - earlier this week, Tory MP Johnny Mercercalled white poppies ""attention seeking rubbish"".,external Does he speak for the majority - or are white poppies a valid symbol of remembrance? Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and former prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major wear the red poppy on Remembrance Sunday last year Red poppiesbegan being used as a symbol in 1921 to help to remember those who fought in war. The flower was chosen because it grows wild in many fields in northern France and Belgium - where some of the deadliest battles of World War One took place. Its use was inspired by a poem, written by serving soldier John McCrae, which begins: ""In Flanders' fields the poppies blow ""Between the crosses, row on row..."" Royal British Legion volunteers collect donations and give out poppies in the streets The Royal British Legion, which sells the red poppy, is clear that it is not a sign of support for war and death. Instead, the RBL stresses it is a symbol for remembrance and hope and should not be seen as a symbol of religion or politics. Nonetheless, some people feel the red poppy has become political, and that politicians use it to help justify war. Meanwhile,white poppiesare distributed by the Peace Pledge Union - the UK's oldest secular and pacifist group. Created in 1933 - just 12 years after the red version - many people wore white poppies to stress the ""never again"" message, which emerged after World War One, and which pacifists feared was slipping away. Like the red poppy, the white badge also symbolises remembrance for victims of war. The Peace Pledge Union says the white poppy also represents a lasting commitment to peace and the belief that war should not be celebrated or glamorised. The white poppy remembers all who are killed in war - including victims It says the white poppy remembers ""all those killed in war"" - while the Royal British Legion says it ""advocates a specific type of remembrance connected to the British Armed Forces"". You may also seepurple poppies. These are less common and created to remember the animals who die in war. Black poppiesremember the African, Black and Caribbean communities who contributed to various war efforts. Lots of people feel very strongly about wearing a red or white poppy and the issue comes up every year. This week, Mr Mercer called on people to ""ignore"" those who wear white poppies. ""If you don't want to wear a poppy don't bother; they fought and died so you could choose,"" the MP said. ""But don't deliberately try and hijack its symbolism for your own ends.""

And news presenter Jon Snow famously refused to wear a poppy on air, saying viewer demands for him to wear a poppy were a kind of ""poppy fascism"". He said he would wear a poppy ""not on the telly... but on Remembrance Sunday in concert with others"". The Royal British Legion says it is. It ""defends the right to wear different poppies"" - and some of its volunteers wear different colours side by side. But it will not sell red poppies alongside other colours, because - it says - it may cause confusion. The charity says the red poppy ""is a symbol of peace inclusive of all regardless of race, belief, origin, or sexual/gender identity. ""Remembrance is neutral on both the causes and consequences of individual conflicts and is above partisan and political interpretation,"" it adds. And the Legion highlights that the red poppy raises money to support Britain's Armed Forces, veterans and their families in their time of need. Why do people wear poppies? Has the core message of the Poppy Appeal been diluted? 'Longest-serving' poppy seller dies Orders have risen considerably in recent years said Symon Hill, a co-ordinator at Peace Pledge Union which makes white poppies. ""In the last four years we have sold around 100,000 each year,"" he said. ""The record was in 2015, when we sold 110,000. In 2017, we sold 101,000."" Sales this year - the 100th anniversary of the end of WW1 - have been ""going very well"" and the group has already sold more than 75,000. ""There is a realistic chance we might exceed the record,"" he said. Sales of the white version might be on the rise but they have a long way to go before they match the number of red poppies distributed every year - more than 40 million forecast in 2018, according to the Legion. Last year, House of Lords peer Jenny Jones, from the Green Party, tweeted that she was wearing both. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"As the UK remembers the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, commemorations will focus on those who fought and died. But Armistice Day wasn't always so sombre. At 11:00 on Tuesday 11 November 1919, ex-service personnel, relatives and friends of the dead and millions of others gave thanks for the sacrifices of the Great War. A year after the conflict had ended, villages, towns and cities held parades, church services and observed two minutes' silence. That was during the day. The evening of 11 November was different. Thousands of people - most of them young - wanted to have fun. ""Victory balls"" - charity fundraising events involving fancy dress, dancing, singing and copious drinking - were held to cater for this need. PathÃ© footage of the biggest ball that year, held at London's Royal Albert Hall,,externalshows partygoers in costumes including turbans, doublets and hose, and a stars-and-stripes dress. One imperious-looking woman poses as Britannia. ""These events often had a celebratory air about them, as soldiers wanted to mark the fact that they had lived through the war,"" says Chris Kempshall, teaching fellow in modern European history at the University of Sussex. ""They celebrated with their comrades and marked the sacrifices of their fellows by living and enjoying their own lives."" The 1918 Armistice saw mass celebrations in the UK The balls continued, raising money for veterans and charities. Victory Dance, a poem by the writer and academic Alfred Noyes published in 1920, showed disgust at the frivolity on show: Shadows of dead men Stand by the wall, Watching the fun Of the Victory Ball. But any criticism remained muted until, on 19 October 1925, the Times newspaper published a letter from Richard ""Dick"" Sheppard, vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, central London. He called for the annual Albert Hall ball to be cancelled. ""Dancing is frequently the obvious and fitting form of gratefully commemorating a glad event,"" he wrote, ""but a fancy dress ball on a vast scale as a tribute to the Great Deliverance which followed on the unspeakable agony of 1914-1918 seems to me not so much irreligious as indecent."" Sheppard, who had been chaplain to a military hospital in France during the war, argued that balls and similar ""thoughtless and ill-conceived"" celebrations in hotels and restaurants ""should not be encouraged, at least while this generation retains the heartache of a tender and thankful remembrance"". Alfred Noyes was an early critic of Armistice balls The Times was inundated with letters agreeing or denouncing Sheppard as a killjoy. One contributor, described as ""Company Commander"", argued that, as the sole survivor of four brothers, ""the last thing that they would wish is that they should stand in the way of our enjoying ourselves"". But another contributor, Roger Lawrence, agreed with Sheppard, saying a fancy dress ball was ""grotesque"" and a ""piece of vulgarity"". The popular press, sensing the value of the controversy, took it further. The Daily Mail campaigned for the balls to end for fear of offending the bereaved. It claimed upper-class socialites, some of whom had not served, were enjoying themselves at the expense of the fallen. However, the Daily Express, engaged in a sales war with its rival, championed the rights of veterans to have a good time and relive their camaraderie, having risked their lives in war. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York took the same position as the Mail. Eventually the Albert Hall Victory Ball's organiser, Lord Northampton, gave in to the appeals, postponing it to 12 November. For 11 November, existing ticket holders could attend a service of remembrance - conducted by Sheppard. Born in Windsor in 1880, Sheppard volunteered for service in the Second Boer War, but was injured on his way to the train station, leaving him unable to serve and disabled for life He took part in the BBC's first religious broadcast, in 1924, but had to stop work on the radio in 1926 because of asthma-related problems In 1927, he announced his conversion to pacifism After Sheppard died in 1937, 100,000 people filed past his coffin Source:Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,external The number of balls dwindled during the late 1920s, when Armistice Day began to take on the more or less entirely sober character it has today. One former officer stopped taking part in commemorations, describing them as ""too much like attending one's own funeral"". ""Set against the sombre nature of these moments is the fact that, in reality, 88% of British soldiers survived the First World War,"" says Dr Kempshall, ""and they wanted to be able to undertake their own commemorations and activities in the light of that fact."" VE Day is remembered for its party atmosphere The debate during the 1920s must be seen in the context of society at the time, argues Elisabeth Shipton, author of Female Tommies: The Frontline Women of the First World War. ""With a rise in pacifism and growing austerity, parties with alcohol, dancing and excess were felt to be increasingly inappropriate,"" she says. ""Furthermore, was it a 'victory' given such a large of loss of life?"" Around 750,000 UK military personnel died during World War One. But, while almost 400,000 UK service personnel died during World War Two, commemorations of Victory in Europe (VE) Day have a far jollier tone, dancers and actors re-enacting famous scenes of the street celebrations of 8 May 1945. What is sometimes forgotten is that UK cities also saw spontaneous parties when the Armistice was announced on 11 November 1918. Thousands massed outside Buckingham Palace, as in 1945. Yet the differences in commemoration continue. ""The two world wars set the tone for how we understand and rationalise wars in this country,"" says Dr Kempshall. The crimes of the Nazi Reich make it easier to see the opponent as ""clearly 'evil'"", while much of the popular memory of World War One is of ""mud, blood, trenches and incompetent generals"", he adds. World War One ""appeared to be less conclusively resolved"", meaning it ""has a huge impact in how we talk about modern wars like Iraq and Afghanistan which have mixed outcomes and, at times, limited popular support"". Charity-supporting balls, held on or around 11 November, are making a slight comeback in the UK, US and around the Commonwealth, notes Ms Shipton.

"The eight brothers were aged from 43 to 20 when they enlisted Thousands of soldiers fought and died alongside family members in World War One, but Thomas and Eliza Everton watched as all eight of their sons went off to battle. Only one of the couple's boys did not come home. The rarity of the family's situation prompted The Privy Council to send a letter in 1915 on behalf of King George V thanking the parents for their sons' contribution to the war. Signed by the keeper of the Privy purse, it said the King had ""heard with much interest"" about the brothers. ""I am commanded to express to you The King's congratulations and to assure you that His Majesty much appreciates the spirit of patriotism which prompted this example, in one family, of loyalty and devotion to their Sovereign and Empire,"" it read. The framed letter with photos of each serving son has been passed down through generations of the Birmingham family. ""Eight sons all serving at the same time - it's unique, outstanding,"" said John Jones, 76, whose wife Rita is Eliza's great-granddaughter. ""And they were all volunteers. They weren't youngsters - it's tremendous stuff."" Thomas and Eliza Everton pictured alongside their letter from the King Thomas John Everton, born in 1851, married Eliza and went on to have eight sons and two daughters. Originally from Chaddesley Corbett in Worcestershire, Thomas and Eliza Everton moved to Birmingham in search of work but employment was scarce and they fell on hard times. In 1881, Mrs Everton ended up in a workhouse in Aston with her five eldest children after they were evicted from their home. It was not for too long and the family were reunited when Mr Everton secured a job with the City of Birmingham council as a pavier and a house in Bordesley Green. Then came the summer of 1914 and on 4 August, Britain declared war on Germany. Realising a bigger army was needed, Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, made a direct appeal to the men of Britain. So keen was the family to help the war effort, all eight brothers, who at the time the war began ranged in age from 20 to 43, enlisted at some stage. The eldest, Alfred, and his younger brother Francis were married and left their families behind. The women the war turned yellow Sikh soldier statue honours WW1 dead The mother who lost three sons in WW1 All eight served in different regiments and they all saw front line action. Francis, who was known in later life by his middle name Frederick, sent beautifully embroidered silk postcards home from the front line to his wife Gertrude, who he had married in April 1914, just a few months before war broke out. 'A Kiss from France' on a silk postcard sent to Frederick's wife Gertrude Postcards were exchanged between Frederick and his wife Gertrude while he fought on the front line Sadly, the heartfelt messages he wrote in pencil have rubbed off over time. Thirteen months into the war, tragedy struck when the second eldest brother, Thomas William, was killed in action. He died on 25 September 1915 in the Battle of Loos at the age of 38. Frederick Everton served in World War One along with his seven brothers A few months later, in June 1916, Frederick was given 14 days' leave from battle to return to his wife after the death of their daughter Lillian, who was 21 months old. But as the war reached its end, the rest of the Everton brothers came home to their families, and were decorated for their contributions to their country. ""They must have been stars of that community,"" said Mr Jones of the returning heroes. Alfred: Born 1871. Married with one son and two daughters. Served in the Royal Field Artillery, as a gunner Sergeant. Enlisted in August 1914. Was discharged with three war medals. Rosina: Born 1875. Thomas William: Born 1877. Served in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as Lance Corporal. Killed in action in the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. He had previously been listed in north Africa in 1897 for which he received five war medals. He also has a commonwealth grave in France. Francis Frederick: Born 1879. Served in the Royal Garrison Artillery. Married Gertrude Griffiths on 2 May 1914. Rita's mother, Gertrude Rose was born. He was discharged in February 1919 and was awarded three war medals. Died in June 1949. Edwin Charles: Born 1880. Served in the Royal Berkshire Regiment as Corporal. Enlisted July 1915. Discharged in August 1918 with four war medals. Frederick Arthur: Born 1886. Served as Acting Sergeant in the Royal Engineers. Discharged in March 1919 with three war medals. Eliza: Born 1888. Named after their mother. Albert: Born 1891. Served as a gunner in The Worcestershire Regiment. Enlisted in August 1916 suffered a gun shot wound and was discharged in June 1917 with three war medals. Howard: Born 1892. Served in the Duke of Cornwall Light Infantry, then later the Royal Dublin Fusiliers as a Private. Enlisted in August 1914 and discharged with four medals in February 1919. George: Born 1894. Served in the Manchester Regiment. Enlisted in May 1914 and was discharged with four war medals. Linda Withey - Mr and Mrs Jones's daughter, and Frederick Everton's great-granddaughter - said she imagined her ancestors to have been ""quietly proud but at the same time matter of fact with getting on and getting by with everyday life"" during the war. ""For them to have kept the document sent on behalf of the King in such pristine condition and for it to have survived to this day it must have been something that was both treasured but also a reminder that at least one was killed in action,"" she added. ""I also recall being shown these documents on several occasions as a child so it was clearly something that was a matter of pride. ""They were keen to keep the memory of the service given to King and country."" Like so many soldiers who returned from front line action, Francis Frederick Everton never spoke about the horrors he had seen and endured through the war. He lived through World War Two watching one of his daughters, Joan, go through the anguish of seeing her fiancÃ© go to fight but thankfully return safely. Frederick Everton (right) at the wedding of his daughter Joan to Arthur a few years before he died Mrs Jones recalls going to visit her grandfather Frederick every Saturday with her mother Gertrude Rose. ""He was quite a quiet and reserved man (but he was) always there every Saturday,"" she said. Mrs Withey said she had always been aware of the history of her great-grandfather and his brothers. ""Mum said he [Frederick] was a very stout and quite stern man, as was usual at the time I guess."" Frederick Everton - sat third from the right on the seated row - with his comrades of the Royal Garrison Artillery The house stayed in the family and Mrs Withey recalls it ""always smelled of aniseed"". And she fondly remembers a ""treasure trove"" sideboard full of antique glasses. ""I have some of these treasures now myself and they often remind me of that house.""

"Mr Trump is in France to mark 100 years since the end of World War One A British minister has appeared to join growing criticism of US President Donald Trump's decision to miss a memorial event on Saturday due to rain. Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood took an apparent swipe at the president on Twitter, saying ""rain did not prevent our brave heroes from doing their job"". Mr Trump is in France to commemorate the centenary of World War One's end. He cancelled a visit to a US military cemetery, but the White House said other senior officials went instead. It said the bad weather grounded the presidential helicopter and cited security concerns in hastily arranging a motorcade for the two-hour drive east of Paris. Trump-Macron smooth over defence spat Armistice Day commemorations in France France and Germany mark WW1 Armistice The US president is also opting to miss the Paris Peace Forum, which is run by his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and starts on Sunday afternoon.

"As the UK remembers the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, commemorations will focus on those who fought and died. But Armistice Day wasn't always so sombre. At 11:00 on Tuesday 11 November 1919, ex-service personnel, relatives and friends of the dead and millions of others gave thanks for the sacrifices of the Great War. A year after the conflict had ended, villages, towns and cities held parades, church services and observed two minutes' silence. That was during the day. The evening of 11 November was different. Thousands of people - most of them young - wanted to have fun. ""Victory balls"" - charity fundraising events involving fancy dress, dancing, singing and copious drinking - were held to cater for this need. PathÃ© footage of the biggest ball that year, held at London's Royal Albert Hall,,externalshows partygoers in costumes including turbans, doublets and hose, and a stars-and-stripes dress. One imperious-looking woman poses as Britannia. ""These events often had a celebratory air about them, as soldiers wanted to mark the fact that they had lived through the war,"" says Chris Kempshall, teaching fellow in modern European history at the University of Sussex. ""They celebrated with their comrades and marked the sacrifices of their fellows by living and enjoying their own lives."" The 1918 Armistice saw mass celebrations in the UK The balls continued, raising money for veterans and charities. Victory Dance, a poem by the writer and academic Alfred Noyes published in 1920, showed disgust at the frivolity on show: Shadows of dead men Stand by the wall, Watching the fun Of the Victory Ball. But any criticism remained muted until, on 19 October 1925, the Times newspaper published a letter from Richard ""Dick"" Sheppard, vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, central London. He called for the annual Albert Hall ball to be cancelled. ""Dancing is frequently the obvious and fitting form of gratefully commemorating a glad event,"" he wrote, ""but a fancy dress ball on a vast scale as a tribute to the Great Deliverance which followed on the unspeakable agony of 1914-1918 seems to me not so much irreligious as indecent."" Sheppard, who had been chaplain to a military hospital in France during the war, argued that balls and similar ""thoughtless and ill-conceived"" celebrations in hotels and restaurants ""should not be encouraged, at least while this generation retains the heartache of a tender and thankful remembrance"". Alfred Noyes was an early critic of Armistice balls The Times was inundated with letters agreeing or denouncing Sheppard as a killjoy. One contributor, described as ""Company Commander"", argued that, as the sole survivor of four brothers, ""the last thing that they would wish is that they should stand in the way of our enjoying ourselves"". But another contributor, Roger Lawrence, agreed with Sheppard, saying a fancy dress ball was ""grotesque"" and a ""piece of vulgarity"". The popular press, sensing the value of the controversy, took it further. The Daily Mail campaigned for the balls to end for fear of offending the bereaved. It claimed upper-class socialites, some of whom had not served, were enjoying themselves at the expense of the fallen. However, the Daily Express, engaged in a sales war with its rival, championed the rights of veterans to have a good time and relive their camaraderie, having risked their lives in war. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York took the same position as the Mail. Eventually the Albert Hall Victory Ball's organiser, Lord Northampton, gave in to the appeals, postponing it to 12 November. For 11 November, existing ticket holders could attend a service of remembrance - conducted by Sheppard. Born in Windsor in 1880, Sheppard volunteered for service in the Second Boer War, but was injured on his way to the train station, leaving him unable to serve and disabled for life He took part in the BBC's first religious broadcast, in 1924, but had to stop work on the radio in 1926 because of asthma-related problems In 1927, he announced his conversion to pacifism After Sheppard died in 1937, 100,000 people filed past his coffin Source:Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,external The number of balls dwindled during the late 1920s, when Armistice Day began to take on the more or less entirely sober character it has today. One former officer stopped taking part in commemorations, describing them as ""too much like attending one's own funeral"". ""Set against the sombre nature of these moments is the fact that, in reality, 88% of British soldiers survived the First World War,"" says Dr Kempshall, ""and they wanted to be able to undertake their own commemorations and activities in the light of that fact."" VE Day is remembered for its party atmosphere The debate during the 1920s must be seen in the context of society at the time, argues Elisabeth Shipton, author of Female Tommies: The Frontline Women of the First World War. ""With a rise in pacifism and growing austerity, parties with alcohol, dancing and excess were felt to be increasingly inappropriate,"" she says. ""Furthermore, was it a 'victory' given such a large of loss of life?"" Around 750,000 UK military personnel died during World War One. But, while almost 400,000 UK service personnel died during World War Two, commemorations of Victory in Europe (VE) Day have a far jollier tone, dancers and actors re-enacting famous scenes of the street celebrations of 8 May 1945. What is sometimes forgotten is that UK cities also saw spontaneous parties when the Armistice was announced on 11 November 1918. Thousands massed outside Buckingham Palace, as in 1945. Yet the differences in commemoration continue. ""The two world wars set the tone for how we understand and rationalise wars in this country,"" says Dr Kempshall. The crimes of the Nazi Reich make it easier to see the opponent as ""clearly 'evil'"", while much of the popular memory of World War One is of ""mud, blood, trenches and incompetent generals"", he adds. World War One ""appeared to be less conclusively resolved"", meaning it ""has a huge impact in how we talk about modern wars like Iraq and Afghanistan which have mixed outcomes and, at times, limited popular support"". Charity-supporting balls, held on or around 11 November, are making a slight comeback in the UK, US and around the Commonwealth, notes Ms Shipton. But Sheppard's view of Armistice Day, shaped by his time tending to wounded and dying soldiers on the Western Front, continues to dominate.

"The eight brothers were aged from 43 to 20 when they enlisted Thousands of soldiers fought and died alongside family members in World War One, but Thomas and Eliza Everton watched as all eight of their sons went off to battle. Only one of the couple's boys did not come home. The rarity of the family's situation prompted The Privy Council to send a letter in 1915 on behalf of King George V thanking the parents for their sons' contribution to the war. Signed by the keeper of the Privy purse, it said the King had ""heard with much interest"" about the brothers. ""I am commanded to express to you The King's congratulations and to assure you that His Majesty much appreciates the spirit of patriotism which prompted this example, in one family, of loyalty and devotion to their Sovereign and Empire,"" it read. The framed letter with photos of each serving son has been passed down through generations of the Birmingham family. ""Eight sons all serving at the same time - it's unique, outstanding,"" said John Jones, 76, whose wife Rita is Eliza's great-granddaughter. ""And they were all volunteers. They weren't youngsters - it's tremendous stuff."" Thomas and Eliza Everton pictured alongside their letter from the King Thomas John Everton, born in 1851, married Eliza and went on to have eight sons and two daughters. Originally from Chaddesley Corbett in Worcestershire, Thomas and Eliza Everton moved to Birmingham in search of work but employment was scarce and they fell on hard times. In 1881, Mrs Everton ended up in a workhouse in Aston with her five eldest children after they were evicted from their home. It was not for too long and the family were reunited when Mr Everton secured a job with the City of Birmingham council as a pavier and a house in Bordesley Green. Then came the summer of 1914 and on 4 August, Britain declared war on Germany. Realising a bigger army was needed, Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, made a direct appeal to the men of Britain. So keen was the family to help the war effort, all eight brothers, who at the time the war began ranged in age from 20 to 43, enlisted at some stage. The eldest, Alfred, and his younger brother Francis were married and left their families behind. The women the war turned yellow Sikh soldier statue honours WW1 dead The mother who lost three sons in WW1 All eight served in different regiments and they all saw front line action. Francis, who was known in later life by his middle name Frederick, sent beautifully embroidered silk postcards home from the front line to his wife Gertrude, who he had married in April 1914, just a few months before war broke out. 'A Kiss from France' on a silk postcard sent to Frederick's wife Gertrude Postcards were exchanged between Frederick and his wife Gertrude while he fought on the front line Sadly, the heartfelt messages he wrote in pencil have rubbed off over time. Thirteen months into the war, tragedy struck when the second eldest brother, Thomas William, was killed in action. He died on 25 September 1915 in the Battle of Loos at the age of 38. Frederick Everton served in World War One along with his seven brothers A few months later, in June 1916, Frederick was given 14 days' leave from battle to return to his wife after the death of their daughter Lillian, who was 21 months old. But as the war reached its end, the rest of the Everton brothers came home to their families, and were decorated for their contributions to their country. ""They must have been stars of that community,"" said Mr Jones of the returning heroes. Alfred: Born 1871. Married with one son and two daughters. Served in the Royal Field Artillery, as a gunner Sergeant. Enlisted in August 1914. Was discharged with three war medals. Rosina: Born 1875. Thomas William: Born 1877. Served in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as Lance Corporal. Killed in action in the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. He had previously been listed in north Africa in 1897 for which he received five war medals. He also has a commonwealth grave in France. Francis Frederick: Born 1879. Served in the Royal Garrison Artillery. Married Gertrude Griffiths on 2 May 1914. Rita's mother, Gertrude Rose was born. He was discharged in February 1919 and was awarded three war medals. Died in June 1949. Edwin Charles: Born 1880. Served in the Royal Berkshire Regiment as Corporal. Enlisted July 1915. Discharged in August 1918 with four war medals. Frederick Arthur: Born 1886. Served as Acting Sergeant in the Royal Engineers. Discharged in March 1919 with three war medals. Eliza: Born 1888. Named after their mother. Albert: Born 1891. Served as a gunner in The Worcestershire Regiment. Enlisted in August 1916 suffered a gun shot wound and was discharged in June 1917 with three war medals. Howard: Born 1892. Served in the Duke of Cornwall Light Infantry, then later the Royal Dublin Fusiliers as a Private. Enlisted in August 1914 and discharged with four medals in February 1919. George: Born 1894. Served in the Manchester Regiment. Enlisted in May 1914 and was discharged with four war medals. Linda Withey - Mr and Mrs Jones's daughter, and Frederick Everton's great-granddaughter - said she imagined her ancestors to have been ""quietly proud but at the same time matter of fact with getting on and getting by with everyday life"" during the war. ""For them to have kept the document sent on behalf of the King in such pristine condition and for it to have survived to this day it must have been something that was both treasured but also a reminder that at least one was killed in action,"" she added. ""I also recall being shown these documents on several occasions as a child so it was clearly something that was a matter of pride. ""They were keen to keep the memory of the service given to King and country."" Like so many soldiers who returned from front line action, Francis Frederick Everton never spoke about the horrors he had seen and endured through the war. He lived through World War Two watching one of his daughters, Joan, go through the anguish of seeing her fiancÃ© go to fight but thankfully return safely. Frederick Everton (right) at the wedding of his daughter Joan to Arthur a few years before he died Mrs Jones recalls going to visit her grandfather Frederick every Saturday with her mother Gertrude Rose. ""He was quite a quiet and reserved man (but he was) always there every Saturday,"" she said. Mrs Withey said she had always been aware of the history of her great-grandfather and his brothers. ""Mum said he [Frederick] was a very stout and quite stern man, as was usual at the time I guess."" Frederick Everton - sat third from the right on the seated row - with his comrades of the Royal Garrison Artillery The house stayed in the family and Mrs Withey recalls it ""always smelled of aniseed"". And she fondly remembers a ""treasure trove"" sideboard full of antique glasses. ""I have some of these treasures now myself and they often remind me of that house.""

The march was described by organisers as a ""nation's thank you"" to all those who fought in WW1, and featured descendants of veterans from across the country. Ten thousand people marched past the Cenotaph in London Emma Silk, 47, from Wiltshire, told the BBC she was proud and emotional to be walking in the parade. ""I want to honour the memory of my grandfather - what he did for our freedom,"" she said. Her grandfather lied about his age to join the war in 1917. Emma Silk holds a photo of her grandfather, aged 17. ""He looks so young,"" she says Helen Wightman and Julie Jones travelled to London for the parade Helen Wightman, 67, from Surrey, was in London for the parade with her younger sister, Julie Jones, 53, from Wigan, to remember their grandfather, Charles Izzard. ""I've got six grandchildren and think its important that we remember if it was not for them, we would not have the freedom that we have today,"" Helen told the BBC. They were wearing his medals but details of his experience are hazy. Julie did try to interview him once for a school project but he got too upset.

Robert Malin, whose job it was to carry away the wounded on stretchers, and his grandson Jeremy Cripps wearing his bravery medals Jeremy Cripps, 64 and from South Shields, walked in the parade in honour of his grandfather, Robert Malin. Mr Cripps said his grandfather went beyond the call of duty by going out under fire to rescue wounded soldiers. By Marie Jackson, BBC News The Mall was packed with people proud to remember the part their families played in the war. Dressed in the sombre, dark clothes of remembrance, many wore an ancestor's solitary medal, others row upon row, alongside their poppies. They carried wreaths with carefully crafted messages of thanks and spoke of their pride in their grandfathers, great-grandfathers and great uncles.

"This video can not be played President Trump and President Putin were among the leaders at the ceremony in Paris French President Emmanuel Macron has urged world leaders marking the centenary of the World War One Armistice to reject nationalism. Addressing leaders in Paris - including US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin - he described it as a ""betrayal of patriotism"". ""By saying 'our interests first and never mind the others' you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has - its moral values,"" he said. Events are taking place worldwide. Some 9.7 million soldiers and 10 million civilians died in World War One from 1914 to 1918. Growing criticism as Trump cancels visit due to rain In pictures: Armistice Day Several world leaders also held bilateral meetings at the events. Mr Putin told journalists he had a brief conversation with Mr Trump and that it went well. However, the French organisers of the lunch event changed the lunchtime seating arrangement at the last minute so Mr Trump and Mr Putin would not be sitting next to each other, Russian media reported. Mr Macron and dignitaries walked to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a memorial to France's fallen under the Arc de Triomphe, in the rain under black umbrellas as church bells tolled through the city. In a speech lasting nearly 20 minutes, the French leader called on fellow leaders to ""fight for peace"". Mr Macron urged leaders to ""fight for peace"" ""Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible,"" he said. The service ended with the bugle call that was played at 11:00 on 11 November 1918 to signal the end of hostilities. Mr Putin is also in Paris On Sunday afternoon Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attended a peace conference - the Paris Peace Forum - with leaders including Mr Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mrs Merkel warned that ""blinkered"" nationalism was gaining ground in Europe and elsewhere. On Saturday Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel visited the town of CompiÃ¨gne, north of Paris.They signed a book of remembrancein a railway carriage identical to the one in which the 1918 Armistice was sealed. Mr Trump did not attend the peace conference and left for the US shortly after it began. Earlier he visited a cemetery in Suresnes in western Paris, saying he had gone there ""to pay tribute to brave Americans"" who died in the war. He caused controversy on Saturday by cancelling a trip to another cemetery for the war dead because of bad weather. Protesters from the feminist group Femen also held up placards in front of the Arc de Triomphe before being led away Earlier on Sunday, just before the leaders assembled, a topless female protester with the words ""fake peacemaker"" written on her chest came within a few metres of the US president's motorcade before being apprehended. A group of about 50 activist groups plan to hold a protest in Paris against his visit later. A ceremony was held at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, while in Adelaide an aircraft dropped thousands of red paper poppies. During his speech in Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke of the importance of remembrance, saying people need ""to learn from the past so that we can better navigate the changing currents of our own times"". In New Zealand, a gun salute took place in the capital, Wellington. And in India, memorials were held for the 74,000 troops who died fighting on the other side of the world. ""This was a war in which India was not directly involved, yet our soldiers fought world-over, just for the cause of peace,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Sunday. Meanwhilein the UK, a series of special events is being heldto mark the end of the 1914-18 conflict.

"This video can not be played President Trump and President Putin were among the leaders at the ceremony in Paris French President Emmanuel Macron has urged world leaders marking the centenary of the World War One Armistice to reject nationalism. Addressing leaders in Paris - including US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin - he described it as a ""betrayal of patriotism"". ""By saying 'our interests first and never mind the others' you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has - its moral values,"" he said. Events are taking place worldwide. Some 9.7 million soldiers and 10 million civilians died in World War One from 1914 to 1918. Growing criticism as Trump cancels visit due to rain In pictures: Armistice Day Several world leaders also held bilateral meetings at the events. Mr Putin told journalists he had a brief conversation with Mr Trump and that it went well. However, the French organisers of the lunch event changed the lunchtime seating arrangement at the last minute so Mr Trump and Mr Putin would not be sitting next to each other, Russian media reported. Mr Macron and dignitaries walked to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a memorial to France's fallen under the Arc de Triomphe, in the rain under black umbrellas as church bells tolled through the city. In a speech lasting nearly 20 minutes, the French leader called on fellow leaders to ""fight for peace"". Mr Macron urged leaders to ""fight for peace"" ""Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible,"" he said. The service ended with the bugle call that was played at 11:00 on 11 November 1918 to signal the end of hostilities. Mr Putin is also in Paris On Sunday afternoon Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attended a peace conference - the Paris Peace Forum - with leaders including Mr Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mrs Merkel warned that ""blinkered"" nationalism was gaining ground in Europe and elsewhere. On Saturday Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel visited the town of CompiÃ¨gne, north of Paris.They signed a book of remembrancein a railway carriage identical to the one in which the 1918 Armistice was sealed. Mr Trump did not attend the peace conference and left for the US shortly after it began. Earlier he visited a cemetery in Suresnes in western Paris, saying he had gone there ""to pay tribute to brave Americans"" who died in the war. He caused controversy on Saturday by cancelling a trip to another cemetery for the war dead because of bad weather. Protesters from the feminist group Femen also held up placards in front of the Arc de Triomphe before being led away Earlier on Sunday, just before the leaders assembled, a topless female protester with the words ""fake peacemaker"" written on her chest came within a few metres of the US president's motorcade before being apprehended. A group of about 50 activist groups plan to hold a protest in Paris against his visit later. A ceremony was held at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, while in Adelaide an aircraft dropped thousands of red paper poppies. During his speech in Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke of the importance of remembrance, saying people need ""to learn from the past so that we can better navigate the changing currents of our own times"". In New Zealand, a gun salute took place in the capital, Wellington. And in India, memorials were held for the 74,000 troops who died fighting on the other side of the world. ""This was a war in which India was not directly involved, yet our soldiers fought world-over, just for the cause of peace,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Sunday.

"This video can not be played Emily Thornberry: 'All options on the table' on Brexit Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry has told the BBC ""all options remain on the table"", including a new referendum, if MPs vote down a Brexit deal. She was asked about party leader Jeremy Corbyn's comment to a German newspaper that Brexit cannot be stopped. Labour would prefer a general election, she said, but could campaign for ""a People's Vote"" if it were not possible. Tory cabinet minister Damian Hinds said MPs must ""consider the alternatives"" if they vote down the deal. The government has not yet agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union, ahead of the UK's exit from the bloc next March. UK must not be trapped in Brexit backstop - Leadsom Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Minister quits and calls for new Brexit vote While the UK government says it is 95% agreed - they have been unable to agree on the mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if a future trade deal is not ready in time. On Friday, transport minister Jo Johnson, who voted to remain in the EU, quit the government saying he could not support the deal and called for another referendum. Meanwhile Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker and Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the DUP - whose party's support Theresa May relies on for key Commons votes - have written a joint article in theSunday Telegraph,externalwarning they are prepared to vote down any deal over proposals to manage the Irish border issue. On Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn was quoted in Der Spiegel, having been asked if he would stop Brexit, as saying: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place."" Asked if Brexit could be stopped on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry said the results of the referendum should be ""abided by"" but there had to be an ""injection of democracy"" in between that result and going any further. That should be a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament, she said. But she said Theresa May was only offering a choice between the UK ""falling off a cliff"" - with no deal agreed - or ""get on this bridge to nowhere"", by backing her deal. She said Labour would refuse to ""play that sort of game"" and, if the vote was lost, the party wanted a general election. She added: ""If we don't have a general election, which we think we should have, then yes of course all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a People's Vote but, you know, there are several stages before we get there."" The People's Vote campaign group organised the march in London in October which it said attracted about 700,000 people. The group wants a referendum on the final withdrawal deal. Ms Thornberry said Mr Corbyn's comments had to be seen in context and he was explaining that: ""We had a referendum, that we are democrats over and above everything else."" At the Labour Party conference in September,party members approved a motion that would keep all options- including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. Mr Corbyn has said he would respect the result of the vote. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmerwrote in the Sunday Times,external: ""There is no duty on MPs to surrender to a bad deal."" Instead, he said that MPs would be able to table motions, press amendments and trigger a no-confidence vote in order to prevent the UK leaving without a deal at all. Sir Keir said: ""I remain as convinced as ever that the consequences of no deal would be so severe that it cannot be allowed to happen."" But Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the BBC that people would have to consider a deal as a whole, stating: ""They need to think about what the alternatives are as well. ""It is no good just not liking individual aspects. If you're going to take that view, you have got to have in mind a realistic, viable, deliverable alternative. ""I think people are going to be getting behind this deal and saying 'yeah, let's get on with it'."" He added: ""It is not necessarily going to be something everybody is going to think is absolutely perfectly what they want. ""But that's the nature of these things, there are some trade-offs.""

"This video can not be played Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron shared a tender moment in a ceremony at the site where the Armistice was signed French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have left their own mark of reconciliation at the start of events to mark the centenary of the end of World War One. They signed a book of remembrance in a railway carriage identical to the one in which the 1918 Armistice was sealed. US President Donald Trump is among world leaders attending the events. But Mr Trump caused controversy by cancelling a trip to a US cemetery on Saturday because of bad weather. The day had a tense beginning amid a row between Mr Trump and Mr Macron over European defence. The French leader said the EU needed a joint army now that the US was pulling out of a key disarmament treaty with Russia. Armistice Day commemorations in France May pays respects to WW1 fallen in France and Belgium What does the US contribute to Nato? Mr Trump described the comments as insulting and said Europe should pay its share of costs within Nato, the Euro-Atlantic alliance. After a meeting at the ElysÃ©e Palace, Mr Macron said he agreed that Europe should pay more. Mrs Merkel became the first German leader since World War Two to visit the forest near the town of CompiÃ¨gne in northern France where the Armistice was signed. She and Mr Macron unveiled a plaque to Franco-German reconciliation, laid a wreath and signed a book of remembrance in a replica railway carriage. The original wagon, on which it was modelled, was used by Adolf Hitler to accept France's capitulation to Nazi Germany in June 1940. Mrs Merkel was the first post-war German leader to visit the CompiÃ¨gne site Around 70 world leaders are gathering in Paris for the events. Mr Macron will lead the main event of the centenary - a sombre commemoration on Sunday at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a memorial to France's fallen under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Sunday afternoon will see Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel attend a peace conference - the Paris Peace Forum - with leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. After an hour of talks with Mr Macron and lunch with their wives Melania and Brigitte, Mr Trump had been due to visit one of two American cemeteries on his schedule. But he cancelled his trip to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial due to ""scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather"". White House officials later explained that low cloud would have prevented his helicopter from landing, and cited security concerns about arranging a motorcade to the site. Gen. John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, attended on the president's behalf. The decision attracted much derision on social media, including from President George W Bush speechwriter David Frum who, like many, drew comparisons with the conditions faced by the troops who fought and died in World War One.

Mr Trump responded angrily in a Friday night tweet, writing: ""President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia.
