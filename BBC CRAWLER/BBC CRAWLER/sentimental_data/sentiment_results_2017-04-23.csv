"Note: Battleground seats are defined as those where the winning party had a majority of less than 10% There are 650 constituencies in the United Kingdom. But the election campaign over the coming weeks will be concentrated in the marginal battleground seats - the ones with small majorities that are most likely to change hands. There's no official definition of a marginal seat but people often look at constituencies where the majority - the gap between the first and second placed parties - is under 10%. For politicians it's obviously a good idea to focus on these battleground seats. There's not much point in spending lots of time and money in constituencies that they already hold comfortably, or where they're so far behind they have no realistic chance of winning. There are exceptions to this. In 2015 the SNP surge in Scotland was so powerful that apparently ""safe"" seats fell. And the collapse of the Lib Dems saw them lose some seats they'd held with sizeable majorities. Such large swings are rare though. And even in 2015 the Conservative/Labour fight took place almost exclusively in the battleground seats. Eighteen seats changed hands between the two biggest parties. Only one of those,Ilford North, had a majority above 10%. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  Seats the Conservatives will be gunning for includeMiddlesbrough South and Cleveland East,Birmingham EdgbastonandWirral West. Recent elections have seen poor returns for the Conservatives in the north-east of England but it's a part of the country that voted strongly for Brexit and Prime Minister Theresa May hopes her focus on the issue will help them gain seats. Labour-heldMiddlesbrough South and Cleveland Eastis a good example. Its voters backed Brexit and there's a considerable pool of almost 7,000 voters who went for UKIP last time. That's one group the Conservatives will target. If they trust Theresa May to deliver Brexit, the Conservatives will argue, why vote UKIP? Picking up a decent chunk of them would be enough to overturn Labour's majority of 2,268. Other pro-Brexit Conservative targets in the north of England and the Midlands includeHalifax,Newcastle-under-Lyme,Derbyshire North EastandWalsall North. In all of them there's a sizeable number of people who voted UKIP in 2015 and a small Labour majority. Birmingham Edgbastonis a different sort of target. Its voters were fairly evenly split on Brexit. But it's a relatively prosperous part of the city which used to be a Conservative stronghold. An increase in the number of ethnic minority voters helped Labour last time round but it's always remained in the Conservatives' sights. With Gisela Stuart standing down after 20 years as the MP, they'll see an opportunity. Wirral Westis one of 10 seats lost by the Conservatives to Labour in 2015 - Esther McVey was ousted as the MP after just one term. With their current lead in the opinion polls, they'll be highly optimistic they can take it back - along with other seats lost in 2015 such asCity of Chester,DewsburyandLancaster and Fleetwood. Labour start the election as the clear underdogs compared to the Conservatives. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hopes to win over voters during the campaign. Their top targets includeGower,Croydon CentralandRenfrewshire East. Gower, in South Wales, has the smallest majority of any seat in the country - a mere 27 votes. If just 14 voters switched from the Conservatives, Labour would take it so they will be campaigning for every vote. Before 2015 they'd held it for more than 100 years and it had been considered a Labour heartland seat. Other losses from 2015 they'll want to reverse includeMorley and Outwood, former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls's old seat, andPlymouth Sutton and Devonport. In recent years London has been Labour's strongest region. They made seven gains here in 2015 and Sadiq Khan went on to win the 2016 mayoral election comfortably. Croydon Centralwas a seat they narrowly missed out on last time but they reduced the Conservative majority to just 165 votes. In a sign of their intentions, Jeremy Corbyn went to the constituency on the very afternoon that MPs voted to allow the early election. HendonandHarrow Eastare other London targets Labour lost 40 Scottish seats to the SNP in 2015. In many cases the swing was so massive that they now look beyond reach. But they'll be looking for any signs of the beginning of a fight back.RenfrewshireEast, which used to be Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy's seat, is their top target. Next down the list isEdinburgh North and Leith. The Lib Dems are starting from a low base. They lost 49 seats in 2015, holding on to just eight, and are looking for a recovery this time. Their targets includeTwickenham,Dunbartonshire EastandYeovil. As the most pro-EU of the national parties, the Lib Dems will particularly target seats like Conservative-heldTwickenhamin London, which voted heavily for Remain in last year's referendum and where Sir Vince Cable is returning to refight his old seat. The December 2016 by-election in neighbouringRichmond Park, where they overturned Conservative Zac Goldsmith's 23,000 majority, showed their strategy could work. Other pro-Remain constituencies in their sights includeKingston and Surbitonand, outside of London,BathandCambridge- the latter held by Labour. Dunbartonshire Eastalso voted for Remain but here they must challenge the SNP, another strongly pro-EU party. Nevertheless, the Lib Dems will think they have a chance. Jo Swinson was ousted there in 2015 when the SNP's vote surged by 30%. She's standing again and won't need much of that back to recapture the seat. The pro-EU message probably won't go down so well in Yeovil, which backed Leave in the referendum. But it's a constituency that the Lib Dems held for more than 30 years before it went Conservative in 2015 - Paddy Ashdown used to be the MP - and the broader south-west region used to be a stronghold for the party. Other targets here includeThornbury and Yate, on the outskirts of Bristol, andSt Ivesin Cornwall - a county where the Lib Dems used to dominate. With the SNP already holding 56 out of 59 seats in Scotland it's clearly impossible for them to make significant gains. But they'll be gunning for Labour's only Scottish constituency,Edinburgh South, and they're not far behind in Lib Dem-heldOrkney and Shetland. Plaid Cymru are just 229 votes behind Labour inYnys Mon (Anglesey). But there could also be an intriguing battle inRhonddaif party leader Leanne Wood decides to stand, even though mathematically it's a lot further down the target list. She achieved a tremendous 24% swing there in the Welsh Assembly election last year, so a gain is not out of the question. UKIP's results in 2015 demonstrated again how parties can suffer under the first-past-the-post electoral system. They received 3.9 million votes but won just one seat, Clacton, and even there the victor was Douglas Carswell, who had defected from the Conservatives. The problem UKIP have is that their vote is very evenly distributed compared to the other main parties - in fact, so much so that they're not even a close second in many places. Former leader Nigel Farage fell 3,000 votes short inThanet Southlast time. They're also close inHartlepoolwhere the Labour MP is standing down so that may be their best chance. The Green Party are also badly served by first past the post. The only seat where they start in second place within 10% of the winner is Labour-heldBristol West. The Lib Dems are also a significant presence in that constituency and even the fourth-placed Conservatives got nearly 10,000 votes in 2015 so there a lot of possible outcomes. It may be only two years since the last general election. But in Northern Ireland it's less than two months since voters last went to the polls. The Assembly election held on 2 March saw gains for Sinn Fein and losses for the main unionist parties (UUP and DUP). It would be wrong to assume the general election will automatically follow the same pattern but it will certainly have an impact on the campaign. Sinn Fein will be eager to recaptureFermanagh and South Tyrone- reversing the loss they suffered in 2015. The swing they achieved in March would be enough to get them over the line. Belfast Southis a rare three-way marginal. Both the DUP and the Alliance Party (APNI) are within 10% of the incumbent SDLP. In fact Sinn Fein is less than 11% behind as well so there are lots of possible outcomes. Perhaps the most important factor, here and elsewhere, will be whether all the parties stand. In 2015 the DUP and UUP agreed to co-operate by standing aside for each other in four constituencies. That certainly helped and the UUP have already announced they'll do the same again. Previously the SDLP have refused to enter any deal with Sinn Fein but they are thinking of doing so this time as part of a broader anti-Brexit alliance. That could change the complexion of a number of battleground seats. The contest inSouth Antrimis different. It has an overwhelming majority of unionist voters. The question is whether they'll back the UUP or DUP. The seat has switched between the two parties four times this century. It wouldn't take much of a shift for it to switch again.

"This video can not be played UKIP leader Paul Nuttall says full-face veils hinder integration UKIP's manifesto will include proposals to ban full veils, the party's leader Paul Nuttall has told the BBC. The announcement has sparked strong reaction on both sides of the debate. Nazif, 37, is Muslim. Originally from Afghanistan, he has lived in the UK since 2002. While his relatives do not regularly wear either the burka or the niqab, he is not in favour of an outright ban. ""If it came about voluntarily I would welcome it,"" he said. ""I'm not in favour of the burka. ""But if women want to wear it or they don't, it should be up to the women themselves."" Mr Nuttall hascited security concernsas one of the motivations behind the proposed ban. UKIP manifesto to pledge a burka ban What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? But for Nazif and his family, back in Afghanistan it was the burka which offered security on otherwise dangerous journeys across the country. Travelling to Pakistan, he says they were forced to go through checkpoints controlled by non-government forces. ""Having your face revealed was a sign that you are part of the government,"" he said. ""My sisters wore the veil in order not to arouse suspicion."" When they were safe, they would remove the veil again. ""If they want to ban the veil it must not be banned under the pretext of security,"" he said. ""Paul Nuttall sees it as an election chip but he doesn't know the full reason. ""In my own family's experience it was a way of getting from point A to point B. ""I am 100% behind a move towards phasing out the veil. But encourage those who wear it to feel safe."" Writing on Twitter, social media user Rachel Robbins was equally sceptical of the security pretext for UKIP's proposed ban. But others disagree. Brian, from Lichfield, reflected the mood of much of the correspondence the BBC received. ""It's a security issue,"" he wrote. ""You can't go into a bank or building society wearing a crash helmet or other 'western' headgear that covers the face. ""The same should apply to the burka and the veil."" Mr Nuttall also highlighted concerns about integration as a key reason for proposing the ban. ""I don't believe you can integrate fully and enjoy the fruits of British society if you can't see people's faces,"" he said on theBBC's Andrew Marr programme. Jennifer, who works in Bradford, agreed that full-face veils could be a barrier to integration. ""I've worked in Bradford for a long time,"" she said. ""I'm increasingly seeing more women with their faces covered. ""I see the increase in women wearing it as evidence of the polarisation of these communities and the isolation of these women from mainstream society. ""It seems like a deliberate barrier to separate them."" Marwa, from London, disagrees. Two years ago she decided to start wearing a hijab - a headscarf worn by many Muslim women. The hijab would not be included in the proposed ban. ""A lot of my family don't wear the hijab,"" she said, ""but it was my individual choice. ""I liked the way I felt when I wore it. ""I'm not sure that banning religious expressions and beliefs will help Muslims feel like they're part of Britain. ""It's this kind of barely tolerant attitude that makes Muslims feel further excluded and alienated. ""It seems to me that Mr Nuttall believes that in order to allow women to be free and to be 'integrated' they must first be told how to dress. ""The hypocrisy of his argument is baffling. What is it that he really wants?"" Others have also questioned the motivation behind Mr Nuttall's announcement. Writing on Twitter, Brendan Cox, the activist and husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, suggested the move had more to do with UKIP's poll numbers. Some European countries, including France, already enforce a public ban on full-face veils, while in December 2016 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that wearing full-faced veils should be prohibited in Germany ""wherever it is legally possible"".

"The Women's Equality Party leader says many women are being shut out of the political debate The leader of the Women's Equality Party, Sophie Walker, is to stand against Tory MP and male rights advocate Philip Davies in the election. If elected in the West Yorkshire seat of Shipley, she said she would be a ""voice for all women"" in Westminster. She said Mr Davies had a ""track record of misogyny"", including trying to block laws on domestic violence. Mr Davies said he welcomed his rival ""parachuting herself"" into the seat with a ""politically correct agenda"". Mr Davies, who won the Shipley seat with a majority of more than 9,624 at the last election, is an outspoken critic of political correctness and what he has described as ""zealous"" feminism. The MP, who has warned that men's voices are being ""neutered"" and that their rights must be more strongly defended, caused a stir when he was elected to the Commons equality and women's committee last year. Announcing her candidacy on 8 June, Ms Walker - a former journalist - took a swipe at Mr Davies, suggesting that it was a ""national embarrassment"" that he was on the committee. Mr Davies has claimed militant feminists want to have ""their cake and eat it"" ""Shipley deserves an MP that will represent the needs and interests of all its constituents, instead of one who spends constituency time on a self-indulgent anti-women campaign,"" she said. ""Right now if you live in Shipley, your MP is best known in Parliament as a sexist whose favourite pastime is inventing long speeches to prevent other MPs from passing important legislation such as the provision of free hospital parking for carers and compulsory sex and relationships education in schools."" Ms Walker also criticised the Conservatives' record on equality issues, saying public spending cuts had disproportionately affected women and Brexit would exacerbate the situation. She said she would campaign for a fair immigration system after the UK's exit from the EU, more support for women's pensions and for social justice to be put at the heart of a ""caring economy"". ""Philip Davies' party's austerity policies hit women harder than men and pushed more women into poverty. His party's funding cuts shut vital services to survivors of violence, when two women a week die at the hands of abusive partners."" Mr Davies, who has represented Shipley since 2005 and strongly supported the UK leaving the EU, challenged Ms Walker to back up her claims of sexism with any evidence. ""I have consistently asked Sophie Walker to quote just one thing I have ever said which has asked for a woman to be treated less favourably than a man, and she hasn't been able to find even one quote from the 12 years I have spent in Parliament,"" he told the Observer. ""I would very much welcome Ms Walker parachuting herself into Shipley as a candidate with her extreme politically correct agenda of positive discrimination and quotas, and am very happy to let the good people of the Shipley constituency decide who they want to represent them."" Mr Davies has regularly called for more focus in the Commons on men's issues, including suicide rates and educational under-achievement among young men and what he says is the varying treatment of male and female prisoners. In a speech last year he attacked ""militant feminists and politically correct males"", accusing them of fighting for equality while also seeking special protection when it suited them. Earlier this year, he was accused of trying to block a Parliamentary bill that would force the UK to sign up to the international Istanbul Convention on preventing domestic violence by making a series of long speeches in the House of Commons. The Women's Equality Party, co-founded by comedian and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig, was founded in 2015. Ms Walker stood for London mayor in May 2016.

"This video can not be played UKIP leader Paul Nuttall says full-face veils hinder integration UKIP is to include a ban on the full veils worn by some Muslim women as part of its general election manifesto, its leader Paul Nuttall has said. Speaking on theBBC's Andrew Marrshow Mr Nuttall said wearing a burka or niqab in public was a barrier to integration and a security risk. He also said UKIP could undertake not to stand against Brexit-supporting MPs. Labour MP Chuka Umunna said the country would not take advice from ""hate peddlers"" at UKIP on integration. The UKIP leader suggested that the party would not stand against MPs in marginal seats who supported Brexit, if local parties agreed. Would you support a burka ban? He cited the example of David Nuttall, Conservative MP for Bury North, who is defending a majority of 400. ""What I don't want to see happen is good Brexiteers - not fly-by-night or five-to-midnight Brexiteers, people who've campaigned for years for Brexit - I don't want to see them lose their seats and a Remainer be there in their place,"" he said. However, Mr Nuttall refused to confirm his own plans to stand as candidate in the June 8 election. ""I will make a decision in the coming week about where to stand, obviously I'll be having conversations with local branches,"" he said. ""Nothing is decided."" In February, hefailed to winin Stoke-on-Trent Central, after Labour held the seat. Speaking about full face-veils, Mr Nuttall told the programme: ""We have a heightened security risk at the moment and for CCTV to be effective you need to see people's faces. ""Secondly, there's the issue of integration. I don't believe you can integrate fully and enjoy the fruits of British society if you can't see people's faces. ""I can't walk into a bank with a balaclava on or a crash helmet, if I can't do it and other people can't do it, I don't see why there are special interests for certain people."" Muslim women who defied the ban could face a fine, he suggested. He said that being ""hidden behind the veil"" contributed to 58% of Muslim women being economically inactive. Guide to Muslim headscarves Mr Nuttall said: ""We'll come in line with other European countries such as Belgium, Bulgaria - there's a ban for example in the city of Barcelona, some places in Italy and, indeed, Angela Merkel is talking about this in Germany at the moment. ""Manfred Weber, who's the leader of the biggest group in the European Parliament, is now talking about an EU-wide ban. We can either be on the curve on this or behind the curve."" Labour's Mr Umunnatweeted,externalhis opposition to the measure after the interview. ""Sorry,"" he wrote. ""Britain won't be taking any lessons on integration from the hate peddlers at UKIP."" UKIP member and former donor, Arron Banks - who has publically called Mr Nuttall ""weak"" - also disagreed with the policy. Mr Banks, who is hoping to run as a candidate for UKIP in Clacton, told the BBC's Sunday Politics Show: ""I'm not personally in favour of that. I think people have a right to their religious beliefs. ""I think there are certain circumstances where if it's a security issue - maybe the airports, or public transport - it's acceptable, but I'm not in favour of curtailing people's [freedoms]."" However, he stood by the previous he call made on Twitter for a ban on Muslim immigration into the UK. ""I've said that - I'm not disputing that,"" added Mr Banks. ""My answer is you can't possibly curtail someone's religious freedoms but what you can do is stop adding to the problem."" Mr Nuttall also told the programme that he wanted to prevent Islamic sharia law becoming ""a parallel legal system in this country"". ""It cannot be right that we have court or councils in this country where the word of a woman is only worth half that of a man. That has no place in a liberal, democratic, functioning Western democracy,"" he said. But he said that Beth Din, Jewish rabbinical courts, would not be affected, because they had been established for centuries and the Orthodox Jewish population was falling. The party's manifesto is also expected to suggest that anyone with evidence of female genital mutilation taking place will be bound by law to inform police. And it will also call for postal voting to be largely abolished, because of concerns over electoral fraud. The former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage,proposed a burka ban,externalin 2010. But the party later dropped the policy, and it did not appear in its2015 manifesto,external. Full-face veils are alreadybanned in publicin some European countries, including France.

"Theresa May has said the election is needed because Westminster is divided over Brexit Theresa May's claims that a general election victory will strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations have been called ""nonsensical"" by the European Parliament's chief Brexit co-ordinator. Guy Verhofstadt, a long-standing critic of Brexit, wrote inThe Observer,externalthat it was ""irrelevant"" whether the Conservatives increased their majority. Instead, Mrs May appeared to be driven by ""political opportunism"", he said. Mrs May says the poll is needed because Westminster is divided over Brexit. The decision to hold the election on 8 June - three years earlier than scheduled - was approved on Wednesday, with 522 MPs in favour and 13 against. Guide: What you need to know about the election May's general election statement in full Which MPs are quitting - and who might stand? Mr Verhofstadt wrote: ""The theory espoused by some, that Theresa May is calling a general election on Brexit in order to secure a better deal with the EU, is nonsensical. ""Will the election of more Tory MPs give Theresa May a greater chance of securing a better Brexit deal? ""For those sitting around the table in Brussels, this is an irrelevance."" Mr Verhofstadt added that many in Brussels believed the chances of a deal were being eroded by Mrs May's ""tough negotiating red lines"" and a lack of ""political room for manoeuvre"" domestically. He said there was no guarantee ""a sprinkling of additional Conservative MPs on the backbenches"" would change this. ""Indeed, it appears this election is being driven by the political opportunism of the party in government, rather than by the people they represent,"" he added. Guy Verhofstadt accused Mrs May of being motivated by ""political opportunism"" Mrs May has argued that an increased Commons majority would strengthen her hand in the Brexit negotiations, making it more difficult for the opposition parties at home to obstruct her plans. In her speech on 18 April, announcing the decision to call an election, she said: ""Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country. ""So we need a general election and we need one now, because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin.""

"From unattainable house prices to disappointing pay rises, the financial challenges faced by young adults can seem daunting. How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why. It used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier. This is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows. Then we had the financial crisis of 2008. The upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them. For example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of Â£27,000 at the age of 28, compared with Â£28,000 for those born in the 1970s. The figure was Â£21,000 for those born in the 1960s and Â£15,000 for those born in the 1950s. Despite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age. By their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about Â£27,000 each, on average. By the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - Â£53,000 each. A large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither. At the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s. Home ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30. Similarly,the Local Government Association reportedin December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago. The lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices. How to own a home by the age of 25 The country where 70% of millennials are homeowners Vent your rent: The campaign laying bare the insides of London homes Give up avocado toast and buy a house? In their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs. At the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing. For today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage. Lower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income. Of course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices. The vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues. This is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire. The schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous. In their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme. This compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s. In 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes. With stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially. But those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future. Of those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance. This figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance. Our data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued. Within each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off. Among the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance. This compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%. Data is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s. So, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations. But most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation. It looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.

"I know some rather annoying crows in the Somali port town of Berbera. Every morning, as I eat my breakfast by the beach, they swoop down and steal my bread, my jam, even my butter. Then they fly back up to their perches on a tall metal fence. They look like sentries, their black feathers gleaming, beaks curved and sharp. ""The Russians brought those birds,"" an elderly Somali tells me. He shows me the giant site of the old Soviet military base, the still-functioning runway they built during the Cold War to counter US influence in the Horn of Africa. At more than 4km (2.5 miles) in length, it's one of the longest on the continent. Fast-forward nearly half a century and, once again, Berbera, now part of the self-declared republic of Somaliland, is full of chatter about military bases. That is because a deal has just been struck for the United Arab Emirates to build a facility there. There is talk of MPs being bribed handsomely to accept it. Some Somalis feel this is part of yet another effort to colonise their country. They have even started a social media campaign - #UAEHandsOffSomalia. The Emirates already have a base in Eritrea,,externaljust up the coast, which is used to conduct war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, a short way across the sea. Turkish workers are a familiar sight in Somalia Travel in the other direction and you hit a huge Turkish base stretching along the beach south of the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Engineers working on its final touches tell me it's going to be Turkey's largest overseas military training camp. The base is just a small part of Turkey's massive involvement in the country, which started in 2011 during the first famine of the 21st Century. Somalia is an eccentric choice for a gateway into Africa but, like other foreign powers, Turkey wants influence, prestige and economic gain. It sometimes feels like Mogadishu is a Turkish colony. As soon as you land at the airport, red and white Turkish flags seem to outnumber the sky blue Somali ones. Many of the staff at the glistening new Turkish-built terminal come from Turkey. They tell me they do not like living in Somalia - it is too hot and there are too many explosions. US troops to help fight against al-Shabab Frank Gardner: Maritime piracy threatens to return Somalia's rocky road to democracy Somalia hopes for better future despite attacks Talk to the United Nations and to what, in development jargon, are called Somalia's ""traditional donors"" - in other words, the US and Europe - and they say, fairly diplomatically, that although they appreciate the efforts of the ""newcomers"", there is a lack of co-ordination. Too many countries are training too many different sections of the Somali security forces, which are already fractured and have a tendency to fight each other almost as much as they fight the local partners of al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State. I also get the sense that they are a tiny bit envious of all the kudos countries such as Turkey, Qatar and the UAE get for rebuilding Mogadishu and flying in supplies for people affected by the current drought. Population15 million (UN, 2015) Area637,657sq km (246,201 sq miles) Major languagesSomali, Arabic, Italian, English Major religionIslam Life expectancy55 years (men), 58 years (women) CurrencySomali shilling ""They are small fry doing highly visible projects,"" one Western diplomat tells me in his base inside the heavily protected international airport. ""We do far more but we prefer not to shout about it."" America in particular has good reason not to show off about its activities in Somalia, which include drone attacks and vast amounts of financial assistance. The 1993 helicopter downings in Mogadishu shocked and angered the US It cannot forget Black Hawk Down, when its troops withdrew in humiliation after a Somali militia shot down two of its helicopters in Mogadishu in 1993, dragging naked bodies of US servicemen through jeering crowds. At times, Somalia seems like a vast international marketplace with foreign diplomats, private security companies and a few bold businessmen coming to ply their wares. There is vast profit to be made in securing and rebuilding a broken country that has come top of the ""failed states"" list for several years in a row. Plus there's oil, minerals, fish, livestock and a fabulously strategic location. The regional powerhouse, Ethiopia, is not at all happy about Somalia's new friends, especially those from the Gulf. It sees Egypt behind all of this, plotting reprisals for the giant dams Ethiopia is building, which Egypt fears may starve it of waters from the Nile. Somalia is situated by globally important sea lanes Pessimists see real danger in this geopolitical realignment. They fear a war, with Somalia and Eritrea, emboldened by their new Gulf allies, taking on Ethiopia. More conflict in an already volatile region would threaten the global economy. Most of Europe and Asia's maritime trade, worth about $700bn (Â£550bn) a year, goes through the narrow Bab-el-Mandeb strait between Eritrea and Yemen. The optimists see opportunity, with a thriving Red Sea zone opening up new economic partnerships and giving landlocked Ethiopia increased access to desperately needed ports. Somalis are worried about unintended consequences. Just like the US, which in 1993 saw a well-meaning humanitarian effort turn into a humiliating nightmare, they say all this friendship from the Gulf is going to end in trouble. ""Look at the Taliban of tomorrow,"" says a Somali friend, pointing towards neatly dressed children in the playground of a Saudi-funded school. ""A new Cold War is being fought on our land, and one side, the West, doesn't even know it.""

"The player's kit suppliers Head and Nike have stood by her Maria Sharapova faces the biggest challenge of her tennis career - namely her return to the sport after a 15-month drugs ban -  and it is not just her continued sporting success that is in the spotlight. Off the court, where she makes the bulk of her earnings, the question is - can she be as big a sponsor draw as she was before her enforced absence? The 29-year-old will return to action on Wednesday, 26 April, in Stuttgart after being handed a wildcard. Althoughsome fellow playershave expressed misgivings, she has the support ofthe WTA tour,external, andher fans,external. And, withbiggest commercial rival,externalSerena Williamsannouncing she is pregnantand facing time away from the game, the Russian's return is certainly timely. In the year from June 2015, Forbes estimates the five-time Grand Slam winner made $1.9m (Â£1.5m) in prize money from playing, but a whopping $20m from endorsements, a sum matched only by Williams. And it is this primary source of earnings that Sharapova will be looking to reinvigorate. Sharapova has participated in Evian promotional events during her ban ""During her time out there will have been some continued relationship with her sponsors,"" says Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford. ""But I am sure there will have been some sort of penalty clause in her sponsor contracts for incurring a suspension."" FollowingSharapova's admission in March 2016that she had tested positive for a banned drug at that year's Australian Open, she was initially banned by the International Tennis Federation for two years,later reduced on appeal. But unlike golfer Tiger Woods,who haemorrhaged sponsors,externalvery quickly after his extra-marital affairs came to light, Sharapova's backers waited to see how things played out. ""That was because they had invested so much money and effort into their deals,"" says Prof Chadwick. ""Also, to terminate deals could have been dangerous as she might come back successfully, and if you as a sponsor have decided to cancel her contract then the door has been left wide open for a rival."" Sharapova's deal with Tag Heuer was not extended As it wasthe sponsor reaction was mixed- Head and Evian were immediately supportive, Nike and Porsche put their relationships on hold but later came back on board, while Tag Heuer and Avon chose not to extend deals that had ended. Given the large amounts of money and time invested - Nike's relationship with the player dates back to when she was 11 years old - it is not surprising the major brands wanted to think hard before reaching their decisions. ""In terms of brands and reputation, what all this has highlighted is that first of all Sharapova is a major brand in her own right,"" says Karen Earl, chairman of the European Sponsorship Association. ""She commands a lot of media attention, as the furore about her comeback demonstrates. It also highlights that she is a huge star, and that women's tennis feels it needs her. ""That is one of the reasons why brands want to continue to associate with her. Those that stuck with her value the association of her brand with their brands."" The player's extensive fan base has remained loyal Mrs Earl says the fact that Sharapova immediately put her hand up and admitted the drugs breach helped mitigate the damage to her brand, and those of her partners. ""Sharapova admitted she had done a wrong thing. ""She has gone out of her way to recognise what she has done and has handled that situation in a credible way. She has been contrite and said it will not happen again,"" says Mrs Earl. ""The fact there hasn't been a public outcry against her return will have reassured brands to stick with her. ""If there had been protests from tennis fans, then that might have influenced her sponsors' decisions."" Prof Chadwick says Sharapova's management and advisers, those who look after her profile, grabbed hold of a difficult situation very quickly. He believes the Russian is now pushing at an open door with regards to her return to the sport, withWTA boss Steve Simon quoted,externalas saying: ""I believe that the game, the fans, the tour... everybody is going to welcome Maria back."" Even before Serena Williams' pregnancy announcement, Prof Chadwick says that the sport was struggling to find an heir apparent at the top of the women's game. ""There is not a great deal of highest-quality talent following on behind,"" he says. ""Nobody seems to be able to string together a consistent run of results. Women's tennis needs all the help it can get in terms of heroes, big names, elite talent to attract fans to the sport. ""As a constellation of female tennis player brands, the sport has been somewhat diminished by Sharapova's absence."" The Russian took part in an exhibition match with Monica Puig in Puerto Rico in December 2016 Mrs Earl points out that while many players have not taken too kindly to Sharapova's return, for her sponsors the important thing is the welcome she will receive from her fans, who are potential purchasers of their products. ""The sponsors are not endorsing her because she has been the most successful player, it is because of what she brings off the court,"" she says. ""Her persona and brand are what is most important. She knows how to market herself. She is commercially astute. ""To her credit, even after her time away, she is still probably the most marketable female tennis player.""

"Ray Davies' new album contrasts the America of his childhood dreams to the reality he discovered while living in New Orleans ""Sorry, I'm chewing gum,"" says Ray Davies five minutes into our interview, before extracting the offending substance from his mouth. It's a fitting interruption. We're here to talk about his latest album, Americana, which charts his love-hate relationship with the US - and there's nothing more American than chomping on a stick of Wrigley's. Of course, our most recently-ennobled rock star is best known for his writing about England on songs like Waterloo Sunset, Muswell Hillbilly, Sunny Afternoon, Dedicated Follower of Fashion, but his obsession with the States started early. As a schoolboy, he was captivated by black and white cowboy movies and the be-bop records his older sisters would bring home. After receiving a guitar for his 13th birthday, he devoured records by Muddy Waters and Slim Harpo. His love affair with the blues was so strong that when he wrote The Kinks' first hit single, You Really Got Me he intended it to be ""a blues song"". ""Then it turned out to be a pop hit."" Somewhat disingenuously, he tells the BBC You Really Got Me was supposed to be The Kinks' only song (even though it was their third single). ""I wanted that to be a hit and then I was going to get out of town,"" he says. ""Unfortunately they asked me to write another one, and another one."" The star recently received a knighthood for services to music The Kinks' success meant Ray and his younger brother Dave could finally visit the Land of the Free - but things didn't go entirely to plan, as he describes on the new album. ""They called us The Invaders, as though we came from another world,""he sings. ""And the man from immigration shouted out, 'Hey punk, are you a boy or a girl?'"" The band could have overcome the prejudice if they weren't already in disarray - prone to fighting on stage, and let down by a promoter who refused to pay them in cash. Things came to a head while taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965. ""Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late,"" Davies wrote in his autobiography X-Ray. ""Then he started making anti-British comments. Things like 'Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks he can come over here and make a career for himself.'"" A punch was thrown, and the American Federation of Musicians refused to issue the Kinks permits to perform in the US for the next four years. ""It was a terrible blow to our career,"" says Davies. ""We couldn't tour. We couldn't play Woodstock. ""Being a bolshie 21-year-old, I said, 'Let's make records and tour the rest of the world'. ""But deep down I was really hurt, because America was the inspiration for much of our music."" The Kinks' hits included Sunny Afternoon, All Day and All of the Night and Set Me Free When the band were finally allowed back, in 1970, they had to start from scratch, plying their trade in tiny clubs and high school gymnasiums. ""It was quite a humbling experience after being really successful before,"" Davies recalls. Yet the US became the band's lifeline in the 1970s, providing adulation, success and financial reward as interest dwindled at home. ""We ended up playing Madison Square Garden in 1980, which is a sign you've made it back. So it was a 10-year programme. It was hard work but, in a strange way, we built a loyal fanbase in that time."" So perhaps it's no surprise that Davies sings  ""I want to make my home/Where the buffalo roam"" on the title track of his new album. Indeed, he moved to the US for several years, finding his spiritual home - and sanctuary - in New Orleans. ""I'm just another person there, which is really nice,"" he says. ""And I fitted in with the music scene."" Living across the road from a church, he would frequently witness the city's brass band funerals, which stretch through the streets in celebration of local musicians and dignitaries at the end of their life. But his sojourn in the city ended badly one Sunday evening in January 2004. Davies was strolling along an unusually deserted Burgundy Street with his girlfriend Suzanne Despies. A car pulled up alongside them, a young man got out, and demanded Despies' purse. She handed it over without any resistance, but Davies suddenly decided to give chase. His assailant was armed, and shot Davies in the leg, breaking his femur. ""Why did I do it? That's the unanswerable question,"" he says. ""I've never really been the sort of person who would chase a man with a loaded gun. But I did. Foolishly, perhaps, and irresponsibly. But I did it. ""It was one of those heat of the moment situations, and I have no explanation other than that."" Americana, is based on Davies' 2013 memoir of the same name He ended up in hospital, heavily drugged and, for the first 24 hours, an anonymous ""John Doe"". The experience informed a song - Mystery Room - in which the star faces his mortality for the first time: ""My brain's hit a brick wall  / My body's in free-fall."" It's partnered with another track, Rock 'N' Roll Cowboys, which equates ageing rock stars with gunslingers about to hang up their holsters. ""Rock and roll cowboys, where do you go now?"" asks Davies. ""Do you give up the chase like an old retiree? Or do you stare in the face of new adversaries?"" It's a question that's flummoxed many of his 60s contemporaries. Has he ever contemplated giving up? ""Every writer who's written and toured for more than five years reaches a point where they think, 'Do I keep going?' or, 'Where do I go next?'"" he says. ""Every day I wake up and say, 'I love writing songs but do I want to do this?'  and the answer is I do. ""I love making records. I love playing in front of people."" For the new record, he sought the help of alt-country stalwarts The Jayhawks, whose deft arrangements provide a rich backdrop to Davies' wry and incisive lyrics. Was it challenging, I wonder, for him to walk in and take charge of an already-established band? ""It was a diplomatic situation,"" he says... well, diplomatically. ""At first, they were trying to sound English in their backing vocals, but I deterred them from that. ""The reason I picked them is because they just play the songs. They don't embellish too much unless I ask them to, which is great."" The star hopes to tour with the Jayhawks later this year. 'If the diaries coincided, it would be wonderful.' The Americana sessions went so well that there are ""another 20"" songs waiting to be finished and released, all derived from Davies's 2013 book of the same name. ""It's a big work, but I hope it'll be put together for a deluxe record later on."" Is he tempted to write something more topical for that record, given the ongoing political turmoil in the US? ""Everyone who knows my work comes up to me and says: 'It's time to revive Preservation,'"" he says, referring to The Kinks' 1973 concept album and tour, in which a comedian becomes a dictator, funded by big business and using the media as a tool of control. ""It was a fun show but it had quite serious undertones,"" says Davies, ""and I think that sums up America at the moment: it's a fun show withveryserious undertones. ""I do hope America balances itself out. It's slightly off-kilter at the moment. ""He [Trump] has still got to face Congress, and it's still a democratic country. I think the will of the people will be heard, and America's constitution is strong. ""It's a difficult time of re-adjustment for them - but I think in time it'll balance itself out.

"This video can not be played How Rome's rubbish is powering Austrian homes Rome's rubbish is helping to power Austrian homes - and it gets to Austria by train. Rome has been struggling to cope with a rubbish crisis and Austria has spare capacity at a waste-to-energy plant near Vienna. So a deal has been struck. The Italians are paying Austrian company EVN to dispose of up to 70,000 tonnes of Roman household refuse this year. The waste is transported by train through northern Italy, over the Alps and ends up at the EVN thermal waste utilisation plant at Zwentendorf on the Danube. Up to three trains a week arrive at the Zwentendorf plant. Each carries airtight containers loaded with around 700 tonnes of Roman household waste. The refuse is incinerated and converted into hot flue gas, which generates steam. The steam is delivered to a neighbouring power station, where it is converted into electricity, which is used to power 170,000 houses in the province of Lower Austria. How Norway turned rubbish into fuel It may seem counter-intuitive to carry rubbish over 1,000km (620 miles) before disposing of it, but it is part of efforts in the European Union to make cities reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfills. ""It is not crazy,"" insists Gernot Alfons, head of the EVN thermal waste plant. For him it is an environmentally friendly solution and the rubbish trains are key. ""The other alternative would be to put this rubbish into landfill, which creates a lot of methane emissions that create a lot of impact in terms of CO2 emissions. ""It is much better to transport this waste to a plant which has a high energy efficiency like ours."" The trains travel more than 1,000km to Zwentendorf in eastern Austria... ...where the waste is sorted and incinerated before being used to power thousands of homes Even in elegant districts like Prati, near the Vatican, it is not hard to see that the city has a rubbish problem. Overflowing communal bins for both household waste and recycling are a common sight, and a lot of Romans are very unhappy. ""I think it is outrageous,"" Claudia Grassi, a resident of Rome told me. ""The beautiful town of Rome is being insulted. It is like a beautiful woman that has been wounded again and again."" Rubbish overflows in the elegant streets of Prati near the Vatican Antonio La Spina, professor of sociology and public policy at Rome's LUISS University, says the city produces more waste than it can cope with. ""One factor is the remarkable amount of waste that is produced per capita in Rome. Another is that the share of (separated) waste is increasing. ""That's a good thing in general, but not if the authorities aren't ready to deal with it all - which they aren't. ""Another problem is the fact that the landfills are full - and some are already a big environmental problem, and need to be closed."" Rome's landfill sites are so full, he says, that the authorities have not only had to look beyond the region, but beyond Italy, to dispose of their waste. But it is not just the lack of space. The rubbish problem is also political. Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi's vow to tackle the rubbish crisis has hit the buffers Waste disposal and other public services in Rome have been plagued by more than mismanagement. In 2014, an investigation known as Mafia Capitale laid bare corruption and tainted bidding in city services, including rubbish collection. Rome's Raggi finds it tough at the top When in Rome shake up the politics Rome's new Mayor Virginia Raggi, from the populist Five Star Movement, came to power last year promising to clean up the city. But she ran into trouble almost immediately. The person she appointed as the city's rubbish tsar, Paola Muraro, was forced to resign after it emerged she was under investigation for alleged wrongdoing during her 12-year stint as a consultant to Rome's rubbish collection agency, AMA. Not a pretty sight: Rome's Campo de' Fiori is a mess for several hours a day Ms Muraro has denied allegations of impropriety. But Mayor Raggi is under pressure. In Campo de' Fiori, one of Rome's most attractive markets, rubbish piles up on the cobblestones almost every afternoon, amid the flower and vegetable stalls. Rubbish collectors eventually arrive to clean it up, but Vladimir, who works at a local restaurant on the square, shakes his head. ""It is disgusting here for two or three hours a day, until they clear it up. Tourists who come here are in shock. In the centre of a European capital, this is not normal.""
