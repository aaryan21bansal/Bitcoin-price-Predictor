"This video can not be played On Saturday student Emma Gonzalez, an organiser of the march, told lawmakers: ""Shame on you!"" Young survivors of Wednesday's school shooting in Florida have announced a national march on Washington to demand political action on gun control. Student organisers told US media that they were determined to make Wednesday's shooting a turning point in the national gun debate. The attack, which left 17 students and staff members dead, was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. Yesterday protestors chanted ""shame on you"" to US lawmakers and the president. Mr Trump said last year he would ""never"" infringe on the right to keep arms - a long-running and contested debate within the US. In his first public comments on the gun control issue since the attack, Mr Trump blamed the Democrats for not passing legislation when they controlled Congress during the early years of Barack Obama's administration. He also rebuked the FBI for missing signals before Wednesday's school shooting, after the organisation admitted it had failed to act on a tip-off about the suspected shooter Nikolas Cruz. US students demand 'Never Again' Who are the victims? A school shooting comes to 'paradise' Speaking on US television networks on Sunday morning, student survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas announced their March for Our Lives campaign. They are planning to march on Washington on 24 March to demand that children and their families ""become a priority"" to US lawmakers. They want other protests to happen simultaneously in other cities on the same day. ""We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,"" Cameron Kasky, a survivor from the school said. It is one of many student-led protests amassing support on social media in the wake of Wednesday's attack. The students from Parkland have demanded ""never again"" in response to the shooting On Saturday students and their parents - as well as politicians - took part in an emotionally-charged rally in Fort Lauderdale, close to Parkland. Arguably the most memorable moment came when high school student Emma Gonzalez took to the podium and attacked the US president and other politicians for accepting political donations from the National Rifle Association (NRA), a powerful gun rights lobby group. ""If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and... how nothing is going to be done about it, I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,"" said Ms Gonzalez. ""It doesn't matter because I already know. Thirty million dollars,"" the 18-year-old said, referring to donations during Mr Trump's presidential campaign. This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' ""To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA - shame on you!"" said Ms Gonzalez, who took cover on the floor of her secondary school's auditorium during the attack. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA spent $11.4m (Â£8.1m) supporting Mr Trump in the 2016 campaign, and $19.7m opposing Hillary Clinton. Florida shooting: A survivor's story Trump reassures US gun owners The president's views on gun control have shifted over time.In recent years, he has pledged to fiercely defend the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects people's right to keep and bear arms. Last year, he told an NRA convention he would ""never, ever infringe"" on that right. In a tweet late on Saturday, the Republican president accused the Democrats,externalof not acting on gun legislation ""when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. ""Because they didn't want to, and now they just talk!"" he wrote, referring to criticism from Democrats following Wednesday's shooting. Mr Trump - who on Friday met survivors of the attack - has also blamed the shooter's mental health and the FBI's failings. The US news network CNN has invited Florida lawmakers and the president to attend a town hall event with survivors of the attack on Wednesday. This video can not be played What has Donald Trump said in the past about guns and gun control? Saturday's rally coincided with a gun show in Florida. Hundreds of people attended the event at the Dade County fairgrounds, despite calls to cancel it. How Trump turned against gun control Five reasons US gun control won't happen Mr Cruz, 19, is a former student at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He was reportedly investigated by local police and the Department of Children and Family Services in 2016 after posting evidence of self-harm on the Snapchat app, according to the latest US media reports. A depressed loner 'crazy about guns' Tales of heroism from Florida attack Child services said he had planned to buy a gun, but authorities determined he was already receiving adequate support, the reports say. The reports come afterthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) admitted it did not properly follow up on a tip-off about Mr Cruz last month. The 5 January tip was not the only information the FBI received. In September, a Mississippi man reported to the law enforcement agency a disturbing comment left on a YouTube video under Mr Cruz's name. Florida Governor Rick Scott called for FBI director Christopher Wray to resign over the failures to act. In a late tweet on Saturday, the President rebuked the organisation for their handling of tip-offs. ""Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign."" 'Shame on you' - Florida students chant.

"This video can not be played The prime minister told ITV's This Morning there were 'issues' with university tuition fees The prime minister has called for better value for students in England, but has ruled out completely scrapping tuition fees. Theresa May has launched her review of tuition fees and university funding, to be chaired by the author and financier, Philip Augar. Labour has said it would abolish fees and bring back maintenance grants. But Mrs May said scrapping fees would push up taxes and mean limiting the number of university places. Will the fee review really make any difference? Kuenssberg: What will May do? Reality Check: Would cutting fees really help poorer students? 10 charts showing the impact of tuition fees Which degrees earn the most? The prime minister, in a speech in Derby, said she remained committed to the principle that students ""who benefit directly from higher education should contribute directly towards the cost of it"". Announcing the year-long review of student finance and university funding, Mrs May warned that the system has failed to deliver sufficient competition on price. Almost all courses are charged at the maximum Â£9,250 per year and interest rates are up to 6.1%. The prime minister said students in England faced ""one of the most expensive systems of university tuition in the world"" and ""the level of fees charged do not relate to the cost or quality of the course"". There are ""serious concerns"" about the cost among parents and grandparents as well as students, she said. There is a temporary freeze on fees at Â£9,250 and that is likely to be extended for at least another year during the review. But there were no signs from ministers of any radical cutting in the headline price of fees. This video can not be played The education secretary wants more variety in the fees charged Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the review was an ""unnecessary waste of time"" and showed that ""Theresa May has finally admitted that her government got it wrong"". ""Labour will abolish tuition fees, bring back maintenance grants and provide free, lifelong education in further education colleges,"" said Ms Rayner. But the prime minister said that completely scrapping fees would be unfair and damaging to universities. She argued it would mean higher taxes for those who did not go to university and would mean universities had to compete for funding with schools and hospitals, with the likely outcome that limits would be introduced on the number of university places. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he wants""more variety"" in the level of fees, rather than almost all courses and universities charging the maximum amount. He also calls for more flexibility in how courses are delivered, such as two-year degrees, encouraging ""commuter degrees"" where students live at home and making it easier for part-time students and those who want to carry on working while studying. Former Labour education minister, Lord Adonis, called for a more significant change - arguing that fees should be much lower or abolished, in the way that had happened in Germany. He accused universities of being ""bloated"" on high fees and said they needed to ""get real"" over how much they should charge. Lord Adonis rejected the idea of different subjects having different costs as a ""big backward step"", which would reduce numbers applying for science subjects, if they became more expensive than arts and humanities. The tuition fee review also will consider ways of reducing costs such as cutting interest rates on loans and reintroducing maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, as well as examining the level of fees. UK reacts to 'underwhelming' earthquake Sexual 'exploitation' warning to driving instructors WATCH: Ram-raid on Rolex shop caught on camera Mrs May said that sure poorer students should have an ""equal chance"" in higher education - but that at present they had the greatest burden of debt. Students from poorer families are offered bigger loans for living costs than better-off students, who are expected to be partly supported by their parents, but it means they graduate with bigger debts. Restoring maintenance grants for poorer students, scrapped last year, would reduce their level of borrowing. Support for vocational training and apprenticeships in ""post-18 education"" will also be considered. The prime minister warned that the route into further technical and vocational training is ""hard to navigate"", saying the standards across the sector ""are too varied"" and the funding ""is patchy"". This video can not be played Five things you should know about your student loan debt The Treasury select committee, chaired by former education secretary Nicky Morgan, has raised concerns about the high level of interest rates. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says students in England face more than Â£5,000 in interest charges before they have even left university - contributing to average graduate debts of more than Â£50,000. Other former Conservative and Labour education ministers Ms Greening, Lord Willetts, Lord Adonis and Charles Clarkehave all raised concerns about the level of interest charges. Universities can charge up to Â£9,250 per year Students do not pay this up-front, but can borrow the full amount They can also take a loan for living costs Disadvantaged students can borrow more for living costs, on the assumption that better-off students are supported by their parents Interest of up to 6.1% is charged on loans from when students start at university Students begin to repay loans once they earn Â£21,000, with this threshold being raised to Â£25,000 Any unpaid debts are written off after 30 years In Scotland's universities,there are no fees for Scottish students,external InNorthern Ireland,external, fees are up to Â£4,030 InWales,external, fees are up to Â£9,000 with plans for higher levels of maintenance support Mrs Morgan has also called for more support for part-time students, saying that their numbers had ""collapsed"". She said that the review needed to find a way to encourage more flexibility in courses and costs, saying that when the fees system was introduced it was ""naively assumed"" there would be be more competition. But there have been warnings against different levels of fees for sciences or humanities and arts, or for different types of university. Lord Willetts said higher fees for courses with the highest graduate earnings would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", giving even more money to the most advantaged courses and institutions. Labour's Angela Rayner says fees are unsustainable and should be scrapped Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, backed calls for more flexible approaches - such as two-year degree courses - but warned that setting different fee levels would be a ""bad idea"". Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, said the current system needed to be ""better understood and feel fairer to students"". The priorities should be support for disadvantaged students and reversing the collapse in numbers of part-time and mature students, said the university group leader.

"The students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were well practised on how to respond in an active shooter situation - the school has lockdown drills, security systems and restricted entrances. But a sole gunman on Valentine's Day was still able to kill 17. From the school's survivors, and other students across the US, movements have sprung up in its aftermath rejecting what has been dubbed the ""new normal"" for their generation. Thousands of teenagers, including many still too young to vote, have become grassroots activists. Social media has become a tool for their ideas and campaigns to spread. Their calls for gun control are not different to those in the aftermath of other tragedies - but the maturity and voracity of the students publicly voicing their demands has led many on social media to say this time feels different. ""In Newtown the students were so young they couldn't stand up, but trust me - we are going to be the change,"" Parkland survivor Alex Wind told the BBC. As Wednesday's atrocity took place, he was forced to huddle in darkness with 60 other students for over an hour and a half as shots rang out throughout their school. Alex and four of his friends founded the Never Again campaign in the immediate aftermath.,externalNow over a dozen of them are tirelessly campaigning and making the rounds on US cable news networks to share their message that the school's survivors will not back down. ""It is absolutely insane that a 19-year-old cannot purchase alcohol but can walk in and buy an AR-15 - a weapon of war, by all means a weapon of mass destruction,"" he said. Who are Florida victims? A school shooting comes to 'paradise' Why the NRA wields so much power ""You don't need this to protect your home or your family, its absolutely absurd you can sell it commercially."" They have announced the March for Our Lives to take place on 24 March, in conjunction with the Everytown for Gun Safety, calling for the prioritisation of children's lives in the gun control debate. This video can not be played On Saturday student Emma Gonzalez, an organiser of the march, told lawmakers: ""Shame on you!"" Student Cameron Kasky, also 17, said the group's aim is to ""create a new normal where there's a badge of shame"" on politicians accepting donations from gun lobbyists. ""My message for the people in office is: You're either with us or against us. We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,"" he told CNN. The group are encouraging other students around the country to join with them and protest - a movement that is already happening online. Lane Murdock, who is 15 and lives in Connecticut, was one of the students who saw events in Florida and felt mobilised to try and make a difference. ""When I saw the news the most saddening thing was that it felt normal,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm from Connecticut where Sandy Hook happened - I've been surrounded by this reality all of my life."" She, like other US students, has grown up learning lockdown drills since she was in elementary school. She remembers her first at seven years old. ""We all hide in the safest corner, huddle together with our knees up against our chest while our teacher turns off the lights, closes the blinds and locks the door."" She had the idea to launch an online petition for a national student walk out on the anniversary of the Columbine attack. After a ""whirlwind"" few days,Lane's campaign has garnered tens of thousands of followers and signatures,external. The teenager, who says she has ambitions of being a journalist, is now liaising with national advocacy groups to make sure any strike action is cohesive and effective. Her mother, Bari, says that she is ""beyond proud"" of her daughter. ""If anything is going to change, it is up to our youth. We're failing our children - I hope it takes off,"" she said. Another student hundreds of miles away from Wednesday's attack, Violet Massie-Vereker, had her own simple and provocative idea to draw attention to the reform debate. Following on from the success of the #MeToo campaign, she proposed a twist exposing the reality for student and parents' concerns with #MeNext? She stood with a sign outside her high school in Pelham in New York alongside several other students and local parents. ""A number of people have told me it's frightening and powerful, and really sends a message,"" the 16-year-old told the BBC. At her high school, the shooting was followed by a special assembly, where the principal gave an address to students where they went over their lockdown procedures. ""She told us, I wish I could assure you that nothing could happen here, but I can't,"" Violet said. Florida: A survivor's story Tales of heroism in Florida attack Celebrities call for change, not prayer Others have joined in their social media campaign, posting pictures themselves or of their children online with their own signs.Their Facebook page now has over 10,000 likes of its own,external. ""It's a drop in the bucket within the debate, but I sincerely believe this is the beginning of the end. Students should harness their fears to help promote a change."" In West Michigan,teenagers from Kalamazoo Central High School started their own petition titled ""Students Fighting Guns Since Adults Won't"",external. It has almost 50,000 signatures. Julia Kemple-Johnson, 17, said the idea came from a discussion between friends a day after the Parkland shooting. She said they felt like they were having a discussion about gun violence every other week. Mackenzie Jones, 15 from Chesterfield, Virginia joined in the online #MeNext? campaign ""I can't remember a time when I didn't know about mass shootings,"" she told the BBC. ""Our teacher told us that Columbine was a wake-up call at the time, but we were born after that and we are just so used to it, so desensitised."" They are trying to work with groups from Colorado and connect with survivors in Florida. Their aim is to contact their local state representatives asking for the introduction of mandatory waiting periods for background checks, and a review of semi-automatic weapons. In Maine, students from Mount Desert Island High School held their own silent protest to the attack. The networks are growing hourly, and the groups' teenage organisers are trying to intersect to create cohesive action. Tweets by survivors from Wednesday's Florida attack are now being met with hundreds of shares and messages of support from their national peers. Whether meaningful change is enacted from the emotional response remains to be seen, but thousands of students without the power to vote are doing their very best to make their voices heard.

"Who should pay for university? And how much? The government is to launch a review of fees The starting pistol for the review of university tuition fees in England will be fired early next week. Or at least that's the latest claim in the political twisting and turning over one of the toughest domestic decisions facing a fragile government. The last time Theresa May's review of fees seemed to be approaching, neither the education secretary Justine Greening nor the universities minister Jo Johnson seemed particularly enthusiastic - and within weeks both of them were out of their jobs. The new team - Damian Hinds and Sam Gyimah - will know they have to deliver, with the prime minister and Mr Hinds expected to lead the charge. As they head for the weekend TV studios, the next big question is what problem the fees review is trying to solve? Is it trying to kill off a political problem - with middle England still unconvinced by young people leaving university with Â£50,000 in debts and interest rates up to 6.1%? Or is it trying to find a fairer way of balancing the cost between student and taxpayer - and to support those who might currently be missing out, such as those in vocational training and those wanting to study part-time? Theresa May said her review of fees would show: ""We have listened and we have learned."" There are some outcomes that are predictable. For instance, the freeze on annual fees at Â£9,250 is going to stretch further than this year. You can't announce a review to show you are listening and then increase fees even more, so there will either be a long-term freeze or a big cut. Lord Willetts, a former universities minister and author of A University Education, says the review could be politically ""high risk"". The government can't ""trump Corbyn"", with Labour having already established its promise to scrap fees. Lord Willetts argues that the current system is essentially a good model - it ensures that students do not have to pay up-front and it ensures universities the reliable funding that allows them to keep widening access. Where he would make changes, he says, is to reduce interest rates and give students more financial support when they are studying. This would also help parents who end up paying for their student children's living costs. There have been suggestions - often attributed to the Treasury - that the review will consider varying the level of fees depending on the likely return in graduate earnings. Applications in England this year have fallen even below the slump that occurred when fees rose to Â£9,000 But Lord Willetts says this would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", concentrating more funding in the most prestigious universities and in courses that lead to the most lucrative careers. A former Labour education secretary, Charles Clarke, says the review will need ""absolute clarity of purpose"", because it is such a complicated system with so many interlocking parts. ""No one seems to know what the aim of the reform in 2018 will be,"" he says. Justine Greening says wrong to scrap maintenance grants 10 charts that show the impact of tuition fees Universities will want to put a bad year behind them Mr Clarke says that linking fees to the likely financial returns of specific courses would ""significantly reduce fees for millions of students"". He backs cutting interest charges - and says that poorer students should have access to maintenance grants. In a theme that the current education secretary is likely to keep hearing, Mr Clarke also highlights the need to provide more support for students when they are studying. He says there should be loans that cover the real living costs and that since students are adults, this shouldn't be dependent on parental income. The former education secretary, Justine Greening, thinking more freely from the backbenches, wants maintenance grants reinstated and has raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts. Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham and biographer of prime ministers, also wants a return of maintenance grants. Damian Hinds faces calls for the review to be widened to include funding for vocational courses He wants a cut in interest rates for loans, saying the current level ""undermines the credibility of the whole scheme"". But he wants a clearer message that repayments from students are a form of graduate contribution and not a ""debt"". There are also calls for the fees review to be much wider than academic study at university - and to look more broadly at support for post-18 students taking vocational courses. Should fees vary depending on how much students are likely to earn? Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, recently warned that taxpayers were currently expected to ""lavishly furnish universities"", when the real shortage was in vocational skills. But universities face their own problems. This year's Ucas application figures have been much worse than superficially they might have appeared. Among applicants in England, the numbers are the lowest since at least 2009 - even below the slump that happened when fees trebled in 2012. There is also an emerging pattern of high status universities getting bigger and attracting more applicants, while others, often doing the hardest work in widening access, are seeing a collapse in student numbers and funding. If universities were Monty Python characters, they would be like the knight who has his arms and legs chopped off - and says ""It's only a flesh wound."" They never want to look like they are in trouble. But behind their shiny prospectuses and fixed smiles, there are some university leaders who are seriously concerned about a review that can only bring them less money. The dispute over whether tuition fees are fair has seen all parties switch sides But this is about politics and this is a subject which has a remarkable track record for sudden switches. It is easy to forget that in 2005 Theresa May was a shadow minister going into a general election with a Conservative manifesto promising to scrap all tuition fees. In the previous year, it had been Labour that had been on the ropes over plans to increase fees to Â£3,000 per year. In the general election, the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, lead the Tory campaign to end fees. He lost his seat to a youngster called Tim Farron and his education brief went to another newcomer, David Cameron. Whatever happened to them?

"Students re-live Wednesday's shooting in Florida - and demand tougher gun laws from their government. Where would you expect a school shooting to happen? Where would you expect 17 people to be shot in the head, in the heart, in the arms and legs, while waiting for home-time? Not here, surely. Not among the palm trees and picket fences. Not among the golf courses, the gated communities, the fortnightly farmers' market. Lanny James, 77, spends the winter in Margate, 5 miles (8km) from Parkland. He bought his place four years ago, but has been coming to Florida since 1976. He was playing golf when he heard the news. Four dead when he finished his round; 17 dead when he got home. ""I just love South Florida,"" he says. ""But this is supposed to be paradise. These things aren't supposed to happen."" But they did happen: here, where the sky is blue, the grass is green and it's legal for 18-year-olds to buy semi-automatic rifles. The Stars and Stripes at half-mast outside a gated community in Parkland, a town of 31,000 people At 14:06 local time (19:06 GMT) on Wednesday, Nikolas Cruz got into an Uber. At 14:19, he got out at Stoneman Douglas, the school that expelled him last year. Cruz, 19, walked into the school and took out his rifle, which he bought 12 months earlier. At 14:21, he started shooting. Two minutes later, the fire alarm went off. Darryl Verna, 17, knew the alarm wasn't a drill. They had a drill that morning, and they never happen twice a day. But he didn't think it was serious. ""I thought it was a prank at first,"" he says. So, like he did that morning, he went outside, by the gates, and waited for the alarm to stop. Darryl's friend, Kaleb Martinez, 16, was also outside. Like Darryl, he wasn't worried. Then he looked to his right. ""I see 10 to 12 cop cars just flying down Holmberg [Road],"" he says. ""Cop cars don't fly like that unless something's happening."" Darryl Verna and Kaleb Martinez As the cops flew towards the school, the teachers came flying out. ""Staff, coaches, they were shouting 'Everybody back inside, everybody back inside,'"" says Kaleb. ""I looked at Darryl and thought 'This is serious.'"" Minutes after walking out, the students ran back into school. Some were screaming. Darryl, Kaleb, and around 50 others went into the band room. A teacher told them to get behind a chair and keep their heads down. Kaleb asked what was happening. The teacher wouldn't say. ""Code Red, lockdown, that's all they said,"" says Kaleb. ""But I got phone calls, text messages. That's when I knew."" By then, police were in the school, looking for Cruz. In the band room, fear rising through their stomachs, the students could hear the search. ""The cops are saying, 'He's in the south end, north end, third floor,'"" says Kaleb. ""I can hear the kids they were evacuating, and they're screaming."" This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' Cruz entered the school on the ground floor and fired into three classrooms: 1214, 1215 and 1216. He went back to 1216, fired again, back to 1215, fired again, then moved onto 1213. Cruz went to the first floor, fired into another room, then climbed the stairs to the second floor. It was three minutes after he started shooting. By then, Aaron Feis was dying. Feis, 37, was a security guard and assistant coach for the school's (American) football team. When he saw Cruz, he shielded the students and took a bullet. He died in hospital. ""He was the nice coach, the one you could always talk to, the one who would always do you favours,"" says Yohance Williams, the 17-year-old linebacker for the high school football team. ""If you didn't have a parking pass, and you wanted to park in the senior lot, he would let you. He would let it slide."" One of Yohance's classmates was also killed: Meadow Pollack, an 18-year-old called ""beautiful inside and out"" by her family. ""She was in my law class, first period,"" says Yohance. ""I saw people posting on Snapchat, 'Have you seen this girl? Have you seen this girl?' Then I saw [she had died] this morning."" To lose a classmate and a coach, like Yohance did, should not be normal. Now, at Stoneman Douglas, it is. An impromptu prayer on the pavement near the school on Thursday, the day after the attack After reaching the second floor, Cruz dropped his backpack and his rifle. He ran down the stairs, past the people he killed, then left the building at 14:28 (19:28 GMT). Students were running west, away from the school. He joined them. In his maroon Stoneman Douglas shirt, and his rifle left behind, Cruz blended into the crowd. The difference was, they were fleeing. He was escaping. Trinity Smith, 16, was in the crowd heading west. She was in a hallway when the shooting started; at first, she thought the popping came from culinary class. Then she saw people running. The teachers tried to lead students to Westglades, the middle school next door. But, to a backdrop of screaming and sirens, people ran for their lives. ""They were jumping fences,"" says Trinity. ""They were running home, right into the intersections [main roads]. ""They weren't really listening to the teachers. They were basically in fight or flight mode."" FBI admits botching tip on Florida gunman Florida shooting: A survivor's story A depressed loner 'crazy about guns' Florida shooting: Who are the victims? As she ran, Trinity tried to speak to her mum. She didn't have her phone, so she borrowed someone else's. Her mum told her to meet her at Walmart, next to Westglades. The traffic was heavy, so her mum left her car and walked, scanning the crowd for her daughter. ""I had to find her without a phone,"" says Trinity. ""I had to get through all the people crying and panicking. I was surrounded by people, none that I knew."" Trinity spent 10 or 15 minutes in the crowd, looking at faces, trying to find her mum. ""She was calling out for me,"" says Trinity. ""I was about to pass her, then I heard my name. She saw me and the relief came."" After she met her mum, Trinity's dad picked them up in his car. He didn't want them walking because he heard the gunman had escaped. He was right. At 14:50 (19:50 GMT), Cruz walked into Walmart - the same Walmart - bought a drink, then headed to McDonald's. This video can not be played Florida shooting suspect appears in court While Cruz was in McDonald's, Darryl and Kaleb were in the band room, heads down, wondering if they would live. ""People kept calling our phones,"" says Darryl. ""We were making sure our relatives knew we were alright. We were lying, of course, but we didn't want anyone outside to panic."" At one point, Darryl sent his mum a text: ""I'll be home soon, I love you, don't worry about it."" Eventually - after two hours, says Kaleb - a Swat team burst into the band room. ""They checked the room, they were looking at everybody, asking if anyone had injuries,"" he says. ""They were making sure we could get out. Then we got out."" By then, Cruz had been caught. After leaving McDonald's he walked south; he was arrested 1.5 miles (2.4 km) away, at 15:41 (20:41 GMT), in the next-door town of Coral Springs. A police report records his interview. ""Cruz stated that he was the gunman who entered the school campus armed with an AR-15, and began shooting students that he saw in the hallways and on the school grounds,"" it says. ""Cruz stated that he brought additional loaded magazines to the school campus, and kept them hidden in a backpack until he got on campus to begin his assault. ""Cruz also admitted that as students began to flee the campus on foot, he decided a plan to discard the AR-15 and vest with the additional magazines so he could blend into the crowd."" The vigil in Parkland, organised by Church United Less than 24 hours after Cruz started shooting, a vigil was held at Parkridge Church, a mile from the school. Sitting outside, hundreds of people prayed, and sang, and cried. Some wore t-shirts saying ""faith, family, friends"". Yohance Williams' shirt said ""faith, family, football"" instead. There were 15 speakers, all from churches. Second-up was Rosalind Osgood, a member of the Broward County School Board, which covers Stoneman Douglas. ""It is time for us to prioritise not only academic achievement, but the emotional and spiritual wellbeing of our children,"" she told the crowd, looking for solutions. ""Our children need you and they need me."" The students at Stoneman Douglas do not disagree. But what they really want, they say, is tougher gun laws. This video can not be played Florida survivors on gun laws: 'Something has to change' ""Every school shooting that happens,"" says Darryl, ""that's the first thing they say - 'Oh, they have mental issues.' ""It's not mental issues. It's a gun problem. It's a problem of how easy it is to get a gun."" School shootings have become part of American life: 32 dead at Virginia Tech in 2007; 27 dead at Sandy Hook in 2012; 17 dead at Parkland in 2018. The list goes on. Darryl's sister, Meme, 17, was also in school on Wednesday. They were texting each other, making sure they were okay. ""I understand it's our second amendment right to bear arms,"" she says. ""Okay - bear an arm. But this [a semi-automatic rifle] is something the military has. You shouldn't have these things."" Her friend, Trinity - who found her mum outside Walmart - agrees. ""You can protect yourself with a pistol,"" she says. ""You don't need high-powered rifles."" Trinity Smith and Meme Verna After the vigil, people find their cars, tears rolling down their faces. Yohance stays behind, talking to reporters. ""Things like this shouldn't be allowed to happen,"" he says. ""The guy had an AR-15. He's 19 years old. How does stuff like this happen? ""People should feel safe at school. You shouldn't have to worry if some kid is going to shoot the school up. ""It's nonsense, it's dumb, it shouldn't happen. Not cracking down on it is ridiculous to me."" As he speaks, 17 silver balloons rise into the blue sky. Florida goes on, but Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School - and its 3,000 students - have changed forever.

"The level of fees and debt for students is going to be the subject of a major review More ""variety"" is needed in the price of university education, the secretary of state said ahead of a government review of the system. Damian Hinds also suggested tuition fees should reflect each degree's value ""to our society as a whole"". It comes as a committee of MPs said there was no justification for such ""high interest rates"" on student loans. Labour said another review would not solve the problems posed by interest rate increases and fee rises. A day of reckoning for tuition fees? 10 charts showing the effect of tuition fees The review, to be launched by Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday, will consider cutting or freezing Â£9,250 tuition fees and lowering interest rates to reduce levels of graduate debt. There will also be discussion of funding for vocational courses and apprenticeships to tackle skills shortages. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hinds would not go into specifics about the review, which he said would be carried out by an independent panel. Damian Hinds became education secretary in January's reshuffle He defended the current system - under which students begin to repay fees when they earn over Â£21,000, rising to Â£25,000. But he said that when it was devised, ministers had not expected so many courses to be charging the same fee. ""What we need to look at is the different aspects of pricing - the cost that it is to put on the course, the value that it is to the student and also the value to our society as a whole and to our economy for the future,"" he said. He said politicians would not be setting the price of different courses, but added: ""What we are doing in the review is looking at how that system works, making sure there are alternatives, making sure there is more variety."" This could include cheaper ways of delivering university education like shorter courses and part-time study, he said. Mr Hinds' predecessor as education secretary, Conservative MP Justine Greening, said student finance should not be a ""political football"" and warned against the issue being ""kicked into the long grass"" with a review. She predicted the review would face a ""challenge"" in trying to work out which degrees were most beneficial to the country. Labour's education spokeswoman Angela Rayner said the government had announced three reviews of tuition fees in 12 months and that another one would not ""solve the problem of the hike in interest rates which this government has done and the tripling of tuition fees"". BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan This might have been heralded as taking an axe to tuition fees, but in practice it sounds more like prudent pruning. Damian Hinds has signalled that university fees and student debts in England are much higher than anyone really expected when the current system was introduced in 2012. The forthcoming review will look for ways to push down the cost - such as lowering interest rates, restoring maintenance grants or reducing fees for some courses. The most definite impact for students is that tuition fees are not going above Â£9,250 any time soon, and the freeze on fees could continue indefinitely. But there is no sign of any radical cutting of the headline figure for fees or pressure for a fundamentally different system. And Mr Hinds seemed to play down suggestions of any intervention from ministers to set different fee levels for sciences, arts and humanities. On schools, Mr Hinds has positioned himself as a pragmatic traditionalist. He's supportive of grammar schools - but there are no plans for any new grammars to be opened. And he will revive the prime minister's stalled plan to allow more free schools to be set up by faith groups. According to the Treasury select committee, the review should reconsider the level of interest rates and whether these charges should be applied when students are still studying. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that students in England will run up more than Â£5,000 in interest charges before they have even left university. Former Conservative and Labour education ministers Ms Greening, Lord Willetts, Lord Adonis and Charles Clarke have allraised concerns about the level of interest charges. Nicky Morgan says there is no convincing reason for such high interest charges on loans for fees There is also a call to consider reinstating maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, after these were abolished last year. Committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan, a former education secretary, warned that the maintenance loans available to students were not enough to cover all their living costs. ""If a student can't access additional sources of income, they may be priced out of university,"" said the committee chairman. The MPs are also asking for a clearer explanation of why such a high level of tuition fee is necessary. The review of fees, first promised in the autumn by the prime minister, will examine whether students are paying a fair amount, whether it is the most efficient way of funding universities and whether students are getting value for money when they are graduating with an average of Â£50,000 in debt. It will also consider the funding of the broader post-18 education system and whether students not on three-year degree courses are getting enough support. Part-time student numbers fell sharply after the last fees increase - and the Treasury Select Committee has called on the review to find ways to reverse this. Peter Horrocks, vice-chancellor of the Open University, said the committee of MPs ""rightly recognised that part-time students have been the real victims of the 2012 reforms"". ""The collapse in part-time student numbers in England is undermining attempts to tackle the skills crisis in the economy,"" said Mr Horrocks. Day of reckoning for tuition fees?

"This video can not be played On Saturday student Emma Gonzalez, an organiser of the march, told lawmakers: ""Shame on you!"" Young survivors of Wednesday's school shooting in Florida have announced a national march on Washington to demand political action on gun control. Student organisers told US media that they were determined to make Wednesday's shooting a turning point in the national gun debate. The attack, which left 17 students and staff members dead, was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. Yesterday protestors chanted ""shame on you"" to US lawmakers and the president. Mr Trump said last year he would ""never"" infringe on the right to keep arms - a long-running and contested debate within the US. In his first public comments on the gun control issue since the attack, Mr Trump blamed the Democrats for not passing legislation when they controlled Congress during the early years of Barack Obama's administration. He also rebuked the FBI for missing signals before Wednesday's school shooting, after the organisation admitted it had failed to act on a tip-off about the suspected shooter Nikolas Cruz. US students demand 'Never Again' Who are the victims? A school shooting comes to 'paradise' Speaking on US television networks on Sunday morning, student survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas announced their March for Our Lives campaign. They are planning to march on Washington on 24 March to demand that children and their families ""become a priority"" to US lawmakers. They want other protests to happen simultaneously in other cities on the same day. ""We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,"" Cameron Kasky, a survivor from the school said. It is one of many student-led protests amassing support on social media in the wake of Wednesday's attack. The students from Parkland have demanded ""never again"" in response to the shooting On Saturday students and their parents - as well as politicians - took part in an emotionally-charged rally in Fort Lauderdale, close to Parkland. Arguably the most memorable moment came when high school student Emma Gonzalez took to the podium and attacked the US president and other politicians for accepting political donations from the National Rifle Association (NRA), a powerful gun rights lobby group. ""If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and... how nothing is going to be done about it, I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,"" said Ms Gonzalez. ""It doesn't matter because I already know. Thirty million dollars,"" the 18-year-old said, referring to donations during Mr Trump's presidential campaign. This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' ""To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA - shame on you!"" said Ms Gonzalez, who took cover on the floor of her secondary school's auditorium during the attack. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA spent $11.4m (Â£8.1m) supporting Mr Trump in the 2016 campaign, and $19.7m opposing Hillary Clinton. Florida shooting: A survivor's story Trump reassures US gun owners The president's views on gun control have shifted over time.In recent years, he has pledged to fiercely defend the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects people's right to keep and bear arms. Last year, he told an NRA convention he would ""never, ever infringe"" on that right. In a tweet late on Saturday, the Republican president accused the Democrats,externalof not acting on gun legislation ""when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. ""Because they didn't want to, and now they just talk!"" he wrote, referring to criticism from Democrats following Wednesday's shooting. Mr Trump - who on Friday met survivors of the attack - has also blamed the shooter's mental health and the FBI's failings. The US news network CNN has invited Florida lawmakers and the president to attend a town hall event with survivors of the attack on Wednesday. This video can not be played What has Donald Trump said in the past about guns and gun control? Saturday's rally coincided with a gun show in Florida. Hundreds of people attended the event at the Dade County fairgrounds, despite calls to cancel it. How Trump turned against gun control Five reasons US gun control won't happen Mr Cruz, 19, is a former student at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He was reportedly investigated by local police and the Department of Children and Family Services in 2016 after posting evidence of self-harm on the Snapchat app, according to the latest US media reports. A depressed loner 'crazy about guns' Tales of heroism from Florida attack Child services said he had planned to buy a gun, but authorities determined he was already receiving adequate support, the reports say. The reports come afterthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) admitted it did not properly follow up on a tip-off about Mr Cruz last month. The 5 January tip was not the only information the FBI received. In September, a Mississippi man reported to the law enforcement agency a disturbing comment left on a YouTube video under Mr Cruz's name. Florida Governor Rick Scott called for FBI director Christopher Wray to resign over the failures to act. In a late tweet on Saturday, the President rebuked the organisation for their handling of tip-offs. ""Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign."" 'Shame on you' - Florida students chant.

"The level of fees and debt for students is going to be the subject of a major review More ""variety"" is needed in the price of university education, the secretary of state said ahead of a government review of the system. Damian Hinds also suggested tuition fees should reflect each degree's value ""to our society as a whole"". It comes as a committee of MPs said there was no justification for such ""high interest rates"" on student loans. Labour said another review would not solve the problems posed by interest rate increases and fee rises. A day of reckoning for tuition fees? 10 charts showing the effect of tuition fees The review, to be launched by Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday, will consider cutting or freezing Â£9,250 tuition fees and lowering interest rates to reduce levels of graduate debt. There will also be discussion of funding for vocational courses and apprenticeships to tackle skills shortages. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hinds would not go into specifics about the review, which he said would be carried out by an independent panel. Damian Hinds became education secretary in January's reshuffle He defended the current system - under which students begin to repay fees when they earn over Â£21,000, rising to Â£25,000. But he said that when it was devised, ministers had not expected so many courses to be charging the same fee. ""What we need to look at is the different aspects of pricing - the cost that it is to put on the course, the value that it is to the student and also the value to our society as a whole and to our economy for the future,"" he said. He said politicians would not be setting the price of different courses, but added: ""What we are doing in the review is looking at how that system works, making sure there are alternatives, making sure there is more variety."" This could include cheaper ways of delivering university education like shorter courses and part-time study, he said. Mr Hinds' predecessor as education secretary, Conservative MP Justine Greening, said student finance should not be a ""political football"" and warned against the issue being ""kicked into the long grass"" with a review. She predicted the review would face a ""challenge"" in trying to work out which degrees were most beneficial to the country. Labour's education spokeswoman Angela Rayner said the government had announced three reviews of tuition fees in 12 months and that another one would not ""solve the problem of the hike in interest rates which this government has done and the tripling of tuition fees"". BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan This might have been heralded as taking an axe to tuition fees, but in practice it sounds more like prudent pruning. Damian Hinds has signalled that university fees and student debts in England are much higher than anyone really expected when the current system was introduced in 2012. The forthcoming review will look for ways to push down the cost - such as lowering interest rates, restoring maintenance grants or reducing fees for some courses. The most definite impact for students is that tuition fees are not going above Â£9,250 any time soon, and the freeze on fees could continue indefinitely. But there is no sign of any radical cutting of the headline figure for fees or pressure for a fundamentally different system. And Mr Hinds seemed to play down suggestions of any intervention from ministers to set different fee levels for sciences, arts and humanities. On schools, Mr Hinds has positioned himself as a pragmatic traditionalist. He's supportive of grammar schools - but there are no plans for any new grammars to be opened. And he will revive the prime minister's stalled plan to allow more free schools to be set up by faith groups. According to the Treasury select committee, the review should reconsider the level of interest rates and whether these charges should be applied when students are still studying. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that students in England will run up more than Â£5,000 in interest charges before they have even left university. Former Conservative and Labour education ministers Ms Greening, Lord Willetts, Lord Adonis and Charles Clarke have allraised concerns about the level of interest charges. Nicky Morgan says there is no convincing reason for such high interest charges on loans for fees There is also a call to consider reinstating maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, after these were abolished last year. Committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan, a former education secretary, warned that the maintenance loans available to students were not enough to cover all their living costs. ""If a student can't access additional sources of income, they may be priced out of university,"" said the committee chairman. The MPs are also asking for a clearer explanation of why such a high level of tuition fee is necessary. The review of fees, first promised in the autumn by the prime minister, will examine whether students are paying a fair amount, whether it is the most efficient way of funding universities and whether students are getting value for money when they are graduating with an average of Â£50,000 in debt. It will also consider the funding of the broader post-18 education system and whether students not on three-year degree courses are getting enough support. Part-time student numbers fell sharply after the last fees increase - and the Treasury Select Committee has called on the review to find ways to reverse this. Peter Horrocks, vice-chancellor of the Open University, said the committee of MPs ""rightly recognised that part-time students have been the real victims of the 2012 reforms"". ""The collapse in part-time student numbers in England is undermining attempts to tackle the skills crisis in the economy,"" said Mr Horrocks. Day of reckoning for tuition fees?

"Doctors examine wounded patients in a hospital in Kizlyar Five women have been killed in a shooting at a church in Russia's volatile republic of Dagestan. Five others, including a police officer and a national guardsman, were injured, Russian officials said. Two are said to be in a critical condition. A man fired at people leaving an evening service in the city of Kizlyar. The attacker was shot and killed at the scene. He was later identified as 22-year-old Khalil Khalilov, a resident of Dagestan. The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack but did not immediately provide any evidence. Islamic State may threaten Russia's Caucasus Dagestan profile The most dangerous place in Europe? Jihadist shadow hangs over Georgia's Pankisi Gorge The gunman used a hunting rifle, opening fire on worshippers leaving a service during celebrations for Maslenitsa - a traditional pre-Lent festival, Russian media report. Four women were killed at the scene, and another woman died later in a hospital. One of them was an award-winning doctor, Lyudmila Shcherbakova, who had more than 40 years' experience working in Dagestan's hospitals, Tass news agency reports. Russian news outlet RBK quoted an Orthodox Christian priest as saying the attack took place immediately following the afternoon service. ""We had finished the mass and were beginning to leave the church. A bearded man ran towards the church shouting 'Allahu Akbar' (God is greatest) and killed four people,"" the priest said. ""He was carrying a rifle and a knife,"" he added. IS later said - through its information wing Amaq - that one of its ""soldiers"" had carried out the attack. However, it provided no evidence to back up its claims. The Dagestan Muftiate - the administrative body for Sunni Muslims in the region - expressed sorrow over the attack and condemned the gunman as a ""Wahhabi... one of those who espouse pseudo-Islam, which has no connection to true Islam"". Wahhabism is an ultra-conservative form of Sunni Islam followed by Saudi Arabia's ruling family and religious establishment. IS made the claim in the name of its so-called ""Caucasus Province"", the last official branch set up by the group in 2015. The branch has claimed a number of deadly attacks against security personnel in Dagestan. Dagestan, located in Russia's North Caucasus, is an ethnically diverse and largely Muslim federal republic. The Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church called the shooting a ""monstrous crime"" aimed at sowing discord between Christians and Muslims in Dagestan.

"Old paper Â£10 notes will cease to be legal tender from 1 March 2018 At least Â£2.1bn worth of old Â£10 notes need to be spent or exchanged before they cease to be legal tender, the Bank of England says. The deadline to spend or exchange old Â£10 notes - featuring naturalist Charles Darwin - is 1 March. Plastic polymer tenners depicting author Jane Austenentered circulation in September. Currently, weekly returns of paper Â£10s are averaging at a value of Â£85m or 8.5 million notes, according to the Bank. To exchange an old tenner, people can either post the notes to the Bank of England, or visit the Bank in person in the City of London. The Bank will exchange all old Â£10 notes indefinitely. The new plastic polymer Â£10 notes pay homage to author Jane Austen The Bank says people can also try to exchange paper tenners at their local bank or post office. However they are not legally required to accept old notes after the deadline. The Bank does not expect all old Â£10 notes to be returned, because some will have been destroyed, gone overseas or kept as memorabilia. Counterfeiters do not seem keen on targeting old paper Â£5s and Â£10s, according to the Bank.

"Driving instructors are being warned that if they have a sexual relationship with a young student it will now be seen as ""exploitation"". The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) says if instructors become sexually involved with 16 and 17-year-old pupils, even if it's consensual, they could face being punished. In 2016-17 there were 109 investigations into instructor misconduct, which includes inappropriate sexual behaviour. Instructors could be removed from the approved register if they're found to be ""a high risk"". Last year,Newsbeat spoke to one learner driverwho had a bad experience with her driving instructor. ""I started noticing little comments. He'd talk about whether I cycled anywhere and said 'You'd look good in Lycra'. ""He added me on Facebook and would ask me questions about whether I was single. As soon as I ended the lessons, I had a text from him asking me out for a drink."" Jess (not her real name) says this left her ""mortified"" as she thought she was way too young for him. The changes were brought in afterMP Richard Graham asked the Prime Minister Theresa Mayto look into the issue. He said the law should be changed to protect young drivers from ""being groomed by a predatory instructor"" and that instructors should be ""covered by the same rules as teachers"". In 2001, the law was changed to make it illegal for teachers to engage in sexual activity with pupils at their school, if they were aged under 18. Young learner drivers need protection from 'predatory' instructors, claims MP The DVSA says it will investigate serious allegations of improper behaviour and refer its findings to the police. It told Newsbeat that could include instructors using sexualised language, unnecessary physical or inappropriate contact and sending indecent messages or images to their pupils. ""We take the safety of learner drivers extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate any complaints about the conduct of instructors and will involve the police where necessary,"" Andy Rice, DVSA Head of Counter-Fraud and Investigations, said. ""Any driving instructors threatening the safety of learner drivers and failing to meet the 'fit and proper' criteria will be removed from the ADI register."" At the moment, all driving instructors are subject to enhanced criminal record checks which must be renewed every four years. The DVSA says the best way of finding a fully-qualified instructor is to go to www.gov.uk/drivinglessons. You can also check out the full driving instructor code of practice.

"The husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, Brendan Cox, has quit two charities he set up in her memory after allegations of sexual assault were made public. Mr Cox denied assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 - but admitted to ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. He has left posts at More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation a week after theMail on Sunday,externalpublished the claims. Mr Cox apologised for the ""hurt and offence"" caused by his past behaviour. In a statement issued on Saturday, he said: ""While I do not accept the allegations contained in the 2015 complaint to the police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I do acknowledge and understand that during my time at Save the Children I made mistakes."" Save the Children have said the complaints against Mr Cox were investigated in accordance with its procedures. The charity confirmed that Brendan Cox was suspended and a disciplinary process begun but that he resigned before it was completed. The charity also announced that its chief executive Kevin Watkins has ordered a review to establish ""whether the system for dealing with complaints about behaviour in the workplace can be further improved"". Jo Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater said the family would ""support Brendan as he endeavours to do the right thing by admitting mistakes he may have made in the past"". She added that ""Brendan is a wonderful father and I have no doubt about the happiness he brought to Jo."" Mr Cox, who married Jo Cox in 2009, was reported to police in Massachusetts in the US in 2015 for ""inappropriate touching"" while on a trip to Harvard - a claim which he denies. The father-of-two said some of the allegations against him were a ""massive exaggeration"", but conceded that he had at times ""overstepped the line"". In 2015 the Mail on Sunday,externalreported that Brendan Cox had stepped down from his position as chief strategist at Save the Children over allegations of ""inappropriate behaviour"" which he at the time denied. More details of Mr Cox's alleged behaviour emerged after Oxfam issued its own apologyover a sex scandal involving aid workers in Haiti. Labour MP Mrs Cox wasfatally shot and stabbed outside her constituency officein West Yorkshire by a far-right extremist during the EU Referendum campaign in 2016. Mr Cox said it had become ""much more difficult"" to focus on the two charities he set up after his wife's death, the community group More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation. ""For that reason, while away over half term, I decided to step down from my current public roles for the time being,"" he said. Labour MP Jo Cox died after being attacked in her West Yorkshire constituency He added: ""In the past I have focused on disputing what I felt was untrue in the allegations, but I realise now that it's more important to take full responsibility for what I have done."" A spokesperson for the Jo Cox Foundation said the charity ""admired"" Mr Cox's contribution as a trustee. ""The trustees and staff have admired the integrity, commitment and dedication that Brendan has shown in our work to create a positive legacy for Jo,"" they said. Speaking on the Peston on Sunday programme Labour MP and friend of Mr Cox, Jess Phillips, said he was right to step down from his positions at the charities. She said that men were ""going to have to address their behaviour"" but added she didn't like the idea that ""we switch off our feelings about people."" ""I love Brendan. He is my friend. His family are friends with my family. ""It's not enough to just say you're sorry, you have to show the way you are going to change in the future. ""And I think Brendan, more so than many I've seen in this area, is actually trying to do that.""

"Aseman operates the ATR 72-500 Sixty-six people are feared to have been killed in a passenger plane crash in the Zagros mountains in Iran. The Aseman Airlines plane, en route from Tehran to the south-western city of Yasuj, came down near the city of Semirom in Isfahan province. The Red Crescent deployed search and rescue teams to the site. The airline has retracted a statement saying definitively that all aboard were dead. Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT, and crashed about an hour later. The aircraft, a twin-engine turboprop, came down on Dena Mountain, 22km (14 miles) from Yasuj, news channel Irinn reported. Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. The airline initially said everyone had been killed, but said later: ""Given the special circumstances of the region, we still have no access to the spot of the crash and therefore we cannot accurately and definitely confirm the death of all passengers of this plane."" Bad weather, including fog and heavy snow, has hampered rescue efforts. Emergency teams have had to travel to the crash site by land rather than using a helicopter. Passengers' relatives have gathered at a mosque near Tehran's Mehrabad airport, according to Reuters news agency. Grieving relatives gathered at Mehrabad airport in Tehran ""I can't bring myself to believe it,"" said one woman whose husband was on board. One man told Tabnak news website that he had missed the flight. Showing an unused ticket as proof, he said: ""God has been really kind to me but I am so sad from the bottom of my heart for all those dear ones who lost their lives."" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying, in a statement, that the incident brought ""great grief and sorrow"". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet. The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme. Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers. Aseman, Iran's third largest airline, signed a contract with Boeing last year to buy 30 of its latest medium-range 737s. The crashed plane, a French-Italian-made ATR 72-500, was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has also expressed ""deep sympathy"" for relatives of those on board, saying the accident ""saddened the hearts"".

The 29-year-old became the first Briton - and the first skeleton athlete - towin successive Winter Games goldswhen she claimed victory on Saturday on a historic day for Team GB. Asked about her future on Sunday, Yarnold said: ""I need to get over my chest infection first. ""I'll take a break and get back to you."" I feel incredibly lucky - Deas Christie faces race against time to make 1,000m Gold for Yarnold as GB win record three medals on day eight GB curlers beaten in controversial finish Yarnold is now the most decorated British Winter Olympian - above Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, and Jeanette Altwegg - who have one gold medal and one bronze each in figure skating. ""As each minute passes it becomes more of a reality, but it still is an unbelievable series of events, of everything just coming together,"" added Yarnold, who received her medal on Sunday evening. ""There's a whole dream of if everything goes right. 'If I do this, if I get this corner, if that transfers, if the speed comes', everything will work magically'. ""I guess now it's just relief that everything did go to plan."" Five things you may not know about Yarnold: Lizzy Yarnold steps on the podium to receive her second Olympic gold medal Yarnold's sled is called Mervyn, after a former work colleague who sponsored her when she needed money to continue competing. She hoped to become a modern pentathlete before being 'talent identified' and encouraged to take up skeleton. Yarnold often listens to grime music before her races. She listened to Dizzee Rascal moments before her first Olympic triumph in 2014. The 29-year-old's hobbies are knitting and listening to The Archers. Yarnold is known by other members of the British skeleton squad as 'She-Ra' - a cartoon character who is the Princess of Power. This video can not be played Winter Olympics: BBC commentators react to Yarnold & Deas medals Fellow Briton Alex Coomber, who won Olympic skeleton bronze in 2002, praised Yarnold's ""mental grit"" and told BBC Sport: ""No other female has tried to retain this title and one of the reasons is because it is so hard. ""What does she do? I'm sure if Lizzy decides she's achieved everything she can, she will find something else to do and succeed at that."" Yarnold posted a total time of three minutes 27.28 seconds to finish nearly half a second ahead of Germany's Jacqueline Loelling in second, as fellow Briton Laura Deas took third spot. The gold and bronze, in addition toIzzy Atkin'sbronze in the ski slopestyle, meant Britain had won three individual medals in one day at a Winter Games for the first time - eclipsing the two won in 1924.

Laura Deas (left) and Lizzy Yarnold were in high spirits after finding out they had both won a medal British pair Yarnold and Deas have been competing against each other on the World Cup circuit during the past few years, but the Olympic gold medallist highlighted the importance of their friendship. ""We keep each other going with cups of teas and chats along the way,"" Yarnold told BBC Sport. ""The night before my run Laura brought me a massive tub of ice cream so perhaps that helped with my sore throat. ""It's not only in the Olympics [we support each other], it's in every single race - Laura is a phenomenal push athlete so I know I'm always behind her on the start and we always push each other. ""When we come home we share tactics. I know I wouldn't have been on that podium without Laura."" A tearful Yarnold, who said she spent Sunday morning knitting, added: ""It's a good privilege to share this moment with one of my best friends in the world. Thank goodness we pushed each other and now we can have a holiday."" Deas relived the moment the pair knew they had both won a medal, and the joy of sharing the medal podium together. ""The emotions were all over the place,"" the Welshwoman told BBC Sport. ""I knew I was in third position with three more runs to go. ""I could barely watch the screen I was so nervous. It was amazing, I couldn't quite realise what had happened. We just sort of screamed at each other. ""I always believed we could both be standing on the podium. We're competitors on the track, but friends off it. I got emotional yesterday. Not only were we sharing the moment but we were on the podium together. I could not be happier."" 1988:Born 31 October in Sevenoaks, Kent. 2008:Joins the Great Britain skeleton programme after attending a Girls4Gold talent search programme. 2010:Starts competing for Britain, winning two races on the third-tier Europa Cup circuit.

"The husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, Brendan Cox, has quit two charities he set up in her memory after allegations of sexual assault were made public. Mr Cox denied assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 - but admitted to ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. He has left posts at More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation a week after theMail on Sunday,externalpublished the claims. Mr Cox apologised for the ""hurt and offence"" caused by his past behaviour. In a statement issued on Saturday, he said: ""While I do not accept the allegations contained in the 2015 complaint to the police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I do acknowledge and understand that during my time at Save the Children I made mistakes."" Save the Children have said the complaints against Mr Cox were investigated in accordance with its procedures. The charity confirmed that Brendan Cox was suspended and a disciplinary process begun but that he resigned before it was completed. The charity also announced that its chief executive Kevin Watkins has ordered a review to establish ""whether the system for dealing with complaints about behaviour in the workplace can be further improved"". Jo Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater said the family would ""support Brendan as he endeavours to do the right thing by admitting mistakes he may have made in the past"". She added that ""Brendan is a wonderful father and I have no doubt about the happiness he brought to Jo."" Mr Cox, who married Jo Cox in 2009, was reported to police in Massachusetts in the US in 2015 for ""inappropriate touching"" while on a trip to Harvard - a claim which he denies. The father-of-two said some of the allegations against him were a ""massive exaggeration"", but conceded that he had at times ""overstepped the line"". In 2015 the Mail on Sunday,externalreported that Brendan Cox had stepped down from his position as chief strategist at Save the Children over allegations of ""inappropriate behaviour"" which he at the time denied. More details of Mr Cox's alleged behaviour emerged after Oxfam issued its own apologyover a sex scandal involving aid workers in Haiti. Labour MP Mrs Cox wasfatally shot and stabbed outside her constituency officein West Yorkshire by a far-right extremist during the EU Referendum campaign in 2016. Mr Cox said it had become ""much more difficult"" to focus on the two charities he set up after his wife's death, the community group More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation. ""For that reason, while away over half term, I decided to step down from my current public roles for the time being,"" he said. Labour MP Jo Cox died after being attacked in her West Yorkshire constituency He added: ""In the past I have focused on disputing what I felt was untrue in the allegations, but I realise now that it's more important to take full responsibility for what I have done."" A spokesperson for the Jo Cox Foundation said the charity ""admired"" Mr Cox's contribution as a trustee. ""The trustees and staff have admired the integrity, commitment and dedication that Brendan has shown in our work to create a positive legacy for Jo,"" they said. Speaking on the Peston on Sunday programme Labour MP and friend of Mr Cox, Jess Phillips, said he was right to step down from his positions at the charities. She said that men were ""going to have to address their behaviour"" but added she didn't like the idea that ""we switch off our feelings about people."" ""I love Brendan. He is my friend. His family are friends with my family. ""It's not enough to just say you're sorry, you have to show the way you are going to change in the future. ""And I think Brendan, more so than many I've seen in this area, is actually trying to do that.""

"Old paper Â£10 notes will cease to be legal tender from 1 March 2018 At least Â£2.1bn worth of old Â£10 notes need to be spent or exchanged before they cease to be legal tender, the Bank of England says. The deadline to spend or exchange old Â£10 notes - featuring naturalist Charles Darwin - is 1 March. Plastic polymer tenners depicting author Jane Austenentered circulation in September. Currently, weekly returns of paper Â£10s are averaging at a value of Â£85m or 8.5 million notes, according to the Bank. To exchange an old tenner, people can either post the notes to the Bank of England, or visit the Bank in person in the City of London. The Bank will exchange all old Â£10 notes indefinitely. The new plastic polymer Â£10 notes pay homage to author Jane Austen The Bank says people can also try to exchange paper tenners at their local bank or post office. However they are not legally required to accept old notes after the deadline. The Bank does not expect all old Â£10 notes to be returned, because some will have been destroyed, gone overseas or kept as memorabilia. Counterfeiters do not seem keen on targeting old paper Â£5s and Â£10s, according to the Bank.

"The Polish prime minister has not responded publicly to Israeli criticism Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has sharply rebuked his Polish counterpart for saying that Jews were among the perpetrators of the Holocaust. He said the remarks by Mateusz Morawiecki at the Munich Security Conference were ""outrageous"". Mr Netanyahu said they showed ""an inability to understand history"". The dispute comes weeks after Israel condemned a new Polish law making it illegal to accuse the Polish nation or state of complicity in Nazi crimes. The legislation was signed into lawby President Andrzej Duda but also referred to the country's highest court to consider its constitutionality. He was responding to an Israeli journalist,externalwho asked if anyone who said there were Polish collaborators in the Holocaust would be considered a criminal in Poland under the new law. Mr Morawiecki said: ""It's extremely important to first understand that, of course, it's not going to be punishable, not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators - as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian.... not only German perpetrators."" Mr Morawiecki has not publicly responded to Mr Netanyahu's criticism. It says that ""whoever accuses, publicly and against the facts, the Polish nation, or the Polish state, of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German Reichâ¦ shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of imprisonment of up to three years"". But it adds the caveat that a person ""is not committing a crime if he or she commits such an act as part of artistic or scientific activities"". New Holocaust law threatens 'whitewash' of Polish history The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love The country has long objected to the use of phrases like ""Polish death camps"", which suggest the Polish state in some way shared responsibility for camps such as Auschwitz. The camps were built and operated by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland in 1939. But the more contentious point raised by the law is whether it will outlaw references to acts of individual complicity by Poles with the Nazis - something historians say there is clear evidence for. The Israelis have been furious about the legislation, which Mr Netanyahu has described as an attempt to rewrite history and deny the Holocaust. Deputies from across Israel's often fractious political spectrum have united to denounce it. Following the passage of the law in the Senate, Israel's Foreign Ministry asked to postpone the visit of a senior Polish official. Now, Israeli MPs are backing a bill that would expand Israel's existing Holocaust denial laws to include a five-year jail sentence for anyone denying or minimising the role of Nazi collaborators, including Poles, in crimes committed in the Holocaust. The amended law would also give legal aid to any Holocaust survivor telling their story who is prosecuted in a foreign country. The US state department had also urged the Polish government to rethink,externalits new law. Poland was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany. Millions of its citizens were killed, including three million Polish Jews in the Holocaust. Six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust overall. More Poles have been honoured by Israel for saving the lives of Jews during the war than any other nation. However, historians say others were complicit by acts such as informing on Jews in hiding for rewards, and participating in Nazi-instigated massacres including in Jedwabne where hundreds of Jews were murdered by their neighbours. A historian and well-known ""Nazi-hunter"" at the Simon Wiesenthal Center,Efraim Zuroff, says the number of collaborators runs into ""many thousands"",external.

"Wednesday's attack in Parkland was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012 President Donald Trump has rebuked the FBI for missing signals before Wednesday's school shooting in Florida. The agency was ""spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign"", Mr Trump tweeted. ""There is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud."" The FBI has admitted it failed to act on a tip-off about suspected shooter Nikolas Cruz, who has confessed to the shooting at a high school in Parkland in which 17 people died. It was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012 and has re-ignited long-running debates about tougher firearm restrictions. Earlier, students who survived the shooting rallied in Florida, demanding tighter legislation on gun control and criticising the president for receiving financial support from the National Rifle Association (NRA) during his presidential campaign. Who are the victims? A school shooting comes to 'paradise' The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words In his tweet, he wrote: ""Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable."" He appeared to link the agency's failures in the specific case to the time it has spent investigating possible collusion between Russia and the Trump team during the 2016 presidential campaign. He has repeatedly denied any links with Moscow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier this week, 13 Russians were charged with interfering in the US election, in a major development in an FBI investigation now led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Three Russian companies were also named in the indictment. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday dismissed the charges as ""blather"", saying he would not comment further until he saw ""facts"". Seven key takeaways from the indictments Full text of the Russia indictment It said it did not properly follow up on a tip-off about Mr Cruz last month when a person close to the suspect contacted the agency to provide ""information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behaviour, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting"". The 5 January tip was not the only information the FBI received. In September, a Mississippi man reported to the law enforcement agency a disturbing comment left on a YouTube video under Mr Cruz's name. Mr Cruz, 19, was also reportedly investigated by local police and the Department of Children and Family Services in 2016 after posting evidence of self-harm on the Snapchat app, according to US media reports. Child services said he had planned to buy a gun, but authorities determined he was already receiving adequate support, the reports say. Students and their parents - as well as politicians - took part in the event in Fort Lauderdale, close to Parkland. Thousands of people attended, according to the Associated Press. Arguably the most memorable moment came when high school student Emma Gonzalez took to the podium and attacked the US president and other politicians for accepting political donations from the NRA, a powerful gun rights lobby group. This video can not be played Student Emma Gonzalez to lawmakers: ""Shame on you!"" ""If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and... how nothing is going to be done about it, I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,"" said Ms Gonzalez. ""It doesn't matter because I already know. Thirty million dollars,"" the 18-year-old said. ""To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA - shame on you!"" said Ms Gonzalez, who took cover on the floor of her secondary school's auditorium during the attack. Responding to her passionate speech, the crowds started chanting ""Shame on you!"" Florida shooting: A survivor's story How Trump turned against gun control Five reasons US gun control won't happen According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA spent $11.4m (Â£8.1m) supporting Mr Trump in the 2016 campaign, and $19.7m opposing Hillary Clinton. Wednesday's attack was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012 Ryan Deitsch, who was among those hiding in a school toilet during the attack, urged lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures on gun ownership. ""The least lawmakers can do is vote on something. What's the worst that can happen?"" the 18-year-old said. In another development, a prominent Republican donor is threatening to withhold funding from candidates who fail to endorse legislation against assault weapons. Al Hoffman Jr, a Florida real estate developer, announced the move in an email to several Republican leaders, including the state's governor, Rick Scott, according to theNew York Times.,external In a tweet late on Saturday, the Republican president accused the Democrats,externalof not acting on gun legislation ""when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. ""Because they didn't want to, and now they just talk!"" he wrote, referring to criticism from Democrats following Wednesday's shooting. The president's views on gun control have shifted over time.In recent years, he has pledged to fiercely defend the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects people's right to keep and bear arms. Last year, he told an NRA convention he would ""never, ever infringe"" on that right.""The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end,"" he said.

"Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley and Emma Watson signed the letter to show ""solidarity and unity"". Harry Potter starEmma Watson,externalhas donated Â£1m to a new campaign aimed at helping those affected by harassment. The donation comes as more than 200 female British and Irish stars have signed an open letter calling for an end tosexual harassment,externalat work. Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley are among the other actors to have signed the letter, published inthe Observer,external. Women attending theBafta,externalAwards in London on Sunday night say they will wear black on the red carpet. The move is a show of solidarity with the Hollywood-based movement Time's Up, launched in the wake of sexual abuse allegations by high-profile actresses against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Watson is one of the first donors to the UK Justice and Equality Fund, which has launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay for a new advice network. What to expect at the 2018 Bafta Awards The fund has been set up by the women who have signed the letter, along with a group of 160 people - including academics, activists and charity workers - to help victims ""access support and justice"". Knightley and Tom Hiddleston have each given Â£10,000. Doctor Who stars Jodie Whittaker and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tamsin Greig and Noomi Rapace have each donated Â£1,000. The letter said the Bafta awards ceremony was a time to ""celebrate this tremendous moment of solidarity and unity across borders by coming together and making this movement international"". It states: ""This movement is bigger than just a change in our industry alone."" Center Parcs pulls Daily Mail ads Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux split The playboy who got away with $242m ""This movement is intersectional, with conversations across race, class, community, ability and work environment, to talk about the imbalance of power."" Other signatories include: Gemma Arterton Carey Mulligan Sophie Okonedo Florence Pugh Gugu Mbatha Raw Saoirse Ronan Andrea Riseborough Lily James Claire Foy Gemma Chan Noma Dumezweni Naomie Harris Penelope Cruz, Mariah Carey and Clare Foy were among celebrities who wore black at the Golden Globes The letter continues: ""In the very near past, we lived in a world where sexual harassment was an uncomfortable joke; an unavoidable awkward part of being a girl or a woman. ""It was certainly not to be discussed, let alone addressed. In 2018, we seem to have woken up in a world ripe for change. ""If we truly embrace this moment, a line in the sand will turn to stone."" The decision to wear black at the Baftas follows asimilar demonstration of support at Hollywood's Golden Globe Awardsearlier this year.

"Aseman operates the ATR 72-500 Sixty-six people are feared to have been killed in a passenger plane crash in the Zagros mountains in Iran. The Aseman Airlines plane, en route from Tehran to the south-western city of Yasuj, came down near the city of Semirom in Isfahan province. The Red Crescent deployed search and rescue teams to the site. The airline has retracted a statement saying definitively that all aboard were dead. Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT, and crashed about an hour later. The aircraft, a twin-engine turboprop, came down on Dena Mountain, 22km (14 miles) from Yasuj, news channel Irinn reported. Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. The airline initially said everyone had been killed, but said later: ""Given the special circumstances of the region, we still have no access to the spot of the crash and therefore we cannot accurately and definitely confirm the death of all passengers of this plane."" Bad weather, including fog and heavy snow, has hampered rescue efforts. Emergency teams have had to travel to the crash site by land rather than using a helicopter. Passengers' relatives have gathered at a mosque near Tehran's Mehrabad airport, according to Reuters news agency. Grieving relatives gathered at Mehrabad airport in Tehran ""I can't bring myself to believe it,"" said one woman whose husband was on board. One man told Tabnak news website that he had missed the flight. Showing an unused ticket as proof, he said: ""God has been really kind to me but I am so sad from the bottom of my heart for all those dear ones who lost their lives."" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying, in a statement, that the incident brought ""great grief and sorrow"". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet. The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme. Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers. Aseman, Iran's third largest airline, signed a contract with Boeing last year to buy 30 of its latest medium-range 737s. The crashed plane, a French-Italian-made ATR 72-500, was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has also expressed ""deep sympathy"" for relatives of those on board, saying the accident ""saddened the hearts"".

"This video can not be played Emotional plea to allow medical cannabis for Alfie Requests for a medical cannabis licence to help a boy whose rare form of epilepsy improved after taking the drug have been denied by the Home Office. Six-year-old Alfie Dingley, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, suffers up to 30 violent seizures a day. His parents want to treat him with medical cannabis oil, which is illegal in the UK. The Home Office said the drug ""cannot be practically prescribed, administered or supplied to the public"". A spokesperson added that it can only be used for research. Alfie's mother, Hannah Deacon, said ""you've got to fight for your kids, I want to know that I've done everything I can"". Members of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on drug policy reform is calling on the government to assist with Alfie's plight. Ms Deacon said Alfie's cannabis dose was ""very small"", just three drops of the oil Ms Deacon said Alfie went to the Netherlands to take a cannabis-based medication in September. She said that while there, the medication, prescribed by a paediatric neurologist, saw his seizures reduce in number, duration and severity. At one point while in the UK, Alfie had 3,000 seizures and 48 hospital visits in a year, but while abroad he went 24 days without a single attack. ""It's very rare and very aggressive, there's only nine boys in the world with Alfie's condition,"" Ms Deacon said. ""We never imagined how well it would work. He's just a six-year-old boy, he deserves a happy life. We've found something that makes him happy and now we've got to take that away."" Ms Deacon said his cannabis dose was ""very small"" and he was taking three drops of the oil, which is made using whole plant cannabis. At one point, Alfie had 3,000 seizures and 48 hospital visits in a year Alfie's mother said the steroids he currently takes in hospital could eventually cause his organs to fail if he keeps taking them at the rate he is. ""He doesn't know any different, he's had a very traumatic life. He's held down and injected,"" she said.

Group co-chair, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt said: ""It would be heartless and cruel not to allow Alfie to access the medication. ""Parliament really must look at reforming our laws to allow access to cannabis for medical purposes, which has huge public support."" MPs have called for Home Secretary Amber Rudd to issue a medical cannabis licence The Home Office said it recognised that people with chronic pain and debilitating illnesses are ""looking to alleviate their symptoms"". A spokesperson added: ""However, it is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards before being placed on the market, so that doctors and patients are assured of their efficacy, quality and safety. ""Cannabis is listed as a Schedule 1 drug, as in its raw form it is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit and is therefore subject to strict control restrictions.

"This video can not be played Mr Netanyahu said Iran was falsely denying that it sent a drone into Israeli territory last week Israel's prime minister has launched a stinging attack on Iran, telling a security conference in Munich it is the ""greatest threat to our world"". Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would ""not allow Iran's regime to put a noose of terror around our neck"". In a moment of drama, he brandished what he said was a piece of an Iranian drone shot down in Israeli territory. Iran's foreign minister later dismissed the speech as ""cartoonish"" and not worthy of a response. BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus, at the conference, says this theatricality was vintage Benjamin Netanyahu, from a prime minister embattled at home with potential corruption charges looming over his head. The former US Secretary of State John Kerry later insisted that Mr Netanyahu's assertion that Iran would be on its way to a nuclear bomb within a decade was ""fundamentally not accurate"". Israel shoots down Iranian drone, then attacks Syrian targets Israel warns Iran after launching major raids in Syria In his speech, Mr Netanyahu drew a parallel between the 1938 Munich Agreement, seen as a failed attempt to appease Nazi Germany, and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. He said the deal had only ""unleashed a dangerous Iranian tiger"", against which ""we will act without hesitation to defend ourselves"". Holding up the remnant of drone, of which Iran denies ownership, he addressed Mr Zarif directly: ""Do you recognise this? You should, it's yours. You can take back a message to the tyrants of Tehran: Do not test Israel's resolve."" Speaking later, Mr Zarif called for a new security arrangement for the nations of the Gulf region, warning that without this there would be turmoil. This video can not be played Zarif accused Israel of using 'aggression' as a policy He insisted that Iran was ""not devouring the entire region - we don't believe that's in our interest or even possible. So we need to start talking instead"". He deflected a question about whether Iran could recognise Israel, accusing Israel of using ""aggression as a policy against its neighbours"" and the Palestinians, and saying it was ""trying to escape responsibility for its criminal policies"". As for the nuclear deal, he insisted ""we will not be the first ones to violate an agreement which we did everything to achieve - despite Mr Netanyahu's efforts"". The immediate trigger is last week's confrontation - the first known direct engagement between the Israeli and Iranian militaries. Israel launched raids against Iranian targets in Syria after saying it had intercepted an Iranian drone crossing the Syria-Israel border. Israel lost a fighter jet for the first time in more than a decade During the offensive, an Israeli F-16 fighter jet was shot down by Syrian air defences, its pilots ejecting in northern Israel. It was believed to be the first time Israel had lost a jet in combat since 2006. The rivalry between Iran and Israel has been exacerbated in recent years by the regional instability - from the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, which removed a counterweight to Iranian regional power, to the ongoing proxy war being fought between many different powers in Syria. Israel is a vocal opponent of the 2015 deal struck between Iran and six world powers which lifted sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme. It is a debatable point whether Mr Netanyahu or Mr Zarif was the most welcome guest in Munich, says the BBC's Jonathan Marcus. While there is strong support in Europe for the nuclear deal with Iran, there is a growing sense in several capitals that more must be done to curb Iran's destabilising regional role. It has emerged as one of the great victors from the chaos in Syria. The Israeli prime minister was speaking withthe huge shadow of potential corruption charges hanging over his head. He is likely to have directed his Munich appearance as much at his domestic audience as to the wider international community, our correspondent says, insisting that he remains the essential leader for Israel at a time of growing regional competition.

Tibetan writer Tsering Woeser told AFP she was ""very worried"" about the state of the monastery. ""Tibetans consider Lhasa to be a sacred place, but Jokhang is a sacred place within that sacred place - the most sacred in all of Tibet,"" she said. ""Some people say it's only because of Jokhang that the holy city of Lhasa exists at all."" ""No matter where they are in the world, Tibetans all wish to come to Lhasa to pray at Jokhang; it's the wish of a lifetime. Many who make pilgrimage to Lhasa prostrating do so just to visit the temple,"" she added. The fire comes as Tibetans celebrate Losar, their traditional new year, which began on Friday. The Jokhang monastery, pictured in 2016 Tibet has had a tumultuous history, during which it has spent some periods functioning as an independent entity and others ruled by powerful Chinese and Mongolian dynasties.

"The shortfall of new affordable homes in England will soon be equivalent to a city the size of Leeds, a charity is warning. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says the supply has fallen short of demand by 30,000 every year since 2011. This cumulative shortfall could reach 335,000 by the end of this parliament, trapping families in insecure housing as a result, the charity said. The government said it was investing Â£9bn in the sector. Married parents of three Dawn and Adrian, from Milton Keynes, told BBC Radio 5 live Investigates their family's health had suffered since being forced into temporary accommodation while they wait for suitable social housing to become available. ""Both of us have had issues with mental health and ability to cope,"" said Dawn, who asked that their surnames not be published. ""It's all come to a head, the culmination of that means Adrian's pretty much had a breakdown for the last couple of months and been signed off work,"" she said. Adrian, who like Dawn works full-time, said not being able to afford a home meant that ""being a proud man, at the end of the day, I took a lot of stick to myself. I beat myself up inside. ""Because when you've got a wife and three children, I felt a failure,"" he said. Affordable housingincludes social rental properties, provided through councils or housing associations, or homes in shared ownership. Some of these rental properties may be let to tenants at up to 80% of the market rate. Where can I afford to rent or buy? The government is due to release a green paper on social housing this spring and independent assessments suggest around 78,000 new affordable homes are required in England each year between 2011 and 2031, to meet demand. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation's acting head of policy and research, Brian Robson, said their analysis shows there have been only 47,000 additional affordable homes in England each year over that time. ""If delivery continues at the current rates by the end of this parliament, by 2022 that would have reached 335,000 homes. ""That's equivalent to a city the size of Leeds,"" Mr Robson said. The analysis is part of a briefing document the charity will present to the government on Monday for inclusion in its social housing green paper. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Sajid Javid, and Housing Minister Dominic Raab were unavailable for interview. In a statement, the ministry said: ""We are delivering the homes our country needs and since 2010 we have built over 357,000 new affordable properties. ""But we are determined to do more and we are investing a further Â£9bn, including Â£2bn to help councils and housing associations build affordable homes where they are most needed."" 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 18 February at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

"The Church of England has the third-largest rural estate in the country Church spires could be used to boost mobile and broadband coverage in rural areas under an agreement between the UK government and the Church of England. The government has committed to achieving good-quality mobile connectivity across the UK by 2022. While the agreement encourages churches to sign up, they will still have to negotiate the usual planning process. Digital analysts welcomed the development but said ""the devil would be in the detail"". ""Getting access to suitable sites, particularly in rural areas, has been a real challenge for mobile operators, so any initiative aimed at improving this will be welcomed by the industry,"" said Matthew Howett, principal analyst at research firm Assembly. ""What's not clear, though, is what the commercial relationship looks like. There have been many stories of rural land owners effectively holding operators to ransom for access to some sites, which has slowed down rollout and added considerably to the cost."" The government said commercial arrangements would be made locally between dioceses or parishes and mobile operators and broadband providers but gave no further details. Two-thirds of Anglican churches are in rural areas and their location at the heart of their communities means they are well-placed to help deliver improved mobile connectivity, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said. Secretary of State Matt Hancock said: ""Churches are central features and valued assets for local communities up and down the country. ""This agreement with the Church of England will mean that even a 15th Century building can help make Britain fit for the future, improving people's lives by boosting connectivity in some of our hardest-to-reach areas."" There are already about 120 examples of broadband and mobile services being delivered from parish churches across the country, according to the Church of England. These take a variety of forms - from wireless transmitters in spires to aerials, satellite dishes and cables. The equipment is used to boost both voice and data coverage. The Dioceses of Norwich and Chelmsford have been signed up to programmes for at least five years. The Bishop of Chelmsford, the Right Reverend Stephen Cottrell, said: ""Encouraging churches to improve connectivity will help tackle two of the biggest issues rural areas face - isolation and sustainability. ""Our work has significantly improved rural access to high-speed broadband."" The Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, said using parish churches ""creatively"" would enhance their value to communities. According to Ofcom's figures,external, published in December,  coverage - where a 4G signal is available from all four mobile operators - is currently available across 43% of the UK. For calls and text messaging, 70% of the UK can receive a signal from all four operators. At the time, Lord Adonis, the chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, urged Ofcom to improve mobile service, which he described as ""deplorable"".

"Two-thirds of drivers would risk driving through flood water, despite it being the leading cause of death during a flood, the Environment Agency says. The agency's Caroline Douglass described the statistic, taken from a survey of 18,000 AA members, as ""extremely concerning"". ""No one should put their own life or those of their friends and family at risk during a flood,"" she said. Since 2013, the AA has rescued more than 14,500 drivers from floods. A total of 101 drivers have been rescued from Rufford Lane in Newark, Nottingham, in the past five years. Driving through flood water can also cause serious damage to the vehicle, with three-quarters of flood-damaged cars ultimately being written off, the agency said. Burst main 'leaves people stuck in cars' The 'forgotten city' of the 2007 summer floods It is running a campaign warning people to prepare for flooding in advance bysigning up for warning messages,external. Ms Douglass, the Environment Agency's director of incident management and resilience, said just 30cm of water was enough to float a family car and even less could float smaller vehicles. Source: AA, January 2013 - December 2017 Ms Douglass urged those travelling long distances during the winter to check for flood warnings along their route. ""If you find your way blocked by flood water, never take the risk - turn around and find another way,"" she said. The survey also found that men were more likely to drive through flood water than women - with 72% of male respondents admitting that they would try it, compared with 60% of women.

"The level of fees and debt for students is going to be the subject of a major review More ""variety"" is needed in the price of university education, the secretary of state said ahead of a government review of the system. Damian Hinds also suggested tuition fees should reflect each degree's value ""to our society as a whole"". It comes as a committee of MPs said there was no justification for such ""high interest rates"" on student loans. Labour said another review would not solve the problems posed by interest rate increases and fee rises. A day of reckoning for tuition fees? 10 charts showing the effect of tuition fees The review, to be launched by Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday, will consider cutting or freezing Â£9,250 tuition fees and lowering interest rates to reduce levels of graduate debt. There will also be discussion of funding for vocational courses and apprenticeships to tackle skills shortages. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hinds would not go into specifics about the review, which he said would be carried out by an independent panel. Damian Hinds became education secretary in January's reshuffle He defended the current system - under which students begin to repay fees when they earn over Â£21,000, rising to Â£25,000. But he said that when it was devised, ministers had not expected so many courses to be charging the same fee. ""What we need to look at is the different aspects of pricing - the cost that it is to put on the course, the value that it is to the student and also the value to our society as a whole and to our economy for the future,"" he said. He said politicians would not be setting the price of different courses, but added: ""What we are doing in the review is looking at how that system works, making sure there are alternatives, making sure there is more variety."" This could include cheaper ways of delivering university education like shorter courses and part-time study, he said. Mr Hinds' predecessor as education secretary, Conservative MP Justine Greening, said student finance should not be a ""political football"" and warned against the issue being ""kicked into the long grass"" with a review. She predicted the review would face a ""challenge"" in trying to work out which degrees were most beneficial to the country. Labour's education spokeswoman Angela Rayner said the government had announced three reviews of tuition fees in 12 months and that another one would not ""solve the problem of the hike in interest rates which this government has done and the tripling of tuition fees"". BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan This might have been heralded as taking an axe to tuition fees, but in practice it sounds more like prudent pruning. Damian Hinds has signalled that university fees and student debts in England are much higher than anyone really expected when the current system was introduced in 2012. The forthcoming review will look for ways to push down the cost - such as lowering interest rates, restoring maintenance grants or reducing fees for some courses. The most definite impact for students is that tuition fees are not going above Â£9,250 any time soon, and the freeze on fees could continue indefinitely. But there is no sign of any radical cutting of the headline figure for fees or pressure for a fundamentally different system. And Mr Hinds seemed to play down suggestions of any intervention from ministers to set different fee levels for sciences, arts and humanities. On schools, Mr Hinds has positioned himself as a pragmatic traditionalist. He's supportive of grammar schools - but there are no plans for any new grammars to be opened. And he will revive the prime minister's stalled plan to allow more free schools to be set up by faith groups. According to the Treasury select committee, the review should reconsider the level of interest rates and whether these charges should be applied when students are still studying. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that students in England will run up more than Â£5,000 in interest charges before they have even left university. Former Conservative and Labour education ministers Ms Greening, Lord Willetts, Lord Adonis and Charles Clarke have allraised concerns about the level of interest charges. Nicky Morgan says there is no convincing reason for such high interest charges on loans for fees There is also a call to consider reinstating maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, after these were abolished last year. Committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan, a former education secretary, warned that the maintenance loans available to students were not enough to cover all their living costs. ""If a student can't access additional sources of income, they may be priced out of university,"" said the committee chairman. The MPs are also asking for a clearer explanation of why such a high level of tuition fee is necessary. The review of fees, first promised in the autumn by the prime minister, will examine whether students are paying a fair amount, whether it is the most efficient way of funding universities and whether students are getting value for money when they are graduating with an average of Â£50,000 in debt. It will also consider the funding of the broader post-18 education system and whether students not on three-year degree courses are getting enough support. Part-time student numbers fell sharply after the last fees increase - and the Treasury Select Committee has called on the review to find ways to reverse this. Peter Horrocks, vice-chancellor of the Open University, said the committee of MPs ""rightly recognised that part-time students have been the real victims of the 2012 reforms"". ""The collapse in part-time student numbers in England is undermining attempts to tackle the skills crisis in the economy,"" said Mr Horrocks. Day of reckoning for tuition fees?

"Aseman operates the ATR 72-500 Sixty-six people are feared to have been killed in a passenger plane crash in the Zagros mountains in Iran. The Aseman Airlines plane, en route from Tehran to the south-western city of Yasuj, came down near the city of Semirom in Isfahan province. The Red Crescent deployed search and rescue teams to the site. The airline has retracted a statement saying definitively that all aboard were dead. Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT, and crashed about an hour later. The aircraft, a twin-engine turboprop, came down on Dena Mountain, 22km (14 miles) from Yasuj, news channel Irinn reported. Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. The airline initially said everyone had been killed, but said later: ""Given the special circumstances of the region, we still have no access to the spot of the crash and therefore we cannot accurately and definitely confirm the death of all passengers of this plane."" Bad weather, including fog and heavy snow, has hampered rescue efforts. Emergency teams have had to travel to the crash site by land rather than using a helicopter. Passengers' relatives have gathered at a mosque near Tehran's Mehrabad airport, according to Reuters news agency. Grieving relatives gathered at Mehrabad airport in Tehran ""I can't bring myself to believe it,"" said one woman whose husband was on board. One man told Tabnak news website that he had missed the flight. Showing an unused ticket as proof, he said: ""God has been really kind to me but I am so sad from the bottom of my heart for all those dear ones who lost their lives."" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying, in a statement, that the incident brought ""great grief and sorrow"". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet. The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme.

"OphÃ©lie Gaillard, who is an award-winning cellist, had the valuable instrument on loan An 18th-Century cello has been returned to a French musician after an appeal following her knifepoint robbery. OphÃ©lie Gaillard was robbed of the instrument and her mobile phone outside her home in Paris on Thursday. After putting an appeal on Facebook, she received an anonymous call saying it was in a car outside her home. She found a window smashed but the instrument in ""good condition"". The rare instrument is worth about â¬1.3m ($1.6m; Â£1.2m) Made in 1737 by Italian instrument-maker Francesco Goffriller, it was loaned to Ms Gaillard from CrÃ©dit Industriel et Commercial (CIC) bank. The instrument was stolen in its case, along with a bow that was itself almost 200 years old. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

""The theft was very violent; I have not been able to sleep for two days. I am so relieved to have found it. I'm coming out of a two-day nightmare - it's a miracle,"" she told the AFP news agency. Her original post was shared almost 10,000 times in just two days. Confirming the instrument's return on Facebook, Ms Gaillard thanked everyone who helped with the appeal, and called its return an ""incredible dream"".

"Footage posted online showed flames billowing from the ancient compound A fire has hit the most important shrine in Tibetan Buddhism - the Jokhang Monastery in Lhasa. Footage posted online showed flames billowing from the roof and what appeared to be at least one gutted pagoda. No casualties were reported. Chinese state media said the blaze started on Saturday evening and was soon put out. The extent of damage to the sprawling compound is unclear. State media said there was no damage to cultural relics. Tibet, the remote and mainly Buddhist territory known as the ""roof of the world"", is governed as an autonomous region of China. Tibet profile The Tibet issue: China's view The Jokhang monastery is more than 1,000 years old and is listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site.

Tibetan writer Tsering Woeser told AFP she was ""very worried"" about the state of the monastery. ""Tibetans consider Lhasa to be a sacred place, but Jokhang is a sacred place within that sacred place - the most sacred in all of Tibet,"" she said. ""Some people say it's only because of Jokhang that the holy city of Lhasa exists at all."" ""No matter where they are in the world, Tibetans all wish to come to Lhasa to pray at Jokhang; it's the wish of a lifetime. Many who make pilgrimage to Lhasa prostrating do so just to visit the temple,"" she added. The fire comes as Tibetans celebrate Losar, their traditional new year, which began on Friday. The Jokhang monastery, pictured in 2016 Tibet has had a tumultuous history, during which it has spent some periods functioning as an independent entity and others ruled by powerful Chinese and Mongolian dynasties.

"Authorities did not say whether Mrs Mugabe herself will face charges The vice chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe has been arrested in connection with an investigation into the awarding of a doctorate to former first lady Grace Mugabe. Levi Nyagura was detained by the country's anti-corruption agency, to be charged with abuse of office. Mrs Mugabe was awarded a PhD just months after enrolling in 2014, despite it usually taking years to complete. An investigation was launched after a petition was made by university staff. Members of the sociology department said they had not seen supporting evidence, and called for the nullification of her qualification and a full investigation. The polarising Grace Mugabe The PhD's authenticity was questioned because her thesis was not published alongside others at the time. The document was only published online in January this year, four years after she graduated, and has been the subject of intense speculation since. She was awarded the qualification by her husband and then-President Robert Mugabe, who was also the chancellor of the university at the time. The doctorate title was used on campaign material for Mrs Mugabe as she became increasingly involved in politics. In November Robert Mugabe was ousted from office after 37 years of rule amid growing speculation his wife was lining herself up to replace her aging husband in power.

"The Polish prime minister has not responded publicly to Israeli criticism Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has sharply rebuked his Polish counterpart for saying that Jews were among the perpetrators of the Holocaust. He said the remarks by Mateusz Morawiecki at the Munich Security Conference were ""outrageous"". Mr Netanyahu said they showed ""an inability to understand history"". The dispute comes weeks after Israel condemned a new Polish law making it illegal to accuse the Polish nation or state of complicity in Nazi crimes. The legislation was signed into lawby President Andrzej Duda but also referred to the country's highest court to consider its constitutionality. He was responding to an Israeli journalist,externalwho asked if anyone who said there were Polish collaborators in the Holocaust would be considered a criminal in Poland under the new law. Mr Morawiecki said: ""It's extremely important to first understand that, of course, it's not going to be punishable, not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators - as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian.... not only German perpetrators."" Mr Morawiecki has not publicly responded to Mr Netanyahu's criticism. It says that ""whoever accuses, publicly and against the facts, the Polish nation, or the Polish state, of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German Reichâ¦ shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of imprisonment of up to three years"". But it adds the caveat that a person ""is not committing a crime if he or she commits such an act as part of artistic or scientific activities"". New Holocaust law threatens 'whitewash' of Polish history The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love The country has long objected to the use of phrases like ""Polish death camps"", which suggest the Polish state in some way shared responsibility for camps such as Auschwitz. The camps were built and operated by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland in 1939. But the more contentious point raised by the law is whether it will outlaw references to acts of individual complicity by Poles with the Nazis - something historians say there is clear evidence for. The Israelis have been furious about the legislation, which Mr Netanyahu has described as an attempt to rewrite history and deny the Holocaust. Deputies from across Israel's often fractious political spectrum have united to denounce it. Following the passage of the law in the Senate, Israel's Foreign Ministry asked to postpone the visit of a senior Polish official. Now, Israeli MPs are backing a bill that would expand Israel's existing Holocaust denial laws to include a five-year jail sentence for anyone denying or minimising the role of Nazi collaborators, including Poles, in crimes committed in the Holocaust. The amended law would also give legal aid to any Holocaust survivor telling their story who is prosecuted in a foreign country. The US state department had also urged the Polish government to rethink,externalits new law. Poland was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany. Millions of its citizens were killed, including three million Polish Jews in the Holocaust. Six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust overall. More Poles have been honoured by Israel for saving the lives of Jews during the war than any other nation. However, historians say others were complicit by acts such as informing on Jews in hiding for rewards, and participating in Nazi-instigated massacres including in Jedwabne where hundreds of Jews were murdered by their neighbours. A historian and well-known ""Nazi-hunter"" at the Simon Wiesenthal Center,Efraim Zuroff, says the number of collaborators runs into ""many thousands"",external.

"Sheep meat exports to the EU could be subject to high tariffs if there is no UK-EU Brexit deal MPs scrutinising the government's plans for the agriculture industry after Brexit want funding for farmers when EU subsidies end, they said in a report. Without an EU-UK trade deal, farm exports face tariffs from March 2019. UK shoppers would also likely see price rises from EU imports such as Danish pork and French cheese, the MPs found. However the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it could both ""secure ambitious free trade deals while supporting farmers"". The environment secretary Michael Gove told farmers in January the government would guarantee subsidies at the current EU level only until the 2022 election. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee assessed the impact of World Trade Organization (WTO) levels of tariffs and regulations being applied to UK-EU food trade, if no deal came out of Brexit negotiations. It today published its report, Brexit: Trade in Food. The report acknowledges the Government's intention to agree a comprehensive free trade agreement and customs agreement with the EU, but says ""there is no guarantee that this will occur."" Newport West's Paul Flynn sits on the Commons' environment committee but opposes a recommendation in a report on how leaving the EU could impact the food trade. The Labour MP said a special fund should not be set up to help, becausein some cases it would be ""income support for super rich"". ""In the event that the UK leaves the EU without a free-trade agreement, UK-EU trade will proceed under WTO rules. Reverting to WTO tariffs will have a significant impact upon agriculture as tariffs are higher for agricultural products than for other goods and services,"" the report states. UK exports would become less competitive in EU markets if WTO rules applied. MPs on the committee suggested the switch from the single market to potential import and export tariffs on food between the UK and EU 27 could force the government to offer funding to farmers as they adjust. The report says ""Defra should consider providing a fund to support our food producing industry to adapt effectively to the challenge ahead."" The National Farmers Union (NFU) echoed the report's findings and its chief EU exit adviser Gail Soutar said there would be ""significant impact on Britain's farmers and domestic food supply"" if no deal was reached. The committee said the sheep farming industry could in particular be worse-off if the EU slapped WTO tariffs on UK lamb. The MPs on the committee heard ""the EU is very important for UK sheep meat exports, with more than 95% of its export volume destined for the EU."" UK meat sold in the EU may become ""uncompetitive"" if tariffs are placed on British produce exported to the EU The report said if sheep meat exports defaulted on to the usual tariff, which would increase their prices by 50%, they would become uncompetitive on the EU market. British shoppers would also see prices rise at the supermarket, if this import tax pushed up production costs for food made here or if the UK government slapped tariffs on food imports from the EU. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium said the committee's report highlighted the cost of a no-deal outcome for farmers, food producers and shoppers across the UK. ""If the UK leaves the EU with no trade agreement, the average WTO tariff of 22% that would be applied to imports, would increase prices for consumers... this would be an unappetising hit to their weekly food bills. ""Given that over two thirds of our food that is imported comes from the EU to supplement UK production, the scale of this potential impact is clear."" British produce would become more expensive in EU markets if WTO tariffs were adopted Ms Dickinson said that the UK government should not simply cut all tariffs on imported food to help consumers out. ""The answer does not lie in unilaterally dropping tariffs to zero, due to the devastating consequences this would have for the UK's agricultural industry."" The committee's report said such a reaction would ""put many UK farmers out of business and render the UK dependent on imported food"". The NFU also warned against the country lowering tariffs across the board, which would open the UK market up to more, potentially cheaper, food imports. The industry is concerned cheaper imports will be available because of lower environmental and animal welfare standards in the countries they are produced - and that the UK's import rules may be softened in order to sign trade deals. However a Defra spokesperson said: ""Leaving the EU gives us a golden opportunity to secure ambitious free trade deals while supporting our farmers and producers to grow and sell more great British food. ""Any future [EU-UK] deal must work for UK farmers, businesses and consumers, and we will not compromise on our high environmental or welfare standards."" The agriculture industry employs one in eight people in the UK. Farm and food production is worth around Â£110bn per year and the EU is both the largest recipient of British farm produce and the largest exporter of such goods into the UK.

"Emergency services were called to the scene just before 09:00 GMT A teenage boy and his grandfather have died after a car was struck by a train at a level crossing. Emergency services were called to the Barns Green crossing in Emms Lane, Horsham, West Sussex, at 08:47 GMT. The 72-year-old man was driving the car and his 15-year-old grandson was the passenger. No-one on the train was injured. British Transport Police (BTP) said their family was being supported by specialist officers. Det Insp Brett Walker said: ""This is an extremely tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time. ""Our officers have been working at the scene, and will continue to do so for the rest of the day, to ensure we gain as much information about how the collision happened."" Passengers said the train ""stopped suddenly"" and ""people started screaming"" Southern said rail services would be affected for the rest of the day, with buses replacing trains between Horsham and Pulborough. BTP officers, who worked alongside Sussex Police, said the two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Paramedics said they walked through the train after the collision to check on passengers and ensure no-one was injured. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has been informed. Emergency services will be at the scene for the rest of the day Many of the train passengers were taken to the nearby Sumners Ponds campsite, where they were given hot drinks. Two of them, Sinitta and Beverley, told BBC Sussex there had been a fire after the crash. ""The train stopped suddenly and then people started screaming,"" they said. ""Then we saw the fire so we moved up the train, and they evacuated the train."" Sumners Ponds staff put a message on the local village Facebook page, appealing for people to give the passengers lifts to Horsham station. Campsite manager Matt Gale described seeing two trains at the level crossing as he arrived for work and a huge plume of smoke. He said the last of the train passengers left on coaches just after 11:00. He estimated they had looked after about 100 people.

"A seismometer shows the earth's movements on Saturday afternoon A minor earthquake with a 4.4 magnitude has affected parts of Wales and England. The quake was felt over all of Wales, most of western England, as far east as London and as far north as the southern edge of the Lake District, the British Geological Survey (BGS) said. The epicentre was approximately 20km north-north-east of Swansea and at a depth of 7.4km, it added. There have been no reports of serious damage or injuries. Britain reacts to 'underwhelming' quake Earthquake tremor was 'frightening' Earthquake 'not unexpected' Events of this magnitude happen in the UK every three to five years, the BGS said. Roger Musson, from the BGS, said it was the largest earthquake in mainland Britain for the last 10 years -since one with a magnitude of 5.2 struck in 2008 in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire,external. He said it was ""relatively shallow"" for a larger British earthquake. They are usually around 15-20km deep. This video can not be played ""The whole building shook"": Roxanne Woolhouse describes the tremor Dyfed Powys Police force said it had received ""an extremely high volume"" of calls relating to tremors. South Wales Police urged the public to avoid calling the emergency services unless it was to report damage or injuries. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Mrs Cox's constituency will be the focus of a number of events remembering the MP Communities have come together to celebrate the life of the murdered MP Jo Cox. The 41-year-old was shot and stabbed in Birstall, in her Yorkshire constituency of Batley and Spen, on 16 June 2016. To mark the first anniversary of her death her family and friends have urged people to hold events that celebrate her life. The Great Get Together, involving picnics, street parties and concerts, runs across the weekend. Organised by the Jo Cox Foundation, it aims to reinforce the message in Mrs Cox's maiden speech in the House of Commons that ""we have more in common than that which divides us"". Mrs Cox's sister, Kim Leadbeater, said the events were ""nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with religion"". ""Nothing to do with anything other than getting together with people in your communities,"" she added. ""People are desperate for it - people want something that is about coming together and being positive."" The Labour MP's former constituency is the focus of a number of events. Gordon and Jean Leadbeater opened the new school centre named in memory of their daughter Schoolchildren across the area participated in special assemblies and Upper Batley High School renamed its conference centre in honour of Mrs Cox. The new centre was opened by Mrs Cox's parents Gordon and Jean Leadbeater. Mrs Leadbeater said she was delighted to take part in the ceremony. ""There was nothing Jo liked better than getting into the schools,"" said Mrs Leadbeater. ""She knew that this is where it all started, the grassroots. Start with the children and work up."" Mr Leadbeater added that, although the anniversary was difficult, ""what keeps us going is the strength we are getting from people and we can feel the love"". People gathered for ""a moment of reflection"" close to the site of Ms Cox's murder in Birstall market place. Children wrote messages on a memorial wall erected in the square.

"The new x-ray fluorescence instrument could lead to a big increase in the number of paintings investigated Researchers in the US have used a new scanning technique to discover a painting underneath one of Pablo Picasso's great works of art, the Crouching Woman (La Misereuse Accroupie). Underneath the oil painting is a landscape of Barcelona which, it turns out, Picasso used as the basis of his masterpiece. The new x-ray fluorescence system is cheaper than alternative art scanning systems - and it is portable, making it available to any gallery that wants it. Details were revealed at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement for Science in Austin, Texas. The Crouching Woman is a painting from Picasso's blue period. This video can not be played How the figure of the crouching woman takes on the landscape painting beneath. What is remarkable is that the landscape painting beneath - probably by a student artist - is turned 90 degrees. The outline of the hills in the background becomes the crouching woman's back. She takes on the shape and form of the Catalan countryside. Kenneth Brummel, a curator at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, said that he was ""excited"" when he first learned what lay underneath the Crouching Woman. ""It helps to date the painting and it also helps to determine where the painting was made,"" he told BBC News. ""But it also gives a sense of the artists with whom the painter was engaging. And these insights help us ask new, more interesting and scientifically more accurate questions regarding an artist, their process and how they arrived at the forms that we see on the surface of a painting."" Hidden portrait 'found under Mona Lisa' Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed at hi-tech laboratory X-ray reveals hidden Goya painting Picasso is known to have painted over a number of his blue period paintings and Mr Brummel said he was pleased to see that the Crouching Woman was like these other works. Francesca Casadio, from the Centre for Scientific Studies in the Arts in Chicago, who is among those leading the project, hopes that the widespread use of the scanners will increase our understanding of artists, their thought processes and the way they worked. ""Many more paintings are waiting to tell their secrets and with our scanning system we can help them talk to us more,"" she told BBC News. Until now scanning was only for the greatest of great works of art - and for the wealthiest galleries. This new system can be used by anyone to find the story behind any painting they are interested in.

"This video can not be played Outgoing chairman Paul Oakden reads the result of the vote UKIP members have voted to sack leader Henry Bolton after controversy over racist messages sent by his partner. The former army officer's fate was decided after 63% voted to back a no confidence motion at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in Birmingham. He had faced calls to quit after it emerged his partner Jo Marney sent racist messages about Meghan Markle. Gerard Batten will take over as interim leader and there will be a leadership election within 90 days. UKIP delayed MPs libel case settlement Bolton defends Jo Marney relationship UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Profile: Henry Bolton Following the vote, Mr Bolton, who had been in the job for less than five months, said he feared the result would see UKIP ""taken off the battlefield"" of British politics for months. He said: ""I think it's going to be difficult to unite the party, what we have effectively had is a rejection of a new draft constitution, a reorganisation and indeed a new way of doing politics."" Mr Bolton again said he had ""strong affections"" for his former girlfriend, who he said sent him a good luck text message before the meeting. Asked if he was going to get back together with Ms Marney, he said: ""I have said all along that once we got the EGM out of the way I would spend time sorting out my private life."" Henry Bolton was leader less than five months He was elected in September in the wake of UKIP's disastrous performance in last year's general election. The party's national executive committee expressed no confidence in him last month, triggering the ballot. He lost the no confidence motion by 867 votes to 500. Outgoing chairman Paul Oakden said: ""Henry Bolton has been removed by the democratic decision of the membership."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Bolton was the party's fourth leader in 18 months. He had replaced Paul Nuttall, who quit after the general election - which saw UKIP's vote share shrink to 1.8% from 12.6% in 2015. When Henry Bolton was elected just five months ago, many in UKIP had hoped he'd be the unifying force the party needed, bringing its focus back to Brexit. But like his two predecessors, his tenure was short lived, and now UKIP is once again seeking leadership and direction. The party's most senior figures are optimistic that they can find a strong leader who will rally the members and give UKIP a voice in the Brexit debate. But among some activists who attended the emergency meeting there was frustration, even anger, at the continued turmoil at the top. Some fear another divisive contest - not least because of the financial implications for the cash-strapped party. UKIP might survive - most think it will - but for now some don't see how it can regain its place on the political playing field as the influential force it once was. Mr Batten, London MEP, said UKIP's membership had made the right decision to sack Mr Bolton. The interim leader said: ""I believe that you have made the best decision that you could in the circumstances."" Mr Bolton said he was considering legal action as a result of the way the process to get rid of him was handled, but Mr Batten responded by saying: ""Get on with the rest of your life."" Prior to the vote ex-leader Nigel Farage had backed Mr Bolton, saying  ""for all his faults"", removing him would hasten UKIP's path to ""irrelevance"". Nigel Farage was succeeded as UKIP leader by Diane James - he then took over as interim leader when she quit Nigel Farage: UKIP's long-serving leader announced his resignation on 4 July 2016, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"" by the Brexit vote Diane James: Lasted less than three weeks after being elected in September 2016 Nigel Farage: Returned as interim leader in October 2016 Paul Nuttall: Elected on 28 November 2016, but quit the following June after UKIP's general election collapse Henry Bolton: Elected on 29 September.

"This video can not be played The helicopter landed on its side crushing several vans A helicopter carrying senior officials has crashed while they assessed damage from Friday's earthquake in Mexico, killing at least 14 including a baby. Mexico's interior minister and the governor of the south-west Oaxaca state were on board, but neither was hurt. The aircraft's pilot lost control as it was coming in to land, Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete said. The 7.2-magnitude quake's epicentre was in Oaxaca but it shook buildings in Mexico City, 350km (217 miles) away. No deaths have been reported from the earthquake itself. Officials said the military helicopter had crashed on top of several vans carrying earthquake survivors in a field while trying to land in the village of Santiago Jamiltepec, not far from the epicentre. Fourteen people - including a six-month-old baby - were killed in the crash, the Oaxaca prosecutor's office said. Witnesses say the village had been affected by a power cut and it was dark when the helicopter approached to land. It circled the village several times, raising a thick cloud of dust and further reducing visibility. This video can not be played The earthquake shook this newspaper office in Mexico City It is not clear whether anyone in the aircraft was among the dead, although Mr Navarrete said some passengers were injured. Friday's quake was 24.6km underground and some buildings were damaged. The epicentre was near the town of Pinotepa de Don Luis. After the tremor, thousands of people were seen fleeing buildings in Mexico City as the ground shook. Some were crying, while others hugged each other on the streets of the capital. Traffic stopped for a few minutes. The authorities activated earthquake alert systems in four states, and Mexico City. They urged residents to stay outdoors. Clouds of dust rose near buildings already damaged by two quakes last September Last September, two devastating earthquakes in Mexico killed hundreds of people. There were clouds of dust near buildings already damaged by the September quakes. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates.

"This video can not be played Emotional plea to allow medical cannabis for Alfie Requests for a medical cannabis licence to help a boy whose rare form of epilepsy improved after taking the drug have been denied by the Home Office. Six-year-old Alfie Dingley, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, suffers up to 30 violent seizures a day. His parents want to treat him with medical cannabis oil, which is illegal in the UK. The Home Office said the drug ""cannot be practically prescribed, administered or supplied to the public"". A spokesperson added that it can only be used for research. Alfie's mother, Hannah Deacon, said ""you've got to fight for your kids, I want to know that I've done everything I can"". Members of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on drug policy reform is calling on the government to assist with Alfie's plight. Ms Deacon said Alfie's cannabis dose was ""very small"", just three drops of the oil Ms Deacon said Alfie went to the Netherlands to take a cannabis-based medication in September. She said that while there, the medication, prescribed by a paediatric neurologist, saw his seizures reduce in number, duration and severity. At one point while in the UK, Alfie had 3,000 seizures and 48 hospital visits in a year, but while abroad he went 24 days without a single attack. ""It's very rare and very aggressive, there's only nine boys in the world with Alfie's condition,"" Ms Deacon said. ""We never imagined how well it would work. He's just a six-year-old boy, he deserves a happy life. We've found something that makes him happy and now we've got to take that away."" Ms Deacon said his cannabis dose was ""very small"" and he was taking three drops of the oil, which is made using whole plant cannabis. At one point, Alfie had 3,000 seizures and 48 hospital visits in a year Alfie's mother said the steroids he currently takes in hospital could eventually cause his organs to fail if he keeps taking them at the rate he is. ""He doesn't know any different, he's had a very traumatic life. He's held down and injected,"" she said. With the Dutch cannabis medication, it is estimated Alfie would have about 20 seizures a year,doctors in the Netherlands have told his family.,external 'Why I use medicinal cannabis' 'I know cannabis is illegal, but it is medicinal' The science of high-potency cannabis He stayed with his parents in a holiday camp in the Netherlands to receive the treatment, but without medical insurance in the country they had to return home in January. The APPG wants Home Secretary Amber Rudd to issue a licence for him to continue taking the medication. Group co-chair, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt said: ""It would be heartless and cruel not to allow Alfie to access the medication. ""Parliament really must look at reforming our laws to allow access to cannabis for medical purposes, which has huge public support."" MPs have called for Home Secretary Amber Rudd to issue a medical cannabis licence The Home Office said it recognised that people with chronic pain and debilitating illnesses are ""looking to alleviate their symptoms"". A spokesperson added: ""However, it is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards before being placed on the market, so that doctors and patients are assured of their efficacy, quality and safety. ""Cannabis is listed as a Schedule 1 drug, as in its raw form it is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit and is therefore subject to strict control restrictions. ""This means it cannot be practically prescribed, administered, or supplied to the public in the UK, and can only be used for research under a Home Office licence.

"Ben Coombs drove across three continents to complete the challenge A man has driven a sports car across 21 countries, starting at the most northerly pub in the world and finishing at the most southerly. Ben Coombs, 38, from Plymouth in Devon, drove 20,000 miles across three continents from the Arctic Circle to the southernmost tip of Chile. It took him seven months to complete the challenge. Mr Coombs described the final pub as ""a dive"", but said ""it's the journey that matters, not the destination"". The idea for the adventure,externalcame while he was having a pint in a pub on Dartmoor. The trip was completed in a green TVR sports car called Kermit The journey started on the Norwegian island of Svalbard in an abandoned mining settlement called Pyramiden, which has a population of four. Mr Coombs said finding the northernmost bar ""was an easy investigative process"". ""Pyramiden is less than 700 miles from the North Pole, is the northernmost settlement on earth with a permanent civilian population, and has only one bar,"" he added. ""The residents all live in the only building still functioning - the town's old hotel - which happens to have a still-functioning bar."" The most northerly pub in the world in Pyramiden To find the most northerly and southerly pub, Mr Coombs looked for licensed premises where anybody could walk in off the street and buy a beer. Although there are bars in Antarctica they are located on bases and are not accessible to members of the public or are not licensed, he said. So Mr Coombs looked for the southernmost settlement outside Antarctica, and came across Puerto Williams in Tierra del Fuego, Chile. In Arizona, Ben Coombs' car Kermit came face-to-face with a replica Herbie, a 1963 VW Beetle The journey involved 20,000 miles of driving and a range of road surfaces From Pyramiden, Mr Coombs drove his green 20-year-old TVR Chimaera, called Kermit, across Europe to Southampton from where the car was shipped to New York in August. He then travelled across the United States to California, before heading south to Mexico. The car had a new clutch fitted in a garage in Nicaragua, the only major repair of the trip A number of friends joined him for various stages of the journey in the two-seater convertible car. ""Central America quickly passed beneath our wheels, before we shipped the car around the Darien gap from Panama to Colombia,"" Mr Coombs said. ""Then it was just the small matter of an 8,000-mile drive across Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Argentina to get to the last bar on earth.""
