"Relatives of those killed on Bloody Sunday have been remembering their loved ones on the 50th anniversary. Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Derry on 30 January 1972. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin laid a wreath at a memorial ceremony in Londonderry and said he supported the families' campaign for justice. The service was part of a series of events held in Derry on Sunday. Mr Martin privately met relatives of those killed. He said he had thanked the families for their ""dignified, persistent and courageous"" campaign in the pursuit of justice, truth and accountability. ""The families of victims should always have primacy in terms of policy considerations and in terms of dealing with the past,"" he said. ""I don't believe there should be amnesties for anybody, I believe the full process of the courts and justice should be deployed."" What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Mr Martin also said it would have been ""helpful"" if some of Northern Ireland's unionist political parties had been represented at the commemoration. Irish President Michael D Higgins commended the people of Derry who have ""led the way, in finding agreement and accommodation between communities and traditions"". In a recorded message during a special event at the city's Millennium Forum, the Irish president said the events of Bloody Sunday ""reverberated across this island and around the world"". Wreaths were placed at the Bloody Sunday memorial during an event marking its 50th anniversary ""The 30th of January 1972 will live on in our collective memory, as will your efforts of vindication of the truth,"" he said. The names of the 13 men killed, and of John Johnston, who was wounded on Bloody Sunday and died six months later, were read out during the event. Lord Savile said in his 2010 report into Bloody Sunday that Mr Johnston did not die from wounds he suffered on the day. His name is included on the official Bloody Sunday memorial. The auditorium then fell silent at the precise moment the first shot was fired 50 years ago. Earlier, relatives of those killed retraced the steps of the original march. They also laid photographs of their loved ones at the memorial in Derry's Bogside. Bloody Sunday brought worldwide attention to the escalating crisis in Northern Ireland, which came to be known asthe Troubles. Maisie McLaughlin's great grandfather Bernard McGuigan was among those killed on Bloody Sunday Kay Duddy, whose 17-year-old brother Jackie was the first person to be shot on Bloody Sunday, said ""it hurts as much 50 years on as it did at the time"". ""We did not just lose a wee brother, we lost a whole generation. There's so many unanswered questions, would he have married? Would he have had a family? ""That is a very, very hard pill to swallow."" Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood, and Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry also attended the memorial service earlier. Internment, protest and Bloody Sunday,external Peter Taylor: Bloody Sunday, 50 years on Michael McKinney, brother of Bloody Sunday victim William McKinney, told the crowd the families are opposed to governmentproposals that would see an end to Troubles-related prosecutions. ""If they pursue their proposals, the Bloody Sunday families will be ready to meet them head on,"" he said. ""We will not go away and we will not be silenced."" Hundreds of people lined the streets of Derry Presbyterian minister Dr David Latimer told the crowd the Bloody Sunday families have ""tirelessly, across the decades, toiled to clear their loved ones' names"". He said their fight for justice has been inspirational across the world. Archbishop Eamon Martin said the ""horror inflicted on Derry"" on Bloody Sunday has ""thankfully been exposed and challenged"". The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland was addressing a service in Derry's Saint Eugene's Cathedral. ""Very painfully the Bloody Sunday families were denied for too long the truth about what happened to their loved ones, and sadly they are not alone,"" he said. A separate march organised by the Bloody Sunday March Committee, from Creggan to Free Derry Corner, also took place on Sunday. At the scene: Mike McBride, BBC News NI People gather in the Millennium Forum for a special commemoration event half a century on since one of Derry's darkest days. A minute's silence is observed in the amphitheatre, as the names of those killed on Bloody Sunday are read out to a hushed audience. The poignant moment takes place as the bells of St Eugene's Cathedral ring out across the city. A chime for every life lost. Actor Adrian Dunbar, who is hosting the event, struggling to find words, says the emotions in the city today are truly palpable 50 years on from the atrocity. The walk of remembrance retraced the steps of the original march in 1972 A day of commemorative events had started with the families walking the same route their relatives had tried to walk five decades ago. Hundreds joined them along the way. A January day that started in peaceful protest, but ended in tragedy. John Kelly, the brother of Michael Kelly, handed out a white rose to a child representing each of the Bloody Sunday families. Each rose representing a loved one tragically taken that day. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpaid tribute to victims' familiesduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Johnson described Bloody Sunday as ""one of the darkest days in our history"" and said in the run up to the anniversary ""we must learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared and prosperous future"". Ahead of the 50th anniversary, ex-prime minister David Cameron said his 2010 apology for Bloody Sunday made it clear therewas no doubt what happened was wrong. When the Saville Inquiry was released, Mr Cameron apologised forthe ""unjustified and unjustifiable"" deaths. Thousands gathered in Derry on that January day for a rally organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. They were protesting against a new law giving the authorities powers to imprison people without trial - internment. The Stormont government had banned such protests, and deployed the Army. Many demonstrators marched towards Free Derry Corner The intended destination of the demonstrators was the city centre, but Army barricades blocked marchers, so many demonstrators headed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00 GMT, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. At 16:07 GMT, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10 GMT, soldiers began to open fire. Jean Hegarty, whose 17-year-old brother Kevin McElhinney was shot and killed on Bloody Sunday, said it was hard to believe 50 years had passed. Kevin, who worked at a local supermarket, was killed as he attempted to flee the firing on Rossville Street. Jean Hegarty looks out at the spot where her brother Kevin McElhinney, aged 17, was killed on Bloody Sunday ""It never gets easier to talk about, even after all this time, for some of us [the Bloody Sunday families] it still sadly feels like it happened just yesterday,"" Ms Hegarty told BBC News NI. She says Sunday is an extremely emotional day for the families. Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 Two public inquiries have been carried out into the events of Bloody Sunday. The Widgery Tribunal, which was announced shortly after Bloody Sunday, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. The Saville Inquiry, published in 2010, found none of the casualties was posing a threat or doing anything that would justify the shooting. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010. Detectives submitted their files to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) towards the end of 2016. Prosecutors said in 2019 they would prosecute a soldier, known only as Soldier F, for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney on Bloody Sunday. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the PPS. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by a brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims.

"A house in Bensham, Gateshead, where the roof was blown off during Storm Malik Thousands of households are still without power in Scotland and north-east England, after two storms hit the UK at the weekend. Storms Malik and Corrie caused power cutsfor 118,000 homes in Scotlandand80,000 in northern England. On Monday evening, around 18,100 remained without power. On Saturday, two people were killed by falling trees - a boy in Staffordshire and a woman in Aberdeen. Several schools in Aberdeenshire, the Highlands and Moray were closed on Monday due to storm damage or power outages. And there has been major disruption to rail services between Edinburgh and Newcastle - with some lines closed on Monday morning. Much of Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England was under a yellow Met Office warning for wind over the weekend. Gusts of 92mph were recorded on Sunday night at Stornoway in the Western Isles. There is another yellow warning in place for parts of northern Scotland,externalon Tuesday between 06:00 GMT and 18:00, with gusts of up to 65mph expected. But the Met Office said the next few days would be much calmer before a brief cold snap on Thursday. Thousands without power as second storm hits Scotland Weather warning now in force in Northern Ireland Thousands into third day without power after storm In pictures: Storm Malik hits Scotland Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said about 16,900 were still without power on Monday evening, mostly in rural Aberdeenshire and the Angus border, while Northern Powergrid said 1,200 customers were without power across Northumberland, County Durham and Tyne & Wear. SSEN said restoration efforts would continue into Tuesday, with the possibility that for ""small clusters"" of customers this may extend into Wednesday. A car crushed by fallen bricks in Seaton Sluice, Northumberland A van at Apperley Bridge near Bradford was crushed by a fallen tree during Storm Malik. No-one was hurt. Trees in Aberdeenshire fell overnight during Storm Corrie Douglas Morrison, 51, who lives two miles from Kemnay, Aberdeenshire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had ""never seen this level of devastation"" to forest areas - ""I'm talking hundreds and hundreds of trees absolutely flattened and snapped like matchsticks"". He said his house had lost power at 08:00 GMT on Saturday and had come back on for a few hours on Sunday before being cut again. ""I just hope it comes on again today because as time passes it gets harder and harder because you lose your hot water, you lose the heat in your house, so let's just hope it comes on today,"" he said. Check the weather in your area Look at the map of power cuts in north-east England and you would be forgiven for thinking there's an alarming lack of electricity in the region. But this is very different from the chaos of Storm Arwen last November. This time only a small number of properties are without supply and more and more are being reconnected by the hour. Storm Arwen swept in from the north, an unusual direction for such weather. Storm Malik came from the west, where we are used to getting our weather from. Trees in particular are more resilient to a westerly as it's the prevailing wind direction. With Arwen, whole communities were left without power for several days - the aim for those without power now is to get them back on by the end of the day. A few areas cut off by Arwen have been hit again this weekend - but the message from Northern Powergrid is the length of time to fix should be much quicker. The damage is not comparable to what happened late last year. Peter Isgate, 65, who lives in Finchale Abbey Village in County Durham, told the PA news agency power had been off at the residential park where he lived since 10:00 on Saturday. He said that the average age there was around 70 and there were people with no heating and that nobody had been to see them. ""It's about heat and cold, old people feel it, and it just seems like they're getting ignored,"" he said. Disruption to trains continued into Monday,with ScotRail replacing a number of services with buses,external. The storms brought back memories of Storm Arwen which left thousands of homes without power for more than a week in Scotland and the north of England. Stewart Sexton, 58, from Alnwick, Northumberland, lost power for 35 hours over the weekend, having previously been badly affected by Storm Arwen, and said he was ""enraged"". ""This situation never happened before Arwen yet we did get storms,"" he said, blaming a lack of maintenance of the infrastructure and a resilience plan. Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was clear there had been a ""much stronger join-up between the power companies and the local resilience partnerships"" over the weekend. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme there was an ""improving situation"" but said power companies and others had to explore how to build more resilience in the system. A number of welfare centres have been opened in Aberdeenshire for people needing showers and power, while hot food is being served at various school canteens.

"Opposition MPs have accused the prime minister and the chancellor of ignoring struggling families, after they confirmed taxes would rise in April. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak insisted their Â£12bn National Insurance increase would go ahead, despite opposition. Labour, the Lib Dems and some Tory MPs are urging a rethink, arguing workers cannot afford more tax at the moment. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss the hike was needed due to Covid spending. She said the Tories wanted to be able to lower taxes to boost the economy - but government support during the pandemic had to be ""paid back"". What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Why are prices rising so quickly? NI rise to squeeze budgets and risk growth - CBI Under the plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022 for a year. From April 2023, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. Legislation to set it up was approved in Parliament in September. The government says the money will initially help clear NHS backlogs, and then be moved into social care system over the next three years. But critics - including some Conservatives - say the rise will place a tougher burden on the lower-paid and should be scrapped. There is also concern about the timing of the increase, with the cost of energy soaring and rising inflation also pushing up the cost of food and other bills. Business groups have also warned about the effect of the rise on small companies and the wider economy. Shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to ""rethink"" the planned rise, adding it would see people's incomes ""squeezed even more"". She told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme: ""You can't possibly hit people with more taxes at the moment. It's just simply not possible for a lot of people to survive."" ""The stories that I'm hearing from people across the country about the sacrifices they're going to have to make are enormous."" She added Labour would be ""doing everything that we can over the next few weeks to try and appeal to Tory MPs' consciences"". The Liberal Democrats have described the National Insurance rise as unfair. Party leader Sir Ed Davey called for action on energy prices, including more support for poorer families paid for through a ""Robin Hood"" tax on fuel companies. He accused the prime minister of being ""focused on saving his own skin"" over the No 10 lockdown parties scandal, rather than ""taking action"". Robert Halfon, one of the Tory MPs calling on the government not to go ahead with the rise, said ministers should make the cost of living their ""number one priority"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he suggested money for the NHS could instead be raised from thetaxes on capital gains- profits made from selling certain assets - or by raising taxes on oil companies. Senior backbench Tories Robert Jenrick and Mel Stride have also called for the increase to be delayed. Former cabinet minister Mr Jenrick saying that 2022 would already be ""exceptionally hard"" for families. Defending the rise in the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak said it was ""progressive"" because higher earners pay more. They described themselves as ""tax-cutting Conservatives"" and ""Thatcherites, in the sense that we believe in sound money"". But they added: ""There is no magic money tree."" The article will be seen as a show of unity between the pair, after widespread criticism of Mr Johnson over claims of parties in Downing Street during lockdown. Mr Sunak is a leading candidate to replace Mr Johnson if a leadership contest is triggered before the next election. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is also seen as a possible leadership candidate, defended the tax rises but accepted they are ""never popular"". Also speaking to the Sunday Morning programme, she said the country was in a ""very difficult situation"" because of money spent supporting the economy during Covid. ""As soon as possible, we want to be in a position to lower our tax rates, we want to drive economic growth, because ultimately that is what will make our country successful,"" she added. ""But we do face a short-term issue, which is that we have spent significant amounts of money dealing with the Covid crisis that does need to be paid back.""

"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warns of a ""real threat"" that Russia will invade Ukraine There is a ""real threat"" of Russia invading Ukraine, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned, but it is ""very unlikely"" British soldiers would be deployed to fight in any conflict. Instead, she said the UK was sending weapons to Ukraine and ""strengthening"" its sanction system so oligarchs close to the Kremlin had ""nowhere to hide"". She said the UK was also offering extra support to nearby Nato allies. Any invasion would be ""terrible for Europe"", Ms Truss told the BBC. Russia has placed about 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and missiles near Ukraine's border, but denies it plans to invade the former Soviet republic, which borders both Russia and the EU. But Ms Truss said it was ""highly likely"" that President Vladimir Putin was looking to invade. ""We're doing all we can through deterrence and diplomacy to urge him to desist,"" she told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme. Economic sanctions - punishments put on a state, individuals or organisations by another country - could target Russian financial institutions, energy companies, and those who are ""key to... the continuation of the Russian regime"". Under new legislation, sanctions could potentially target ""any interest that has an impact on the Russian government"", she said. The Foreign Office is expected to announce tougher sanctions in Parliament on Monday. Earlier this week, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskycalled on the West not to create panic, saying warnings of an imminent invasion were putting Ukraine's economy at risk.

Why Germany isn't sending weapons to Ukraine Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? How will we know if war has started in Ukraine? Ms Truss, who will visit Ukraine and Moscow in the next two weeks, said the UK had already trained 20,000 troops in Ukraine, supplied anti-tank missiles, and given support to its navy and energy sector. The UK is alsoconsidering offering to double the number of its troops deployed in Eastern Europe, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it would send a ""clear message to the Kremlin"". The UK has more than 900 military personnel based in Estonia, more than 100 in Ukraine as part of a training mission, while a light cavalry squadron numbering about 150 is deployed to Poland. Also speaking to Sunday Morning's Sophie Raworth, Nato's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said there would be a ""high price to pay"" if Russia decided ""to use force"". ""The more aggressive they are, the more Nato [presence] they will get at the borders."" However, he reiterated that Ukraine was not a member of the military alliance, and as such there were ""no plans to deploy Nato combat troops"". This video can not be played Nato's Jens Stoltenberg: ""No plans to deploy combat troops in Ukraine"" Russia wants the West to promise Ukraine will never join Nato, in which members promise to come to another's aid in the event of an armed attack. Nato's 30 members include the US, UK, and several former Soviet republics, some of which border Russia. Moscow sees Nato troops in Eastern Europe as a direct threat to its security. Mr Putin has long argued the US broke a guarantee it made in 1990 that Nato would not expand further east, though interpretations differ over exactly what was promised. Last month, Russia issued a written list of its concerns about Nato expansion and reiterated that Ukraine should never join the alliance. The US hassince rejected that demand, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was offering Moscow ""a serious diplomatic path forward, should Russia choose it"". If Russia were to invade Ukraine, it would not be the first time. Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014. It is also backing rebels who seized large swathes of the eastern Donbas region soon afterwards, and some 14,000 people have died in fighting there.

"Some farmers fear valuable farmland could be lost as firms try to offset their carbon footprints, instead of being safeguarded for agriculture There is ""very little evidence"" valuable Welsh farmland is being sold-off to investors to offset their carbon footprints, a minister has said. Deputy climate change minister Lee Waters said there was ""legitimate concern"" from farming groups. But he suggested tree planting was being used as a scapegoat for other issues. Farming unions have said carbon emissions should be cut rather than offset. The Welsh government, whichdeclared a climate emergency in 2019, has said it needs to plant 86 million trees by the end of this decade to meet itsnet zero target,externalby 2050. Some farmers have spoken of being cold-called by agents working for investors who want to buy farmland for afforestation -  planting trees to offset carbon emissions -sparking fears the loss of land could damage local culture, language and heritage, with valuable farm land being lost. However, on Sunday, Mr Waters told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement programmethe evidence ministers had so far was that the number of farms being bought up, and grants being applied for, was ""very, very small"". ""But that's not to say it couldn't happen and we want to guard against it happening,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains the basics of carbon offsetting He suggested that farmers were worried about wider issues in farming such as Brexit and climate change. He said: ""It would be better, if the people who are sounding these alarms worked with us to try to manage the change instead of railing against the change. ""There's definitely a feeling of anxiety for a number of causes and tree-planting is the convenient pantomime villain."" The Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) has said 75% of the biggest plans for planting trees on Welsh land came from outside the country over the past three years. What is greenwashing and how can you spot it? Seven ways not to be fooled by greenwashing tricks Carbon offsetting 'not get-out-of-jail-free card' Any proposal to plant over 50 hectares of woodland in Wales - the size of about 93 football fields - needs an environmental impact assessment, but the FUW said only 25% of those plans came from land owners based in Wales. ""What we want is Welsh farmers leading the way here, Welsh landowners planting the trees and control and ownership remaining locally. ""There's a lot of anxiety from farming communities about change, but we're romanticising the present; your average farm income with EU subsidies is Â£16,000 per farm. ""So, we've been subsidising farmers in to working poverty and properly managed tree-planting alongside food production offers a new income stream,"" he added. Responding to the deputy minister's comments on theBBC Politics Wales programmeon Sunday NFU Cymru's Abi Reader said farmers were keen to plant trees, but the right kind of tree needed to be planted in the right place. ""It is about being very conscious that we may be exporting our carbon benefits that we've got here in Wales to larger companies,"" she said. In December, the BBC reported that the land agent Savills had made ""direct approaches"" to farmers in Wales on behalf of clients looking to buy land and plant trees in order to offset theircarbon emissions. In response to this, Mr Waters said: ""I would say to the Savills of this world who are doing the cold-calling, 'hold your horses, don't get carried away with yourself'.""

"Sheffield is one of the places to benefit Sheffield and Wolverhampton have been chosen as the first places to benefit from government regeneration funding. Ministers want to help transform derelict areas of 20 towns and cities in England, with new housing and jobs. The government says further details will be set out in its long-awaited blueprint to ""level up"" economic opportunities around the UK. But Labour said the announcement was ""recycled money"" and would not do enough to boost poorer areas. The government's levelling up policy paper, to be published next week, is also set to outline plans to expand devolution in England. Cabinet sources have told the BBC some government figures do not think the plans are ambitious enough, with concerns the proposals repackage certain policies that have already been announced. Make levelling up more than a slogan, say MPs Gove insists government has cash to spend The plan to end levelling-up confusion The town debating how to level up The government regeneration of the 20 locations is being funded by part of a Â£1.5bn fund announced by the chancellor at the last Budget in October. The money, which will be made available from April, will be allocated to councils in England to pay for new infrastructure on brownfield land - land that has previously been developed. The government is yet to confirm which other areas, other than Sheffield and Wolverhampton, will be prioritised for the cash. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the plans would help ""transform"" these areas, as well as relieving pressure on green fields and infrastructure in the South East. ""While talent is spread equally across the UK, opportunity is not. Our country is a success story, but not everyone is sharing in it,"" he wrote. ""That has to change. We need to tackle, and reverse, the inequality that is limiting so many horizons, and which also harms our economy."" ""The gap between much of the South East and the rest of the country - in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities - must be closed."" However, Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said the brownfield funding announcement was ""recycled money"" that would simply give ""a bit of a refund in a few places"" of investment lost under the Conservatives. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Morning programme, she added that the announcement ""completely misses the point,"" adding that people needed ""good jobs and wages"" to ensure levelling up was a success. The party has set out its own five-point plan for levelling up, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. Meanwhile, more than 100 places outside London will benefit from extra funding for arts and culture from 2023, the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said. Arts Council England will identify the locations, and DCMS said 100% of the additional funding recently agreed for the group would go to supporting culture and creativity outside of London. Announcing his Spending Review to parliament in October, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said more than Â£850m was being allocated to cultural and heritage infrastructure.

"A fallen tree blocks a road in Aberdeen Households in the north of Scotland could be without power until Tuesday after a second storm hit the region. About 37,000 homes were without power on Monday morning as Storm Corrie knocked out supplies to 30,000 customers. Engineers are still working to reconnect 7,000 customers who lost power during Storm Malik on Saturday. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: ""We're in for quite a challenging few days."" He said transport arrangements could be affected by the storm and people should check before they travel on Monday morning. Storm Corrie hit Scotland on Sunday evening gusts of 92mph recorded at Stornoway. A number of welfare centres have been opened in Aberdeenshire for people needingshowers and power,external, whilehot food,externalis being served at various school canteens.

This video can not be played Watch as Storm Malik batters Scotland's coastline More than 80,000 homes lost supply during Storm Malik on Saturday. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said the majority were in rural Aberdeenshire and the Moray coast, with some in Angus, the Highlands and Perthshire. The firm's engineers had struggled to access faults due to fallen trees blocking roads and it has since moved to ""red alert"" status. Graeme Keddie, director of corporate affairs for SSEN, told the BBC that some households could be without power until Tuesday. Hundreds more engineers have been brought to Scotland to tackle the impact of Storm Corrie, he said, and they would prioritise the people who have been without power the longest. He added: ""We are pushing out restoration times in some circumstances until Tuesday, that's really just to allow people to make informed choices of staying with family or friends. ""If people do not have alternative accommodation, please do arrange it whether it's a hotel or rented accommodation and we will reimburse them after, on production of receipts. ""We are keen to make sure those in our community are supported especially the most vulnerable."" SP Energy Networks, which supplies electricity in south and central parts of the country, said it had restored power to 22,450 customers but 550 remained off supply at 11:10 on Sunday. A fallen tree at a house in Clydebank in Glasgow Some schools in Aberdeenshire are likely to close after inspections over the weekend found storm damage. The council's chief executive Jim Savage said announcements about closures would be made to families on Sunday afternoon. ""We've made the decision it's going to be a local choice by each headteacher in the morning about whether the school is going to be open which is the normal way that we work - so it's not a blanket open or shut, it's a case by case basis,"" he added.

"A house in Bensham, Gateshead, where the roof was blown off during Storm Malik Thousands of households are still without power in Scotland and north-east England, after two storms hit the UK at the weekend. Storms Malik and Corrie caused power cutsfor 118,000 homes in Scotlandand80,000 in northern England. On Monday evening, around 18,100 remained without power. On Saturday, two people were killed by falling trees - a boy in Staffordshire and a woman in Aberdeen. Several schools in Aberdeenshire, the Highlands and Moray were closed on Monday due to storm damage or power outages. And there has been major disruption to rail services between Edinburgh and Newcastle - with some lines closed on Monday morning. Much of Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England was under a yellow Met Office warning for wind over the weekend. Gusts of 92mph were recorded on Sunday night at Stornoway in the Western Isles. There is another yellow warning in place for parts of northern Scotland,externalon Tuesday between 06:00 GMT and 18:00, with gusts of up to 65mph expected. But the Met Office said the next few days would be much calmer before a brief cold snap on Thursday.

SSEN said restoration efforts would continue into Tuesday, with the possibility that for ""small clusters"" of customers this may extend into Wednesday. A car crushed by fallen bricks in Seaton Sluice, Northumberland A van at Apperley Bridge near Bradford was crushed by a fallen tree during Storm Malik. No-one was hurt. Trees in Aberdeenshire fell overnight during Storm Corrie Douglas Morrison, 51, who lives two miles from Kemnay, Aberdeenshire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had ""never seen this level of devastation"" to forest areas - ""I'm talking hundreds and hundreds of trees absolutely flattened and snapped like matchsticks"". He said his house had lost power at 08:00 GMT on Saturday and had come back on for a few hours on Sunday before being cut again. ""I just hope it comes on again today because as time passes it gets harder and harder because you lose your hot water, you lose the heat in your house, so let's just hope it comes on today,"" he said. Check the weather in your area Look at the map of power cuts in north-east England and you would be forgiven for thinking there's an alarming lack of electricity in the region. But this is very different from the chaos of Storm Arwen last November. This time only a small number of properties are without supply and more and more are being reconnected by the hour. Storm Arwen swept in from the north, an unusual direction for such weather. Storm Malik came from the west, where we are used to getting our weather from. Trees in particular are more resilient to a westerly as it's the prevailing wind direction. With Arwen, whole communities were left without power for several days - the aim for those without power now is to get them back on by the end of the day. A few areas cut off by Arwen have been hit again this weekend - but the message from Northern Powergrid is the length of time to fix should be much quicker.

"Part of Glasgow were turned into Gotham City for the filming of a new HBO series It's hard to miss the fact that Glasgow is doubling for Gotham at the moment. There's barely a corner of the city which hasn't been transformed, the street signs and vintage cars and huddles of well wrapped crew reminding us that Hollywood has once again rolled into town. Batgirl is the latest Warner Brothers movie for its HBO Max streaming platform. The production has been filming in Glasgow since the end of last year, and will continue for the next two months. ""It's a huge deal for the city,"" says Councillor Ruairi Kelly, who chairs Glasgow City Council's neighbourhoods, housing and public realm committee. ""We've had some major productions here but this is the first time a whole film has been based in the city, from start till finish."" Film and TV productions generate Â£42m for Glasgow Glasgow goes Gotham for Batgirl filming Indiana Jones filming takes place in Glasgow Earlier in the week Glasgow Film Office, set up by the council in 1997 to attract film and television to the city, declared 2021 a record year. Films like The Flash and Indiana Jones, along with TV productions like Annika, Shetland and Screw had, they said, contributed a record Â£42.2m to the local economy. Where does the money go? ""It's hard to say exactly,"" says Councillor Kelly. ""There's a lot of commercially sensitive information but it's things like vehicle rental, catering, even extras, it all benefits the wider economy of the city."" But a number of industry professionals question the figure, and would like a better breakdown of the numbers. Vintage cars and US-style shop fronts have been spotted in parts of the city Grant McPhee is a Scottish film director and camera operator and has worked on many of the productions which have been made in Scotland over the last few years. ""Any film work taking place in Scotland is positive news,"" he says ""But we have to be open and proportional with what the real-world benefits to Scotland and the Scottish film industry are,"" he says. Film and TV producer Chris Young agrees. ""It's a tale of two worlds. It is a fantastic moment, there are lots of productions and it's never been busier but that's high end productions coming to Scotland, taking advantage of the tax breaks. ""In terms of indigenous production, there's nowhere near that support. They have a lower tariff. ""It's fine to boast about having Amazon and Netflix in our back yard but if they got a better tax credit in France or Mexico, they'd go there. We have amazing landscape, brilliant, technicians , writers, actors but we're not really nurturing the next generation. ""What's required is a national film studio, a national film school and a joined up strategy."" Good Omens, starring Michael Sheen and David Tennant, is filming in Scotland Isabel Davis, executive director of Screen Scotland, the national agency set up in 2017 agrees. ""That's what we were brought into being to create,"" she says. ""And a lot of work is happening from school age onwards. ""And Chris Young is right. The best way to learn is on productions and that's where we are working. ""Take someone like Douglas MacKinnon, who is showrunner for Good Omens and Anansi Boys, both filming in Scotland at the moment. He is working to bring trainees on to both those productions and that's key to what we're trying to achieve."" It's a point echoed by Culture Secretary Angus Robertson. ""We're working to build a more sustainable screen industry and this does not have to mean a trade-off between international and Scottish-based companies or between film and TV."" ""Most of the productions filming here, and all those that are funded by Screen Scotland, have to build training into their productions and we are making skills and talent development a priority. ""We see inward investment, which accounts for only a 10th of Screen Scotland's budget, going hand-in-hand with strengthening and developing Scottish-based crews and creative talent."" Actress Leslie Grace was in Glasgow for the Batgirl shoot But that comes back to the point that many industry professionals here make. These big Hollywood productions don't seem to be hiring many local crews. Batgirl received Â£150,000 from Glasgow City Council as an incentive to film here. Isabel Davis says she's unable to comment on the specifics she says any production given public money is expected to hire locally. She says that's ""people predominately from Scotland, some are from the south, but most are based in Scotland"". ""It's far better to crew locally and we've seen a huge increase in demand,"" she said. That's a point which many in the local industry dispute. Grant McPhee says you only have to look at the unit lists and IMDb to see the disproportionate numbers of London based crews. ""We need to have serious discussions to ensure locally-based crew are prioritised for these visiting large scale productions, something which is currently not the case despite promises made."" ""It is not enough to simply pay for entry level positions with a glass ceiling. Scotland is full of experienced actors, technicians and above line talent and in order to create a sustainable infrastructure with real benefits to the future of Scotland's film industry they must not be side-lined for crew based outside of Scotland."" Meanwhile the Batgirl production has rolled on to a different part of the city and Councillor Kelly is confident it'll leave a legacy of more than just photographs and memories of the days in which Glasgow became Gotham. ""It's not just a case of the circus coming to town and leaving afterwards. We want long term careers built here and with the new studio at Kelvin Hall opening, we can build on that. We'll be looking to work with production companies to secure apprenticeships, skilled work and all the community benefits we can push for.""

"Relatives of those killed on Bloody Sunday have been remembering their loved ones on the 50th anniversary. Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Derry on 30 January 1972. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin laid a wreath at a memorial ceremony in Londonderry and said he supported the families' campaign for justice. The service was part of a series of events held in Derry on Sunday. Mr Martin privately met relatives of those killed. He said he had thanked the families for their ""dignified, persistent and courageous"" campaign in the pursuit of justice, truth and accountability. ""The families of victims should always have primacy in terms of policy considerations and in terms of dealing with the past,"" he said. ""I don't believe there should be amnesties for anybody, I believe the full process of the courts and justice should be deployed."" What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Mr Martin also said it would have been ""helpful"" if some of Northern Ireland's unionist political parties had been represented at the commemoration. Irish President Michael D Higgins commended the people of Derry who have ""led the way, in finding agreement and accommodation between communities and traditions"". In a recorded message during a special event at the city's Millennium Forum, the Irish president said the events of Bloody Sunday ""reverberated across this island and around the world"". Wreaths were placed at the Bloody Sunday memorial during an event marking its 50th anniversary ""The 30th of January 1972 will live on in our collective memory, as will your efforts of vindication of the truth,"" he said. The names of the 13 men killed, and of John Johnston, who was wounded on Bloody Sunday and died six months later, were read out during the event. Lord Savile said in his 2010 report into Bloody Sunday that Mr Johnston did not die from wounds he suffered on the day. His name is included on the official Bloody Sunday memorial. The auditorium then fell silent at the precise moment the first shot was fired 50 years ago. Earlier, relatives of those killed retraced the steps of the original march. They also laid photographs of their loved ones at the memorial in Derry's Bogside. Bloody Sunday brought worldwide attention to the escalating crisis in Northern Ireland, which came to be known asthe Troubles. Maisie McLaughlin's great grandfather Bernard McGuigan was among those killed on Bloody Sunday Kay Duddy, whose 17-year-old brother Jackie was the first person to be shot on Bloody Sunday, said ""it hurts as much 50 years on as it did at the time"". ""We did not just lose a wee brother, we lost a whole generation. There's so many unanswered questions, would he have married? Would he have had a family? ""That is a very, very hard pill to swallow."" Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood, and Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry also attended the memorial service earlier. Internment, protest and Bloody Sunday,external Peter Taylor: Bloody Sunday, 50 years on Michael McKinney, brother of Bloody Sunday victim William McKinney, told the crowd the families are opposed to governmentproposals that would see an end to Troubles-related prosecutions. ""If they pursue their proposals, the Bloody Sunday families will be ready to meet them head on,"" he said. ""We will not go away and we will not be silenced."" Hundreds of people lined the streets of Derry Presbyterian minister Dr David Latimer told the crowd the Bloody Sunday families have ""tirelessly, across the decades, toiled to clear their loved ones' names"". He said their fight for justice has been inspirational across the world. Archbishop Eamon Martin said the ""horror inflicted on Derry"" on Bloody Sunday has ""thankfully been exposed and challenged"". The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland was addressing a service in Derry's Saint Eugene's Cathedral. ""Very painfully the Bloody Sunday families were denied for too long the truth about what happened to their loved ones, and sadly they are not alone,"" he said. A separate march organised by the Bloody Sunday March Committee, from Creggan to Free Derry Corner, also took place on Sunday. At the scene: Mike McBride, BBC News NI People gather in the Millennium Forum for a special commemoration event half a century on since one of Derry's darkest days. A minute's silence is observed in the amphitheatre, as the names of those killed on Bloody Sunday are read out to a hushed audience. The poignant moment takes place as the bells of St Eugene's Cathedral ring out across the city. A chime for every life lost. Actor Adrian Dunbar, who is hosting the event, struggling to find words, says the emotions in the city today are truly palpable 50 years on from the atrocity. The walk of remembrance retraced the steps of the original march in 1972 A day of commemorative events had started with the families walking the same route their relatives had tried to walk five decades ago. Hundreds joined them along the way. A January day that started in peaceful protest, but ended in tragedy. John Kelly, the brother of Michael Kelly, handed out a white rose to a child representing each of the Bloody Sunday families. Each rose representing a loved one tragically taken that day. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpaid tribute to victims' familiesduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Johnson described Bloody Sunday as ""one of the darkest days in our history"" and said in the run up to the anniversary ""we must learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared and prosperous future"". Ahead of the 50th anniversary, ex-prime minister David Cameron said his 2010 apology for Bloody Sunday made it clear therewas no doubt what happened was wrong. When the Saville Inquiry was released, Mr Cameron apologised forthe ""unjustified and unjustifiable"" deaths. Thousands gathered in Derry on that January day for a rally organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. They were protesting against a new law giving the authorities powers to imprison people without trial - internment. The Stormont government had banned such protests, and deployed the Army. Many demonstrators marched towards Free Derry Corner The intended destination of the demonstrators was the city centre, but Army barricades blocked marchers, so many demonstrators headed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00 GMT, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. At 16:07 GMT, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10 GMT, soldiers began to open fire. Jean Hegarty, whose 17-year-old brother Kevin McElhinney was shot and killed on Bloody Sunday, said it was hard to believe 50 years had passed. Kevin, who worked at a local supermarket, was killed as he attempted to flee the firing on Rossville Street. Jean Hegarty looks out at the spot where her brother Kevin McElhinney, aged 17, was killed on Bloody Sunday ""It never gets easier to talk about, even after all this time, for some of us [the Bloody Sunday families] it still sadly feels like it happened just yesterday,"" Ms Hegarty told BBC News NI. She says Sunday is an extremely emotional day for the families. Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 Two public inquiries have been carried out into the events of Bloody Sunday. The Widgery Tribunal, which was announced shortly after Bloody Sunday, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. The Saville Inquiry, published in 2010, found none of the casualties was posing a threat or doing anything that would justify the shooting. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010. Detectives submitted their files to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) towards the end of 2016. Prosecutors said in 2019 they would prosecute a soldier, known only as Soldier F, for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney on Bloody Sunday. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the PPS. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by a brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims.

"Young children between the ages of five and 11 considered most at risk of coronavirus will be offered Covid jabs from Monday in England. The move comes after the UK drugs regulator approved alow-dose versionof a Covid vaccine for children last month, deeming it safe and effective. Eligible children include those with learning disabilities and long-term conditions, such as diabetes. Cases in young children are rising, but for most, infections are not severe. Some of those most at risk are more vulnerable to serious illness, and those living with vulnerable adults could pass the infection on. In December 2021 the government's vaccine advisers, theJoint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation,external, recommended around 500,000 young children at highest risk be given the jabs. This includes children with serious underlying heart and lung conditions and those living with people with weakened immune systems. A decision on vaccinating all other five-to-11-year-olds has not yet been made. Deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, GP Dr Nikki Kanani, urged parents not to delay coming forward. She said: ""We know vaccines give significant protection against severe illness from Covid - including the Omicron variant - so it is important that our youngest and most at risk get protected."" Most jabs will be given by GP-led teams and in hospital hubs. Officials say parents and guardians should wait to be invited by the NHS. Young children at risk will be offered two Pfizer vaccines eight weeks apart - at a third of the adult dose. It is widely used in other countries - more than five million children have been given it in the US alone. Covid vaccines are already being offered to young children at risk inWales,externalandScotland,external. Public-health experts inNorthern Ireland,externalsay GPs will be sending parents information about jabs by early February. The NHS has already delivered more than three million vaccinations to people aged 12 to 17. Separately, NHS England plans send out flu vaccine reminders to the parents and guardians of eligible children. In England this includes all two-and-three-year-olds and all pupils from reception age to school leavers, to drive up protection from the virus.

"Seren Jones said swimming did not come naturally to her and she initially preferred other sports ""I remember being petrified of the water. I just hated it."" This is not the first memory of swimming you expect to hear from someone who spent 13 years pursuing the activity to elite level and winning a scholarship to an American university. But talking to swimming equality advocate Seren Jones it's clear that she is not one to back away from a challenge. Statistics from England and Wales both show people from black and Asian backgrounds are less likely to swim than those from white communities, with a lack of parental involvement leading to some children not having the right skills in the water. This wasn't the case for Seren, 27, who was taken swimming by her parents from a young age. 'Black people can swim' - Dearing backs campaign to get BAME people in the water Meet Alice Dearing, Team GB's first black female swimmer Are lidos becoming fashionable again? Despite this early exposure to water, the pool was not somewhere she felt comfortable. ""I'd go with my sister, who's a year older than me, and I remember her going off and having a great time, and I remember just screaming and clinging on to my dad,"" she said. Seren as a toddler with her father Robyn, a former semi-professional footballer ""Swimming was never something that came naturally to me. I hated coming out of the pool and being cold and wet. ""And I didn't take to it the way I took to other sports - cross-country, gymnastics, netball, all of those came really naturally to me but swimming was the one I really didn't want to do and didn't enjoy."" So what made her persist? ""I think it frustrated me that I was bad at swimming, that it was a weakness. I just decided I wanted to keep working at it."" Seren and her sister were signed up for swimming classes, like many children, just to ensure they were safe around water and to be able to enjoy swimming on holidays. Seren was a member of City of Cardiff Swiming Club as a teenager After some sessions at a leisure centre, they were told about the City of Cardiff Swimming Club, where there was an opportunity to train and compete, so both sisters went along for trials. She remembers the moment that changed her attitude to swimming after joining. ""It was four of us girls in a lane. The three girls were really, really shy and it was our first session. The coach was like, 'the warm-up is 100m, so swim the lengths'. ""I was the brave one so I went first and by the time I had swum the 100m, I'd gone from leading the lane to the back. The girls had just completely swam over me. ""It annoyed me. I just wanted to get better at it and I just kept training. I didn't enjoy it for a long time. I remember my coach calling me out of the pool to do press-ups because I wasn't listening when I was meant to."" Over time ""something just clicked,"" she started competing and - finally - enjoying herself. Seren had success at the National Collegiate Athletic Association championships She was not overly conscious being one of only a handful of non-white swimmers in the sport. Going to a Welsh-medium school, she was used to being in a mostly white environment. ""I don't think I really digested it and understood it. I was happy and I had friends and that was fine. ""But definitely as I got older, going to Welsh nationals and only having a few of us there, it would be a luxury going to British nationals and Sheffield because they had the English clubs and they had more black swimmers. ""It would be like, 'oh my God, there are more of us'. There weren't a lot but at least there were more and that was always really refreshing and lovely for me."" By this stage, Seren was competing alone after her sister stopped swimming at the age of 16. Time to study for university and to do other things were part of that decision but one factor was the impact of the water on hair and hairstyles. Seren and US college swim teammates winning trophies ""She said she wanted to have good hair, which at the time for us essentially meant straight hair,"" she explained. ""My sister's got quite dense Afro hair and she couldn't wear the styles that she wanted to wear, the styles that made her feel confident as a young woman growing up in a white-dominated society. ""Swimming didn't allow her to chemically straighten her hair or have long braids, which is what she wanted as well, and looks became important to her, especially when she was thinking about going into law, and [had ideas about] what a lawyer looked like."" Despite the long hours of training, Seren realised by the age of 15 that her ambition to become an Olympic swimmer was not going to happen, but luckily for her, she knew there was another route to continue her swimming career. Learning from her father's experience of getting an athletic scholarship to study in the US on the back of his footballing ability (he later became a semi-professional in the UK), she applied for a swimming scholarship and in 2012 went to study English and journalism at Long Island University in New York. Seren (bottom left) found swimming in the US to be much more of a team effort It gave her access to America's collegiate system where she ""fell in love with swimming again"" and enabled her to compete at elite level where she also - wrongly - imagined black representation would be less of an issue. ""When I got my offer to go to America, I was convinced I would meet more black swimmers. I was like, 'surely, it's America, I'm moving to New York'. ""I met hundreds of black athletes, but when it came to swimming it was the same thing all over again. ""I remember at the national collegiate level, meeting another black girl who swam for a university in Minnesota and we just clicked immediately, and there were a few black guys but they weren't the same calibre as us and were at the lower-ranking meets. ""We know that black athletes are so dominant in dry land sports, we literally see them on the podiums when it comes to track and basketball and football especially. ""But we didn't see that same translation into water sports, so America didn't quite live up to the hopes that I'd had for black swimmers."" On a more positive note, she does feel that there has been a shift in participation at the higher levels, with more black swimmers, referees and coaches at recent events she has attended. Seren Jones, Ed Accura, Alice Dearing and Danielle Obe set up the Black Swimming Association Now Seren, an audio producer from Cardiff, has just announced a partnership betweenSport Wales,externaland theBlack Swimming Association,external(BSA), the non-profit organisation she helped found to promote equality and accessibility in swimming for black and ethnic minority people. She set up BSA alongside Team GB's only current (and second ever) black swimmer Alice Dearing, filmmaker Ed Accura and inventor Danielle Obe, who has designed swimming headwear for black people. The non-profit has been working with Sport England on programmes to draw in people of Afro-Caribbean, African and Asian heritage. ""Swimming is not prioritised for a lot of kids who come from those backgrounds or communities,"" said Seren. ""You can break it down by thinking about the financial reasons. In Western societies, people of colour tend to represent those who live in lower socio-economic areas of the countries. ""Swimming is a super expensive sport. Not just to go to learn how to swim but it gets more expensive as you progress, unlike football, where you reap the rewards as you go through academies and services are provided for you usually [like] digs and kit and all those opportunities."" Swimming is the opposite, she says, with payment per race not just per competition - she remembers a charge of Â£7 per race, and that was at least 10 years ago - meaning each meet can add up to a lot of money if a coach asks a swimmer to enter multiple races. Giving people water confidence is central to the BSA's aim For a family on a tight budget, when you factor in having siblings, transport, hotels if they are very far away, kit - which gets increasingly expensive - it can be prohibitive, she argued. ""The actual racing suits can cost around Â£300 and you need more than one, so it really does add up the more you progress."" She also said representation was ""hugely influential"", for example, seeing high-profile black footballers or Asian cricketers made it more likely children would get ""funnelled"" into those sports. ""But swimming is a sport where you don't see representation, so a lot of children and parents are going to think that it's a space that is not created or designed for them. It's kind of like a chicken and egg vicious cycle."" She also cited religious and cultural factors, such as privacy and modesty for some Muslims, particularly women, as a potential barrier when ""you're required to be physically vulnerable - so much of your body is on show all the time"". Seren now understands her mother's talks to her and her sister about how they were role models for younger black children when they were competing as teenagers. Participants at one of the first BSA sessions held in Hackney, London The BSA's move into Wales will see the creation of a programme delivery officer based in Cardiff alongside Sport Wales' headquarters. They will aim to bring in the next generation of black swimmers as well as increase non-white representation in the aquatic workforce by 25%. Only 3% of the UK's swimming workforce is non-white. Brian Davies, Sport Wales' acting CEO, said: ""In order to make sport more welcoming, inclusive, and diverse in Wales, we want to broaden our networks so that we are working with more experts who have a better understanding of the communities that we're seeking to engage with. ""We're very interested in the BSA's research into the participation barriers which diverse communities face, as well as their plans for increasing the representation of Black and Asian people in the aquatic workforce."" While Seren now swims recreationally as much for the mental health benefits as the physical, she is fully aware of what she gained from persisting with a sport she initially disliked so much. ""I never would have thought it would have taken me around the world to train or taken me to America for my degree,"" she said. ""I never would have thought I'd set up something like the BSA so it's been an incredible experience, how much the sport has given me.""

""I don't want to forget the volunteers and everyone who makes possible this event. Thank you very much for supporting tennis and myself. It has been tough times to organise tennis tournaments but the last two years you have done a great job. I wish you all the very best. ""One month and a half ago I thought this might be my last Australian Open but this has given me plenty of energy to keep going. ""I really can't explain the feelings I have right now.

In the low moments you have been there every single moment in support. ""Without you none of this is possible so thank you very much for everything."" Russell FullerTennis correspondent in Melbourne When you consider you had the world number one spending four nights in an asylum hotel, then the Aussies breaking a 44 year drought in the women's final - and then a final like that.

"Relatives of those killed on Bloody Sunday have been remembering their loved ones on the 50th anniversary. Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Derry on 30 January 1972. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin laid a wreath at a memorial ceremony in Londonderry and said he supported the families' campaign for justice. The service was part of a series of events held in Derry on Sunday. Mr Martin privately met relatives of those killed. He said he had thanked the families for their ""dignified, persistent and courageous"" campaign in the pursuit of justice, truth and accountability. ""The families of victims should always have primacy in terms of policy considerations and in terms of dealing with the past,"" he said. ""I don't believe there should be amnesties for anybody, I believe the full process of the courts and justice should be deployed."" What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Mr Martin also said it would have been ""helpful"" if some of Northern Ireland's unionist political parties had been represented at the commemoration. Irish President Michael D Higgins commended the people of Derry who have ""led the way, in finding agreement and accommodation between communities and traditions"". In a recorded message during a special event at the city's Millennium Forum, the Irish president said the events of Bloody Sunday ""reverberated across this island and around the world"". Wreaths were placed at the Bloody Sunday memorial during an event marking its 50th anniversary ""The 30th of January 1972 will live on in our collective memory, as will your efforts of vindication of the truth,"" he said. The names of the 13 men killed, and of John Johnston, who was wounded on Bloody Sunday and died six months later, were read out during the event. Lord Savile said in his 2010 report into Bloody Sunday that Mr Johnston did not die from wounds he suffered on the day. His name is included on the official Bloody Sunday memorial. The auditorium then fell silent at the precise moment the first shot was fired 50 years ago. Earlier, relatives of those killed retraced the steps of the original march. They also laid photographs of their loved ones at the memorial in Derry's Bogside. Bloody Sunday brought worldwide attention to the escalating crisis in Northern Ireland, which came to be known asthe Troubles. Maisie McLaughlin's great grandfather Bernard McGuigan was among those killed on Bloody Sunday Kay Duddy, whose 17-year-old brother Jackie was the first person to be shot on Bloody Sunday, said ""it hurts as much 50 years on as it did at the time"". ""We did not just lose a wee brother, we lost a whole generation. There's so many unanswered questions, would he have married? Would he have had a family? ""That is a very, very hard pill to swallow."" Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood, and Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry also attended the memorial service earlier. Internment, protest and Bloody Sunday,external Peter Taylor: Bloody Sunday, 50 years on Michael McKinney, brother of Bloody Sunday victim William McKinney, told the crowd the families are opposed to governmentproposals that would see an end to Troubles-related prosecutions. ""If they pursue their proposals, the Bloody Sunday families will be ready to meet them head on,"" he said. ""We will not go away and we will not be silenced."" Hundreds of people lined the streets of Derry Presbyterian minister Dr David Latimer told the crowd the Bloody Sunday families have ""tirelessly, across the decades, toiled to clear their loved ones' names"". He said their fight for justice has been inspirational across the world. Archbishop Eamon Martin said the ""horror inflicted on Derry"" on Bloody Sunday has ""thankfully been exposed and challenged"". The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland was addressing a service in Derry's Saint Eugene's Cathedral. ""Very painfully the Bloody Sunday families were denied for too long the truth about what happened to their loved ones, and sadly they are not alone,"" he said. A separate march organised by the Bloody Sunday March Committee, from Creggan to Free Derry Corner, also took place on Sunday. At the scene: Mike McBride, BBC News NI People gather in the Millennium Forum for a special commemoration event half a century on since one of Derry's darkest days. A minute's silence is observed in the amphitheatre, as the names of those killed on Bloody Sunday are read out to a hushed audience. The poignant moment takes place as the bells of St Eugene's Cathedral ring out across the city. A chime for every life lost. Actor Adrian Dunbar, who is hosting the event, struggling to find words, says the emotions in the city today are truly palpable 50 years on from the atrocity. The walk of remembrance retraced the steps of the original march in 1972 A day of commemorative events had started with the families walking the same route their relatives had tried to walk five decades ago. Hundreds joined them along the way. A January day that started in peaceful protest, but ended in tragedy. John Kelly, the brother of Michael Kelly, handed out a white rose to a child representing each of the Bloody Sunday families. Each rose representing a loved one tragically taken that day. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpaid tribute to victims' familiesduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Johnson described Bloody Sunday as ""one of the darkest days in our history"" and said in the run up to the anniversary ""we must learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared and prosperous future"". Ahead of the 50th anniversary, ex-prime minister David Cameron said his 2010 apology for Bloody Sunday made it clear therewas no doubt what happened was wrong. When the Saville Inquiry was released, Mr Cameron apologised forthe ""unjustified and unjustifiable"" deaths. Thousands gathered in Derry on that January day for a rally organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. They were protesting against a new law giving the authorities powers to imprison people without trial - internment. The Stormont government had banned such protests, and deployed the Army. Many demonstrators marched towards Free Derry Corner The intended destination of the demonstrators was the city centre, but Army barricades blocked marchers, so many demonstrators headed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00 GMT, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. At 16:07 GMT, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10 GMT, soldiers began to open fire. Jean Hegarty, whose 17-year-old brother Kevin McElhinney was shot and killed on Bloody Sunday, said it was hard to believe 50 years had passed. Kevin, who worked at a local supermarket, was killed as he attempted to flee the firing on Rossville Street. Jean Hegarty looks out at the spot where her brother Kevin McElhinney, aged 17, was killed on Bloody Sunday ""It never gets easier to talk about, even after all this time, for some of us [the Bloody Sunday families] it still sadly feels like it happened just yesterday,"" Ms Hegarty told BBC News NI. She says Sunday is an extremely emotional day for the families. Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 Two public inquiries have been carried out into the events of Bloody Sunday. The Widgery Tribunal, which was announced shortly after Bloody Sunday, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. The Saville Inquiry, published in 2010, found none of the casualties was posing a threat or doing anything that would justify the shooting. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010. Detectives submitted their files to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) towards the end of 2016. Prosecutors said in 2019 they would prosecute a soldier, known only as Soldier F, for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney on Bloody Sunday. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the PPS. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by a brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims.

"Opposition MPs have accused the prime minister and the chancellor of ignoring struggling families, after they confirmed taxes would rise in April. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak insisted their Â£12bn National Insurance increase would go ahead, despite opposition. Labour, the Lib Dems and some Tory MPs are urging a rethink, arguing workers cannot afford more tax at the moment. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss the hike was needed due to Covid spending. She said the Tories wanted to be able to lower taxes to boost the economy - but government support during the pandemic had to be ""paid back"". What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Why are prices rising so quickly? NI rise to squeeze budgets and risk growth - CBI Under the plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022 for a year. From April 2023, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. Legislation to set it up was approved in Parliament in September. The government says the money will initially help clear NHS backlogs, and then be moved into social care system over the next three years. But critics - including some Conservatives - say the rise will place a tougher burden on the lower-paid and should be scrapped. There is also concern about the timing of the increase, with the cost of energy soaring and rising inflation also pushing up the cost of food and other bills. Business groups have also warned about the effect of the rise on small companies and the wider economy. Shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to ""rethink"" the planned rise, adding it would see people's incomes ""squeezed even more"". She told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme: ""You can't possibly hit people with more taxes at the moment. It's just simply not possible for a lot of people to survive."" ""The stories that I'm hearing from people across the country about the sacrifices they're going to have to make are enormous."" She added Labour would be ""doing everything that we can over the next few weeks to try and appeal to Tory MPs' consciences"". The Liberal Democrats have described the National Insurance rise as unfair. Party leader Sir Ed Davey called for action on energy prices, including more support for poorer families paid for through a ""Robin Hood"" tax on fuel companies. He accused the prime minister of being ""focused on saving his own skin"" over the No 10 lockdown parties scandal, rather than ""taking action"". Robert Halfon, one of the Tory MPs calling on the government not to go ahead with the rise, said ministers should make the cost of living their ""number one priority"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he suggested money for the NHS could instead be raised from thetaxes on capital gains- profits made from selling certain assets - or by raising taxes on oil companies. Senior backbench Tories Robert Jenrick and Mel Stride have also called for the increase to be delayed. Former cabinet minister Mr Jenrick saying that 2022 would already be ""exceptionally hard"" for families. Defending the rise in the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak said it was ""progressive"" because higher earners pay more. They described themselves as ""tax-cutting Conservatives"" and ""Thatcherites, in the sense that we believe in sound money"". But they added: ""There is no magic money tree."" The article will be seen as a show of unity between the pair, after widespread criticism of Mr Johnson over claims of parties in Downing Street during lockdown. Mr Sunak is a leading candidate to replace Mr Johnson if a leadership contest is triggered before the next election. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is also seen as a possible leadership candidate, defended the tax rises but accepted they are ""never popular"". Also speaking to the Sunday Morning programme, she said the country was in a ""very difficult situation"" because of money spent supporting the economy during Covid. ""As soon as possible, we want to be in a position to lower our tax rates, we want to drive economic growth, because ultimately that is what will make our country successful,"" she added. ""But we do face a short-term issue, which is that we have spent significant amounts of money dealing with the Covid crisis that does need to be paid back.""

"Number 11 Kate Cross saw out the final over as England took a draw from an incredible Test Women's Ashes, one-off Test, Manuka Oval (day four of four) Australia 337-9 dec& 216-7 decMooney 63; Brunt 3-24 England 297 & 245-9Sciver 58, Knight 48, Dunkley 45; Sutherland 3-69 Match drawn (Australia lead series 6-4) Scorecard England and Australia drew the one-off Women's Ashes Test in Canberra in one of the most incredible finales cricket has seen. Chasing a record 257, England were on course for a stunning win and required 45 runs from 60 balls with seven wickets left. But as the tension grew to a crescendo, England lost six wickets for just 26 runs, Australia fighting back to close in on a win that would have seen them retain the Ashes. When two wickets fell with three overs to go, England suddenly switched to survival mode in an attempt to keep the series alive. Number 11 Kate Cross faced 12 balls at the end, blocking out the final over, as England fell 12 runs short of their target but at least ensured the four points on offer for the Test were shared. The finish was only possible because Australia declared on 216-7 half an hour before tea, leaving England 48 overs to reach their target. The result leaves Australia leading 6-4 in the multi-format points-based series. They will only have to win one of the three one-day internationals that follow to retain the Ashes. The first ODI begins at 03:10 GMT on Thursday, also at Manuka Oval. At the end, incredibly, both sets of players will probably have left the field feeling disappointed. Both could have won a game that beggared belief. Had England been victorious it would have been the highest successful chase in women's Tests - and they began by making a hugely difficult task look relatively straightforward. But all-rounder Nat Sciver pulled to square leg for 58 and as the pressure swung - England now feeling the heat of being favourites - so did the momentum. Australia had resorted to defensive bowling and field-placings but suddenly a world-class team sensed their moment. Beth Mooney, playing with metal plates in her jaw after breaking the bone two weeks ago, pulled off a stunning diving catch at long-on to dismiss Sophia Dunkley, who had taken England to within 24 runs of their target by smashing 45 from 32 balls. Debutant leg-spinner Alana King and seamer Annabel Sutherland, playing her second Test, capitalised as panic struck in the England camp, a desperate run-out of Anya Shrubsole adding to the incredible drama. Until that point England had still been going for the win but with 14 balls remaining, Cross came out with only defence in mind and faced 12 of 13 balls in a last-wicket partnership with Sophie Ecclestone. Surrounded by catchers, Cross somehow kept her cool to navigate the final over bowled by King to ensure the series goes on one more game at least, although England may well regret the failure to win. Australia recently went on a 26-match winning run in 50-over matches and now Heather Knight's side will probably have to beat them three times in a row to win the Ashes. This was the scene in the England dug-out after the match, Ecclestone (second left) and Brunt (back right) looking dejected 38 overs:With 10 overs to go England are 212-3, requiring a further 45 for the win. Sophia Dunkley has come out and smashed back-to-back sixes while Nat Sciver has 52 not out. 40.3 overs:Sciver hits a pull straight to square leg off Annabel Sutherland - 39 runs are needed from 43 balls. 42.2 overs:Sutherland and Alana King squeeze the scoring before Amy Jones clubs to deep mid-wicket for four. England require 33 runs from 34 balls. 43.2 overs:England's hopes suffer a big blow as 23-year-old Dunkley is brilliantly caught by Beth Mooney at long-on for a 32-ball 45. England need 24 from 28 balls while Australia only require four wickets to win. 44.1 overs:Katherine Brunt top-edges a pull off Sutherland - 21 from 24 balls is the still very gettable requirement for England, but they now have only three wickets left. 45.4 overs:England need 13 from 15 balls but Anya Shrubsole is run out inches short at the non-striker's end trying to steal a single. 45.5 overs:The very next ball Charlie Dean top-edges a sweep and is caught for three bringing number 11 Kate Cross to the crease. 47 overs:Cross sees off seven consecutive deliveries to take the game to the final over. England require 12. Australia need one wicket. 48 overs:Cross defends the final ball, a full toss from King, and an incredible Test is drawn. Credit must go to Australia captain Meg Lanning for her declaration, which dangled the possibility of a win in front of England and ensured they took on the victory challenge. England began their chase steadily, with openers Tammy Beaumont and Lauren Winfield-Hill putting on 52 before falling for 36 and 33 respectively, Beaumont the aggressor in the partnership. Knight and Sciver provided the meat of the chase, putting on 72 from 70 balls and keeping the required run-rate in check at all times. A crucial moment was the loss of Knight who, having made 168 not out in the first innings, was out lbw to a ball from 18-year-old seamer Darcie Brown that nipped back. Even after her dismissal England continued to chase a win but her calm head was missed. Australia began the day 12-2, leading by 52, and England had hopes of dismissing their hosts and giving themselves a smaller target. They were held up by regular contributions from the Australia batting order, however - Mooney top-scoring with 63 - and were not helped by two drops and a missed stumping by wicketkeeper Jones, including Mooney when on 40. Ultimately, though, what will be remembered is the gripping final hour. It resulted in a fifth consecutive drawn women's Test, potentially strengthening calls for such matches to be played over five days not four. None of those previous draws were as exciting as this, however. Australia captain Meg Lanning:""All the emotions. We declared, we didn't think it was enough to bowl them out but that was our aim. They batted extremely well and it was hard to stop them scoring. ""I did go through the thoughts that we were done. They were doing it easy and there didn't look like any way through. ""To be able to fight back as a group and nearly flip it on its head was pretty amazing."" England captain Heather Knight:""Opportunity missed is the overriding feeling. We were in such a great position. The way we went for the game made me really proud. I am just frustrated. ""It has been an amazing Test. We stood toe-to-toe with the Aussies throughout the game. What a win it would have been."" Transfer Gossip Daily:What are the biggest rumours as deadline day approaches?

"A planned rise in National Insurance from April will ""unquestionably place a further squeeze"" on budgets and risk stunting economic growth, the CBI business group has warned. The CBI said firms ""weren't supportive"" of the tax increase when it was first announced, and ""they're still not"". The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the rise could ""spell the end for a lot of small firms"". The government has said the increase will help clear the NHS backlog. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunakwrote in the Sunday Times,externalto confirm the Â£12bn rise, which they said was ""the right plan"" and ""must go ahead"". Why are prices rising so quickly? What will National Insurance changes cost me? Under the government's plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022 for a year. After that, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. The changes will see an employee on Â£20,000 a year pay an extra Â£89 in tax, while someone on Â£50,000 will pay Â£464 more. Critics have said the increase could contribute to inflation - the rate at which prices rise - which is already at its highest point for three decades, reaching 5.4% in January. There are also concerns the rise could contribute to the cost of living, with household budgets being squeezed by rising energy prices. But the NHS Confederation, the body which represents health and care leaders, has said the funding is needed to care for vulnerable people. The CBI, which represents 190,000 UK businesses, said increasing National Insurance would ""risk curtailing growth at a critical moment in the recovery"" from coronavirus restrictions. A spokesperson said businesses recognised the ""need to fund the increased demands on our health and social care service"", but urged the government to look to other methods of raising funds it could. ""If the government goes ahead as planned, then it is incumbent on them to use the March Budget to bring forward more ambitious plans to raise the longer term growth potential of the economy,"" the CBI added. For Lucy Bull, who manages Castle Grove Nursing Home in Devon, the rise in National Insurance will come at a time she wants to increase wages for her 45 carers. She told the BBC she believed the extra tax revenue would mostly go to the NHS, and not reach the care sector. She added while the NHS had done a ""brilliant job"" through the pandemic, the funding needed to be for the ""care sector as a whole"". ""We are working really hard to raise the salaries for our care workers - taxing even more is not going to help that,"" she said. ""The cost of personal care, it's extremely expensive and it's just going up."" Ms Bull, who is also a director at Devon Care Homes Collaborative, said unlike other businesses, the care sector couldn't just decide to charge more money for beds. ""It's not just the same as deciding you're going to charge a bit more for a cup of coffee,"" she added. ""For most relatives and residents there's a finite pot of money."" Elsewhere, the boss of the Federation of Small Businesses, said its members had warned they would have ""no choice but to increase prices, reduce wages or let staff go"", if the government proceeded as planned, due to other increases in the National Living Wage and business rates. National chairman Mike Cherry said: ""This regressive tax hike will hit lower earners and struggling community small businesses the hardest, leaving less cash in people's pockets to spur our recovery."" Mr Cherry also warned National Insurance rising would coincide with the moment reliefs on business rates were due to end, which he said would ""spell the end for a lot of small firms"", unless ""action is taken now"". UK Hospitality boss Kate Nichollstweeted,externalrestaurants, bars and pubs also had to deal with business rates relief ending, on top of rising VAT and supply chain problems. ""All when consumers will already feel pinch and demand will be suppressed. Keep VAT at 12.5% will ease price pressure,"" she said. Meanwhile, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said without the extra funding, the public would face longer waits for treatment and ""hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people won't get the care and support they need from social care services"". ""But it is for the government to decide how best to fund this extra investment,"" he added. Sarah McClinton, vice-president of Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said it was ""essential that as a society we fund adult social care in the longer term"", adding more tax needed to be assigned to social care.

"US President-elect Donald Trump has called on Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national incomes on defence. That is more than double the military alliance's current target of 2%. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also told member countries to boost military spending as part of a new ""wartime mindset"". Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato'sprimary purpose,externalwas to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree thatif one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.,external Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises. For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004. It alsoco-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.,external Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Having been neutral for decades,both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, the alliancesaid that Ukraine could eventually join,external. Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked. Although then Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg reconfirmed Ukraine could join ""in the long term"", he said this would not happen until after the war ended. Nato currently asks every member country to spend at least 2% of national income - also known as GDP - on defence. It is thought that23 countries met that target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014. The countries which spend the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states. In July 2024, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmersaid the UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. In December 2024, Nato secretary general Rutte said that member stateswould have to ""shift to a wartime mindset"" and spend ""considerably more than 2%"" on defence,external. During his first term as US president, Trump persuaded many Nato members to increase defence spending. In 2018 he said thatall countries in the alliance should be committing 4% of GDP. At a press conference at his Florida home in January 2025,Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5%,external, telling reporters: ""They can all afford it."" While campaigning for his second presidential term, Trumpsaid he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough, remarks which were strongly condemned by the White House and former Nato chief Stoltenberg. How much do Nato members spend on defence? Nato said Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed the""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"".,external The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia. However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment. German research organisationthe Kiel Institute,externalsaid that the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (Â£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024. European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (Â£43.7bn) over the same period. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp. Atacms missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are hard to intercept due to their high speed In August 2024,Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets- the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states. Since November 2024,the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia In January and February 2025, Nato forces will take part in a military  exercise calledSteadfast Dart 25,externalin Bulgaria and Romania, led by a UK army division. Troops will practise how toreinforce the alliance's eastern borders ahead of an enemy attack,external. In 2023, Nato's commanders agreed detailed plans for countering possible Russian attacks anywhere in the Arctic, the North Atlantic, Eastern Europe or the Mediterranean Sea region. It increased the number of troops in Europe on high alert from 40,000 to more than 300,000, and bolstered its defences on Russia's borderswith eight battlegroups,external.

You are an amazing champion. You guys have a great rivalry and it is not over yet. ""I want to thank my two guys in my box who were here all week. I hope we have more victories to come.

"Relatives of those killed on Bloody Sunday have been remembering their loved ones on the 50th anniversary. Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Derry on 30 January 1972. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin laid a wreath at a memorial ceremony in Londonderry and said he supported the families' campaign for justice. The service was part of a series of events held in Derry on Sunday. Mr Martin privately met relatives of those killed. He said he had thanked the families for their ""dignified, persistent and courageous"" campaign in the pursuit of justice, truth and accountability. ""The families of victims should always have primacy in terms of policy considerations and in terms of dealing with the past,"" he said. ""I don't believe there should be amnesties for anybody, I believe the full process of the courts and justice should be deployed."" What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Mr Martin also said it would have been ""helpful"" if some of Northern Ireland's unionist political parties had been represented at the commemoration. Irish President Michael D Higgins commended the people of Derry who have ""led the way, in finding agreement and accommodation between communities and traditions"". In a recorded message during a special event at the city's Millennium Forum, the Irish president said the events of Bloody Sunday ""reverberated across this island and around the world"". Wreaths were placed at the Bloody Sunday memorial during an event marking its 50th anniversary ""The 30th of January 1972 will live on in our collective memory, as will your efforts of vindication of the truth,"" he said. The names of the 13 men killed, and of John Johnston, who was wounded on Bloody Sunday and died six months later, were read out during the event. Lord Savile said in his 2010 report into Bloody Sunday that Mr Johnston did not die from wounds he suffered on the day. His name is included on the official Bloody Sunday memorial. The auditorium then fell silent at the precise moment the first shot was fired 50 years ago. Earlier, relatives of those killed retraced the steps of the original march. They also laid photographs of their loved ones at the memorial in Derry's Bogside. Bloody Sunday brought worldwide attention to the escalating crisis in Northern Ireland, which came to be known asthe Troubles. Maisie McLaughlin's great grandfather Bernard McGuigan was among those killed on Bloody Sunday Kay Duddy, whose 17-year-old brother Jackie was the first person to be shot on Bloody Sunday, said ""it hurts as much 50 years on as it did at the time"". ""We did not just lose a wee brother, we lost a whole generation. There's so many unanswered questions, would he have married? Would he have had a family? ""That is a very, very hard pill to swallow."" Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood, and Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry also attended the memorial service earlier. Internment, protest and Bloody Sunday,external Peter Taylor: Bloody Sunday, 50 years on Michael McKinney, brother of Bloody Sunday victim William McKinney, told the crowd the families are opposed to governmentproposals that would see an end to Troubles-related prosecutions. ""If they pursue their proposals, the Bloody Sunday families will be ready to meet them head on,"" he said. ""We will not go away and we will not be silenced."" Hundreds of people lined the streets of Derry Presbyterian minister Dr David Latimer told the crowd the Bloody Sunday families have ""tirelessly, across the decades, toiled to clear their loved ones' names"". He said their fight for justice has been inspirational across the world. Archbishop Eamon Martin said the ""horror inflicted on Derry"" on Bloody Sunday has ""thankfully been exposed and challenged"". The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland was addressing a service in Derry's Saint Eugene's Cathedral. ""Very painfully the Bloody Sunday families were denied for too long the truth about what happened to their loved ones, and sadly they are not alone,"" he said. A separate march organised by the Bloody Sunday March Committee, from Creggan to Free Derry Corner, also took place on Sunday. At the scene: Mike McBride, BBC News NI People gather in the Millennium Forum for a special commemoration event half a century on since one of Derry's darkest days. A minute's silence is observed in the amphitheatre, as the names of those killed on Bloody Sunday are read out to a hushed audience. The poignant moment takes place as the bells of St Eugene's Cathedral ring out across the city. A chime for every life lost. Actor Adrian Dunbar, who is hosting the event, struggling to find words, says the emotions in the city today are truly palpable 50 years on from the atrocity. The walk of remembrance retraced the steps of the original march in 1972 A day of commemorative events had started with the families walking the same route their relatives had tried to walk five decades ago. Hundreds joined them along the way. A January day that started in peaceful protest, but ended in tragedy. John Kelly, the brother of Michael Kelly, handed out a white rose to a child representing each of the Bloody Sunday families. Each rose representing a loved one tragically taken that day. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpaid tribute to victims' familiesduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Johnson described Bloody Sunday as ""one of the darkest days in our history"" and said in the run up to the anniversary ""we must learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared and prosperous future"". Ahead of the 50th anniversary, ex-prime minister David Cameron said his 2010 apology for Bloody Sunday made it clear therewas no doubt what happened was wrong. When the Saville Inquiry was released, Mr Cameron apologised forthe ""unjustified and unjustifiable"" deaths. Thousands gathered in Derry on that January day for a rally organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. They were protesting against a new law giving the authorities powers to imprison people without trial - internment. The Stormont government had banned such protests, and deployed the Army. Many demonstrators marched towards Free Derry Corner The intended destination of the demonstrators was the city centre, but Army barricades blocked marchers, so many demonstrators headed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00 GMT, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. At 16:07 GMT, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10 GMT, soldiers began to open fire. Jean Hegarty, whose 17-year-old brother Kevin McElhinney was shot and killed on Bloody Sunday, said it was hard to believe 50 years had passed. Kevin, who worked at a local supermarket, was killed as he attempted to flee the firing on Rossville Street. Jean Hegarty looks out at the spot where her brother Kevin McElhinney, aged 17, was killed on Bloody Sunday ""It never gets easier to talk about, even after all this time, for some of us [the Bloody Sunday families] it still sadly feels like it happened just yesterday,"" Ms Hegarty told BBC News NI. She says Sunday is an extremely emotional day for the families. Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 Two public inquiries have been carried out into the events of Bloody Sunday. The Widgery Tribunal, which was announced shortly after Bloody Sunday, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. The Saville Inquiry, published in 2010, found none of the casualties was posing a threat or doing anything that would justify the shooting. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010. Detectives submitted their files to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) towards the end of 2016. Prosecutors said in 2019 they would prosecute a soldier, known only as Soldier F, for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney on Bloody Sunday. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the PPS. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by a brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims.

Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said the majority were in rural Aberdeenshire and the Moray coast, with some in Angus, the Highlands and Perthshire. The firm's engineers had struggled to access faults due to fallen trees blocking roads and it has since moved to ""red alert"" status. Graeme Keddie, director of corporate affairs for SSEN, told the BBC that some households could be without power until Tuesday. Hundreds more engineers have been brought to Scotland to tackle the impact of Storm Corrie, he said, and they would prioritise the people who have been without power the longest. He added: ""We are pushing out restoration times in some circumstances until Tuesday, that's really just to allow people to make informed choices of staying with family or friends. ""If people do not have alternative accommodation, please do arrange it whether it's a hotel or rented accommodation and we will reimburse them after, on production of receipts. ""We are keen to make sure those in our community are supported especially the most vulnerable.""

"Relatives of those killed on Bloody Sunday have been remembering their loved ones on the 50th anniversary. Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Derry on 30 January 1972. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin laid a wreath at a memorial ceremony in Londonderry and said he supported the families' campaign for justice. The service was part of a series of events held in Derry on Sunday. Mr Martin privately met relatives of those killed. He said he had thanked the families for their ""dignified, persistent and courageous"" campaign in the pursuit of justice, truth and accountability. ""The families of victims should always have primacy in terms of policy considerations and in terms of dealing with the past,"" he said. ""I don't believe there should be amnesties for anybody, I believe the full process of the courts and justice should be deployed."" What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Mr Martin also said it would have been ""helpful"" if some of Northern Ireland's unionist political parties had been represented at the commemoration. Irish President Michael D Higgins commended the people of Derry who have ""led the way, in finding agreement and accommodation between communities and traditions"". In a recorded message during a special event at the city's Millennium Forum, the Irish president said the events of Bloody Sunday ""reverberated across this island and around the world"". Wreaths were placed at the Bloody Sunday memorial during an event marking its 50th anniversary ""The 30th of January 1972 will live on in our collective memory, as will your efforts of vindication of the truth,"" he said. The names of the 13 men killed, and of John Johnston, who was wounded on Bloody Sunday and died six months later, were read out during the event. Lord Savile said in his 2010 report into Bloody Sunday that Mr Johnston did not die from wounds he suffered on the day. His name is included on the official Bloody Sunday memorial. The auditorium then fell silent at the precise moment the first shot was fired 50 years ago. Earlier, relatives of those killed retraced the steps of the original march. They also laid photographs of their loved ones at the memorial in Derry's Bogside. Bloody Sunday brought worldwide attention to the escalating crisis in Northern Ireland, which came to be known asthe Troubles. Maisie McLaughlin's great grandfather Bernard McGuigan was among those killed on Bloody Sunday Kay Duddy, whose 17-year-old brother Jackie was the first person to be shot on Bloody Sunday, said ""it hurts as much 50 years on as it did at the time"". ""We did not just lose a wee brother, we lost a whole generation. There's so many unanswered questions, would he have married? Would he have had a family? ""That is a very, very hard pill to swallow."" Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood, and Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry also attended the memorial service earlier. Internment, protest and Bloody Sunday,external Peter Taylor: Bloody Sunday, 50 years on Michael McKinney, brother of Bloody Sunday victim William McKinney, told the crowd the families are opposed to governmentproposals that would see an end to Troubles-related prosecutions. ""If they pursue their proposals, the Bloody Sunday families will be ready to meet them head on,"" he said. ""We will not go away and we will not be silenced."" Hundreds of people lined the streets of Derry Presbyterian minister Dr David Latimer told the crowd the Bloody Sunday families have ""tirelessly, across the decades, toiled to clear their loved ones' names"". He said their fight for justice has been inspirational across the world. Archbishop Eamon Martin said the ""horror inflicted on Derry"" on Bloody Sunday has ""thankfully been exposed and challenged"". The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland was addressing a service in Derry's Saint Eugene's Cathedral. ""Very painfully the Bloody Sunday families were denied for too long the truth about what happened to their loved ones, and sadly they are not alone,"" he said. A separate march organised by the Bloody Sunday March Committee, from Creggan to Free Derry Corner, also took place on Sunday. At the scene: Mike McBride, BBC News NI People gather in the Millennium Forum for a special commemoration event half a century on since one of Derry's darkest days. A minute's silence is observed in the amphitheatre, as the names of those killed on Bloody Sunday are read out to a hushed audience. The poignant moment takes place as the bells of St Eugene's Cathedral ring out across the city. A chime for every life lost. Actor Adrian Dunbar, who is hosting the event, struggling to find words, says the emotions in the city today are truly palpable 50 years on from the atrocity. The walk of remembrance retraced the steps of the original march in 1972 A day of commemorative events had started with the families walking the same route their relatives had tried to walk five decades ago. Hundreds joined them along the way. A January day that started in peaceful protest, but ended in tragedy. John Kelly, the brother of Michael Kelly, handed out a white rose to a child representing each of the Bloody Sunday families. Each rose representing a loved one tragically taken that day. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpaid tribute to victims' familiesduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Johnson described Bloody Sunday as ""one of the darkest days in our history"" and said in the run up to the anniversary ""we must learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared and prosperous future"". Ahead of the 50th anniversary, ex-prime minister David Cameron said his 2010 apology for Bloody Sunday made it clear therewas no doubt what happened was wrong. When the Saville Inquiry was released, Mr Cameron apologised forthe ""unjustified and unjustifiable"" deaths. Thousands gathered in Derry on that January day for a rally organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. They were protesting against a new law giving the authorities powers to imprison people without trial - internment. The Stormont government had banned such protests, and deployed the Army. Many demonstrators marched towards Free Derry Corner The intended destination of the demonstrators was the city centre, but Army barricades blocked marchers, so many demonstrators headed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00 GMT, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. At 16:07 GMT, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10 GMT, soldiers began to open fire. Jean Hegarty, whose 17-year-old brother Kevin McElhinney was shot and killed on Bloody Sunday, said it was hard to believe 50 years had passed. Kevin, who worked at a local supermarket, was killed as he attempted to flee the firing on Rossville Street. Jean Hegarty looks out at the spot where her brother Kevin McElhinney, aged 17, was killed on Bloody Sunday ""It never gets easier to talk about, even after all this time, for some of us [the Bloody Sunday families] it still sadly feels like it happened just yesterday,"" Ms Hegarty told BBC News NI. She says Sunday is an extremely emotional day for the families. Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 Two public inquiries have been carried out into the events of Bloody Sunday. The Widgery Tribunal, which was announced shortly after Bloody Sunday, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. The Saville Inquiry, published in 2010, found none of the casualties was posing a threat or doing anything that would justify the shooting. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010. Detectives submitted their files to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) towards the end of 2016. Prosecutors said in 2019 they would prosecute a soldier, known only as Soldier F, for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney on Bloody Sunday. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the PPS. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by a brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims. Cameron wanted 'no doubt' over Bloody Sunday apology Parachute Regiment flags near Derry 'unacceptable' Army should apologise for Bloody Sunday, says SDLP What happened on Bloody Sunday?

""I don't want to forget the volunteers and everyone who makes possible this event. Thank you very much for supporting tennis and myself. It has been tough times to organise tennis tournaments but the last two years you have done a great job. I wish you all the very best.

In the low moments you have been there every single moment in support. ""Without you none of this is possible so thank you very much for everything."" Russell FullerTennis correspondent in Melbourne When you consider you had the world number one spending four nights in an asylum hotel, then the Aussies breaking a 44 year drought in the women's final - and then a final like that.

"Sheffield is one of the places to benefit Sheffield and Wolverhampton have been chosen as the first places to benefit from government regeneration funding. Ministers want to help transform derelict areas of 20 towns and cities in England, with new housing and jobs. The government says further details will be set out in its long-awaited blueprint to ""level up"" economic opportunities around the UK. But Labour said the announcement was ""recycled money"" and would not do enough to boost poorer areas. The government's levelling up policy paper, to be published next week, is also set to outline plans to expand devolution in England. Cabinet sources have told the BBC some government figures do not think the plans are ambitious enough, with concerns the proposals repackage certain policies that have already been announced. Make levelling up more than a slogan, say MPs Gove insists government has cash to spend The plan to end levelling-up confusion The town debating how to level up The government regeneration of the 20 locations is being funded by part of a Â£1.5bn fund announced by the chancellor at the last Budget in October. The money, which will be made available from April, will be allocated to councils in England to pay for new infrastructure on brownfield land - land that has previously been developed. The government is yet to confirm which other areas, other than Sheffield and Wolverhampton, will be prioritised for the cash. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the plans would help ""transform"" these areas, as well as relieving pressure on green fields and infrastructure in the South East. ""While talent is spread equally across the UK, opportunity is not. Our country is a success story, but not everyone is sharing in it,"" he wrote. ""That has to change. We need to tackle, and reverse, the inequality that is limiting so many horizons, and which also harms our economy."" ""The gap between much of the South East and the rest of the country - in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities - must be closed."" However, Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said the brownfield funding announcement was ""recycled money"" that would simply give ""a bit of a refund in a few places"" of investment lost under the Conservatives. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Morning programme, she added that the announcement ""completely misses the point,"" adding that people needed ""good jobs and wages"" to ensure levelling up was a success. The party has set out its own five-point plan for levelling up, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. Meanwhile, more than 100 places outside London will benefit from extra funding for arts and culture from 2023, the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said. Arts Council England will identify the locations, and DCMS said 100% of the additional funding recently agreed for the group would go to supporting culture and creativity outside of London. Announcing his Spending Review to parliament in October, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said more than Â£850m was being allocated to cultural and heritage infrastructure.

"Young children between the ages of five and 11 considered most at risk of coronavirus will be offered Covid jabs from Monday in England. The move comes after the UK drugs regulator approved alow-dose versionof a Covid vaccine for children last month, deeming it safe and effective. Eligible children include those with learning disabilities and long-term conditions, such as diabetes. Cases in young children are rising, but for most, infections are not severe. Some of those most at risk are more vulnerable to serious illness, and those living with vulnerable adults could pass the infection on. In December 2021 the government's vaccine advisers, theJoint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation,external, recommended around 500,000 young children at highest risk be given the jabs. This includes children with serious underlying heart and lung conditions and those living with people with weakened immune systems. A decision on vaccinating all other five-to-11-year-olds has not yet been made. Deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, GP Dr Nikki Kanani, urged parents not to delay coming forward. She said: ""We know vaccines give significant protection against severe illness from Covid - including the Omicron variant - so it is important that our youngest and most at risk get protected."" Most jabs will be given by GP-led teams and in hospital hubs. Officials say parents and guardians should wait to be invited by the NHS. Young children at risk will be offered two Pfizer vaccines eight weeks apart - at a third of the adult dose. It is widely used in other countries - more than five million children have been given it in the US alone. Covid vaccines are already being offered to young children at risk inWales,externalandScotland,external. Public-health experts inNorthern Ireland,externalsay GPs will be sending parents information about jabs by early February. The NHS has already delivered more than three million vaccinations to people aged 12 to 17. Separately, NHS England plans send out flu vaccine reminders to the parents and guardians of eligible children. In England this includes all two-and-three-year-olds and all pupils from reception age to school leavers, to drive up protection from the virus.

"Relatives of those killed on Bloody Sunday have been remembering their loved ones on the 50th anniversary. Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Derry on 30 January 1972. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin laid a wreath at a memorial ceremony in Londonderry and said he supported the families' campaign for justice. The service was part of a series of events held in Derry on Sunday. Mr Martin privately met relatives of those killed. He said he had thanked the families for their ""dignified, persistent and courageous"" campaign in the pursuit of justice, truth and accountability. ""The families of victims should always have primacy in terms of policy considerations and in terms of dealing with the past,"" he said. ""I don't believe there should be amnesties for anybody, I believe the full process of the courts and justice should be deployed."" What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Mr Martin also said it would have been ""helpful"" if some of Northern Ireland's unionist political parties had been represented at the commemoration. Irish President Michael D Higgins commended the people of Derry who have ""led the way, in finding agreement and accommodation between communities and traditions"". In a recorded message during a special event at the city's Millennium Forum, the Irish president said the events of Bloody Sunday ""reverberated across this island and around the world"". Wreaths were placed at the Bloody Sunday memorial during an event marking its 50th anniversary ""The 30th of January 1972 will live on in our collective memory, as will your efforts of vindication of the truth,"" he said. The names of the 13 men killed, and of John Johnston, who was wounded on Bloody Sunday and died six months later, were read out during the event. Lord Savile said in his 2010 report into Bloody Sunday that Mr Johnston did not die from wounds he suffered on the day. His name is included on the official Bloody Sunday memorial. The auditorium then fell silent at the precise moment the first shot was fired 50 years ago. Earlier, relatives of those killed retraced the steps of the original march. They also laid photographs of their loved ones at the memorial in Derry's Bogside. Bloody Sunday brought worldwide attention to the escalating crisis in Northern Ireland, which came to be known asthe Troubles. Maisie McLaughlin's great grandfather Bernard McGuigan was among those killed on Bloody Sunday Kay Duddy, whose 17-year-old brother Jackie was the first person to be shot on Bloody Sunday, said ""it hurts as much 50 years on as it did at the time"". ""We did not just lose a wee brother, we lost a whole generation. There's so many unanswered questions, would he have married? Would he have had a family? ""That is a very, very hard pill to swallow."" Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood, and Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry also attended the memorial service earlier. Internment, protest and Bloody Sunday,external Peter Taylor: Bloody Sunday, 50 years on Michael McKinney, brother of Bloody Sunday victim William McKinney, told the crowd the families are opposed to governmentproposals that would see an end to Troubles-related prosecutions. ""If they pursue their proposals, the Bloody Sunday families will be ready to meet them head on,"" he said. ""We will not go away and we will not be silenced."" Hundreds of people lined the streets of Derry Presbyterian minister Dr David Latimer told the crowd the Bloody Sunday families have ""tirelessly, across the decades, toiled to clear their loved ones' names"". He said their fight for justice has been inspirational across the world. Archbishop Eamon Martin said the ""horror inflicted on Derry"" on Bloody Sunday has ""thankfully been exposed and challenged"". The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland was addressing a service in Derry's Saint Eugene's Cathedral. ""Very painfully the Bloody Sunday families were denied for too long the truth about what happened to their loved ones, and sadly they are not alone,"" he said. A separate march organised by the Bloody Sunday March Committee, from Creggan to Free Derry Corner, also took place on Sunday. At the scene: Mike McBride, BBC News NI People gather in the Millennium Forum for a special commemoration event half a century on since one of Derry's darkest days. A minute's silence is observed in the amphitheatre, as the names of those killed on Bloody Sunday are read out to a hushed audience. The poignant moment takes place as the bells of St Eugene's Cathedral ring out across the city. A chime for every life lost. Actor Adrian Dunbar, who is hosting the event, struggling to find words, says the emotions in the city today are truly palpable 50 years on from the atrocity. The walk of remembrance retraced the steps of the original march in 1972 A day of commemorative events had started with the families walking the same route their relatives had tried to walk five decades ago. Hundreds joined them along the way. A January day that started in peaceful protest, but ended in tragedy. John Kelly, the brother of Michael Kelly, handed out a white rose to a child representing each of the Bloody Sunday families. Each rose representing a loved one tragically taken that day. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpaid tribute to victims' familiesduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Johnson described Bloody Sunday as ""one of the darkest days in our history"" and said in the run up to the anniversary ""we must learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared and prosperous future"". Ahead of the 50th anniversary, ex-prime minister David Cameron said his 2010 apology for Bloody Sunday made it clear therewas no doubt what happened was wrong. When the Saville Inquiry was released, Mr Cameron apologised forthe ""unjustified and unjustifiable"" deaths. Thousands gathered in Derry on that January day for a rally organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. They were protesting against a new law giving the authorities powers to imprison people without trial - internment. The Stormont government had banned such protests, and deployed the Army. Many demonstrators marched towards Free Derry Corner The intended destination of the demonstrators was the city centre, but Army barricades blocked marchers, so many demonstrators headed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00 GMT, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. At 16:07 GMT, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10 GMT, soldiers began to open fire. Jean Hegarty, whose 17-year-old brother Kevin McElhinney was shot and killed on Bloody Sunday, said it was hard to believe 50 years had passed. Kevin, who worked at a local supermarket, was killed as he attempted to flee the firing on Rossville Street. Jean Hegarty looks out at the spot where her brother Kevin McElhinney, aged 17, was killed on Bloody Sunday ""It never gets easier to talk about, even after all this time, for some of us [the Bloody Sunday families] it still sadly feels like it happened just yesterday,"" Ms Hegarty told BBC News NI. She says Sunday is an extremely emotional day for the families. Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 Two public inquiries have been carried out into the events of Bloody Sunday. The Widgery Tribunal, which was announced shortly after Bloody Sunday, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. The Saville Inquiry, published in 2010, found none of the casualties was posing a threat or doing anything that would justify the shooting. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010. Detectives submitted their files to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) towards the end of 2016. Prosecutors said in 2019 they would prosecute a soldier, known only as Soldier F, for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney on Bloody Sunday. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the PPS. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by a brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims.

"Sheffield is one of the places to benefit Sheffield and Wolverhampton have been chosen as the first places to benefit from government regeneration funding. Ministers want to help transform derelict areas of 20 towns and cities in England, with new housing and jobs. The government says further details will be set out in its long-awaited blueprint to ""level up"" economic opportunities around the UK. But Labour said the announcement was ""recycled money"" and would not do enough to boost poorer areas. The government's levelling up policy paper, to be published next week, is also set to outline plans to expand devolution in England. Cabinet sources have told the BBC some government figures do not think the plans are ambitious enough, with concerns the proposals repackage certain policies that have already been announced. Make levelling up more than a slogan, say MPs Gove insists government has cash to spend The plan to end levelling-up confusion The town debating how to level up The government regeneration of the 20 locations is being funded by part of a Â£1.5bn fund announced by the chancellor at the last Budget in October. The money, which will be made available from April, will be allocated to councils in England to pay for new infrastructure on brownfield land - land that has previously been developed. The government is yet to confirm which other areas, other than Sheffield and Wolverhampton, will be prioritised for the cash. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the plans would help ""transform"" these areas, as well as relieving pressure on green fields and infrastructure in the South East. ""While talent is spread equally across the UK, opportunity is not. Our country is a success story, but not everyone is sharing in it,"" he wrote. ""That has to change. We need to tackle, and reverse, the inequality that is limiting so many horizons, and which also harms our economy."" ""The gap between much of the South East and the rest of the country - in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities - must be closed."" However, Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said the brownfield funding announcement was ""recycled money"" that would simply give ""a bit of a refund in a few places"" of investment lost under the Conservatives. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Morning programme, she added that the announcement ""completely misses the point,"" adding that people needed ""good jobs and wages"" to ensure levelling up was a success. The party has set out its own five-point plan for levelling up, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. Meanwhile, more than 100 places outside London will benefit from extra funding for arts and culture from 2023, the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said. Arts Council England will identify the locations, and DCMS said 100% of the additional funding recently agreed for the group would go to supporting culture and creativity outside of London. Announcing his Spending Review to parliament in October, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said more than Â£850m was being allocated to cultural and heritage infrastructure.

"Storm Ana made tens of thousands homeless across Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique The deadly storm that hit southern African countries this week has shown the reality of the climate crisis, a UN official has said. The death toll from the destruction caused by Storm Ana has risen to 86. Rescue workers are trying to reach tens of thousands who have been cut off as roads and bridges have been washed away in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi. Authorities are now watching to see if a second storm - Batsirai - will hit the continent next week. In Mozambique, where 18 people have been killed and 120,000 people affected, Maria Luisa Fornara, from the UN children's fund Unicef, described Storm Ana as a ""blunt reminder"" of the impact that climate change is having. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said more investment was needed to ""protect and save lives"". In one neighbourhood of Madagascar's capital, Antananarivo, people are having to use canoes to reach their flooded homes ""I lost my fishing boat, it was swept away by the strong wind,"" Abdul Ibrahim, a fisherman in Mozambique's Nampula province told AFP news agency. ""I have never seen anything like this before. It will be difficult for me to recover."" Seeking temporary shelter in a classroom for her and her two children, Maria Jose told AFP that the first winds had blown away her house. ""I have nothing left, I lost everything."" Some of the infrastructure that had been rebuilt after Cyclone Idai in 2019 has been destroyed again. In Madagascar, which was the first country to be hit on Monday, the death toll now stands at 48 and some 72,000 are reported to have lost their homes. ""I am very sad because we work like crazy to make money and now our house is destroyed,"" one woman said surveying the damage that was caused. Many people in Malawi, like elsewhere in the region, are now having to rebuild their destroyed homes Malawi's President, Lazarus Chakwera, declared a state of emergency in the wake of the storm which left 20 people dead in the country. The disaster management agency said families had been forced to carry the dead to burials because roads had been cut off. A resident in the southern town of Chikwawa, described how fellow villagers spent two days holding on to trees as the waters swept through. The weather authorities are keeping a close eye on Tropical Storm Batsirai which has formed in the Indian Ocean and is moving westwards.

"Young children between the ages of five and 11 considered most at risk of coronavirus will be offered Covid jabs from Monday in England. The move comes after the UK drugs regulator approved alow-dose versionof a Covid vaccine for children last month, deeming it safe and effective. Eligible children include those with learning disabilities and long-term conditions, such as diabetes. Cases in young children are rising, but for most, infections are not severe. Some of those most at risk are more vulnerable to serious illness, and those living with vulnerable adults could pass the infection on. In December 2021 the government's vaccine advisers, theJoint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation,external, recommended around 500,000 young children at highest risk be given the jabs. This includes children with serious underlying heart and lung conditions and those living with people with weakened immune systems. A decision on vaccinating all other five-to-11-year-olds has not yet been made. Deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, GP Dr Nikki Kanani, urged parents not to delay coming forward. She said: ""We know vaccines give significant protection against severe illness from Covid - including the Omicron variant - so it is important that our youngest and most at risk get protected."" Most jabs will be given by GP-led teams and in hospital hubs. Officials say parents and guardians should wait to be invited by the NHS. Young children at risk will be offered two Pfizer vaccines eight weeks apart - at a third of the adult dose. It is widely used in other countries - more than five million children have been given it in the US alone. Covid vaccines are already being offered to young children at risk inWales,externalandScotland,external. Public-health experts inNorthern Ireland,externalsay GPs will be sending parents information about jabs by early February. The NHS has already delivered more than three million vaccinations to people aged 12 to 17. Separately, NHS England plans send out flu vaccine reminders to the parents and guardians of eligible children. In England this includes all two-and-three-year-olds and all pupils from reception age to school leavers, to drive up protection from the virus.
