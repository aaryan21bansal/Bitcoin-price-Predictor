"Developers are still scouring the leaked code for fresh discoveries Details of new iPhones and other forthcoming Apple devices have been revealed via an apparent leak. Two news sites were given access to an as-yet-unreleased version of the iOS operating system. The code refers to an iPhone X in addition to two new iPhone 8 handsets. It also details facial recognition tech that acts both as an ID system and maps users' expressions onto emojis. One tech writer said it was the biggest leak of its kind to hit the firm. Apple is holding a launch event at its new headquarters on Tuesday. The California-based company takes great efforts to keep its technologies secret until its showcase events, and chief executive Tim Cook spoke in 2012 of the need to ""double down""on concealment measures. Some details about the new devices had, however, already been revealed in August, when Apple published some test codefor its HomePod speakers,external. But while that was thought to have been a mistake, it has been claimed that the latest leak was an intentional act of sabotage. ""As best I've been able to ascertain, these builds were available to download by anyone, but they were obscured by long, unguessable URLs [web addresses],""wrote John Gruber,external, a blogger known for his coverage of Apple. ""Someone within Apple leaked the list of URLs to9to5Mac,externalandMacRumors,external. I'm nearly certain this wasn't a mistake, but rather a deliberate malicious act by a rogue Apple employee."" Neither Mr Gruber nor the two Apple-related news sites have disclosed their sources. However, the BBC has independently confirmed that an anonymous source provided the publications with links to iOS 11's golden master (GM) code that downloaded the software from Apple's own computer servers. GM is a term commonly used by software firms to indicate that they believe a version of a product is ready for release. ""More surprises were spoiled by this leak than any leak in Apple history,"" Mr Gruber added. Apple could not be reached for comment. Apple chief Tim Cook has publicly discussed his desire to protect Apple's secrets Several developers are still scouring the leak for new features, but discoveries so far include: a reference to iPhone X, which acts as fresh evidence that Apple intends to unveil a high-end model alongside more modest updates to its handset line images of a new Apple Watch and AirPod headphones a set-up process for Face ID - an alternative to the Touch ID system fingerprint system - that says it can be used to unlock handsets and make online purchases from Apple, among other uses the introduction of Animoji - animated emoji characters that mirror a user's captured facial expressions It marks the second time in three months that the company seems to have been deliberately caught out by a staff member. In June, an hour-long recording of an internal meeting - ironically about stopping leakers -was passed onto the Outline news site,external. It revealed that Apple had hired ex-workers from the US National Security Agency (NSA), FBI and Secret Service to help catch tattletales. ""I have faith deep in my soul that if we hire smart people they're gonna think about this, they're gonna understand this, and ultimately they're gonna do the right thing, and that's to keep their mouth shut,"" one senior Apple executive was heard to say. Apple's mobile devices account for the bulk of its profits One company watcher said that the scale of the leak meant Tuesday's launch had lost some of its power to surprise. ""There will be an unbelievable effort within Apple to determine how this happened and I don't envy the person that did it because there will be no forgiveness for it,"" commented Ben Wood from the tech consultancy CCS Insight. But he added that it was unlikely to affect sales or interest in the new devices. ""For other companies this might have huge impact on the effectiveness of their grand official launches, but for Apple there is such insatiable demand for even the smallest details and such an obsessive fan-following of its products that even a very detailed leak will do little to dampen the enthusiasm of bloggers and others to report its news,"" he said.

"This video can not be played You're Boatiful: James Blunt makes an unusual stage exit James Blunt set sail over the audience at Radio 2's Hyde Park festival on Sunday - perched precariously inside a rubber dinghy. The star's take on crowd-surfing came at the end of a mid-afternoon set, which featured the hits You're Beautiful, Bonfire Heart and 1973. But he came to a sticky end when the Union Jack dinghy capsized about 30 rows back from the stage. ""Can we have him back, please?"" compere Alan Dedicoat asked the crowd. The star lasted about a minute before capsizing Blunt later emerged unscathed, after posing for selfies with (some of) the 35,000-strong audience. Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park: Full coverage Radio 2's rain-soaked ""festival in a day"" also saw performances from Stereophonics, Rick Astley, Emeli Sande and Blondie. And country star Shania Twain gave her first UK performance in 13 years, receiving a rapturous reception from fans who'd been waiting for her comeback. Shania Twain was the event's special guest, playing just before Blondie and Take That The singer has been out of action for several years after developing dysphonia, an ailment where the muscles squeeze the voice box. But, rising through a trap door in the stage in Hyde Park, she sounded reinvigorated. Declaring: ""London is my favourite cityâ¦ ever!"" she launched into hits including That Don't Impress Me Much and Man! I Feel Like A Woman. As she played her signature ballad, Still The One, the audience linked arms and swayed along to the song. There were plenty of memorable moments backstage, too. Here are five of the best stories we heard. How do we know? Because Rick Astley visited them, and lived to tell the tale. ""I have some friends in Denmark who own a beer company, and they made a beer for me,"" the star explained. ""We went to bar with them in Japan a couple of weeks ago, and one of the bars they own has a Rick Astley toilet. ""If you go in there,"" he continued, ""all the music played in that toilet is me. ""Being in Japan is a funky thing anyway, but going to a bar and having a toilet that just plays your music is a whole different level of funk. ""And I'd had a few beers as well that night. My head was a bit of a mess."" As she recovered from her vocal problems in 2012, Shania Twain took a residency at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. ""It was very stable,"" she explained. ""One environment every night - a very controlled environment for the voice - and I wasn't fatiguing myself by touring."" But she needed a little more support. Which came in the shape of... two horses. ""[During] You're Still The One, I had two horses on stage with me,"" she said. ""It helped me, psychologically. I'm serious! ""This whole process of not focussing on my voice really helped. The psychological distraction worked."" Sadly, the equestrian antics were not replicated at Hyde Park. ""I can't take the horse on tour,"" she noted, sensibly. Full disclosure: we knew this already - but it took one famous Blondie fan by surprise. ""That one's a shocker for a lot of people,"" said drummer Clem Burke. ""I approached Noel Gallagher for a song a couple of years back and the first thing he said was, 'I'll trade you for Hanging on the Telephone' and I said, 'Guess what? We didn't write that one.'"" ""The original Hanging on the Telephone [by The Nerves] is really good,"" added guitarist Chris Stein. ""I recommend it to anybody who's not heard it. It's a little more pared down, and a little calmer."" Meanwhile, Debbie Harry reassured fans the song would never be dropped from their set. ""It's hard because we want to play the new music,"" she said, ""but we also want to let people enjoy the things that bring back their memories."" This New Year, Emeli Sande resolved to learn a new skill: skateboarding. ""It's going ok,"" she laughed. ""At the moment I'm just going forward - not turning corners or doing any kinds of tricks."" And where does internationally-famous singer of song Emeli Sande practise her pop shoves and board flips? ""In my driveway! It's quite big. Big enough to skateboard on, at least."" When he's not crowdsurfing across Hyde Park, James Blunt is supporting his friend and co-writer Ed Sheeran on his US tour. ""It's extremely calm,"" he says of life on the road with the world's biggest pop star. ""We drink tea. We watch television series - I can't think of which one, but we take it very easy."" Over the last three months, though, he's noticed a big disparity between his show and Ed's. ""I have five people in my band, he has a loop pedal. He's not only a great musician but a great businessman, too. ""It feels highly inefficient of me, and my band sit there nervously, waiting to be fired.""

"Any MPs who oppose the government's EU repeal bill will be backing a ""chaotic"" Brexit, ministers have warned ahead of the first key vote on the legislation. The EU Withdrawal Bill, which will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, is being debated in the Commons. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson urged MPs not to ""frustrate"" the process, suggesting the public wanted the government to ""get this thing done"". Jeremy Corbyn is facing a rebellion over Labour's opposition to the bill. As two former ministers said they would defy the Labour whip by not voting against the bill, Mr Corbyn said he respected the outcome of last year's Leave vote but said he could not back the measure as he believed the government was trying to evade parliamentary scrutiny and ""grab"" wide-ranging powers. The Liberal Democrats also plan to vote against the bill but the government has the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, with whom they have a deal to secure a Commons majority. Live updates: MPs debate Brexit bill A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill Brexit: Repeal bill 'not a blank cheque' Blair calls for EU migration curbs Debate on the bill at second reading - the first chance for MPs to debate its main principles - resumed at 15:30 BST, with a series of votes scheduled for late on Monday night. MPs took turns to make their case, with supporters of the legislation saying it would make the Palace of Westminster ""more sovereign and more accountable"" but critics claiming it sought to ""strip Parliament of its sovereign power"". Previously referred to as the Great Repeal Bill, the bill overturns the 1972 European Communities Act which took the UK into the then European Economic Community. It will also convert all existing EU laws into UK law, to ensure there are no gaps in legislation on Brexit day. This video can not be played The foreign secretary won't be drawn on length of Brexit transition period on the Today programme Ministers say this process will ensure a smooth transition out of the EU, avoiding a ""cliff-edge of uncertainty"" but critics say ministers are also handing themselves sweeping powers to change laws without full parliamentary scrutiny. Former Conservative Chancellor Ken Clarke predicted the government would have to change the wording of the bill to deal with concerns about what he said was an unprecedented use of delegated powers. Conservative Bob Neill said some of the proposals in terms of powers were ""unacceptable and unnecessary"" but blocking the bill would ""do nothing for the good governance of the country nor for business confidence"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Ministers accept privately that they will probably have to budge in some areas. But tonight's midnight vote is not likely to be the big showdown. Tory rebels will, in the main, vote for the bill in principle, and enter hand-to-hand combat in the more detailed stages in the next couple of months. And although the opposition will vote against the bill this evening, there are also anxious MPs on that side of the House of Commons who won't, worried about appearing to be blocking Brexit by ""killing the bill"". But tonight will be the first real taste of the months to come, the House of Commons sitting until midnight, the government anxiously totting up the numbers, MPs being told to cancel any plans they have to be around for vital votes. Read Laura's blog Labour, which says the bill will give the government powers similar to those used by medieval monarchs, has tabled a series of amendments and will order its MPs to oppose it at second reading stage unless its changes are accepted. ""I hope Labour MPs will recognise that Labour fought the election recognising the result of the referendum... and that we would seek parliamentary scrutiny of the whole negotiating process,"" Mr Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's World at One. This video can not be played Labour MP Caroline Flint tells Radio 4's Today she will abstain from voting against the Withdrawal Bill ""It does not mean handing over all our decision-making on how the negotiations proceed to one secretary of state. This is a power grab by the government at the expense of our democratically elected Parliament."" But Labour MP Caroline Flint, a former minister for Europe, is refusing to vote against the bill despite the three-line whip imposed by her party - the strongest available sanction. ""Our job is to improve this bill,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Not kill it at birth."" Ms Flint, who has yet to defy the whip, said voting the bill down would cause ""huge problems"" by ending the session of Parliament and requiring an entirely new bill. Also confirming that he would not vote against the bill, Labour's former welfare minister Frank Field said he was ""on the side of the majority of people who voted to come out"" of the EU. The SNP said there was a risk of currently devolved powers being returned to Westminster in areas such as fishing and farming but Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said passing the bill was an important step in ""honouring the promises"" the government had made regarding Brexit. ""We need to get this great ship launched,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""I do very much hope we will win tonight but people who vote against it will be effectively voting to frustrate Brexit by producing a completely chaotic result."" And Brexit Secretary David Davis said the measures in the bill would mean the UK could leave the EU ""safe in the knowledge that we are ready for day one of exit"". ""A vote against this bill is a vote for a chaotic exit from the European Union,"" he warned. ""The British people did not vote for confusion and neither should Parliament. Without it, we would be approaching a cliff edge of uncertainty which is not in the interest of anyone.""

"The government is to lift the 1% public sector pay cap for the first time for both police and prison officers, the BBC understands. Ministers are expected to accept recommendations for higher pay rises this week and also to pave the way for similar increases in other sectors. Unions, the opposition, and some Tories are calling for the cap to be lifted. But there are warnings that police forces have budgeted for a 1% rise and without extra money, jobs are at risk. Reality check: Is public sector pay higher than private sector? Public sector pay: Will they or won't they? Hammond says UK must 'hold nerve' over public pay The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said that while forces were welcoming reports of a pay rise, there were widespread concerns that it would put a huge strain on them if extra resources were not found. The West Midlands Police and Crime commissioner has warned that, in such a scenario, 80 jobs would be lost for every 1% rise above the current cap. ""If the government do not put aside money to fund the pay increase, PCCs will be left with large bills and have no other option other than to reduce officer and staff numbers,"" Labour's David Jamieson said. ""The government must act quickly to ensure that its pay cap lifting is not a hollow gesture."" Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and since 2013, rises have been capped at 1% - below the rate of inflation. The higher increases expected this week for police and prison officers are based on the recommendations of independent pay review bodies, with recruitment and retention problems being cited in the case of prison officers. The BBC understands the Treasury will then issue guidance on next year's pay round, which is likely to see the cap eased in other areas where there are similar problems, such as teaching and nursing. Nurses protested about the pay cap at Westminster last week Most - though not all - pay review bodies this year identified recruitment and retention problems, but decided to take note of government policy on wage restraint so they didn't recommend rises above an average of 1%. But the police and prison officers review bodies, in as yet unpublished reports, did call for increases above 1% this summer, and the government has been mulling over how to handle a controversial issue. This week it will agree to the recommendations, though there may be some creativity over how the pay awards are implemented. And the government would also say that some public sector workers have enjoyed rises above 1% through promotion or pay increments. But now, more widely, the Treasury is expected to tell other pay bodies - covering teachers and NHS staff for example - that they can take recruitment and retention difficulties into account when recommending next year's increases. So not lifting of the pay cap across the board - which Labour is calling for - but this could be, as the TUC put it, a crack in the ice of pay restraint. It comes as MPs are set to vote on public sector pay on Wednesday. Labour's health spokesman Jon Ashworth urged Conservative MPs who ""sincerely"" believe the public sector pay cap should go to vote with his party during its Opposition Day debate, which would not be binding on the government. He told Sky News: ""We keep getting briefings in newspapers and suggestions that the government is sympathetic and wants to do something, and 'oh, it's terrible and we accept that but let's see where we get to'."" But the TUC's Frances O'Grady said the government should not favour some public service workers over others - and speaking at the TUC conference in Brighton, she said nurses, paramedics and fire fighters ""are very angry"", adding that seven years was ""a long time for anyone to manage"" with pay restraint. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're very clear that public service workers are a team. Pay shouldn't be a popularity contest. We know that front-line workers, so-called, depend on the whole team so we want a pay rise across the board."" The Public and Commercial Services union is to ballot its members on industrial action over the cap. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said raising pay in line with inflation for the next three or four years would cost Â£6bn to Â£7bn more than continuing with the current policy. During last week's Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said public sector workers were doing a vital job in often harrowing circumstances. She added that the government would wait for the publication of the police and prison officers' pay review bodies' reports before deciding its policy framework for 2018-2019.

"This video can not be played Dr Helen Webberley said she listens to 'children's hearts' about when they want treatment A Monmouthshire GP is being investigated over complaints about her giving gender-change hormones to children as young as 12. Dr Helen Webberley has been restricted from treating transgender patients unsupervised while the General Medical Council (GMC) looks into the case. The Abergavenny-based GP said there had been no adverse finding against her. The GMC said it would only comment on investigations if and when they reached tribunal stage. Transgender children: Preparing for puberty Child, five, referred to trans clinic The investigation was launched after two GPs complained to the GMC about Dr Webberley's private clinic, which specialises in gender issues. She told the BBC she had given cross-sex hormone treatment to one 12-year-old and three 15-year-olds, despite NHS guidelines that they be given at about 16 or over. ""There are many children under 16 who are desperate to start what they would consider their natural puberty earlier than that,"" Dr Webberley told BBC Wales. ""And, of course, when someone mentions a 12-year-old it is very emotive."" Dr Webberley said the NHS protocol on hormone treatment starting at about 16 was ""not set on any medical evidence or research"". ""It's not in line with the centres of excellence in other countries and the standards of transgender care moving forward,"" she added. She pointed out there had been ""no decisions or judgements"" made on the claims against her and they were ""simply aspects that need to be explored"". The restrictions imposed by the GMC on 7 May mean that all of Dr Webberley's work with transgender patients will have to be supervised until November 2018. She is unable to practise until she finds an approved clinical supervisor, which Dr Webberley says she is currently putting in place. Stephanie Davies-Arai, of campaign group Transgender Trends, which raises concerns about gender treatment among children, said she was ""very concerned"" by the move toward ""earlier and earlier"" treatment for ""younger and younger"" children. ""Teenagers [and children] are not really equipped to make long-term decisions and benefit and risk calculations. We should not be fixing their identity at that age with medication that is irreversible,"" she added. She said cross-sex hormone treatment can effectively put patients on the path to sterilisation, alongside other changes, which is a ""huge ethical issue"". ""These are huge, life-changing effects on children's bodies, on children's lives, and we need to be very, very cautious before presenting this treatment pathway to minors,"" she said. Ms Davies-Arai called for ""much-tighter regulation"" for private GPs in this area. The news comes after the Welsh Governmentannounced Wales would get its first transgender cliniclast month. The Tavistock clinic, in England,  which is currently the only centre offering gender identity treatment to young people in England and Wales, has seen asharp rise in cases in recent years. Only available on the NHS for those aged 16 or over Helps make those with gender issues ""more comfortable"" with their physical appearance and how they feel Hormones start the process of changes in the body Usually need to be taken indefinitely Source: NHS Wales to get first transgender clinic Websites looked at by health watchdog 'Four year wait' for transgender help Child, five, referred to trans clinic At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Italian rescue services issued this photo of the flooded Livorno area At least six people have been killed after heavy rainstorms and flooding in the Italian city of Livorno. Four members of a family were killed when their basement apartment flooded. Italian newspaper Il Tirreno reports that two parents and their son died. One girl was rescued by her grandfather, but he died when he returned to attempt for his other family members, the newspaper said. Pictures from the city showed large areas underwater and extensive damage. One resident, Piero Caturelli, said he had never seen such bad weather. ""It's incredible, incredible.  It started around 10pm and continued until this morning. In my living memory, there's never been anything like this,"" he said. The flooding caused extensive damage to property in Livorno Mayor Filippo Nogarin told the AFP news agency that the extent of the flooding was completely unexpected, as only an orange alert was issued. The city in Tuscany was the worst hit, but weather warnings have been issued for much of the country. Precautions are being taken in the capital, Rome, where the highest level of alert is in place.

He added that criticism of the UK government's response to the disaster was ""completely wrong"". Earlier Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon dismissedcomplaints that the UK's responsewas ""found wanting"" and that it was slower than France and the Netherlands.

"When Zoe's son left home and went to university his behaviour changed - he became uncommunicative and dropped out after his first year. Here Zoe talks about what happened and the conversation she wishes she'd had with him. He was a very carefree, happy-go-lucky child, easy-going, a little bit mischievous, but nothing out of the ordinary. I wouldn't have said he was particularly academic but bright enough to carry things off. So he did well enough in his GCSEs, went on to do A-levels, and did well enough to get into university - admittedly through clearing - but he did get into university. We took him up for Freshers' Week. He seemed to immediately get in with a nice group of friends. They all bought their tickets for the Freshers' Week entertainments and we left him in a hall of residence looking perfectly happy. The first weekend he was away we did get in touch with him and he seemed quite chirpy. After that it was more or less total silence. Part of the joy of going to university is getting away from your parents and finding your feet and being yourself, so we weren't unduly worried at that stage. We thought, ""We need to give him space just to be himself,"" I suppose. He didn't call us and he didn't answer our calls or emails. We were trying to phone him - in the end phoning almost every night, possibly a bit too much - and never getting anything back. We didn't really hear anything at all until it was time for him to come home for Christmas and he wanted a lift home. By the second term of his first year we thought, ""This is really a bit strange."" We got my husband's brother to visit him because he lived close to the university. He seemed to think things were okay. We went to visit ourselves - probably two or three times because it was quite a long way from us - and on the occasions when we did he seemed absolutely fine, maybe a little bit hyper, a little bit over-the-top, but not enough to give us huge concerns. He chatted and I think we played crazy golf and had a generally pleasant weekend, but again, after that, no contact. So by that third term we were getting really seriously worried. We had no way of knowing how he was doing academically and he kept us clear of his friends and his girlfriend. Listen to Zoe's interview in full oniPM on BBC Radio 4 And find outhow universities are trying to support their students better After he'd come home at the end of his first year the weeks went by and he didn't - apparently - hear about his exam results. So when nothing came through the post I called the university and was basically met with a blank wall. Their line was that at the age of 18 he's an adult, he is entitled to privacy, and we weren't entitled to know anything. So eventually, after I called once or twice, they did tell me that he'd done enough to get through to the second year. But when I told my son it then came out that he hadn't actually sat his exams, so he hadn't got through to the second year - that was just a mistake. Our fear was that he would just disappear from our lives by moving away and not contacting us, but I didn't have any suspicion that he was depressed or was in any trouble. We didn't have any hold on him and we were just so very, very sensitive about what we said to him - possibly too much now I look back on it. Initially he wanted to go back and change course and do something different, but in the end he decided he wasn't going to. We went through lots of options with him and he seemed quite keen on the fire service, but it's very competitive to get into and you have to be really fit. He wasn't unfit but he wasn't super fit, so we bought him trainers and my husband went running with him locally, we encouraged him as much as we could. Eventually he said he went for an interview - we're not actually sure whether he did or not - but he didn't get in. That was such a shame because I think that was the one thing that kind of lit a spark with him, that he would have liked to have done. After that he went back to his university town because he and his friends had organised a house together, which we were fine with, and he did actually get a clerical job which probably wasn't going anywhere but it was something. At the end of the academic year, he quit his job and came home. We're not sure what sparked that - he still seemed to be in contact with his friends, he had a girlfriend too who was in that town. He did tell his colleagues that he was going travelling which wasn't true, but that was what he told them to explain why he was leaving. He came home, had a week's holiday in Tenerife with his girlfriend, and then we were home for four or five weeks together with my younger son. Things seemed to be going reasonably well - he told us he had got in touch with a number of job agencies. I didn't want to rock the boat - and I'm going to regret that forever - because I think now he had got himself into a state where he couldn't see a way out, he couldn't see a way forward. Although he still had friends and he still had our support, I think he needed to know that he could start afresh, and I regret now not saying that that was the case. You can start again, particularly when you're only 20. We decided to go on holiday. I remember driving out of our village towards the ferry port and both of us saying we thought he'd turned a corner. He appeared to be going out to work every day, he seemed relatively happy, he was quite communicative at home. When I came home from work he would say, ""What sort of a day have you had?"" So we were quite relieved and felt happy enough leaving him. It was only a week's holiday. We came back on the Sunday. I'd sent him a text the previous day just to confirm when we were coming back. When we got home the first thing I noticed was that the car was missing. He hadn't passed his driving test but he was learning to drive, so I was immediately worried that he'd taken the car and driven it without being licensed to do so. Then when we got into the house there was a message, a handwritten message, saying, ""Please could you call the police station."" So I did that and I obviously asked what it was about. They said they didn't want to tell me over the phone, that they would be sending somebody around. So of course I was concerned, but my immediate reaction was to go around the house tidying up and unpacking and just keeping myself busy really, just to stop thinking about what it might be. My worst thought was that he had driven the car and he'd had an accident, maybe he'd hurt somebody else or something. So I was already quite worried. About half an hour later two policemen came to the door and I let them in. They said that while we were away our son had taken his life. I heard this almighty, animalistic cry from behind me, my husband. It just seemed so unbelievable. The policemen asked us to identify his handwriting from a note that had been left, and then asked us to fill in some forms. We had to give dates of birth and that sort of thing. I was so shocked at the time I couldn't even remember my son's date of birth, it's frightening really, your mind goes completely blank. After that they drove us down to the hospital to identify him. Somebody showed us into the mortuary and we spent just a few minutes with him and then left. The police officers took us home and left us, that was it. There was no follow-up or counselling or anything like that, but this was 13 years ago and my hope is that things have changed since then. My other son was travelling at the time and I couldn't get hold of him for about four or five days. Eventually we had a phone conversation with him and that was dreadful. I had met my son's girlfriend just briefly once, lovely girl. She was coming down with our blessing for the week that we were away.  I believe she went on the Thursday, and I think he took his life on Friday, Saturday night, but nothing untoward happened between the two of them, they were fine, and she didn't have any inclination at all that that was going to happen. His girlfriend and his friends that he shared the house with were totally shocked. They couldn't believe it, they'd never seen him have a down moment, they thought he was the life and soul of the party. The only thing I can think of was that he was depressed, possibly about the future and his lack of prospects, and just was extremely good at masking it. Nothing's come out of the woodwork to say that he was in any sort of trouble. In the notes that he left behind he said that he realised we were always there to support him, so it shouldn't have been that he felt he was alone. He had good friends, he wasn't a loner. He had school friends, university friends and us, and he kept them all very separate. But he was embellishing his life, things like he claimed to have been a drummer in a band which he hadn't been, just a few things like that - not wicked lies as such, just an embellishment of the truth, just what he wished his life was like. At 18 the law might say you are an adult from day one but it doesn't happen like that - there's a transition. I would have thought a parent who was pretty anxious phoning up saying they've not heard from their son for several months would have triggered some alarm bells somewhere. There should have been some sort of pastoral care that could follow that up, but there didn't appear to be any. Even if they had just said, ""Yes, we will follow that up. Would you like to talk to the tutor yourself?"" and then got back to us to let us know whether they had spoken to him and what the outcome was, that would have helped enormously. It might not have changed the end result, but I think parents should have some degree of say over their children at that age. Call the 24-hour NHS support line on 0800 0234 650 For the Samaritans, call 116123 After he'd gone we did find a list of the temp agencies that I assumed he'd contacted. I phoned them all up and none of them had ever heard of him, so we surmise from that that he probably wasn't working. We don't know what he was doing during those hours of the day when he was out of the house. The first few months after he died I went over and over in my mind trying to understand what had gone on and why it might have happened. Eventually I came to the conclusion that no amount of me worrying and mulling this over was going to make the slightest bit of difference. He had gone and there was nothing else I could do about it. It took me a long, long time to think about counselling of any sort. Initially I just thought I didn't deserve to feel better, I just felt so guilty. After 10 years I finally got around to going to a voluntary organisation for some counselling which was helpful. Obviously it can't change things but it came at a time when I couldn't keep talking to friends - they'd been immensely supportive, and I can't thank them enough for helping us out over that time and just being patient and listening - but there comes a time when if you cry every time you see somebody they're not going to want to see you. So it was useful being able to talk again to somebody who was sympathetic. Within a couple of days of the news we had put together a photo album of my son's life. We went through all of our old photos, pre-digital this was, and put together a nice album that showed his best bits and we had that on display at the funeral. And there were lots of very good bits.

"Long journeys can seem even more tedious when they're accompanied by the kids in the back seat asking ""are we nearly there yet?"" every few miles. So it can be something of a relief when a familiar landmark comes into view, indicating the comforts of home are just around the corner. From tree-topped tors to man-made monoliths, people shared with BBC Newstheir particular sights - and sites- that means the trip is nearing its end. Here are some more. Kirsten Reeve with her son Archie and their ""coming home tree"" A solitary tree stands atop the natural knoll, which rises roughly 20m above the Severn Valley. Also known as the Crookbarrow Hill, the mound is a registered monument with Historic England as the site of a mediaeval fortification. More importantly to some, though, the tree is a clear sign to those on the M5 that junction 7 - Worcester South - is drawing near. Kirsten Reeves has nominated The Tump as her family's ""coming home tree"". ""It is very special to our family. I grew up in Worcester so seeing the tree as we travelled home from holidays on the M5 was always a very exciting moment and symbolised that just 10 minutes of the journey were left. ""After moving away for many years I decided to move 'home' when my husband and I started our family as he was in the navy and spent a long time away. Our two children now love seeing the coming home tree too and always spend the last part of our journeys trying to be the first one to spot it as it emerges. ""My husband has spent a lot of time at sea and after completing an 11-month deployment away from home said that the best thing ever was seeing that tree and knowing he was finally home."" For Nick Mitchell the Ouse Valley viaduct at Balcombe always marks his return from London to Sussex by train. He tells the BBC: ""I know we are back in the countryside as we cross the magnificent structure. ""As the train soars over the beautiful Ouse Valley, passengers often look up from their newspapers and electronic devices to gaze out over the woods and fields. ""When there's heavy mist or it's dark, it feels like we are flying as you can't see the ground at all."" The National Lift Tower is a research facility built to test - you've guessed it - lifts. The 127m (418ft) tall structure houses six lift shafts of varying heights, one of which is a high-speed shaft with a (theoretical) maximum speed of 10m/s (22mph). It rose to wider fame when Sir Terry Wogan lampooned it on his BBC Radio 2 programme, dubbing it the ""Northampton lighthouse"". He even joked the east coast was eroding so quickly that the government had commissioned the ""lighthouse"" ready for Northampton's new coastal location. He's quoted as saying: ""I don't think it was looked on in an architectural sense by my listeners - they're a bit too dim - we just took it for what it was: a lighthouse in the middle of nowhere."" According to Christopher Watts, for whom it is the landmark that shows he's nearly home, it is known as ""Terry Wogan's lighthouse"". ""I also have a personal interest as l worked on it for six months during the construction, installing a lot of the lift equipment,"" Mr Watts says. Sarah Dev-Sherman and her children enjoy spotting the tower on their way to visit family The Church Langley Water Tower is a conspicuous landmark perched high above and on the west side of the M11. Sarah Dev-Sherman, originally from Essex but now living in Norfolk, says whenever she and her children visit family ""there is always a race with the kids to see who can see the Church Langley water tower first. ""When we see it, it means we're nearly there after a long time in the car.  It's such an iconic landmark you cannot fail to notice it."" Sue Simmons from Cambridge also lists it as her favourite sign that home is around the corner. ""We always shout 'home cone!' when we see it. People think we're strange, but it is now a family tradition."" The Penshaw Monument was built in 1844 in memory of John George Lambton, the first Earl of Durham. He was a reforming Whig politician with the nickname ""Radical Jack"" who inherited vast wealth, created by the coalmining interests on his family's estates, when he was only five. He then became known as ""Jog Along Jack"" after saying ""a gentleman could jog along comfortably on Â£40,000 a year"". For local boy Richard Speding, who has lived in London for more than 30 years, the Penshaw (pronounced Pen-sher) Monument is the first thing he looks for when leaving the A1 and joining the A690. ""It's then I know I'm only minutes from the village I was brought up in.  If I have the time I will visit and climb up to the top and survey my hometown."" Hidden inside one of the towers is a secret passage which goes to the top of the 20m (66ft) structure - the National Trust opens the winding staircase to the public between Good Friday and the end of September. Its towering profile is one of the symbols on the badge of Sunderland Football Club. Dream, a statue of the elongated head of a nine-year-old girl is located on the summit of the former Sutton Manor Colliery in St Helens, Merseyside, midway between Liverpool and Manchester. It was created by Catalan artist Jaume Plensa after the group of former miners who made up the commissioning committee were unhappy with his first proposal - a statue of a mining lamp. They rejected the proposal and asked for something more ""present day and progressive"". Plensa came back with Dream. It's a homecoming landmark for Maeve and Maurice Harris, who remember the topping off ceremony in 2009 as it was on the same day as the birth of their first grandchild. ""For that reason, we always call her ""Your Grace"" after our granddaughter Gracie. She's a special reminder of a special time and always makes us smile on the way back to Warrington."" The Parish Church of St Mary and All Saints has a vision-bendingly twisty spire, which signifies ""home"" for John Merry. He says local lore has it that the devil or a witch caused the twist when being expelled from the area. The spire is made of wood and clad in lead. It's thought the lean on the tower is accidental and arose from the use of unseasoned timber and inexperienced craftsmen, while the twist is a deliberate design. The church survived underground activities of both coalmining and railway works, as well as two world wars, but nearly succumbed to fire in 1961.

"They were convicted of crimes they did not commit and are permanently changed by spending years in prison. They face a range of serious psychiatric problems and can never return to the lives they had before. Four exonerated prisoners - Robert Brown, Paddy Hill, Sunny Jacobs and Peter Pringle -told the BBC documentary Fallouttheir false convictions continued to blight their lives many years later. Robert Brown - sentenced to life: served 25 years Robert Brown celebrates on his release from prison but he now says it was a hollow victory At the age of 19, Glasgow-born Robert Brown was found guilty of a murder he didn't commit. He was arrested in Manchester in 1977 and charged with killing 51-year-old Annie Walsh. Brown had first travelled to the city to watch Manchester United. He had met a girl and ended up staying. He says he was trying to build a new life for himself after growing up in a children's home in Renfrewshire. ""The police took that opportunity away from me to build a new life with my girlfriend, who I cared for and loved,"" he says. ""It affected her as well. She died of alcohol poisoning at 35 years of age."" This video can not be played Robert Brown hasnât slept in a bed in six months as he needs cell-like conditions to sleep. Brown's arrest came early one morning four months after the murder. ""I was beaten up in the police station for two days and I got blamed for the murder of Annie Walsh,"" he says. Brown signed a confession but always claimed it was because he was bullied into it by the police. A decade before his release he could have applied for parole but refused because it would have meant abandoning his claims of innocence. He says: ""My mother begged me to take parole. That was never going to happen. If I had taken parole I was a dead man. ""If I had took parole I would have been selling my soul to the devil. I would never have been free."" In 2002, the Court of Appeal heard of a ""conspiracy of corruption"" within Greater Manchester Police and that one of the police officers central to the case, former Detective Chief Inspector Jack Butler, was ""deeply corrupt"". Brown's conviction was considered unsafe and he was released after 25 years behind bars. He says: ""To ram it down the back of their throats, the establishment, is an amazing feeling but it a hollow, empty victory - and then the real horror story begins."" He remembers raising his hands aloft outside the court on his release. ""I thought what am I doing this for because it was not a victory."" Brown says: ""The amount of time that I served would, in all honesty, damage anybody. ""The deprivation, the degradation, that would damage anybody."" Fifteen years after his release he lives in a one room ""prison cell"" and struggles to sleep. ""At night time I just walk up and down, your adrenaline is off the Richter scale, your heartbeat is off the Richter scale, it is a constant kaleidoscope of thoughts about what they did to me. ""I go through that process until my head is that tired of thinking about it I just conk out for a couple of hours."" This video can not be played Paddy Hillâs reaction to being released from prison after 16 years. On the day, Robert Brown was released from prison, there was another man standing beside him who had been through the same ordeal. Paddy Hill was one of the Birmingham Six, sentenced to life for the IRA bombings in 1974 and released as an innocent man after 16 years. His psychiatrist describes him as one of the most mentally scarred cases he has ever come across. It was the organisation that Hill founded after his release - the Miscarriage of Justice Organisation or MOJO - whose campaign was instrumental in Brown winning his freedom. Hill says: ""People think that when we got out it was the old proverbial fairytale ending, we get plenty of money and head off into the sunset and live happily ever after. It's a load of nonsense."" The 72-year-old grew up in the Ardoyne area of Belfast but moved to Birmingham with his family in 1960, at the age of 16. He says: ""I met a girl there and fell in love and got married. Birmingham was like my second home."" Firemen survey the damage outside the Birmingham pub, 'Tavern in the Town', after an IRA bomb blast On the night of bombings at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town pubs in Birmingham, in which 21 people died, Hill was travelling back to Belfast with a group of friends. ""We were getting the boat back from Heysham back to Belfast,"" he says. The wrecked interior of the Mulberry Bush public house after the explosion of a bomb planted by the IRA Hill says he was having a pint on the boat when a ""uniform cop with a big Alsatian came up to me and said port security wanted to talk to me"". At first the interrogation followed procedure but when police from the West Midlands arrived, Hill says, he was battered and tortured. ""It changed my whole life round,"" he says. ""I never thought I would go to jail."" Paddy Hill speaking after his release from prison in 1991 He was released in 1991. ""If you had told me the day I got out that I would not be able to handle the outside world I would have laughed in your face,"" Hill says. ""I was a hell of a lot happier in prison than I was when I came out."" Hill says he ""hit he wall"" a few months after being released and began to burst into tears without warning. It has been a quarter of a century since Hill was released but the effects of his wrongful conviction remain. He says: ""I have a bad sleeping pattern. I wake up and the sweat and the adrenaline is pumping through you at 100 mph and every one of your nerves is like they are being stretched."" Ten years after his release Hill founded MOJO. He says his anger levels at his own situation have come down over the years but he now gets angry for other people when he hears their stories. ""There are more innocent people in prison today than there was in my day, a hell of a lot more,"" Hill says. ""The reason they don't help us is clear to me, it would be an admission of guilt."" Peter Pringle was one of the last men to be sentenced to death in Ireland, convicted of murdering two Gardai in 1980. He served 15 years. He was born and raised on the south side of Dublin and left school early after ""a bit of bother"" with a Christian brother. Peter, who is now 78, says he was ""very angry"" about the poverty in Dublin in the 1950s and joined Sinn Fein when he was 16. He became known to police when he was involved with the IRA in his youth but after spending two years in an internment camp in his early 20s he moved to the west coast and became a fisherman. This video can not be played How Peter Pringle grieved for the life he should have had before it was stolen from him. At the age of 41, with a serious drink problem, he was arrested in Galway and accused of armed robbery and the murder of a policeman acting in the course of duties. ""I had absolutely nothing to do with it,"" Pringle says. The bank robbery was in Co Roscommon, 80km (50 miles) from where he was staying. ""I am an alcoholic and at that time had a serious drink problem and on that date I was on a 12-day session,"" he says. ""It was brought to my attention that the police were looking for me. ""I detoxed in the police station while being battered and interrogated. It was an horrendous time. I knew I had nothing to do with it. I was not even in the bloody county."" He was sentenced to death and put in a death cell. Two weeks before his execution date in June 1981, he was told his sentence had been commuted to 40 years in jail. He studied law and fought his case, eventually winning release in 1995. Peter actually got help from a clinical psychiatrist on his release because it was organised by his human rights lawyer Greg O'Neill. ""He explained to me about grief and how I needed to grieve for the life I might have had if I had not of been sent to prison,"" Pringle says. He says the dreadful experience of that grief has helped him cope with his life now. ""I had a terrible loss, a terrible blackness, just feeling totally lost,"" he says. ""That terrible time actually benefits me now."" Peter Pringle and Sunny Jacobs have been around the world campaigning against the death penalty Along with his new partner, Sunny Jacobs (see below), Pringle now uses what happened to him to help other exonerated prisoners. He says: ""We provide a place where people who have experienced wrongful imprisonment can be with people who have experienced the same thing. ""We can listen, they know we are not judging. They know we understand."" Sunny Jacobs was sentenced to death, along with her then husband, for the murder of two police officers in Florida in 1976 and served 17 years on Death Row. She says: ""We have been told the experience of being convicted and locked up for 15/20 years is beyond post-traumatic stress disorder. It is something that does not even have a name."" This video can not be played How would you celebrate your release after being wrongfully incarcerated for 17 years? Jacobs was born in Queens, New York City, and describes herself as a ""quiet kid who liked rescuing injured animals"". She had a son when she was 18 which ended her college career and she says she became isolated, concentrating on raising her child. Ten years later, in 1976, she was married to Jesse Tafero and had a second child, who was just 10 months old. Their car broke down in Florida and someone Jesse knew offered to give them a lift back to North Carolina. Jacobs and her children were sleeping in the car in the rest area of an Interstate when the police came to check the IDs of drivers. The next thing she knew there were shots being fired and the driver, Walter Rhodes, was ordering Sunny and the kids into the police car. Rhodes drove them away but they were stopped at a road block. Two police officers were killed in the gunfire and Jesse and Sunny were convicted on the testimony of Rhodes, who negotiated a plea bargain, claiming they had pulled the triggers. At her trial Jacobs says there was one juror ""who refused to bullied in going along with the rest of them because he did not feel right about the conviction"". She says: ""As a result of not being unanimous they had to sentence me to life in prison but the judge overruled them and sentenced me to death anyway."" At the time she was the only woman in the US with a sentence of death. Jacobs was put in solitary confinement for five years, awaiting execution, but eventually her sentence was commuted to life. Her husband Jesse was executed in horrific circumstances. Jacobs says: ""The electric chair malfunctioned and instead of dying he caught fire. ""The people who were there on behalf of the media said that flames shot out of his head and smoke came out of his ears and he struggled against his restraints. ""It took 13 and a half minutes before he was finally pronounced dead. ""When our daughter, who was by then 15 years old, heard what happened to her father she tried to kill herself."" After Jesse's execution, Rhodes confessed he had fired the fatal shots and Jacobs was released 1992, at the age of 45. She says the authorities were in such a hurry to get rid of her that there was no-one to collect at the prison. ""I was standing there with my little box of possessions,"" she says. ""I had not a penny in my pocket, I had no ID, it was like I had just landed from some strange planet through a portal."" She says she was afraid it was a trick and there might be a marksman on the roof ready to shoot her if she moved away from the prison. For Jacobs, being released was a ""big let down"" because she felt estranged from all the people whom she thought of as her home base. Jacobs, who practices yoga and meditation, says she had to stop focusing on the harm done to her and instead concentrate on what was left of her life and ""what could I do?"" ""That helped me a lot,"" she says. ""I was able to form a new healthy relationship with each of my children and then my grandchildren. ""All this time later it is still a daily process."" Sunny and Peter met in 1998 when Jacobs travelled to Ireland to speak at Amnesty International events. They now live together in Ireland and run the Sunny Center, giving exonerated prisoners somewhere to go where they will be listened to and understood. She says: ""As a result of us coming together we are able to share with others in ways that we wouldn't be able to individually. ""So I really think that peace is the way and love is the answer.""

"Flags of all varieties were seen at the Royal Albert Hall The 2017 Proms season has ended with a rallying cry for the future of classical music. ""For many decades we have heard about the imminent demise of classical music,"" said conductor Sakari Oramo. ""But look,"" he said, surveying the Royal Albert Hall, ""at this."" ""Classical music is going to be around for a very long time,"" he added, praising Proms co-founder Sir Henry Wood, ""whose vision of access to music for everyone continues to inspire us."" As is tradition, the audience set off party poppers, honked hooters, danced and wept melodramatically during Sir Henry's medley of British sea songs.

Initially the sole conductor and musical director, he presided over more than 5,000 promenade concerts, and premiered works by Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and Mahler, amongst others. In an interview from 1941, broadcast on Radio 3 during Saturday's Last Night celebrations, he echoed the sentiments expressed by Oramo. ""They said there wasn't the public for great music 47 years ago. The critics wagged their heads. ""But Robert Newman said we'd make a public and we did. It was a bold venture in 1895 [but] it worked."" Sir Henry Wood conducting one of his 5,000 Proms concerts This year's Proms season - the 123rd - has seen 80 orchestras and ensembles performing more than 400 pieces of music, including 30 premieres, over eight weeks. Highlights includedNicola Benedetti's dramatic performanceof Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No 1; the Aurora orchestraplaying Beethoven's Eroica from memory; and French orchestra Les Sieclesbreaking into Daft Punk's Get Luckyfor their encore. Saturday's Last Night wrapped up the season in traditional good spirits, with Swedish soprano Nina Stemme dressing up as a Valkyrie to deliver Rule Britannia. The concert opened with a premiere of Flounce, a spritely new work by Finnish composer Lotta Wennakoski, whose staccato strings and sweeping crescendos resembled one of Bernard Hermann's soundtracks for Alfred Hitchcock. Stemme later brought the audience to tears with a sublime performance of the Prelude and Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. Across the UK, fans joined in the fun with Proms in the Park concerts in Enniskillen, Swansea, Glasgow and London's Hyde Park. Mica Paris braved the Welsh rain to deliver an impassioned tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, while the London audience were treated toBryn Terfel lugging around milk churns,externalas he performed If I Were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof. In Northern Ireland, Dame Evelyn Glennie delivered an eye-wateringly brisk performance ofFlight of the Bumblebee,external; while Hyde Park was headlined by Kinks legend Sir Ray Davies. ""I don't know anywhere else in the world where you have something like this,"" marvelled Nina Stemme ahead of her performance. ""I think we should do more concerts with this kind of participation, in various forms, from the audience."" Swedish soprano Nina Stemme dressed as a Valkyrie for Rule Britannia! The 2017 Proms welcomed nearly 300,000 concert-goers through the doors of the Royal Albert Hall, with one in five purchasing standing tickets which are sold on the day for Â£6. More than 35,500 tickets were bought by people attending the Proms for the first time and 10,000 under-18s attended concerts across the season. The BBC Proms will return on 13 July, 2018.

"""When I had surgery, I was not thinking that I would be anywhere near a US Open title,"" said Sloane Stephens Sloane Stephens was planning to spend Saturday night in New York celebrating with Madison Keys, hours after beating her friend to a first Grand Slam title. The 24-year-old American, ranked 83rd until Monday, thrashed 15th seed Keys 6-3 6-0 in just 61 minutes to complete a scarcely believable return from injury. Asked if she would be buying the drinks, Stephens confirmed: ""Yes, a lot of them apparently. We are having a little celebration and she is coming."" Just 69 days after returning from an 11-month injury lay-off, and six weeks since her ranking dropped to 957, Stephens became only the fifth unseeded woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in the Open era. And she later revealed it was boredom as much as nerves that threatened to upset her equilibrium during the 48 hours between semi-final and final at Flushing Meadows. ""I was literally in my room twiddling my thumbs,' she said. ""I was looking at car reviews last night on Auto Trader, like literally. That's how bored I was. I didn't have anything to do."" Stephens admitted that the nerves finally took hold as she stepped out onto Arthur Ashe Stadium - but a little over an hour later her eyes were bulging as a cheque for $3.7m (Â£2.8m) was handed to her and she was announced as a Grand Slam champion. She said: ""There are no words to describe how I got here, because if you told someone this story they'd be, like, 'that's insane'."" Stephens wins first Grand Slam title Nadal favourite to win men's title Live scores, schedule and results It is four years since Stephens first grabbed worldwide headlines when she beat compatriot Serena Williams in the Australian Open quarter-finals. The likes of NBA stars Shaquille O'Neal and Dirk Nowitzki, and singer John Legend, congratulated her on social media, and a star had seemingly been born. In the event, progress was harder going until 2016 when she won three titles, cementing her place in the top 30 and apparently on the up. A right foot stress fracture halted that momentum, forcing her to withdraw from the US Open last August, and she would not return until Wimbledon. Surgery followed in January and for the next 16 weeks Stephens was on crutches and unable to put any pressure on her foot. Just a month before Wimbledon, she was still wearing a protective boot. ""There is no positive to not being able to walk and being on one leg,"" said Stephens. ""That's not fun for anyone."" Finally, Stephens stepped back on court in July - and first-round defeats at Wimbledon and in Washington were entirely predictable. Her ranking plummeted to 957. What followed was, in her own words on Saturday night, ""insane"". The victory over Keys was her 15th in 17 matches, the kind of form shown by someone vying to be number one rather than avoid slipping outside the top 1,000. ""When I had surgery, I was not thinking that I would be anywhere near a US Open title,"" she said. ""Nor did I think I was going to be anywhere near the top 100."" Keys and Stephens shared a laugh before the trophy presentation Sybil Smith made her tournament debut in the player box for the final as her daughter made history. ""It was nice that we got it right for the two weeks, and I came out with the title,"" said Stephens. It is eight years since Stephens attended her father's funeral on the eve of the US Open, after he died in a car accident in Louisiana. Estranged from the family, John Stephens had been a running back in the NFL for the New England Patriots, the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs. But it was her mother, Sybil, an all-American swimmer, who brought up Stephens, and that included introducing the nine-year-old to tennis. ""Obviously my whole life my mum has been very supportive,"" said Stephens. ""She's been in my corner the whole time. ""I have had a lot of ups and a lot of downs - and some really low downs - and throughout that, my mum has been there 100% with me."" It was at a tennis academy in her native Florida that Stephens learned the game, and also where she met Laura Robson as an 11-year-old. The British number four, 23, was clearly moved on Saturday night by seeing two of her friends and contemporaries on the US Open presentation stage, posting on social media: ""Who's cutting onions?"" Robson might use both women as inspiration for her own struggle back up the rankings following injury. Stephens has spent as much time in 2017 as a TV presenter on a US tennis channel - what Keys described as ""her second job"" - as she has on court, helping fill her time during the 11-month injury lay-off. Describing herself as in ""a sad place"", the television work proved to be a boost to morale. Paul Annacone, ex-coach of Pete Sampras, worked with Stephens for eight months in 2014, and again on her TV work this year. He believes the extended break from tennis had some benefit. ""I think it has helped Sloane become more focused and realise that the window is closing, ever so slightly,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""That's allowed her to go on court with a much more relentless ability to compete and deal with adversity. ""I think historically she has got a little bit nervous in stages, and then when adversity has set in she's struggled a little bit to compete through it. ""This summer, Sloane's been amazing with adversity."" The semi-final victory over fellow American Venus Williams in New York took her record in three-set matches this summer to 8-0. Stephens will not be short of family and friends, including Keys, to celebrate with in New York. Her coach, Kamau Murray, and team have exuded calm, happily posing with fans in the public plaza at Flushing Meadows earlier in the week. It is unlikely Serena Williams joined the party eight days after giving birth to her first child, but the 23-time Grand Slam champion posted her support on social media before the final. ""There are NO words to describe how proud and how happy I am,"" Williams said on Twitter. One person absent from the player box on Arthur Ashe Stadium was Stephens' boyfriend, Jozy Altidore, a former forward for Sunderland in the Premier League, now leading the line for Toronto FC. Otherwise engaged in MLS action against San Jose, he revealed that he found out the result of the final from his mother in the stands at half-time. Altidore then scored twice in the second half of a 4-0 win. ""That's really good,"" said Stephens, before adding: ""He should have got a hat-trick. It would have been such a good day. Goodness.""

"The bodies of hundreds of children are believed to be buried in a mass grave in Lanarkshire, southern Scotland, according to an investigation by BBC News. The children were all residents of a care home run by Catholic nuns. At least 400 children are thought to be buried in a section of St Mary's Cemetery in Lanark. The Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul, which ran the home, refused to comment on the findings. The research by the File on 4 programme in conjunction with theSunday Post newspaper,externalfocused on Smyllum Park Orphanage in Lanark. It opened in 1864 and provided care for orphans or children from broken homes. It closed in 1981, having looked after 11,600 children. A burial plot, containing the bodies of a number of children, was uncovered by two former residents of Smyllum in 2003. Frank Docherty and Jim Kane discovered an overgrown, unmarked section of St Mary's Cemetery during their efforts to reveal physical abuse which they said many former residents had suffered. St Mary's Cemetery in Lanark where the bodies of more than 400 children are believed to be buried In 2004, the campaigners said the Daughters of Charity told them their records suggested that children had been buried in 158 compartments in the graveyard. Frank and Jim, who both died earlier this year, believed however, that the numbers were far higher as the nuns had indicated their records were incomplete. The investigation by File on 4 and the Sunday Post indicates they were right; at least 400 children are understood to be buried in the plot. ""Oh my God, I've got goose pimples. It's shocking,"" said Frank Docherty's widow, Janet. ""He had been trying for years to find a figure and he didn't get anywhere. That's unbelievable."" The death records indicate that most of the children died of natural causes, from diseases common at the time such as TB, pneumonia and pleurisy. Analysis of the records show that a third of those who died were aged five or under. Very few of those who died, 24 in total, were aged over 15, and most of the deaths occurred between 1870 and 1930. One of those believed to be buried there is Francis McColl. He died in 1961, aged 13; his death certificate indicates he died from a brain haemorrhage. His brother Eddie spent decades wondering what had happened to Francis. At one point, he heard he'd been struck on the head by a golf club, which now chimes with the evidence of the death certificate. But Eddie could find no trace of where his brother had been buried. ""It's ridiculous,"" he says. ""I'm not happy about that. Whoever is behind this, I hope they can live with themselves."" Many allegations of abuse at the care home were also uncovered by File on 4 and the Sunday Post, including beatings, punches, public humiliations and psychological abuse. This case mirrors the investigation into theTuam mother and baby home, an Irish institution run by a religious order, where it is thought nearly 800 babies and young children died and were buried in unmarked graves between the 1920s and 1960s. Smyllum Park Orphanage in Lanark after it closed in the 1980s What happened at Smyllum is one of the topics that theScottish Child Abuse Inquiryis examining. Two representatives of the Daughters of Charity gave evidence to the inquiry this summer in which they said they could find no records of any abuse taking place. The nuns refused to respond to detailed questions from reporters about how many people were buried in the mass grave. In a statement, they said they were ""co-operating fully"" with the Child Abuse Inquiry and that they believed that was the ""best and most appropriate forum for such investigations"". They continued: ""...as Daughters of Charity our values are totally against any form of abuse and thus, we offer our most sincere and heartfelt apology to anyone who suffered any form of abuse whilst in our care"". Memorial stone at St Mary's Cemetery to remember all who died at Smyllum Park Orphanage Since 1855, there has been a legal duty in Scotland to register a death. Those death records are available for scrutiny at the National Records for Scotland office in Edinburgh. The records contain details such as the name and age of the deceased as well as what they died of and their usual place of residence. After focusing on those people under 18 who'd been resident at Smyllum, the BBC and Sunday Post checked local burial records for Lanark, which today are held with South Lanarkshire Council. They found no evidence that the dead had been buried. Some children were sent to the home from other places across central Scotland, so spot checks were also made with a number of other areas. Burial records were discovered in Glasgow for two of the dead. No other area we approached could find any burial record for the names we asked them to check. As the Daughters of Charity have previously indicated that children were buried in an unmarked plot at the cemetery, and that their records are incomplete, all the bodies are believed to be buried in the graveyard. The method is a replica of that used to expose amass grave in the Irish Republic. File on 4: The Secrets of Smyllum Parkis broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 12 September 2017 at 20:00 BST.

"The service has been running since 2015 An open-top bus service has been axed because of ""hostility and tirades"" from residents, its operator says. Drivers of the Jurassic Mule service, on the Devon and Dorset coast, have been verbally abused and a bus depot entrance was ""deliberately blocked"". The Mendip Mule Motorbus service runs through Beer, Colyton and Seaton in Devon, and on to Lyme Regis and Charmouth in Dorset. The operator said buses will be withdrawn from service later. It has been running since 2015 and employs 25 part-time staff. Issues over parking had arisen in Seaton and cars had been badly parked, intentionally, across Colyton bus depot's entrance, owner Derek Gawn said. ""I do realise that 99% of people do support us, but I can no longer cope with the 1%,"" said Mr Gawn. He said the company used a bus park in Seaton, provided by East Devon District Council for use by buses and coaches on a pay-and-display basis. ""It isn't for the bus drivers to be shouted at by residents who don't welcome the facility,"" Mr Gawn continued. ""[And it's] not a particularly good welcome for the much-needed tourists bringing their spending to the town."" East Devon District Council said it was a matter for Seaton Town Council, which has not responded to a BBC request for comment. ""We have also experienced people deliberately parking their cars badly on the approach to our depot at Colyton Station in an attempt to make access difficult,"" Mr Gawn added. Some people have taken to social media in support of the service. On Facebook, Clare Dare said: ""I think by moving next to a bus park there is a pretty good indication that there may possibly be a bus or 2 in there at some point!!!""

"The stabbings happened at a church on Rocky Lane in Aston Three people have been injured in a stabbing inside a church in Birmingham. A 33-year-old man is being treated in hospital after he was knifed at the New Jerusalem Apostolic Church, in Aston, at about 10:50 BST. He is in a stable condition and his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. A 46-year-old man is being held on suspicion of attempted murder. The other two people suffered hand injuries as they tried to restrain the knifeman, West Midlands Police said. Early indications suggested the offender and victim knew each other and it was a targeted attack, the force added. In a statement on Facebook, the church said three members of its congregation were injured. None of the injuries were life-threatening, it said. The church said: ""At this time we are restricting hospital visits to family only and we will keep you updated as regularly as possible.

"Kim Jong-un attended a celebration for the country's nuclear scientists and engineers after its latest test Nato's general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg, has said North Korea's nuclear programme ""is a global threat and requires a global response"". ""That of course also includes Nato,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. But he refused to say whether an attack on the US overseas territory of Guam would trigger the military alliance's collective defence pact. Article 5 of the Nato treaty says that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all. Guam, an island territory of the US in the Pacific Ocean, is a key military outpost and has been the subject ofheated rhetoric from Pyongyang. North Korea crisis in 300 words How should Trump handle North Korea? How do you defend against North Korea? ""I will not speculate about whether Article 5 will be applied in such a situation,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. ""What I will say is that we are now totally focused on how can we contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict and press North Korea to stop its nuclear missile programmes."" He called on North Korea to stop its development of nuclear weapons, saying it was a blatant violation of UN security resolutions and ""a threat to international peace and stability"". This video can not be played Nato's Jens Stoltenberg: N Korea response ""of course includes Nato"" Nato has condemned Pyongyang's tests but, as a military alliance, is not directly involved in the related diplomacy. The comments from Mr Stoltenberg come as members of the UN Security Council differ on how to deal with the crisis following North Korea's latest missile test over Japan. The UShas drafted a resolutionto increase sanctions and cut off some of the last remaining sources of income for Pyongyang, as well as imports of oil. Russia, however,has expressed scepticism about more sanctions, which have had little effect so far. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? Appearing separately on the same programme as Mr Stoltenberg, British defence minister Michael Fallon said the US would have a right to ask other members of the United Nations to join any defence of its territory - but that should be avoided. ""What we have to avoid at all cost is the spilling over in to any kind of military conflict,"" he said. ""So we're working flat out at the United Nations to get a better resolution there, to enforce the existing sanctions. We are looking at sanctions across the European Union and of course we are trying to persuade China to keep its neighbour in check."" Analysts believe a military conflict with North Korea would be devastating for both Pyongyang and South Korea; and some say that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is seeking a nuclear deterrent rather than planning for open war.

"British Commandos have been providing support in the British Virgin Islands Fifty police officers are flying to the UK's overseas territories to help restore order after Hurricane Irma, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says. The situation across the Caribbean is ""very grim indeed"", he said, following an emergency government meeting. But he said things are improving in the British Virgin Islands where 125 troops are helping to tackle looting. He added that criticism of the UK government's response to the disaster was ""completely wrong"". Earlier Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon dismissedcomplaints that the UK's responsewas ""found wanting"" and that it was slower than France and the Netherlands.

For his part, the governor has imposed an overnight curfew to keep criminality at bay. A drive back to the airport revealed further damage. With trees uprooted, another fear is that rain could result in land erosion. Back inside the airport arrivals lounge, UK soldiers spent Saturday night sleeping on the luggage carousel and on benches.

She said: ""All US and Canadian citizens were flown off the island yesterday but no British citizens were allowed to leave, after being taken to the airport and queuing for four hours for the evacuation plane, as there has been no communication between the Foreign Office and the island.

"This video can not be played Hurricane Irma left a path of destruction in the Virgin Islands The BBC's Paul Blake and Laura Bicker report from the British Virgin Islands, where Hurricane Irma's force has destroyed communities, and left at least five people dead. The flight into the island of Tortola should feature sweeping views of lush green hillsides and translucent-blue bays. Today it looks like the victim of a bomb blast. On approach to the airport on Saturday, boats could be seen piled on top of one another like children's toys. Others laid lop-sided on dry ground or semi-submerged offshore. A car ride to the governor's office gave a street-level view of the destruction. Many neighbourhoods have been flattened, their residents can be seen trying to cook and clean amidst the rubble. Hill sides were strewn with debris and dotted by houses disembowelled by the storms powerful winds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Around them, the earth looked scorched - not by fire, but by wind and water that has ripped away vegetation. Power lines snaked across roads while residents drove over them in vehicles with blown-out windows. Residents recalled the storm with horror, with many believing that the hurricane had spun off tornadoes, which then cut through buildings like a jigsaw. As they tried to assess the damage, many asked with trepidation about Hurricane Jose - a smaller storm loosely following Irma's path - and whether it was coming their way. This video can not be played Hurricane Irma: 'My roof blew off - I lost everything' We met one survivor who was still trying to comprehend what had happened to his home. Arron Glasgow says he and his brother were fighting to keep the wind out when the roof suddenly blew off. Standing in what used to be the family's living room, he says ""I've lost everything. What you see me have on - perhaps one other shirt - is what I have."" Flipped cars and boats in the street meant driving was slow and treacherous. Downed trees and power poles were buttressed by flimsy boards so that cars passed underneath. With stagnant water pooling in the streets and a decimated utility system, there is now a concern that disease and other public health threats could emerge. There is a shortage of basic supplies such as gasoline, food and water Some residents have criticised the UK government's response as ""pathetic and slow"". British troops have now arrived to help. The Royal Engineers and Commandos co-ordinated by Joint Force Headquarters have retrofitted the arrivals lounge into something of a home base, where they are organising security and recovery operations. Mid-afternoon on Saturday, those operations came into full swing with the arrival of a Royal Air Force A400M transport aircraft. As the massive prop plane came to a halt, its rear hatch cracked open. Troops arrived on the island of Tortola on Saturday British troops are using Tortola's airport arrivals lounge as a home base Dozens of soldiers jogged out with gear that is being used to establish a sort of base of operations inside the arrivals lounge.

"This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""If you think there is a different and better way... argue for it"" Tony Blair has defended his call for new controls on EU migration as a cabinet minister accused him of a belated ""epiphany"" on the issue. The ex-PM said the UK could stay in the EU after all with new curbs in place. He claimed this would address people's ""grievances"" without the ""sledgehammer"" of Brexit. Critics have pointed to his Labour government's decision not to apply transitional controls to eastern European migrants in 2004. No restrictions a 'spectacular mistake' Eastern European workers in UK pass 1m Reality Check: Migration to the UK Mr Blair's proposals are to ""tighten"" existing free movement rules, including on benefit entitlement, and seek to negotiate an ""emergency brake"" on EU migration in certain sectors. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, the former prime minister - one of the most prominent anti-Brexit campaigners - said he accepted last year's Leave vote but that there were ways of controlling EU immigration without leaving. ""Brexit is a distraction, not a solution, to the problems this country is facing,"" he said. Mr Blair said he believed Brexit would go ahead ""unless it starts to become obvious that the public is having second thoughts"" - and that ""hasn't become obvious yet"". ""If we put this case to people, maybe they will listen. If they don't - I accept it goes forward,"" he said. Critics said Tony Blair had been responsible for ""open door"" immigration Unlike France and Germany, which did not give migrants from the 10 countries which joined the EU in May 2004 full access to their labour market until 2011, the then-Labour government did not insist on any transitional controls. Mr Blair said: ""The situation back then was different."" He told the Marr show the economy had been strong when he left office in 2007 before the financial crash, adding: ""You've got to listen to what people are saying and react to it."" ""It's a bit late now, this epiphany"", responded Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon on the Marr show. Sir Michael said ""election after election"" had shown the public wanted ""proper controls"" over immigration. ""I think it's a pity he didn't think of that when all these new countries were admitted to the European Union on his watch,"" he added. Pro-EU Conservative Ken Clarke told Sky News it was ""hopeless"" to think the UK could stay in the EU, given the ""mood of the country"". The government has said free movement will end with the UK's withdrawal from the EU, and a forthcoming immigration bill will set out its plans in detail. Last week, leaked draft plans suggested firms would have to recruit locally unless they could prove an ""economic need"" to employ EU citizens and ending the right to settle in the UK for most European migrants. The report by Mr Blair'sInstitute for Global Change,externalsuggests reforming free movement rules, without ""excessive"" restrictions which would jeopardise the UK's membership of the EU single market. It says the ""structure of free movement"" could be kept ""broadly intact"" with rules on access to benefits tightened. Under existing rules, citizens of other EU countriescan be removed after six monthsif they have not found a job, have no realistic possibility of finding one, and require support from the welfare system. Mr Blair's report says EU nationals should already have an offer of work when they arrive and says those who did not earn permission to stay would be banned from opening a bank account, renting a home or claiming benefits. The report also proposes restricting free healthcare for unemployed migrants and letting universities charge EU nationals higher tuition fees than UK students. It says an ""emergency brake"" could be negotiated with the EU, which would allow the UK to impose temporary restrictions in certain sectors when migrant numbers were high. An ""emergency brake"" - which would have affected migrants' benefits - was key to the package of EU reforms ex-PM David Cameron tried to use to persuade voters to back staying in the EU last year. The co-chairman of the campaign group Leave Means Leave, Richard Tice, said Tony Blair's attempt to deny democracy would be seen for what it was, and ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, referring to immigration, said Mr Blair was ""the reason we are in this mess"". Unite union leader Len McCluskey said Mr Blair was ""as out of touch now as he was in 2004"". He told Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics that ""greedy bosses"", not migrant workers, were to blame for undercutting wages, saying that unionisation and regulation were the only way to prevent this from happening. Opening the TUC's annual conference in Brighton, general secretary Frances O'Grady said the government had ""no realistic negotiating strategy"" and was taking the UK towards a ""kamikaze Brexit"".

"Could a genetic mutation explain some dogs' insatiable appetite? When it comes to man's best friend, science may finally have solved the mystery of their gluttony - some Labradors, it seems, are genetically predisposed to being hungry. That's according to scientists who were discussing their ongoing mission to improve our favourite pets' healthat the British Science Association Festival in Brighton,external. Several research teams in the UK are on a mission to improve canine health. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have studied the appetite of Britain's favourite dog breed, and suggest Labradors are genetically at risk of becoming overweight. Roughly a quarter of British households own a pet dog, and Labrador retrievers remain our most popular canine companion. However, this stereotypically ""greedy"" breed often suffers size-related health problems. ""Obesity is a serious issue for our dog population,"" says Dr Eleanor Raffan from the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science. ""It has the potential to have a massive impact on pet welfare."" In research supported by the Dogs Trust, Dr Raffan and her colleagues have analysed DNA from the saliva of Labradors across the UK. They found that particularly greedy individuals possess a gene mutation responsible for increasing their appetite. ""We found around a quarter of pet Labradors have at least one copy of this mutation in the gene,"" Dr Raffan explains. Their increased appetite manifests itself as a ""food obsession"", familiar to dog-owners as begging or scavenging for food. In the past, the onus has been on owners to restrict the diet of their pets to prevent excessive weight gain. But Dr Raffan's research suggests the propensity for large appetites, and hence potential obesity, is hardwired into some individuals. ""We hope to shift the paradigm away from owner-blaming"" says Dr Raffan. ""It's a bit more nuanced than just owners needing to be careful."" Dr Raffan cautions against any attempt to breed this ""greedy mutation"" out of Labrador lines. While it might predispose the dogs to obesity, a strong focus on food may also explain why Labradors are so easy to train and are such loyal human companions. ""If we try to get rid of the mutation, we might find we change the personality of the breed, and that would be a real shame,"" she explains. Yet their results raise an ethical conundrum. Owners and veterinary surgeons are responsible for providing five core so-called freedoms to animals in their care, including freedom from pain and disease, and freedom from hunger. Obesity is a disease, and negatively impacts upon canine quality of life. ""But equally, being hungry is a welfare issue,"" says Dr Raffan. ""And these dogs are genetically hungry."" Dr Raffan hopes future research will improve the satiety of their diets, allowing a feeling of ""fullness"" without the potential for excessive weight gain. Being overweight undoubtedly reduces a dog's quality of life, and can also affect their ability to cope with arthritis and other underlying joint disorders. At the University of Liverpool, scientists are using state-of-the-art imaging technology to study diseases affecting the knee joints of Labradors. Damage to the canine cruciate ligament, similar to the injuries commonly suffered by professional human athletes, is the most common orthopaedic problem seen in veterinary practices. Injury to the knee ligaments is also more common in heavier dog breeds ""We're trying to understand how the shape of the Labrador body and the way they walk might contribute to knee problems,"" says Prof Eithne Comerford, a specialist in musculoskeletal biology. Using high-speed x-ray cameras, the researchers film their canine patients walking through the lab, and watch their knee bones slide and twist in real-time. The team hopes to understand how walking contributes to the risk of ligament injury and rupture in Labradors, with the ultimate goal of reducing lameness and suffering within the breed. ""This data will also help veterinary surgeons and engineers design better treatments for ligament damage in Labradors, like customised knee implants,"" explains biomechanist Dr Karl Bates from the University of Liverpool. Both research groups rely heavily on the good will of Labrador owners, both for collecting samples and entering their pets into experimental trials. In addition to tackling diagnosed health issues, researchers hope to change the public's perception of what ""desirable"" traits should characterise our favourite breeds. ""There is a real danger when we breed dogs to be cuddlier and cuter,"" warns Dr Raffan. ""I think people have seen so many overweight Labradors, they start to assume it's normal"".

"China wants more electric cars on the road to fight pollution China, the world's biggest car market, plans to ban the production and sale of diesel and petrol cars and vans. The country's vice minister of industry said it had started ""relevant research"" but that it had not yet decided when the ban would come into force. ""Those measures will certainly bring profound changes for our car industry's development,"" Xin Guobin told Xinhua, China's official news agency China made 28 million cars last year, almost a third of the global total. Boththe UK and Francehave already announced plans to ban new diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040,  as part of efforts to reduce pollution and carbon emissions. Chinese-ownedcarmaker Volvo said in Julythat all its new car models would have an electric motor from 2019. Geely, Volvo's Chinese owner, aims to sell one million electric cars by 2025. Volvo has announced plans to go electric across the board Other global car firms including Renault-Nissan, Ford and General Motors are all working to develop electric cars in China. Automakers are jostling for a slice of the growing Chinese market ahead of the introduction of new rules designed to fight pollution. China wants electric battery cars and plug-in hybrids to account for at least one-fifth of its vehicle sales by 2025. The proposals would require 8% of automakers' sales to be battery electric or plug-in hybrids by next year, rising to 12% in 2020. Xin predicted the change would create ""turbulent times"" in the industry. The shift will also have a knock-on effect on oil demand in China. The country is currently the world's second-largest oil consumer after the US.

"Kay said the last four months had been ""horrendous"" for Manchester Comedian Peter Kay has delivered a message of defiance at Manchester Arena's reopening concert, declaring ""we can't let terrorists win"". Kay appeared at the We Are Manchester show on Saturday alongside other local heroes including Noel Gallagher. More than 14,000 fans were there, four months after a bomb killed 22 people. ""The victims will never ever be forgotten, but we've got to move forward with love and not hate, and that's how we win,"" Kay told the crowd. Kay worked as a steward at the venue in the 1990s before going on to perform there more than 40 times. Noel Gallagher appeared to shed a tear ""There's been a lot of joy in this room over the years, including the night of 22 May, right up until the terrorist attack,"" he said - and the crowd booed at the mention of the attack. ""These last four months have been incredibly painful,"" Kay continued. ""Horrendous is putting it mildly. But that's why you're here - because we can't let terrorists win. ""And I know the memories of that night will stay with us for a very long time but we've got to remember the good times and let them outweigh the bad."" Kay then introduced Gallagher, and the former Oasis star performed a string of favourites including Don't Look Back In Anger. The song took on special significance in the wake of the bombing aftera crowd started spontaneously singing it at a memorial. ""It's become some sort of anthem for defiance,"" Gallagher said. ""And every time you sing, we win."" The atmosphere was joyful for most of the show Armed police patrolled outside and inside the arena As well as defiance, the mood at the event had a mixture of pride, catharsis, pure enjoyment - and, for some, trepidation. Among the crowd were Paul Woodhouse and his son, from Edinburgh, who were at the Ariana Grande concert that was attacked on 22 May. He said: ""Some of us that were there first time were there [at the reopening] to face a fear. ""Not so much of going to a concert, but of going back to the same place. It's still a bit raw. In time, yes, I think it will have helped, coming back to the same place."" The atmosphere inside the concert was ""quite positive"", he added. ""We found everybody was quite cheerful with everybody. Quite uplifting. You knew everybody was standing together."" Courteeners got the crowd going Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was in the audience Adrian Thorpe, who was in the arena foyer when the bomb went off, said returning with his daughter and partner was initially ""nerve-wracking"". He said: ""It was emotional returning but it's turned out a happy evening. Last time we were here it was a sad time but it's been a joyous evening. ""She's enjoyed it and that's all that matters now. The kids can put a smile back on their faces again."" The foyer area was also reopened on Saturday, but it now contains a row of airport-style body scanners and brightly-coloured temporary wall coverings with slogans such as ""We are entertainment"", ""We are love"" and ""We are stronger"". Rick Astley lifted the mood Pixie Lott was the first singer to perform Also in the crowd was Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City FC, whose wife and daughters were at the Ariana Grande gig. He told BBC News: ""It's good to come back to normality and see that life is going on and remember the families that suffered."" Manchester Arena attack - full coverage Surviving the Manchester bomb There was tight security at the venue, with backpacks banned and armed police patrolling both the exterior and the inside concourse. The night started with a tribute to the bomb victims from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who read the names of the 22 people who were killed by Salman Abedi. The something-for-everyone bill included 1980s pop star Rick Astley - who was wearing a shirt bearing the Manchester bee emblem - plus Pixie Lott, ex-Girls Aloud member Nadine Coyle, grime MC Bugzy Malone and Stockport band Blossoms. Poet Tony Walsh delivered his poem This is the Place Manchester grime MC Bugzy Malone made an appearance Manchester band Courteeners summed up how the sense of pride in the city has been renewed since the attack when singer Liam Fray declared during their first song: ""Manchester, centre of the universe."" The concert was hosted by comedian Russell Kane. When a photographer came on stage to take a picture of the crowd, Kane told them: ""Let's show the world what defiance, happiness, positivity and strength look like."" Proceeds from the concert will go to establishing a permanent memorial to the victims.

"Drifting down the Zambezi in Zimbabwe, I overheard two American men swapping hunting stories. ""First shot got him in the shoulder,"" a white man in his late sixties explained to his friend. ""Second hit him right in the side of the head!"" Pointing at his temple, he passed his phone with a picture. The animal in question was a dead crocodile. Crocodiles are easy to find on this part of the Zambezi: lying in the sun on the banks of the river, boats can float just a few feet away. And given that they are motionless for most of the time, not hard to shoot, I imagine. The second American showed his pal a picture of a Cape Buffalo he had killed, and planned to have shoulder mounted. He complained he couldn't afford the $19,000 (Â£14,500) Zimbabwe demands for the licence to kill an elephant. His buffalo cost him $8,000 (Â£6,100). ""Are they saying an elephant is worth more than two buffalo?"" he lamented. ""I saw hundreds of elephants today. Far too many. You have to see it here to realise. In California they are saying these animals are endangered!"" The first man's wife then talked of the thrill she gets at the kill, discussing how different calibres of bullet explode the vital organs of African wildlife. I left to look at the hippos watching from the river. A trophy hunting taxidermist welcomes customers in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe But, curiously, I have felt obliged to consider the ethics of big game hunting at home in London in the last few months. I'm an Arsenal fan, and it recently emerged that my team's owner,American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke, had launched a TV channel in the UK featuring lion and elephant hunting. The corporate values of family brand Arsenal do not sit easily with pay-to-view videos of hunters shooting animals for fun, and after a couple of days of hostile publicity, Kroenke ordered his channel to stop showing the killing of some big game. But both sides in the hunting debate claim they are the true guardians of animal welfare. Supporters of African trophy hunting, including some in very high places - two of President Trump's sons are avid big game hunters - argue that a ban on hunting would harm wildlife and local people. It would stop much needed revenue reaching some of Africa's poorest communities, discourage conservation and cut funds for wildlife management that would make it easier for poachers to operate, they say. Why big game hunting is big business in South Africa What Cecil the lion means to Zimbabwe When is it hunting and when is it poaching? Opponents counter that little of the profit from trophy hunting money ends up in the communities where it takes place. They say poachers use legal hunting as cover for their illegal activities, and argue that there are more efficient and humane ways to support the welfare of southern Africa's animals and people. I was travelling in Zimbabwe and neighbouring Botswana last month - two countries with opposing policies towards big game hunters. Hunting is still big business in Zimbabwe, as the rich Americans on the Zambezi demonstrate, butsince 2014 it has been completely banned in Botswana. The difference in approach between Botswana and its neighbours - South Africa, Namibia and Zambia also allow trophy hunting - was brought dramatically home to me in the country's glorious Chobe National Park. In the late afternoon, I watched a herd of around 600 Cape Buffalo snake its way down to the Chobe River that marks the boundary with Namibia. It was mesmerising to see these majestic animals following each other, nose to tail, across the water. Cape Buffalo cross the Chobe River from Botswana into Namibia where hunters are waiting Then my guide pointed out two vehicles on the horizon, across the river. ""Hunters,"" he explained, simply. Through the binoculars we could see six men with rifles. Apparently oblivious to the risk, the buffalo continued to cross the border towards them. Later, shots would be heard. In a move interpreted as a direct challenge to the wildlife policies of other southern African nations, Botswana's President Ian Khama is marching his country towards a new model of African tourism: ""low impact/high value"". Botswana believes that by protecting its animals and minimising humankind's footprint on the natural world, it can turn the country into an exclusive tourist destination that brings in far more than it loses from the ban on hunting. Botswana is home to more than a third of Africa's dwindling elephant population, and - since the hunting ban - these intelligent animals have increasingly sought refuge there. The concentration of elephants is a huge draw for tourists but, as predicted by opponents of the ban, it is also a huge temptation for less scrupulous hunters and poachers. Botswana's answer is to make the country a hostile environment for those who want to harm the wildlife. Military bases have been moved to the borders of the national parks. Armed patrols on foot and in the air are ready, if necessary, to kill people coming to kill animals. Some poachers have been shot dead. The hunting ban doesn't just apply to rich trophy hunters. It also limits or outlaws the shooting of game by local people for food or to protect crops and livestock. The Botswana government believes if there is any legal shooting of animals, the big poaching syndicates and illegal hunting operations will use that as cover for their activities. Farmer Chibeya Longwani shows me his bucket of tabasco chillies In Mabele village, close to the Namibian border, I watched a man mixing an extraordinary cocktail: crushed tabasco chillies, elephant dung and engine oil. With a flourish he set the contents on fire and stood back to admire his handiwork. ""That is supposed to stop an elephant trampling my crops,"" Chibeya Longwani told me, pointing at the ash in the tin. He spread it along the sides of his field, beside plastic chairs, broken electric fans and beer crates, as instructed by the Ministry of Agriculture. ""They said that bees stop elephants too,"" Mr Longwani said. ""But they don't have the boxes at the moment."" His frustration was obvious. As well as advice on deterring elephants, farmers can claim compensation from the government if wild game does damage property. But if they kill the animals, they are likely to get nothing. Plastic refuse is used to try and deter elephants from farmland To police the new approach, the Department of Wildlife and National Parks has recruited an army of Special Wildlife Scouts, operating in rural villages. Their job, for example, includes ensuring families don't take more than the five guinea fowl they are allowed each day, and that farmers are honest in their compensation claims. It is a nationwide exercise in social engineering - trying to change the ancient relationship between the rural population and the wild animals around them. The government believes the long-term rewards justify the rules. Many farmers remain unconvinced. For those tourists coming to Botswana with cameras rather than guns though, the policies have created an utterly captivating wild landscape teeming with amazing African animals and birds. And ""elite travellers"" are prepared to pay big money for the privilege of seeing it. During the high season, a single room in one of the most exclusive lodges on the Okovango Delta can cost more than $5,000 (Â£3,830) a night, equivalent to the price of a Namibian licence to shoot a single leopard. Many tourist lodge operators work in partnership with local villages. I encountered one lodge where 10% of the business turnover will soon go to the community nearby. Villagers often have a direct say in development plans. There was a huge backlash after the much-loved Zimbabwean lion Cecil was killed in 2015 International tourism is expected to bring in $210m (Â£160m) to Botswana this year, rising to $370m (Â£280) by 2021 - more than trophy hunters spend across the whole of southern Africa. Many in Zimbabwe, by contrast, see hunting as an inextricable part of Africa's cultural heritage, believing that, if done sustainably and responsibly, it can be a valuable addition to the region's economy and wildlife management. The walking guides who take tourists into the bush there aren't allowed to operate until they have passed a state exam that includes shooting an elephant and a buffalo. I asked one guide how he had felt about doing it. ""It depends if you like hunting,"" was his enigmatic reply. The Zimbabwean government argues that 75% of proceeds from trophy hunting goes towards wildlife preservation and anti-poaching initiatives. The recent Great Elephant Census project,externalsuggests Zimbabwe's elephant population has fallen 11% in a decade, with poaching and illegal hunting threatening to wipe out whole herds in parts of the country. Thekilling of Cecil the lion by an American trophy hunter just outside Zimbabwe's protected Hwange National Park area in 2015made headline news around the world. The furore prompteda number of airlines to ban the transport of ""trophies"" from Africa, another sign of how toxic hunting has become for international brands. Three years after introducing its hunting ban, Botswana is so far holding firm, despite huge pressure from other southern African nations. It is a critical time for the policy.

"An arena in the west Florida town of Estero is transformed into a shelter for residents Hurricane Irma has strengthened to a category four storm as it nears Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (209km/h). Hurricane force wind gusts are battering islands in Florida's south, the governor says, with the mainland due to be hit in the coming hours. Water levels are already rising on the coast of the US state where a huge storm surge is expected. At least 25 people died when Irma earlier hit several Caribbean islands. In Florida, 6.3 million people - about 30% of the state's population - had been told to evacuate. But on Saturday, the state governor said it was now too late to leave for anyone remaining.

"Far-right group National Action was banned in 2016 Two men arrested over a suspected neo-Nazi terror plot involving serving British army soldiers have been released without charge by police. No further action will be taken against two men, both aged 24, from Northampton and Ipswich, West Midlands Police said. They were among five men, four soldiers and a civilian, who were arrested on 5 Septemberover a plot linked to banned far-right group National Action. Detectives have been granted more time to question the other three. They are a 22-year-old from Birmingham, a 32-year-old arrested in Powys, and a 24-year-old from Northampton. The latter was arrested in Cyprus and the Ministry of Defence had previously confirmed he was held at the island's British Dhekelia base before being transferred to RAF Akrotiri for a flight back to the UK. The men are being held on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2000; namely on suspicion of being members of a proscribed organisation. A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: ""Detectives have been granted extra time to question the men."" Three of the servicemen are believed to be from the Royal Anglian Regiment. Being a member of - or inviting support for - a proscribed organisation is a criminal offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. There are 71 such groupslisted by the Home Office on its register,external. They include a range of international and national groups, of which National Action wasthe first far-right group to be bannedin December 2016.

"The NHS pays for long-term support and care for severely ill patients using national criteria Medical opinions have been ignored in the assessment of NHS payments to patients receiving care, it is claimed. Three health workers said an assessor organisation discounted medical views so some patients were denied NHS care. Norman Lamb MP said England-wide data obtained by the BBC showed a ""regional disparity"" and was ""an injustice"". However the assessor organisation, Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU, says it follows national guidelines to decide on payments. Under national criteria, the NHS pays for long-term support and care if a patient's condition is severe enough. However,BBC Inside Out Easthas found a wide difference among clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in England in the percentage of patients rejected following assessment for continuing health care (CHC). Between July 2016 and July 2017,  Birmingham South and Central CCG rejected 75% of its new CHC assessments, Manchester CCG turned down only 17% of assessments, while Tameside and Glossop CCG only rejected 5% of those assessed. All assessors - of which there about half a dozen covering England - should use the same criteria. Three health workers told the BBC that one of the main assessor organisations, Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU (Commissioning Support Unit), sometimes ignored medical opinions in assessments so patients could not obtain NHS care. One worker told the BBC: ""There has been bullying at the meetings - attempts to ridicule people who are there who have a professional opinion. ""They ignored what professionals have said and changed what professionals have said. The concern is that this puts patients at risk."" North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb called allegations of ignoring medical opinions ""very disturbing"" North Norfolk MP Mr Lamb, whose Liberal Democrat constituency includes North Norfolk CCG where 73% of cases assessed were turned down, said the disparity and the allegations of medical opinions being ignored were ""very disturbing"". ""The regional disparity amounts to an injustice between individuals with the same conditions which can't begin to be justified,"" said the former health minister. But Alfonzo Tramontano, chief nurse at Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU, said: ""There are strict national guidelines for what constitutes continuing healthcare. ""Importantly, there is no reason why we would ever want to do anything other than assess an individual's needs correctly. ""We carry out each assessment using the national guidelines and make recommendations to an expert CCG panel, and we have never put pressure on our nurse assessors to do anything other than assess each individual's health care needs correctly."" An NHS England spokesman said taxpayers ""rightly expect"" care to be taken before public money is handed out. ""It's a fact that the majority of people put through a continuing healthcare assessment turn out not to need it,"" he said. ""While funding decisions on CHC cases are taken by local health bodies, there is now a far more consistent approach than ever before since the launch of the national eligibility framework."" John Gallagher, 78, had NHS funding for the care for his wife Diane withdrawn three times Among those receiving NHS care was nursing home resident Diane Gallagher, 77, who had Alzheimer's disease. Her husband, John Gallagher, 78, who lives in Northampton, said funding was withdrawn three times, but every time he argued with the authorities and got it back. Diane Gallagher had worked as a nurse Talking about the most recent time NHS payment was rejected, Mr Gallagher said he was ""totally gobsmacked"", adding by that point his wife couldn't walk, stand, talk or feed herself. In August Mrs Gallagher died, but her husband still faces having to pay the bill for her final weeks of care. He insists the NHS should pay. BBC Inside Out East is broadcast at 19:30 BST on Monday.

"A British tourist who live tweeted his terror as Hurricane Irma struck has been rescued by the US air force. Alex Woolfall, from London, who was on holiday on the Caribbean island of St Martin, has been taken to Puerto Rico. Four days ago, he was evacuated from his hotel room to a concrete stairwell to hide from the storm and described the ""apocalyptic"" noise as it hit. Mr Woolfall told the BBC the island now looks ""like a war zone after heavy bombardment"". The PR consultant posted updates for more than 20 hours while trapped in the stairwell of the Westin Hotel, describing the soaring temperature and ""terrifying"" sounds. Mr Woolfall said the experience was ""like a movie I never want to see"". His updates eventually stopped after power to the island was cut, and his Twitter account remained silent for several days until his rescue. Allow Twitter content?

"The NHS has released figures revealing that 457 people died in England last year while waiting for an organ transplant. Doctors' union the British Medical Association (BMA) and politicians alike have called for an opt-out system to be adopted in England, where people's consent to donate their organs after their death is presumed unless they have explicitly said otherwise. This system is currently in force in Wales and in a number of other countries throughout Europe. In a recent Parliamentary debate on organ donation, Labour MP Dan Jarvis said: ""England must now move to an opt-out system. The evidence is clear - hundreds of people a year are paying a price of us not doing so."" But there is a lack of evidence to support this claim. In Wales, where an opt-out system was introduced in December 2015, there has actually been a small dip in the number of deceased donors, from 64 in 2015-16 to 61 in 2016-17. This resulted in a drop in organ transplants from 214 to 187 respectively. This is not to say the opt-out scheme is having a negative effect - some fluctuation is to be expected - but so far, despite the claims, we don't have any evidence that it is having a positive effect. Girl's organs donated to record eight people The BMA says it believes that over time such a scheme would lead to an increase in organ donation. The Welsh government is in the process of evaluating the scheme and plans to publish a report by the end of this year. Jemima Layzell died of a brain aneurysm in 2012 and her organ donations have helped eight people including five children One concern raised by Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP, in a paper for the British Medical Journal is that the Wales model of organ donation creates a group of non-donors who did not exist before. In the English system there are two groups of people: those who have opted in and registered their wish to be a donor, and those who have done nothing whose families will be asked to decide. In Wales there are now effectively three groups of people:  those who have opted in and so registered their wish to be a donor; those who have done nothing for whom it is assumed they are happy to donate their organs, but it is still ultimately for their family to decide; and a third group who have opted out and so expressly registered their wish not to be a donor. As it currently stands, 6% of the Welsh population has opted out of organ donation. This is a group of people who in an opt-in system were still potential donors, depending on their families' wishes - they may not have ended up donating organs, but we just don't know. There is correlation between countries having opt-out schemes and having a higher number of organ donors. But the countries which have the most donors per head combined the introduction of their opt-out schemes with other changes, like better infrastructure, more funding for transplant programmes and more staff working to identify and build relationships with potential donors before their death. Spain is often touted as an opt-out scheme success story. So-called ""presumed consent"" legislation was passed in 1979 but donor rates only began to go up 10 years later when a new national transplant organisation was founded which co-ordinates the whole donation and transplantation process. The legislation is also not strictly enforced since families are always consulted and have the final say. However, opt-out schemes don't always translate to increased organ donor rates. In Sweden, for example, such a scheme has been in force since 1996 and it remains one of the lowest-ranked countries for organ donation in Europe. Luxembourg and Bulgaria also have opt-out systems and low rates of organ donation. In France and Brazil, variations on a ""presumed consent"" system actually led to a decline in the rate of organ donation. Another difficulty in assessing whether opt-in or opt-out schemes are driving different countries' donation rates is that these schemes take different forms across the globe. In both Spain and Wales, families of potential organ donors are always given the chance to refuse. But this is not universal - Austria and Singapore both have ""hard opt-out"" systems where those who have not opted out are presumed to have consented to organ donation regardless of their families' wishes. And there are other differences, for example in Israel a priority incentive scheme means those who have agreed to donate their own or a deceased family member's organs are given priority on transplant lists should they themselves need an organ in the future. In ""hard opt-out"" systems there were increases in the organ donor rate of up to 25%.

"This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""If you think there is a different and better way... argue for it"" Tony Blair has defended his call for new controls on EU migration as a cabinet minister accused him of a belated ""epiphany"" on the issue. The ex-PM said the UK could stay in the EU after all with new curbs in place. He claimed this would address people's ""grievances"" without the ""sledgehammer"" of Brexit. Critics have pointed to his Labour government's decision not to apply transitional controls to eastern European migrants in 2004. No restrictions a 'spectacular mistake' Eastern European workers in UK pass 1m Reality Check: Migration to the UK Mr Blair's proposals are to ""tighten"" existing free movement rules, including on benefit entitlement, and seek to negotiate an ""emergency brake"" on EU migration in certain sectors. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, the former prime minister - one of the most prominent anti-Brexit campaigners - said he accepted last year's Leave vote but that there were ways of controlling EU immigration without leaving. ""Brexit is a distraction, not a solution, to the problems this country is facing,"" he said. Mr Blair said he believed Brexit would go ahead ""unless it starts to become obvious that the public is having second thoughts"" - and that ""hasn't become obvious yet"". ""If we put this case to people, maybe they will listen. If they don't - I accept it goes forward,"" he said. Critics said Tony Blair had been responsible for ""open door"" immigration Unlike France and Germany, which did not give migrants from the 10 countries which joined the EU in May 2004 full access to their labour market until 2011, the then-Labour government did not insist on any transitional controls. Mr Blair said: ""The situation back then was different."" He told the Marr show the economy had been strong when he left office in 2007 before the financial crash, adding: ""You've got to listen to what people are saying and react to it."" ""It's a bit late now, this epiphany"", responded Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon on the Marr show. Sir Michael said ""election after election"" had shown the public wanted ""proper controls"" over immigration. ""I think it's a pity he didn't think of that when all these new countries were admitted to the European Union on his watch,"" he added. Pro-EU Conservative Ken Clarke told Sky News it was ""hopeless"" to think the UK could stay in the EU, given the ""mood of the country"". The government has said free movement will end with the UK's withdrawal from the EU, and a forthcoming immigration bill will set out its plans in detail. Last week, leaked draft plans suggested firms would have to recruit locally unless they could prove an ""economic need"" to employ EU citizens and ending the right to settle in the UK for most European migrants. The report by Mr Blair'sInstitute for Global Change,externalsuggests reforming free movement rules, without ""excessive"" restrictions which would jeopardise the UK's membership of the EU single market. It says the ""structure of free movement"" could be kept ""broadly intact"" with rules on access to benefits tightened. Under existing rules, citizens of other EU countriescan be removed after six monthsif they have not found a job, have no realistic possibility of finding one, and require support from the welfare system. Mr Blair's report says EU nationals should already have an offer of work when they arrive and says those who did not earn permission to stay would be banned from opening a bank account, renting a home or claiming benefits. The report also proposes restricting free healthcare for unemployed migrants and letting universities charge EU nationals higher tuition fees than UK students. It says an ""emergency brake"" could be negotiated with the EU, which would allow the UK to impose temporary restrictions in certain sectors when migrant numbers were high. An ""emergency brake"" - which would have affected migrants' benefits - was key to the package of EU reforms ex-PM David Cameron tried to use to persuade voters to back staying in the EU last year. The co-chairman of the campaign group Leave Means Leave, Richard Tice, said Tony Blair's attempt to deny democracy would be seen for what it was, and ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, referring to immigration, said Mr Blair was ""the reason we are in this mess"". Unite union leader Len McCluskey said Mr Blair was ""as out of touch now as he was in 2004"". He told Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics that ""greedy bosses"", not migrant workers, were to blame for undercutting wages, saying that unionisation and regulation were the only way to prevent this from happening. Opening the TUC's annual conference in Brighton, general secretary Frances O'Grady said the government had ""no realistic negotiating strategy"" and was taking the UK towards a ""kamikaze Brexit"".

"Leighton created dozens of fake Facebook accounts to trap his victim The extradition of a paedophile jailed for 16 years for sex offences involving teenagers in four countries is being sought by the US. Paul Leighton, 32, of County Durham,admitted rape, despite being in the UK when the offences took place in the US. Leighton tricked victims on Facebook into sending him naked pictures and blackmailed them to abuse relatives. US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) anticipated his extradition over victims in Pennsylvania, it said. The Home Office spokesperson said it would ""neither confirm nor deny that an extradition request has been made"". It is believed as many as 100 children in North America were abused by Leighton. The defendant, of Malvern Crescent, Seaham, created dozens of fake Facebook profiles to befriend teenagers in the UK, Canada, the US and Australia, Newcastle Crown Court was told. He threatened a 14-year-old boy from Florida into repeatedly raping his one-year-old niece. Prosecutor Paul Reid said it had been a ""campaign of rape"". Leighton pleaded guilty ""to the rape of this baby 4,000 miles away as he was using [the uncle] as an accessory"", he said. He admitted other offences, including blackmail, causing a child to engage in sexual activity, making indecent photographs of a child and sexual assault. The investigation that led to his arrest was led by HSI in a joint operation with Northumbria Police.

"This video can not be played Myanmar's Rohingya have been described by the UN as ""the most friendless people in the world, as Justin Rowlatt reports Rohingya Muslim insurgents in Myanmar have declared a one-month unilateral ceasefire to ease the humanitarian crisis in northern Rakhine state. The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa) said the truce would start on Sunday, urging Mynamar's army to lay down weapons as well. Arsa attacks on police on 25 August led to a ferocious military response. About 290,000 Rohingya are said to have fled Rakhine and sought shelter over the border in Bangladesh since then. The UN says thataid groups urgently need $77m (Â£58m)to help Rohingya who have fled Myanmar. There is a desperate need for food, water and health services for new arrivals in Cox's Bazaar,the UN added,external. Rohingya residents - a stateless, mostly Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar - say the military and Rakhine Buddhists are waging a brutal campaign against them, burning their villages. Myanmar rejects this, saying its military is fighting against Rohingya ""terrorists"". Who are Arsa? Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Tales of horror from Rohingya who fled BBC reporter: 'A Muslim village was burning' Myanmar conflict: The view from Yangon Arsa announced its ceasefire in a statement on Saturday. It also asked humanitarian organisations to resume their work. Myanmar so far has made no public comments on the insurgents' initiative. Rohingya accuse the military of burning their villages - but Myanmar says its soldiers are fighting against ""terrorists"" Aid agencies in Cox's Bazaar say they are overwhelmed by the numbers fleeing, while reporters at the scene have described seeing thousands of Rohingya waiting at roadsides, begging and chasing food trucks. An AP reporter,externalsaw one man collapsing from hunger while queuing at a food distribution point. The UN Resident Co-ordinator in Bangladesh, Robert Watkins, said: ""There is now an urgent need for 60,000 new shelters, as well as food, clean water and health services, including specialist mental health services and support for survivors of sexual violence."" Those who have fled Rakhine describe village burnings, beatings and killings at the hands of the security forces and Buddhist youths. The Myanmar government says it is the Rohingya militants and the Muslim villagers themselves who are burning their own homes and attacking non-Muslims - many of whom have also fled the violence. But a BBC reporter in Rakhine state on Thursdaysaw a Muslim village being burned, apparently by a group of Rakhine Buddhists, contradicting the official version of events. Also on Saturday, rights group Amnesty Internationalaccused,externalMyanmar's military of planting landmines at the border with Bangladesh. Bangladeshi border guards and villagers have told the BBC that they witnessed more than 100 Myanmar soldiers walking by and apparently planting landmines at the border. Bangladeshi officialshave said they believe Myanmar government forces are planting the landmines to stop the Rohingya returning to their villages. A Myanmar military source said no landmines had been planted recently, while a government spokesman told Reuters more information was needed. The Rohingya plight is sparking concern and protests in many nations, and Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been criticised for failing to protect them. Various world leaders have urged Ms Suu Kyi,a Nobel Peace laureate who spent years under house arrestfor her pro-democracy activism, to speak out on behalf of the Rohingya.

"Kay said the last four months had been ""horrendous"" for Manchester Comedian Peter Kay has delivered a message of defiance at Manchester Arena's reopening concert, declaring ""we can't let terrorists win"". Kay appeared at the We Are Manchester show on Saturday alongside other local heroes including Noel Gallagher. More than 14,000 fans were there, four months after a bomb killed 22 people. ""The victims will never ever be forgotten, but we've got to move forward with love and not hate, and that's how we win,"" Kay told the crowd. Kay worked as a steward at the venue in the 1990s before going on to perform there more than 40 times. Noel Gallagher appeared to shed a tear ""There's been a lot of joy in this room over the years, including the night of 22 May, right up until the terrorist attack,"" he said - and the crowd booed at the mention of the attack. ""These last four months have been incredibly painful,"" Kay continued. ""Horrendous is putting it mildly. But that's why you're here - because we can't let terrorists win. ""And I know the memories of that night will stay with us for a very long time but we've got to remember the good times and let them outweigh the bad."" Kay then introduced Gallagher, and the former Oasis star performed a string of favourites including Don't Look Back In Anger. The song took on special significance in the wake of the bombing aftera crowd started spontaneously singing it at a memorial. ""It's become some sort of anthem for defiance,"" Gallagher said. ""And every time you sing, we win."" The atmosphere was joyful for most of the show Armed police patrolled outside and inside the arena As well as defiance, the mood at the event had a mixture of pride, catharsis, pure enjoyment - and, for some, trepidation. Among the crowd were Paul Woodhouse and his son, from Edinburgh, who were at the Ariana Grande concert that was attacked on 22 May. He said: ""Some of us that were there first time were there [at the reopening] to face a fear. ""Not so much of going to a concert, but of going back to the same place. It's still a bit raw. In time, yes, I think it will have helped, coming back to the same place."" The atmosphere inside the concert was ""quite positive"", he added. ""We found everybody was quite cheerful with everybody. Quite uplifting. You knew everybody was standing together."" Courteeners got the crowd going Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was in the audience Adrian Thorpe, who was in the arena foyer when the bomb went off, said returning with his daughter and partner was initially ""nerve-wracking"". He said: ""It was emotional returning but it's turned out a happy evening. Last time we were here it was a sad time but it's been a joyous evening. ""She's enjoyed it and that's all that matters now. The kids can put a smile back on their faces again."" The foyer area was also reopened on Saturday, but it now contains a row of airport-style body scanners and brightly-coloured temporary wall coverings with slogans such as ""We are entertainment"", ""We are love"" and ""We are stronger"". Rick Astley lifted the mood Pixie Lott was the first singer to perform Also in the crowd was Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City FC, whose wife and daughters were at the Ariana Grande gig. He told BBC News: ""It's good to come back to normality and see that life is going on and remember the families that suffered."" Manchester Arena attack - full coverage Surviving the Manchester bomb There was tight security at the venue, with backpacks banned and armed police patrolling both the exterior and the inside concourse. The night started with a tribute to the bomb victims from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who read the names of the 22 people who were killed by Salman Abedi. The something-for-everyone bill included 1980s pop star Rick Astley - who was wearing a shirt bearing the Manchester bee emblem - plus Pixie Lott, ex-Girls Aloud member Nadine Coyle, grime MC Bugzy Malone and Stockport band Blossoms. Poet Tony Walsh delivered his poem This is the Place Manchester grime MC Bugzy Malone made an appearance Manchester band Courteeners summed up how the sense of pride in the city has been renewed since the attack when singer Liam Fray declared during their first song: ""Manchester, centre of the universe."" The concert was hosted by comedian Russell Kane. When a photographer came on stage to take a picture of the crowd, Kane told them: ""Let's show the world what defiance, happiness, positivity and strength look like."" Proceeds from the concert will go to establishing a permanent memorial to the victims.
