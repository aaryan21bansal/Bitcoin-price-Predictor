"The next Mulan is a live action remake of the animated hit movie Walt Disney has delayed and postponed the release of three major films, dealing a fresh blow to cinema operators struggling amid the pandemic. The new Avatar and Star Wars films have been delayed by a year, while Mulan has been removed from schedules completely. Mulan, already delayed because of cinema closures, had been scheduled for release at the end of August. A rise in virus cases in the US and the impact globally on film production forced the change. ""It's become clear that nothing can be set in stone when it comes to how we release films during this global health crisis,"" a Disney spokesman said. ""Today that means pausing our release plans for Mulan as we assess how we can most effectively bring this film to audiences around the world."" A rise in virus cases in the US and the impact globally on film production forced the change. News that the release of three major Walt Disney films will be delayed or postponed is a fresh blow to cinema operators struggling amid the pandemic. It had been hoped that Mulan might spark a late-summer rebound in cinema-going. The Avatar sequel is now set to debut in theatres in December 2022, and the next Star Wars movie in December 2023. On Thursday, the AMC and Cineworld cinema chains pushed back the reopening date for their US outlets until at least mid-August, from the end of July. New York City and Los Angeles, the two biggest markets in the US, have no concrete plans for reopening cinemas.

"The UK and EU have said they still remain some way off reaching a post-Brexit trade agreement, following the latest negotiations in London. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a deal looked ""at this point unlikely"" given the UK position on fishing rights and post-Brexit competition rules. His UK counterpart David Frost said ""considerable gaps"" remained in these areas, but a deal was still possible. The UK has ruled out extending the December deadline to reach a deal. This was the second official negotiation round to be held in person since the coronavirus crisis, after both sides agreed to ""intensify"" talks in June. The two sides' chief negotiators are due to meet informally in London next week, with another round of official talks scheduled for mid-August in Brussels. Analysis: What's happening in post-Brexit trade talks? What are the sticking points in the trade talks? What happens after Brexit? What trade deals has the UK done so far? Speaking after the talks, Mr Barnier said the UK had not shown a ""willingness to break the deadlock"" over fisheries and post-Brexit rules on competition. ""By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement at this point unlikely,"" he told reporters. He said there was a risk of no deal being reached unless the UK changed course on the topics, which were ""at the heart"" of the EU's trade interests. He added that an agreement would be needed by October ""at the latest"" so it could be ratified before the current post-Brexit transition period ends in December. In a statement, Mr Frost said fisheries and the rules on competition - known as ""level playing field"" provisions - remained the ""most difficult areas"". He said he still believed a deal could still be reached in September, but the government must ""face the possibility"" one will not be struck. But he added the EU had shown a ""pragmatic approach"" over British demands to limit the role of the European Court of Justice after the transition period ends. If the last four years, or even 40 years, have taught us anything about negotiations and the European Union, it is that they go on a bit and rarely are they concluded without the deadline being not just imminent, but, well...pretty much now. And this is not that point, yet. It was always very unlikely this would be the moment where a document would be pulled triumphantly from the inside of a suit pocket, a deal done. When Michel Barnier says a trade agreement between the UK and the EU is ""at this point unlikely"", your eye is drawn towards that word ""unlikely"". But ""at this point"" matters too. Both sides are still talking and compromise likes to turn up fashionably late. None of this guarantees there will be a deal - there may not be. But both sides want one, if they can find one they can live with. And remember, whatever happens between now and New Year's Eve, things will be different next year. Legally, Brexit happened at the end of January this year. In practical terms, it happens at the start of January next year. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Frost said the UK, which has so far insisted on a series of separate deals in different areas, was also willing to consider a ""simpler"" structure for an agreement. However he conceded previous UK demands for an ""early understanding"" on the principles of a deal by this month would not be reached. He said EU offers to break the deadlock had so far failed to honour the ""fundamental principles which we have repeatedly made clear"". Each side says the other needs to make a move. And if there is to be a deal, it will probably come at the eleventh hour. That means compromises will have to emerge in September before a deal is agreed in October - leaving both sides just enough time to ratify an agreement before the end of the year. There have been suggestions of potential progress this week - on the role of the European Court of Justice and on the overall structure of a future agreement. But differences between the two sides are substantial, and go to the heart of what the Brexit process is all about: how closely aligned will the UK be with the EU in the future? For the UK sovereignty is key; for the EU the priority is to protect the integrity of its single market. And for now, the two sides often seem to be talking past each other in public. Read more of Chris Morris's analysis on what's happening in post-Brexit trade talks Mr Barnier said that to agree a deal, the EU would require ""robust"" guarantees from the UK over its future rules for providing state support to companies. He criticised the UK for providing ""no visibility"" on its future regime in this area, and called for it to share more details of its plans. The UK is due to stop following EU ""state aid"" rules at the end of the transition period, and has not unveiled details of its subsequent regime. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said he wants tomake it easierfor the UK government to provide assistance to struggling firms. What happens after Brexit?

"The US and China have clashed repeatedly in recent months, over trade, coronavirus and Hong Kong The US has charged four Chinese nationals with visa fraud for allegedly lying about their membership of China's armed forces. Three are under arrest while the FBI is seeking to arrest the fourth, who is said to be in China's San Francisco consulate. FBI agents have also interviewed people in 25 US cities who have an ""undeclared affiliation"" with China's military. Prosecutors say it is part of a Chinese plan to send army scientists to the US. Members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) applied for research visas while hiding their ""true affiliation"" with the military,US justice department attorney John C Demers said in a press release,external. ""This is another part of the Chinese Communist Party's plan to take advantage of our open society and exploit academic institutions."" What's behind Trump's new strategy on China? The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order The arrests come after the US announceda Chinese scientist had taken shelter in the San Francisco consulate, and the day after US officials ordered the closure of China's mission in Houston, saying it was involved in stealing intellectual property. This video can not be played Men were filmed acting suspiciously at China's consulate in Houston on Tuesday On Thursday - before the arrests were announced - Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin described the US allegations as ""malicious slander"" and said China ""must make a necessary response and safeguard its legitimate rights"". US President Donald Trump has repeatedly clashed with China in recent months, over trade, the coronavirus pandemic and the new Hong Kong security law. Hours after the charges were announced US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced a ""new tyranny"" from China. Speaking at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in California, Mr Pompeo called on ""on every leader of every nation"" to stand up to China, adding that securing freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party was ""the mission of our time"". The four individuals charged with visa fraud are Wang Xin, Song Chen, Zhao Kaikai and Tang Juan. Ms Tang is thought to be in the San Francisco consulate. All the Chinese nationals are said to have lied about their service in the PLA, either stating they had never served in the military or no longer served. Wang Xin was arrested on 7 June after questioning by Customs and Border Protection agents at Los Angeles International Airport. He disclosed that he remains a PLA member, and works at a military university lab, the justice department release said, having stated on his visa that he had left the military in 2016. All four of the charged Chinese nationals are allegedly currently serving in China's armed forces Song Chen and Zhao Kaikai meanwhile were both arrested on 18 July. Prosecutors allege that Ms Song claimed to be a neurologist who had left the armed forces but in reality was still affiliated with PLA Air Force (PLAAF) hospitals in China, while Zhao Kaikai claimed never to have served in the military but in fact was a member of a top PLA research institution. Ms Tang is thought to be a member of the PLAAF. An agent found photos of her in military uniform and evidence that she worked at an air force medical university. She also allegedly wrote on her visa application that she had never been in the military. FBI agents have also interviewed people in 25 US cities who have an ""undeclared affiliation"" with China's military, the justice department said. The arrests come two days after China's consulate in Houston came under scrutiny. Footage showed people throwing what appeared to be paper into flaming bins. Emergency services were called to the building but Houston police say they were not granted access. On Wednesday, the administration gave China 72 hours to close the consulate ""to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information"". The consulate is one of five in the US, not counting the embassy in Washington. China described the closure as a ""political provocation"". There are a number of flashpoints between Beijing and Washington. Some of the most serious are: Coronavirus: President Trump has repeatedly referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"". and alleged it originated from a Chinese laboratory, despite his own intelligence officers saying it ""was not manmade"". In response, Chinese officials have suggested, without evidence, that Covid-19 might have originated in the US Trade: Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. The US and China have engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war since 2018 as a result of the dispute Hong Kong: China's imposition of a sweeping new national security law in Hong Kong in June led the US to revoke the region's preferential economic treatment. Beijing has accused the US of ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs, promising it will retaliate South China Sea: The two countries have also clashed over Beijing's pursuit of offshore resources in disputed waters, withMr Pompeo calling it a ""campaign of bullying"".

"Johnny Depp is ""generous"" and ""loving"" when sober but the ""other side of him was a monster"", actress Amber Heard has told the High Court in London. Ms Heard said she had been ""so in love"" with her former husband and had ""always held out hope"" he would get clean. But in a text to her mother, she said he was ""violent and crazy"" and she was ""heartbroken that this is who I love"". Mr Depp, 57, is suing the publisher of the Sun over an online article that labelled him a ""wife beater"". The newspaper insists it was accurate. Meanwhile, Ms Heard's sister said in a written statement to the court that she ""felt sick"" when she learned the actress was going to marry Mr Depp. Depp 'threw bottles like grenades at Heard' Elon Musk offered Amber Heard '24/7 security' I was afraid Depp was going to kill me, says Heard Ms Heard was questioned by Sasha Wass, representing the Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers (NGN). Ms Wass read out text messages the Aquaman actress sent to her mother, Paige, on 22 and 23 March 2013, when the couple were in a relationship but not yet married. In her first witness statement, Ms Heard claimed that in March 2013, Mr Depp hit her with the back of his hand, which caused her blood to hit the wall, after an argument about a painting by her ex-partner Tasya van Ree. He denies this. The actress initially said the incident took place on 8 March 2013, but told the court she now considers the correct date of the ""painting incident"" to be 22 March 2013. Ms Wass told the court that in one text to her mother, Ms Heard wrote: ""It's terrible, mum. I don't know what to do."" Another read: ""He's nuts, mum. Violent and crazy. I'm heartbroken that this is who I love."" In a third, she wrote: ""I feel like I'm on a very fast train that's about to explode, but I don't want to jump off and leave my love behind. ""So I stay on the train, even though I know it's about to explode."" Ms Heard, who was married to the film star from 2015 to 2017, then told the court: ""I was so in love with Johnny at that time. We had had a wonderful year together where he was sober and clean and that is how I got to know him. ""And Johnny, when he was like that, [is] generous, loving, he is a remarkable man when he is like that. ""I loved him and I didn't want to lose that... the other side of him was a monster, but I always held out hope that he would get clean and sober."" As she read out the messages, Ms Wass told the court Ms Heard's mother had suggested she informed her father, to which the actress replied: ""I can't tell dad."" Ms Heard explained to the court: ""I felt safe to tell my mother, but I didn't know how my dad would react. I had never been in this situation before and I didn't know if he would react violently... to Johnny. ""I didn't want to make it worse."" The court also heard about a series of texts between Ms Heard and Mr Depp's then assistant, Nathan Holmes, which were sent on 22 March 2013. The actor is said to have been due on set at the time to film part of a documentary he was making about Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Mr Holmes texted Ms Heard at around noon to say ""on my way to get him"", to which Ms Heard replied: ""Trying to wake him now."" The court heard Ms Heard texted Mr Holmes just before 18:00 to say: ""Success - he's coming down."" Ms Wass asked: ""What was going on between noon... and about 6 o'clock that evening?"" Ms Heard replied: ""Johnny refused to leave... [he was] snorting lines of cocaine, drinking whisky and he was saying we really need to work this out, he wanted to get to the bottom of it. ""He wanted me to admit that I was having an affair with, not only Tasya van Ree, my ex-partner, but also a gentleman I hardly knew... he had just gotten it in his mind that I had these affairs and he wouldn't leave until I admitted it."" Ms Heard concluded her evidence by addressing Mr Depp's claim that her allegations were an elaborate hoax and that she had - in Ms Wass's words - ""manipulated pictures, painted on bruises, destroyed property with your friends in order to implicate Mr Depp"". Ms Wass asked: ""Has there been any benefit to your career since you have made these allegations against Mr Depp?"" Ms Heard replied: ""No. What woman has ever benefited from being the victim of domestic violence?"" Ms Wass asked if Ms Heard had ""benefited financially"" from making the allegations, to which the actress said: ""I married and divorced Johnny without a pre-nup in a no-fault state. ""I was entitled to 50% of his [assets] and he of mine without having to prove anything happened in the marriage, bad or good. It's a no-fault state and I was entitled to 50%."" Meanwhile, the court heard a written witness statement from Ms Heard's sister who said she ""begged"" Ms Heard, 34, not to go through with the marriage, telling her ""him [Mr Depp] putting a ring on her finger was not going to stop him hitting her"". Whitney Henriquez said when she first met the Pirates Of The Caribbean star he seemed ""very sweet"" and she was ""surprised how much I liked him"". The pair became close, ""like brother and sister"", she claimed, with Mr Depp, 57, calling her ""sis"". But Ms Henriquez also said her sister's relationship with the actor was ""tumultuous from the start"". Her statement said: ""I wasn't aware of violence at the beginning, but I do remember Amber talking about them having big fights and being concerned for my sister. ""Amber told me that they would [verbally] fight - sometimes for days on end - and then go days without speaking to each other."" The libel case centres on an article published on the Sun's website in April 2018 under the headline ""Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?"". The article related to allegations made by Ms Heard, which Mr Depp denies.

"Sir Thomas Picton defended his right to obtain confessions by torture while governor of Trinidad The statue of a ""brutal"" slave owner - convicted over the torture of a girl - is to be removed from a ""Welsh heroes"" gallery in Cardiff's City Hall. Sir Thomas Picton's statue had stood for more than a century, remembering him as the highest ranking officer to die in the Battle of Waterloo. Cardiff council notedPicton's ""abhorrent behaviour"" as Governor of Trinidad,externalin the 19th Century and on Thursday voted to remove the monument. The statue will now be covered up. Calls to remove the statue followed Black Lives Matter protesters toppling a similar statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. The statue of Sir Thomas Picton (left) is in a gallery of Welsh heroes at City Hall While governor of the-then British colony Trinidad, Picton authorised the illegal torture of a 14-year-old girl, which caused public outrage at the time. He was found guilty but was never sentenced. A statue of Picton was placed in City Hall in 1916, as part of the Heroes of Wales collection. Racism action 'must go beyond' removing statues Waterloo's hero and villain Call for Wales to examine slavery statues Councillor Saeed Ebrahim proposed the motion to the full council to remove the statue. ""The behaviour of Picton as governor of Trinidad was abhorrent, even in his own era, and not deserving of a place in the Heroes of Wales collection,"" the motion read. ""Heightened awareness about the history of slavery must include a reassessment of the regard in which we hold Picton, and many others who were actors and beneficiaries of slavery. ""In hindsight it was an error to have included Picton as an option in the 1916 public vote, and an error that he had not been removed sooner. ""A democratic decision, by the representatives of the people of Cardiff, to remove the statue will send a message to Black people in Cardiff and across the world that the city recognises the role people like Picton played in slavery, and that we must seek to address the systemic racism that still exists due to slavery and empire. ""Black lives matter, and none of us are equal until all of us are equal."" Fifty seven councillors voted for the statue's removal from the Marble Hall of Heroes, five voted against that and there were nine abstentions. Now Cardiff council will seek permission from the Welsh Government and Cadw - which protects historic monuments in Wales - to remove it from the civic centre building, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Following the vote, council leader Huw Thomas said: ""Whilst gestures such as this are important, they cannot deflect us from the harder task of trying to address the challenges still experienced by black communities today."" Cardiff council has said it will set up a taskforce to explore how to tackle racial inequality in the Welsh capital.

Nearly 20 firms are named in the suits, accused of trademark infringement and defamation among other violations. One firm, Sera Labs, said it had stopped the fake ads ""immediately"". All of the companies sell goods with CBD, an extract from the marijuana plant that does not have psychoactive properties. It is used in products such as creams, oils and food. However lawyers for Mr Eastwood - who has starred in films such as Dirty Harry, as well as directing features including Mystic River - said he ""does not have and never has had"" any association with CBD. One of the fake articles was headlined ""Big Pharma In Outrage Over Clint Eastwood's CBD"" and quotes the actor saying he is stepping away from his acting career to promote a new line of CBD products, according to one of the two lawsuits, which were filed in a federal court in California. But Mr Eastwood's lawyers say he never gave such an interview. The other lawsuit concerns an ""internet scam"", in which the firms tagged their websites with Mr Eastwood's name, a move that made it look like he had backed the products, while also making it easier for people searching online to find their products. ""Like many of his most famous characters, Mr Eastwood is not afraid to confront wrongdoing and hold accountable those that try to illegally profit off his name,"" the court papers say. The lawsuits say it is standard practice for Mr Eastwood to reject licensing deals and reserve his celebrity to advertise his films and other personal interests. One of the CBD firms in the lawsuit, Sera Labs, said it had been unaware that its products were being falsely linked with the actor. It said it had ""worked for a limited time with a publisher and gave them specific advertisements they could use which follow our very strict guidelines"". It added that it ""shut down the ads immediately after learning that they used Mr Eastwood's name and likeness"".

BBC Scotland News As we conclude our live coverage this Thursday, 23 July, here is a reminder of today's headlines. Boris Johnson spent time in Orkney on Thursday People working from home have been eating more ice cream but neglecting their grooming habits, consumer goods giant Unilever has suggested. The firm said ice cream sales leapt 26% in the three months to June, but demand for shampoo and deodorant fell. It said it had seen strong ""growth in home consumption of foods, ice cream and tea"" during lockdown. But there had been ""fewer personal care occasions from going to work or socialising"".

Top runners like Haile Gebrselassie (left) have taken part in the Glasgow event The Covid-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of this year's Great Scottish Run, which was scheduled for Sunday, 4 October. The event, which attracts international competitors as well as charity runners, has been held every year round the streets of Glasgow since 1991. Last year's male and female half-marathons were won by Uganda's Timothy Toroitich and Kenya's Edith Chelimo. Organisers said,externalthere was ""no option"" to stage the event any time in 2020. Competitors can roll over their entry to next year's Great Scottish Run, provisionally scheduled for 3 October 2021, or receive a refund. Primary school pupils will not be required to maintain physical distancing, but secondaries will be asked to do so ""where possible"" The Scottish government has ring-fenced funding for 850 new teachers and 200 support staff to help schools build towards reopening on 11 August. Education Secretary John Swinney said pupils would need extra support when they return to classes after lockdown. And he said ministers would decide whether it was safe to go ahead with the plans on 29 July. Guidance is being drawn up on ""extra precautions"" to be put in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Readmore here. Swab tests are used to look for the presence of the virus A network of coronavirus-testing walk-in centres is to be set up across England in an attempt to persuade more people to come forward for testing. Several hundred walk-in units will be up and running by the end of October, in time for winter, when there is concern cases could start to rise. They will complement the existing drive-through centres, mobile testing units and home-ordering service. It comes amid concern people are still not coming forward for testing. Readmore here. BBC Radio Scotland Some pupils have returned to school in England The Scottish government is ""making up plans at the last minute"" to reopen schools from 11 August, according to Scottish Labour's education spokesman Iain Gray. John Swinney gave MSPs anupdate on progress earlier,but no final confirmation will arrive until next Thursday, 30 July. âSchools are due to open in just over two weeks yet we still have no final decision, councils still donât actually have the additional resources they need and guidance on risk mitigation is still being written,"" Mr Gray told BBC Radio Scotland. The government has never had a route map for the return of schools and they still donât. They look as though they are making this up at the last minute."" Iain Gray MSP The additional teachers referred to by Mr Swinney today ""amount to less than half a staff member per school, and councils have two weeks left to try to recruit them,â Mr Gray added. The Conservativesâ education spokesman, Jamie Green, also called on Mr Swinney to end the uncertainty, saying the balance of evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of schools reopening.

But Sir James later told employees these were no longer needed. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Ian Cairns receives regular
treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and says he is ""quite excited"" but a ""wee bit apprehensive"" about the changes that will see a pause to shielding guidelines from 1 August. ""Twenty weeks locked up is hard to take,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. ""I had six months chemo last year but this feels
a lot worse. ""I havenât seen my two grandchildren for four months, Iâm missing my friends and I
need to push myself to go out and do things."" Mr Cairns welcomed the Scottish government's plan to develop a Covid forecasting scheme for each local area. ""The more information we have, the better informed we are to make decisions,"" he adds. Vivien Yu takes immune suppressants

all happened."" If you are just joining us here's a reminder of the main points from today's Scottish government coronavirus briefing: People in Scotland considered to be at the greatest risk of Covid-19 will be able to go to pubs and restaurants with outdoor spaces from Friday. Nicola Sturgeon said people shielding could also meet indoors with maximum of eight people from up to two households if physical distancing was maintained. Visits to indoors shops or the hairdresser and using public transport will be allowed as well. The changes come ahead of a ""pause"" in shielding guidelines from 1 August. Giving her daily coronavirus briefing, the first minister acknowledged the ""painful journey"" of those in the shielding category over the past four months of lockdown. Chairman Dave Cormack says the club's position had become ""unsustainable"" Aberdeen Football Club have announced Â£1m of pay cuts to help plug a Â£10m shortfall due to the coronavirus pandemic. Staff earning over Â£30,000 per year have agreed to take reductions averaging 20%. The club say the deal will close a ""widening funding gap"" caused by being unable to start the new campaign in front of fans. ""Our situation was becoming unsustainable,"" said chairman Dave Cormack. Readmore here.

It's four months exactly since Scotland went into lockdown, and in the past 15 days there has been just one death of a person who tested positive for Covid-19. Drivetime will be looking at where we are with the virus - as well as reaction to the latest news for people shieldng. As the prime minister visits Scotland today in an effort to strengthen support for the union, the programme will also hear from one of Scotland's leading historians, Sir Tom Devine. Scotland's largest teachers' union has welcomed the Scottish government's announcement of ring-fencedfunding for 850 new teachers and 200 support staff. But the EIS says more must still be done ahead of schools reopening on 11 August. The union's general secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""Clearly, with less than three weeks until schools are set to
reopen, it is vital that local authorities act quickly to ensure that the
promised additional teachers and support staff are recruited prior to the start
of term. ""It also remains essential that the process of reopening schools is
managed safely, with updated risk assessments to be carried out and all
necessary mitigations â such as enhanced cleaning regimens, adequate ventilation
and facilities for regular hand-washing â to be in place in all schools prior
to them reopening.â An Edinburgh businessman who took the Scottish government to court over coronavirus grants has failed in his bid to have reductions overturned. Jon Sharp owns six coffee shops in the city and argued that a 25% reduction to the grants for five of the properties applied from 8 June under the Scottish government grants scheme was ""unlawful"". Mr Sharp argued he had ""a legitimate expectation that a full 100% grant would be paid in respect of all six of his properties"" and suggested ""the decision of the Scottish ministers to restrict the amount of the grant payable in respect of second and subsequent properties is irrational"". But Judge Lord Fairley refused the petition for judicial review, saying Mr Sharp ""did not have such a legitimate expectation"", further saying it was ""not necessary"" to pass judgement on an ""abuse of power"". The Scottish government has apologised for giving out the wrong advice on when funfairs could reopen. Operators were originally told they would  be able to start up from the 15 of July - but days later were told to close again. Codona's Amusement Park in Aberdeen said it was ""astounded"" at the move which could jeopardise 180 jobs. Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said it was ""unfortunate and regrettable"" that conflicting advice had been given out. She said that at one point, funfairs may have been considered as visitor attractions but added that the regulations had a clear definition for funfairs. ""We will move to reopen Scotland's funfairs when it is safe to do so,"" she said. Read more.  A final decision on schools reopening will be announced next Thursday, 30 July, John Swinney confirms. Plans for blended
learning remain an ""essential contingency"" that could be applied at a local, regional or national level in future if required, says the education secretary. Each school will train
additional teachers to provide online provision across a range of subjects. Mr Swinney concludes his statement to the Scottish Parliament by returning to the ""moral and educational imperative"" of getting pupils back in school. ""They have suffered during
lockdown and the government and our partners are focused on putting in
place the opportunity to access school to support their wellbeing and develop their
potential. That drive must lie at the heart of all we do,â he adds. Of the Â£100m announced in June to tackle additional costs for schools, Â£50m will be specifically ring-fenced for the recruitment of additional
teachers and support staff for the next academic year, says John Swinney. Final numbers will be dependent on the precise mix of staff, but the education secretary expects 850 extra teachers to be recruited, while local authorities will be able to bring in about 200 support staff
across Scotland. ""I do not under-estimate the logistical challenge of reopening our
schools safely,"" he says. A further Â£20m will be allocated to local authorities to address additional requirements
such as extra cleaning or capacity constraints on school transport. The government will also make a further Â£3m
investment in youth work to support education recovery, he adds. Around 92% of UK firms were trading in the two weeks to 12 July as more opened their doors to customers on the easing of lockdown restrictions, new figures show. The proportion of active firms jumped from 86% in the first two weeks of June, as the economy got a boost from the reopening of non-essential shops and hospitality venues, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Firms currently trading said 7% of their total workforce had returned from furlough in the past two weeks and another 6% are expected to return in the next two weeks. Guitar sales is one area that has seen a boostfrom the lockdown with a surge in amateur musicians and podcasters, says Gear4Music, the UK's biggest online retailer of instruments and sound equipment. In the April-to-June period, it said the value of UK sales rose 80% on the same time last year to Â£21.2m. And Unilever said it had seenice cream sales soarwhile demand for personal hygiene items had fallen. Mr Swinney reiterates that advice on reopening schools remains conditional on
continued low rates of infection, effective surveillance and a process for
handling any local outbreaks The Scottish government is working to provide guidance by
31 July that will enable schools to reopen in August, he says. A final decision will be
taken by Cabinet next Wednesday, 29 July, and set out
to parliament next Thursday. The guidance has been developed
in partnership with local government, teachers' unions parent
representatives and other public health officials, says the education secretary. This should provide staff, pupils and parents with the reassurance they need, as it is important they all understand the
changes required, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99903166
"Four of the suspects were pictured in this handout from Italy's financial police corps A group of Carabinieri military police have been arrested and their police station closed after investigators uncovered a raft of alleged crimes taking place in the barracks. The Carabinieri in the northern city of Piacenza are suspected of drug-trafficking, blackmail and torture. The case has shocked prosecutors and residents in the northern Italian city. ""We are untouchable,"" one of the suspects is alleged to have told a colleague on a police wiretap. Accounts of the team's exploits were front-page news in Italy on Thursday, and local prosecutor Grazia Pradella said ""nothing that went on in that barracks was legal - they were out-and-out criminals"". The allegations read like the pages of a crime novel, and many of the offences took place in the weeks when Italy went into pandemic lockdown, even though the police operation began in 2017. One picture showed a man who had clearly been mistreated in custody ""While the city of Piacenza was counting so many coronavirus deaths, these Carabinieri supplied drugs to the drug dealers who were stuck at home without drugs under anti-Covid rules,"" the prosecutor said. Piacenza is in the northern region of Emilia Romagna and suffered one of the highest death rates in Italy. She compared what went on at the barracks to the practices of organised crime syndicates.

One photo released to the media showed a detainee in handcuffs and bare feet with a bloody nose. According to one wiretap, one member of the corps was heard saying they would never be caught. ""I've made a criminal gang, guys! In short, we've built a pyramid. We stand on top - me you and him - we're untouchable ok?"" The prosecutor said Carabinieri in the Levante barracks were suspected of drug dealing, receiving stolen property, extortion, illegal arrest, embezzlement and abuse of office. While 12 people were under investigation, five people were detained and a sixth placed under house arrest. The military prosecutor in Verona, who has jurisdiction in the case, said he had opened an investigation and was working in close contact with his colleagues in the civil judiciary. The revelations risked tarnishing the image of 110,000 men and women who did their best every day to uphold the values of the military police force, Italy's defence minister said. However, reports also emerged of a young Carabiniere who refused to join in the beatings, drugs and other alleged illegal activities. The most recent arrival at the barracks, identified in Italian reports as having the initials RB, was recorded complaining to his father about what was going on.

to remove customers from shops if they do not wear face coverings when the law
comes into effect on Friday. The new legislation means people will have to cover their
mouth and nose in shops, post offices, banks, transport hubs and enclosed
shopping centres. Children under the age of 11, shop workers and those who
have a âreasonable excuseâ will be exempt. The College of Policing says officers should be
âprofessionally curiousâ to ensure that someone without a covering has a good
reason for not wearing one. But the guidance urges officers to only as a âlast
resortâ issue a fixed penalty of Â£100 or make an arrest. Luton and Blackburn with Darwen have both been added to a list of areas of concern by Public Health England, following a rise in Covid-19 infections.

The countryâs World Health Organization representative, Dr Yonas Tegegn Woldermariam, told reporters that the death does not indicate that Uganda should reinstate total lockdown as it will depend on various issues, including the number of infections and the capacity of health facilities.

A study by the University of Veterinary Medicine in Hannover, in co-operation with the German army, found that after a week of training, eight dogs were able to correctly differentiate infected samples from control samples in 94% of cases. The researchers say the findings could be used to help identify the spread of the infection at public areas such as airports and sports events. Other countries have also begun investigating the potential of sniffer dogs to detect the virus,including the UK. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

International Airport fully reopened on Thursday, four months after it was closed due to
the pandemic. A
Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said all incoming passengers must take a
test 48 hours before boarding their flight. He
added that some outbound passengers are required to take a test several days

will have their temperature checked on arrival at the airport. Earlier
on Thursday, coronavirus cases in Iraq surpassed 100,000. More than 4,122
people have died since the outbreak began. The unemployment rate in Sweden has risen to its highest level in more than two decades, the country's statistics agency has said. The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate among 16 to 64-year-olds reached 9.4% in June, up from 8.6% the previous month. The figure is the highest since the late 1990s, when a severe economic crisis led to an all-time high of 11.7%. The rate among young people is even higher, with 28% of 16-24 year olds out of work - a rise of more than 7% since January. David Samuelsson, a statistician at Statistics Sweden, said the rise was mainly due to ""those who have had temporary contracts and not gotten an extension"", AFP news agency reported. Young people, meanwhile, have been affected by a lower number of summer jobs, he added. Unlike many countries, Sweden did not impose a lockdown The season opener of Major League Baseball begins tonight - at game where all fans are barred. The first game will begin when Dr Anthony Fauci, a top US disease expert who is widely respected for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and other viral outbreaks, will throw out the opening pitch of the game as the reigning champion Washington Nationals host the New York Yankees in Washington DC. Hours later the Los Angeles Dodgers will face off against the San Francisco Giants in LA. The baseball season will be shortened to only 60 games per team, and there are loads of new rules to prevent players from infected each other. Spitting is banned. As is licking your fingers to better grip the ball. Despite the lack of spectators, one network - Fox Sports - says they will be virtually added fans to bleachers during matches it airs.

A further 196 people have been quarantined at the camp for 9-13 year olds, run by Christian youth organisation Adonia. Health authorities say two people are in hospital care and that infections may rise when they get the test results of people in quarantine who have symptoms. Around 33,500 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Switzerland since the country's outbreak began, and 2,000 have died. After peaking in March, new case numbers fell in June and the government began to ease lockdown measures. But since then infections have been creeping up in different areas of the country. During the last two weeks, around 100 new cases have been reported every day on average. Sir James Dyson pictured outside Dyson HQ in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, in 2016 Dyson iscutting 600 jobs in the UK

Airbus is laying off almost 900 of its workers in Spain, adding to 700 already announced in February. It says the unparalleled pandemic-related crisis facing global aviation has made the extra cuts necessary. In total, Airbus is shedding about 15,000 staff from its global operation, including 5,000 in both France and Germany. Protester Jose Luis Collado, who has worked at the company for 41 years, told Reuters news agency that Airbus was ""taking advantage"" of the pandemic to push through job cuts. ""This is a temporary situation. It's going to pass and we don't understand why around 1,700 people of Airbus Spain have to be fired,"" said Mr Collado. A group of medieval re-enactors are leading a modern-day crusade against coronavirus on the Swedish island on Gotland. Donning full suits of armour and flying banners reading ""Together we take responsibility"", the group of eight knights is encouraging tourists to stay chivalrous and adhere to social distancing guidelines. ""We have three messages and those are: keep distance, wash your hands often and stay home if you're feeling unwell,"" project manager Lennart Borg told AFP news agency. The band of modern-day knights are from a re-enactment society, Torneamentum, which holds jousting tournaments during the summer. Since the events have been cancelled due to coronavirus, they will be appearing at beaches and other places at risk of crowding. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Johnny Depp is ""generous"" and ""loving"" when sober but the ""other side of him was a monster"", actress Amber Heard has told the High Court in London. Ms Heard said she had been ""so in love"" with her former husband and had ""always held out hope"" he would get clean. But in a text to her mother, she said he was ""violent and crazy"" and she was ""heartbroken that this is who I love"". Mr Depp, 57, is suing the publisher of the Sun over an online article that labelled him a ""wife beater"". The newspaper insists it was accurate. Meanwhile, Ms Heard's sister said in a written statement to the court that she ""felt sick"" when she learned the actress was going to marry Mr Depp. Depp 'threw bottles like grenades at Heard' Elon Musk offered Amber Heard '24/7 security' I was afraid Depp was going to kill me, says Heard Ms Heard was questioned by Sasha Wass, representing the Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers (NGN). Ms Wass read out text messages the Aquaman actress sent to her mother, Paige, on 22 and 23 March 2013, when the couple were in a relationship but not yet married. In her first witness statement, Ms Heard claimed that in March 2013, Mr Depp hit her with the back of his hand, which caused her blood to hit the wall, after an argument about a painting by her ex-partner Tasya van Ree. He denies this. The actress initially said the incident took place on 8 March 2013, but told the court she now considers the correct date of the ""painting incident"" to be 22 March 2013. Ms Wass told the court that in one text to her mother, Ms Heard wrote: ""It's terrible, mum. I don't know what to do."" Another read: ""He's nuts, mum. Violent and crazy. I'm heartbroken that this is who I love."" In a third, she wrote: ""I feel like I'm on a very fast train that's about to explode, but I don't want to jump off and leave my love behind. ""So I stay on the train, even though I know it's about to explode."" Ms Heard, who was married to the film star from 2015 to 2017, then told the court: ""I was so in love with Johnny at that time. We had had a wonderful year together where he was sober and clean and that is how I got to know him. ""And Johnny, when he was like that, [is] generous, loving, he is a remarkable man when he is like that. ""I loved him and I didn't want to lose that... the other side of him was a monster, but I always held out hope that he would get clean and sober."" As she read out the messages, Ms Wass told the court Ms Heard's mother had suggested she informed her father, to which the actress replied: ""I can't tell dad."" Ms Heard explained to the court: ""I felt safe to tell my mother, but I didn't know how my dad would react. I had never been in this situation before and I didn't know if he would react violently... to Johnny. ""I didn't want to make it worse."" The court also heard about a series of texts between Ms Heard and Mr Depp's then assistant, Nathan Holmes, which were sent on 22 March 2013. The actor is said to have been due on set at the time to film part of a documentary he was making about Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Mr Holmes texted Ms Heard at around noon to say ""on my way to get him"", to which Ms Heard replied: ""Trying to wake him now."" The court heard Ms Heard texted Mr Holmes just before 18:00 to say: ""Success - he's coming down."" Ms Wass asked: ""What was going on between noon... and about 6 o'clock that evening?"" Ms Heard replied: ""Johnny refused to leave... [he was] snorting lines of cocaine, drinking whisky and he was saying we really need to work this out, he wanted to get to the bottom of it. ""He wanted me to admit that I was having an affair with, not only Tasya van Ree, my ex-partner, but also a gentleman I hardly knew... he had just gotten it in his mind that I had these affairs and he wouldn't leave until I admitted it."" Ms Heard concluded her evidence by addressing Mr Depp's claim that her allegations were an elaborate hoax and that she had - in Ms Wass's words - ""manipulated pictures, painted on bruises, destroyed property with your friends in order to implicate Mr Depp"". Ms Wass asked: ""Has there been any benefit to your career since you have made these allegations against Mr Depp?"" Ms Heard replied: ""No. What woman has ever benefited from being the victim of domestic violence?"" Ms Wass asked if Ms Heard had ""benefited financially"" from making the allegations, to which the actress said: ""I married and divorced Johnny without a pre-nup in a no-fault state. ""I was entitled to 50% of his [assets] and he of mine without having to prove anything happened in the marriage, bad or good. It's a no-fault state and I was entitled to 50%."" Meanwhile, the court heard a written witness statement from Ms Heard's sister who said she ""begged"" Ms Heard, 34, not to go through with the marriage, telling her ""him [Mr Depp] putting a ring on her finger was not going to stop him hitting her"". Whitney Henriquez said when she first met the Pirates Of The Caribbean star he seemed ""very sweet"" and she was ""surprised how much I liked him"". The pair became close, ""like brother and sister"", she claimed, with Mr Depp, 57, calling her ""sis"". But Ms Henriquez also said her sister's relationship with the actor was ""tumultuous from the start"". Her statement said: ""I wasn't aware of violence at the beginning, but I do remember Amber talking about them having big fights and being concerned for my sister. ""Amber told me that they would [verbally] fight - sometimes for days on end - and then go days without speaking to each other."" The libel case centres on an article published on the Sun's website in April 2018 under the headline ""Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?"". The article related to allegations made by Ms Heard, which Mr Depp denies.

"Nicola Sturgeon said she acknowledged the ""painful journey"" of those who had been shielding for four months People in Scotland considered to be at the greatest risk of Covid-19 will be able to go to pubs and restaurants with outdoor spaces from Friday. Nicola Sturgeon said people shielding could also meet indoors with maximum of eight people from up to two households if physical distancing was maintained. Visits to indoors shops or the hairdresser and using public transport will be allowed as well. The changes come ahead of a ""pause"" in shielding guidelines from 1 August. Giving her daily coronavirus briefing, the first minister acknowledged the ""painful journey"" of those in the shielding category over the past four months of lockdown. ""You've had to remain in your house and largely apart from all other people, even people in your own household, for months now,"" she said. ""But by doing so you have protected yourselves, you've reassured your loved ones and you've helped our health and care services - so a sincere and heartfelt thank you from me to each of you for that."" People in the shielding category will be able to visit pubs and restaurants with outdoors spaces Ms Sturgeon said that the relaxation of restrictions was possible because of the way infection rates had slowed in Scotland over the past few weeks. She compared the hundreds of new cases that were being reported each day at the beginning of April to the 16 new cases detected on Thursday. Those new cases amounted to a 0.4% positive test rate - compared to 20% and above a few months ago - the first minister said. Scotland has now also gone seven days without a new death of someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. The shielding changes announced for Friday mean the children of those who are shielding will also be able to return to formal childcare provision. However, this does not apply to children who are shielding. Meetings outdoors with up to 15 people from four other households outdoors with physical distancing Using public transport wearing a face covering Visits to shops, pharmacies and indoor markets with a face covering Visits to museums, galleries, libraries, cinemas and other visitor attractions with a face covering Full guidance is available on theScottish government website,external. Ms Sturgeon said a ""Covid forecasting service"" was being developed for those in the shielding category, which will enable people to assess the infection risk in their local area. The ""pause"" in shielding guidelines, which comes at the end of next week, will mean people will be able to return to the workplace. The advice to those in the shielding category will then be the same as people at ""heightened risk"" - for example older people. However, a resurgence in infections, either nationally or locally, could mean a return to restrictions or changes to current guidance. Ms Sturgeon said it would ""understandable"" if people felt anxious after living in such a restricted way for so long. ""We are not asking you to stop being careful and we do not want you to feel under pressure to do anything you think is unsafe. In fact we want to do anything we can to help you feel as safe as possible,"" she added. DEATHS:Who is dying and where with Covid-19 in Scotland?

"The University of York is one of those institutions affected At least 10 universities in the UK, US and Canada have had data stolen about students and/or alumni after hackers attacked a cloud computing provider. Human Rights Watch and the children's mental health charity, Young Minds, have also confirmed they were affected. The hack targeted Blackbaud, one of the world's largest providers of education administration, fundraising, and financial management software. The US-based company's systems were hacked in May. It has been criticised for not disclosing this externally until July and for having paid the hackers an undisclosed ransom. In some cases, the data was limited to that of former students, who had been asked to financially support the establishments they had graduated from. But in others it extended to staff, existing students and other supporters. The institutions the BBC has confirmed have been affected are: University of York Oxford Brookes University Loughborough University University of Leeds University of London University of Reading University College, Oxford Ambrose University in Alberta, Canada Human Rights Watch Young Minds Rhode Island School of Design in the US University of Exeter All the institutions are sending letters and emails apologising to those on the compromised databases. In some cases, the stolen data included phone numbers, donation history and events attended. Credit card and other payment details do not appear to have been exposed. Blackbaud, whose headquarters are based in South Carolina, declined to provide a complete lists of those impacted, saying it wanted to ""respect the privacy of our customers"". ""The majority of our customers were not part of this incident,"" the company claimed. It referred theBBC to a statement on its website,external: ""In May of 2020, we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. Prior to our locking the cyber-criminal out, the cyber-criminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment."" The statement goes on to say Blackbaud paid the ransom demand. Doing so is not illegal, but goes against the advice of numerous law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, NCA and Europol. Blackbaud added that it had been given ""confirmation that the copy [of data] they removed had been destroyed"". Several Blackbaud clients listed on its site have confirmed they were not affected, including: University College London Queen's University Belfast University of the West of Scotland Islamic Relief Prevent Breast Cancer ""My main concern is how reassuring - impossibly so, in my opinion - Blackbaud were to the university about what the hackers have obtained,"" commented Rhys Morgan, a cyber-security specialist and former student at Oxford Brookes University, whose data was involved. ""They told my university that there is 'no reason to believe that the stolen data was or will be misused'. ""I can't feel reassured by this at all. How can they possibly know what the attackers will do with that information?"" Oxford Brookes University is among those contacting students about the hack Blackbaud has said it is working with law enforcement and third party investigators to monitor whether or not the data is being circulated or sold on the dark web, for example. Barrister blogger Matthew Scott was also sent an email about the hack. ""I doubt that my university has many details that aren't pretty easily available, but I am more concerned about giving in to the blackmail and blithely accepting the word of the blackmailer that all the data has now been destroyed,"" he told the BBC. Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies must report a significant breach to data authorities within 72 hours of learning of an incident - or face potential fines. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office [ICO], as well as the Canadian data authorities, were informed about the breach last weekend - weeks after Blackbaud discovered the hack. An ICO spokeswoman said: ""Blackbaud has reported an incident affecting multiple data controllers to the ICO. We will be making enquiries to both Blackbaud and the respective controllers, and encourage all affected controllers to evaluate whether they need to report the incident to the ICO individually."" Leeds University said, in a statement: ""We want to reassure our alumni that, since being informed by Blackbaud of this incident, we have been working tirelessly to investigate what has happened, in order to accurately inform those affected. No action is required by our alumni community at this time, although, as ever, we recommend that everyone remains vigilant.""

"The app will assist with the ongoing contact tracing programme A coronavirus contact tracing app for Northern Ireland will be launched next week, the health committee has been told. Dan West from the Department of Health said the release of Stop Covid NI was supported by the executive. The app will supplement the phone-based contact tracing programme already in place. Northern Ireland will be the first part of the UK to have a contact tracing app. TheRepublic of Ireland's app launched earlierin July. Both apps have been designed by the company Nearform. Mr West, a chief digital information officer at the Department of Health, said the NI app would notify close contacts automatically. It would also identify people at risk of infection who would be impossible to trace through the traditional method. The app could launch as soon as 29 July. It comes asthe Northern Ireland Executive announced a further easing of lockdown restrictionsfrom Friday. After a positive Covid-19 test result, a person will receive a unique code by text message. That message will invite the person to enter the code if they use the app. Entering the code will trigger a ""Bluetooth handshake"", allowing the app to notify any other user who has been nearby for long enough to be at risk of infection. ""There will be some people who won't be able to or won't want to use the app, and that's okay,"" Mr West said. ""The more people who do use it, the more protection this will provide to the whole community. We can say that for sure."" The app will be intended for over-18s initially, because of a conflict between data protection laws and the need for identifiable safeguarding consent. Dr Eddie O'Neill from the Health and Social Care Board is meeting the children's commissioner, the information commissioner's office and the Children's Law Centre to find a way through that. Health Minister Robin Swann wants a system that can work with the Republic of Ireland's app Health Minister Robin Swannpreviously said his department was working with its counterpart in the Republic of Ireland. The ambition was to have the two systems work in tandem, so information about contacts who need to be traced can be shared by both governments. The contact tracing programme has been operational in Northern Ireland since mid-May. The great coronavirus-tracing apps mystery It involves people with a positive test result being contacted by phone. The people they have been within 2m of for 15 minutes or more are called and advised about isolating or being tested if they have symptoms. The app is an add-on to that, to help with contact tracing, and alert those who may not be easily contacted. The UK government is working on an app using the Google Apple toolkit Mr West said the development and operation of the app in Northern Ireland ""is orders of magnitude cheaper than the efforts in England to develop their app so far"". He said it would cost less than Â£1m to build and operate. The UK government is working on developing an app for use in the rest of the country. In England an NHS team spent four months and nearly Â£12m developing an app which was trialled on the Isle of Wightbut did not work as planned. Health Secretary Matt Hancock then announced the new focus would be on adecentralised app using the Google Apple toolkit- but that was unlikely to be ready for months.

"This video can not be played Convicted rapist Lawrance was a keen amateur boxer Men who lie to sexual partners about being infertile should not be found guilty of rape, judges have ruled. The issue was considered because of an appeal by 55-year-old Jason Lawrance. Last July he was found guilty of raping a woman twice - despite her consenting to sex - because he had lied about having had a vasectomy. However, Court of Appeal judges said these convictions were unsafe and have quashed them. Lawrance has other rape convictions and remains in prison. The woman deceived by him took emergency contraception but became pregnant, then had an abortion. Despite this, the judges said Lawrance's ""lie about his fertility was not capable in law of negating consent"". Sex, lies and legal consent: Can deceit turn sex into rape? Jason Lawrance appeals against vasectomy lie rape convictions Match.com rapist Jason Lawrance jailed for two and a half more years Lawrance is serving life sentences for his other rapes and his legal team did not appeal against any of his other convictions. His solicitor, Shaun Draycott, said: ""We are delighted by this judgment. There was real concern that the upholding of the convictions recorded at Nottingham Crown Court [last July] would have had the potential to criminalise large sections of an otherwise law-abiding population, both male and female. ""The ruling provides clarity on the important issue of whether one person's consent to a sexual act can be negated by another person's dishonesty."" Jason Lawrance is serving life sentences for raping numerous women He wasgiven a life sentence in 2016for raping five women, attempting to rape one woman, and sexually assaulting another. The assaults took place between June 2011 and November 2014 in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire. He met the women through online dating site Match.com - which was also how he met his wife - and Dating Direct. Lawrance, originally from Leicestershire,went on trial again last Julyaccused of raping and sexually assaulting six more women. One of these was the woman he deceived about having had a vasectomy. He was convictedof five charges of rape, one charge of sexual assault and a further charge of assault by penetration. He was found not guilty of two charges of rape. Jason Lawrance's texts were used as evidence (photo posed by model) Lawrance and the woman were texting each other before they met and he told her he had undergone ""the snip"" in a discussion about contraception. Giving evidence in a trial last year, the woman said Lawrance also made the same claim verbally before they slept together. They had sex twice and Lawrance left in the middle of the night. He later texted her saying: ""I have a confession. I'm still fertile. Sorry xxx"" Clive Stockwell QC, prosecuting, asked the woman: ""Would you have had sexual intercourse with him if he had not had a vasectomy?"" The woman replied: ""Absolutely not; unless he had other protection."" She also told the court: ""I was absolutely gobsmacked that anybody could do such a thing."" Lawrance's text messages were used as evidence he had deceived the woman, and that he knew the woman would not have consented to sex without contraception. The Sexual Offences Act 2003,externalsays a person commits rape if the other person ""does not consent to the penetration"" or they ""do not reasonably believe"" the person consents. Section 74 of the Act,externalspecifies that a person consents if he or she ""agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice"". The prosecution's case was that the woman's consent was vitiated by Lawrance's deception. Clive Stockwell QC, prosecuting Lawrance, told jurors that because he deceived the woman, this had ""robbed her of her freedom of choice"". ""Her consent was obtained by a deception,"" he said in his opening. ""That, we submit, is not true consent."" Lawrance was charged with two counts of rape because he had sex with the woman twice. Defence barrister David Emanuel QC said classing the deceit as rape was ""taking it too far"". However, the jury decided it was rape and found Lawrance guilty of those two charges. The appeal was heard by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon The appeal was heard by the Lord Chief Justice for England and Wales, Lord Burnett of Maldon, sitting with Mrs Justice Cutts and Mrs Justice Tipples. Their judgment said: ""In terms of section 74 of the 2003 Act, the complainant [the woman] was not deprived by the appellant's [Lawrance's] lie of the freedom to choose whether to have the sexual intercourse which occurred."" The judges looked at similar cases involving deception, including Julian Assange's extradition case, wherea judgment said sex without a condom would be a sexual offence,externalin the UK if the other partner had only agreed on the condition a condom was used. They also considereda case known as R(F),external, which involved a woman who consented to sex with her husband on the condition he withdrew before ejaculating. However, the Court of Appeal judges said Lawrance's case was different from these cases. The judgment said: ""Unlike the woman in Assange, or in R(F), the complainant agreed to sexual intercourse with the appellant without imposing any physical restrictions. ""She agreed both to penetration of her vagina and to ejaculation without the protection of a condom."" The woman was, instead, ""deceived about the nature or quality of the ejaculate"", the judges said. ""The deception was one which related not to the physical performance of the sexual act but to risks or consequences associated with it.""

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson defends UK union on a visit to Scotland The response to the coronavirus pandemic has shown the ""sheer might"" of the UK union, Boris Johnson has said during a visit to Scotland. Mr Johnson was in Orkney and the north of Scotland one year on from the day he took office as prime minister. He said the work of the military and Treasury job retention schemes had proved the ""merits of the union"". But the SNP said the visit showed Mr Johnson was ""in a panic"" about rising support for Scottish independence. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon did not meet Mr Johnson during the trip but said she would continue to work with his government on the ""immediate priority"" of tackling coronavirus. Follow updates on Boris Johnson's visit to Scotland What's Boris Johnson worried about in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon said she did not think anyone should be ""championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives"" to make a constitutional argument. Mr Johnson said he ""pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the United Kingdom"" when he entered Downing Street one year ago, adding that the response to the pandemic had shown his government's commitment to the whole of the UK. The UK government has coordinated much of the country's economic response to the virus, including the coronavirus job retention furlough scheme. But devolved governments have had control over most public health measures and have been able to set more local timetables and messaging. Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""always happy to meet the prime minister"" Although the whole of the UK entered lockdown in the same week, each constituent part has eased restrictions at a different rate. Phase 3 of Scotland's""route map"" out of lockdownbegan last week, as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and barbers were allowed to reopen. They were allowed to reopen in England slightly earlier on 4 July, along with holiday accommodation - including hotels, B&Bs, cottages, campsites and caravan parks. Boris Johnson must have found recent opinion polls conducted in Scotland to be awkward reading. Surveys suggesting rising support for Scottish independence and a significant gap between his approval ratings and those of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, appear to have prompted him to make his first visit to Scotland since last year's general election. The prime minister wants to use the trip to remind people in Scotland just how much cash the UK treasury has spent in response to the coronavirus crisis. He is stressing that it is the Westminster government that has supported 900,000 people who might have otherwise lost their jobs and produced billions of pounds in extra spending for the NHS. The SNP don't look too worried about a prime ministerial trip denting support for their cause. On her 50th birthday, on Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that a visit for Boris was the best birthday pressie she could hope for. Every time the PM tells voters that it is only as part of the UK that Scottish businesses and public services could afford to cope with the pandemic, the SNP will reply that they are sick of being told that Scotland is ""too wee, too poor and too stupid"" to be independent. Read more from Sarah Smith Speaking in Orkney, where he met local fishermen, Mr Johnson said the ""merits of the union"" had been ""proved throughout this crisis"", citing the work of the military and the Treasury's support for workers and firms. The UK government says the furlough and self-employment schemeshave supported 900,000 jobs in Scotland, and that Â£4.6bn of additional funding was being provided to the Scottish government. The prime minister also said not enough time had passed for another independence referendum to be held, saying the 2014 vote wasa ""once in a generation"" event. He said: ""What I'm saying is that the union is a fantastically strong institution. It's helped our country through thick and thin. ""It's very, very valuable in terms of the support we've been able to give to everybody throughout all corners of the UK, and we had a referendum on breaking up the union a few years ago - I think only six years ago. That is not a generation by any computation and I think what people really want to do is see our whole country coming back strongly together, and that's what we're going to do."" Ms Sturgeontweeted,externalthat the prime minister's visit to Scotland ""highlighted the argument for Scottish independence"". However she said politicians should remain focused on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and ""not use it as a political weapon"". At her coronavirus briefing on Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""worked very hard to have a collaborative approach to the other governments of the UK"". She said financial support from the Treasury was ""very welcome"", but said it should be clear that ""this is borrowed money"" which would have to be repaid by Scottish taxpayers too - ""it's not some kind of favour that has been done"". The first minister said UK-wide actions by Mr Johnson's administration were a reflection of where powers lie, saying that ""if we held the powers we would be doing these things ourselves"". She added: ""I just don't think any of us should be championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political cases we want to make. ""This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we are not out of yet. Too many people people have died and all of us have a really solemn responsibility to focus on and get our countries through, and that's what I'm going to continue to do. ""Campaigning right now is not my priority. Boris Johnson has every right to be on a campaign visit but in his shoes it's not what I would do."" Mr Johnson was greeted by a small group of protestors during his visit to Orkney Mr Johnson also announced Â£50m of funding from the UK government for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles - the latest in a series of ""city and region deals"" which see Scottish and UK ministers each pledge cash to various areas for spending on new infrastructure and local development schemes. The Scottish government has also committed Â£50mto the ""Islands growth deal"", which will target sectors including tourism, energy and skills. The timing of Mr Johnson's visit comes amid a ""perfect storm"" over Scottish independence, according to Sir Tom Devine, an emeritus professor of Scottish history at Edinburgh University. Sir Tom told BBC Two's Newsnight the union is in its most fragile condition since 1745, and that opinion polling suggesting increasing support for independence in Scotland has been consistent for some time. Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt added that a senior SNP source had told him they believed the party's moment ""is at last arriving"". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mr Johnson was visiting due to recent polls suggesting support for independence was on the rise. Mr Blackford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister's message would go down ""particularly badly"" in Scotland. ""I think what we've demonstrated over the course of the last few months [is] that in the areas of devolved responsibility, in the areas of public health, the leadership that's been shown by our first minister is in sharp contrast to the bluster that we've seen from Boris Johnson,"" he said.

"Nicola Sturgeon said she acknowledged the ""painful journey"" of those who had been shielding for four months People in Scotland considered to be at the greatest risk of Covid-19 will be able to go to pubs and restaurants with outdoor spaces from Friday. Nicola Sturgeon said people shielding could also meet indoors with maximum of eight people from up to two households if physical distancing was maintained. Visits to indoors shops or the hairdresser and using public transport will be allowed as well. The changes come ahead of a ""pause"" in shielding guidelines from 1 August. Giving her daily coronavirus briefing, the first minister acknowledged the ""painful journey"" of those in the shielding category over the past four months of lockdown. ""You've had to remain in your house and largely apart from all other people, even people in your own household, for months now,"" she said. ""But by doing so you have protected yourselves, you've reassured your loved ones and you've helped our health and care services - so a sincere and heartfelt thank you from me to each of you for that."" People in the shielding category will be able to visit pubs and restaurants with outdoors spaces Ms Sturgeon said that the relaxation of restrictions was possible because of the way infection rates had slowed in Scotland over the past few weeks. She compared the hundreds of new cases that were being reported each day at the beginning of April to the 16 new cases detected on Thursday. Those new cases amounted to a 0.4% positive test rate - compared to 20% and above a few months ago - the first minister said. Scotland has now also gone seven days without a new death of someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. The shielding changes announced for Friday mean the children of those who are shielding will also be able to return to formal childcare provision. However, this does not apply to children who are shielding. Meetings outdoors with up to 15 people from four other households outdoors with physical distancing Using public transport wearing a face covering Visits to shops, pharmacies and indoor markets with a face covering Visits to museums, galleries, libraries, cinemas and other visitor attractions with a face covering Full guidance is available on theScottish government website,external. Ms Sturgeon said a ""Covid forecasting service"" was being developed for those in the shielding category, which will enable people to assess the infection risk in their local area. The ""pause"" in shielding guidelines, which comes at the end of next week, will mean people will be able to return to the workplace. The advice to those in the shielding category will then be the same as people at ""heightened risk"" - for example older people. However, a resurgence in infections, either nationally or locally, could mean a return to restrictions or changes to current guidance. Ms Sturgeon said it would ""understandable"" if people felt anxious after living in such a restricted way for so long. ""We are not asking you to stop being careful and we do not want you to feel under pressure to do anything you think is unsafe. In fact we want to do anything we can to help you feel as safe as possible,"" she added. DEATHS:Who is dying and where with Covid-19 in Scotland?

"Swab tests are used to look for the presence of the virus A network of coronavirus-testing walk-in centres is to be set up across England in an attempt to persuade more people to come forward for testing. Several hundred walk-in units will be up and running by the end of October, in time for winter, when there is concern cases could start to rise. They will complement the existing drive-through centres, mobile testing units and home-ordering service. It comes amid concern people are still not coming forward for testing. How does contact tracing work in England? Whatever happened to the NHS contact-tracing app? The government's weekly random test of 30,000 people, run by the Office for National Statistics, suggests there are about 1,700 new infections a day. But the testing service is picking up only about a third of those. Some of that will be because people are not showing symptoms when they are infected, but bosses at the NHS Test and Trace service said they wanted to see more people come forward for testing. Meanwhile, Public Health England has released its weekly report into local infection rates. It shows Blackburn has had the most positive cases per 100,000 people over the past week at nearly 80 -as the BBC reported earlier this week. Mass testing in Blackburn began at the weekend following a spike in infections Leicester, which was placed into local lockdown earlier in the month, has seen cases fall. Extra measures have been introduced in Blackburn, including tougher guidance on household mixing. But a full local lockdown is not on the cards yet. Luton has also been designated an area for intervention alongside Leicester and Blackburn. It means some of the restrictions being eased nationally from this weekend, including the re-opening of gyms, will not now happen there. Other areas among the top 10 are Kirklees, Sandwell, Rotherham and Bradford. These are all being closely watched, with local public health teams encouraging those who have been in close contact with confirmed cases to self-isolate. Overall, there are signs the contact tracing service - NHS Test and Trace - is beginning to improve on some measures. Some 80% of people who tested positive over the past week provided details of close contact. Of those close contacts provided 78% were reached and asked to isolate, up from 72% last week. NHS Test and Trace head Baroness Harding said she was pleased with the performance. But she said the ""most important lever"" in keeping the virus at bay was to get more people to come forward for testing, which was why a network of walk-in centres was being created. ""NHS Test and Trace relies on everyone playing their part,"" she said. ""We all need to get a test if we have symptoms, share details of our contacts if we test positive and self-isolate when asked to do so."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

And the capacity to process tests is also being increased, with a new mega-lab opening in Newport, Gwent. The ambition is that by the end of October 500,000 tests a day will be able to be processed.

"Janice Dunphy, owner of the Web Adventure Park indoor play centre As the nation gradually unlocks, nightclubs and soft play centres still don't know when it will be their turn to reopen. ""On Friday there was the devastating news that everybody else apart from ourselves and nightclubs could open,"" says Janice Dunphy, owner of the Web Adventure Park indoor play centre in York. ""We've been closed now 133 days so it's really difficult to accept,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money. Indoor play centres, along with nightclubs, have not yet been given permission to reopen and so far no date has been set for them to work towards. That's leaving business owners such as Janice unable to plan for a return of their customers and the financial boost that would provide. Plan for 'significant normality' by Christmas - PM 'My hotel is losing about Â£40,000 a month' 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Recent weeks have seen non-essential shops, theme parks and outdoor play areas reopen and at the start of August it will be possible for bowling alleys, casinos and ice rinks to welcome customers back. But as Boris Johnson announced the lifting of those restrictions, as well as a return to full services for beauticians, he added: ""Nightclubs and soft play areas will sadly need to remain closed for now - although this will be kept under review."" Janice says: ""My financial director told me we have to lose Â£200,000 off our wage bill over the next 18 months. Some of the staff that we've had to let go have families."" For the Web Adventure Park that meant significant redundancies, as they could not afford for furloughed staff to continue accruing holiday pay. ""We used to have 65 staff but I've just made nine redundant and had to lay 20 off temporarily. Then we have 20 staff working in the nursery, which is still open. ""The ones we have had to lay off are mostly the younger workers, the 18-year-olds."" Janice is not just a business owner, she also sits on the management committee for the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions. It claims that up to two-thirds of soft play centres could close by October if they don't receive support that reflects their extended lockdown. ""We have supported everything that we've been asked to do,"" says Janice. ""I actually produced the reopening protocol that was approved by [the Health and Safety Executive] so we've ticked every box as far as we've been asked. ""We would remove ball pits and anything that was a potential hazard would be taken out. Our members have foggers that they can clean surfaces with."" ""However there's been no clarity, nothing has come back from government. There's questions as to why certain industries that are indoors that have large numbers like inflatables parks, like trampoline parks can open but we can't. ""If we had some idea of why, if we could speak to the government and ask why we could answer some of the questions but we've had no communication at all."" The nightclub sector is another that remains locked down despite the easing of restrictions elsewhere. ""I think what's really frustrating with our nightclub is we just have no idea when we might be able to reopen and it's really hard to plan that way,"" says Charlie Gilkes, a nightlife entrepreneur and the co-founder of Inception Group, which includes a nightclub. ""We understand that nightclubs are quite hard to operate with any social distancing in place, they are social environments, but we just need to have some sort of clarity of when they think it will be, even if that's next year. ""And we need some sort of promise that the furlough scheme will be extended for nightclubs so that our staff can remain on that and there can be some specific support for the businesses which aren't allowed to open."" A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""We recognise the frustration of businesses which have had to remain closed because of the pandemic and we are working to help them reopen as soon as it is safe. ""We are also providing businesses and their employees with an unprecedented package of support during this national emergency including Â£330bn worth of government backed and guaranteed loans and the Coronavirus Job Retention scheme.""

"For decades, Ritter Sport has marketed its chocolate bars on their unique, square shape. So when rival brand Milka challenged its German monopoly on square chocolate, the battle lines were drawn. Milka achieved an initial victory in 2016 by getting the trademark deleted but that ruling was overturned. Finally, the case ended up in the Federal Court of Justice, where judges have now thrown out Milka's complaint and ruled in favour of Ritter Sport. The square bar dates back to 1932, when Clara Ritter came up with the idea,according to company legend,external. ""Let's make a chocolate bar that fits in everyone's jacket pocket without breaking and weighs the same as a normal long bar,"" she is supposed to have said (although in German). By 1970 it had come up with the slogan""Quadratisch, praktisch, gut""- quality, chocolate, squared, as the company likes to translate it. The family company registered the shape with the German patent and trademark office in 1993, so when Milka began marketing a square bar in 2010, the case went to court. The judges said the square shape gave customers an indication of both its origin and quality Milka, now owned by Mondelez, won round one in the federal patent court but that ruling was later thrown out and the patent court decided the following year that Ritter could keep its three-dimensional monopoly. Milka's final challenge in the Federal Court of Justice has now also failed. No break for Kit Kat in trademark case Cadbury accused of 'shrinkflation' as pack size cut Normally a brand cannot claim protection in Germany if its shape gives the product ""an essential value"". But the judges in this case said Ritter Sport was different. Consumers considered the square nature of the chocolate bar as an indication of both where the chocolate came from and its quality, they concluded. They said there was no artistic value to the shape and it did not lead to differences in price. Their ruling means that the incumbent bar can remain the only top-brand square chocolate bar on the shelves in German shops.

"Full guidance on wearing face coverings in shops in Englandhas been released,,externalless than 12 hours before the new rules come into force. Coverings will be mandatory in enclosed public spaces including supermarkets, indoor shopping centres, transport hubs, banks and post offices. They must also be worn when buying takeaway food and drink, although they can be removed in a seating area. Those who break the rules could face a fine of up to Â£100. And police will be able to ""use force"" to remove customers from shops if they do not wear face coverings, as well as prevent them from entering, guidance from the College of Policing says. However,forces have saidthey will only be enforcing the rules, including issuing the Â£100 fines, as a last resort - and officers will not be patrolling premises. There are exemptions to the new rules for children under 11, those with disabilities or certain health conditions, such as respiratory or cognitive impairments that make it difficult for them to wear a face covering. Public Health England has warned parents not to buy coverings for babies and young children because of the risk of choking or suffocation. Allow Twitter content?

It is not compulsory for shop workers to wear face coverings but the government said it ""strongly"" recommended that employers consider their use where appropriate. The government said it was the responsibility of individuals to wear one, although businesses are encouraged to take steps to encourage customers to follow the law, such as with signs. Sainsbury's and Costa Coffee have already said their staff will not challenge or enforce customers who enter their stores.

Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask How to make your own face mask Masks will not be mandatory in indoor venues which have other safety measures in place, including: Eat-in restaurants Pubs Hairdressers and salons Gyms and leisure centres Cinemas, concert halls and theatres Visitor attractions like museums The government said evidence suggests that when used correctly, face coverings may reduce the chance of infecting others The government has been accused of mixed messaging over wearing masks in takeaways, with trade bodies and MPs saying there had been confusion about how the rules would apply. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""If you are in a premises where you are able to sit down and consume food or drink that you have bought, then you can remove your face covering in order to eat and drink on site."" The criticism came after ministers and Boris Johnson's official spokesman contradicted each other over how the rules would apply to takeaways and sandwich shops. Speaking before the guidance was published, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the messaging from the government had been contradictory and it was ""very late in the day"" for the guidance to be confirmed. Unison official Jon Richards also said the UK ""was late to the table on face coverings and now people don't know what they should do"". He said the rules on face coverings were in place for shops and public transport but not for some other enclosed spaces such as libraries, register offices and civic centres. ""The public needs clarity to end the muddle,"" he said. This video can not be played How to wear a face covering According to the government,,externalface coverings should cover the mouth and nose and can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that securely fits around the side of the face without having to be held in place. The requirement to wear face coverings at transport hubs - railway and bus stations, airports and maritime ports - only applies for those areas which are fully indoors and enclosed. You are allowed to remove a face covering in certain situations, for example to prove identification in banks or when buying age restricted products. Face coverings have been compulsory in shops in Scotland since 10 July. Shoppers are not currently required to wear them in Wales or Northern Ireland, althoughNI will wait until 20 August before decidingwhether to make them compulsory. Coverings are already compulsory on public transport in England and Scotland, as well as most buses, trains and ferries in Northern Ireland. They will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July. The Police Federation, which represents front-line officers, says they can't spend their time patrolling thousands upon thousands of outlets. Shop staff and security guards can already detain shoplifters while waiting for the police to arrive and police leaders hope shop managers will refuse non-mask wearers entry - rather than turning to the police to solve the problem. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said that police in London would only enforce the wearing of coverings in shops ""as a last resort"" - if people not wearing a covering refused to leave a shop or became ""aggressive"". Read more here. Tracy Cannard, who works in a supermarket and is a representative of the shopworkers' union USDAW, said while increasing numbers of customers were choosing to wear masks this still only amounted to around 20% and making it compulsory would help her feel safer. James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said he was advising its members to communicate the rules on face coverings through posters and informal conversations - rather than challenging customers who did not wear one. He said incidents of verbal and physical abuse of shop workers had increased during lockdown and retailers did not want to risk creating a ""flashpoint"" for confrontation. The head of the Trades Union Congress, Frances O'Grady, also warned the new rules could put staff at risk of abuse. ""The new rules requiring shoppers to wear masks may further risk staff safety, she said. ""Shop staff are not required to police the wearing of face masks - employers must make this clear. And every employer must publish a risk assessment that sets out how they will safeguard staff from abusive customers and those who refuse to wear masks."" Abuse could also be directed at disabled people who are exempt from the rule, a disability charity has warned. Fazilet Hadi, a policy manager at Disability Rights UK, said there had already been ""horrific stories"" of disabled people being confronted about not wearing a mask, and has called for a government advertising campaign to raise awareness of the exemptions. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""everyone must play their part"" by following the new guidance. ""As we move into the next stage of easing restrictions for the public, it is vital we continue to shop safely so that we can make the most of our fantastic retail industry this summer,"" he said. ""I also want to thank the British public for all the sacrifices they are making to help keep this country safe."" In other developments: Two more areas in England - Luton and Blackburn - have been marked as ""areas of intervention"".

"There is now almost no excuse for notwearing a face mask while out shopping in England- covering your face is as essential as remembering your cash or bank card. The rulesdiffer a little around the UK. But wherever you live, it's going to be hard to avoid covering up your mouth and nose. And that raises a host of dilemmas. This is important to get right. The key things are to clean your hands before you put it on and take it off, and to make sure it fits snugly so there aren't any gaps between the material and your face. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering Of course if your mask doesn't fit properly you can always adjust it, or tie it in a slightly more convenient way. But it needs to cover both your mouth and nose and also go up to the top of your nose, hooking behind your ears or the back of your head. And remember, the idea is no gaps. Got it? You're good to go. When buying your mask the first thing you need to decide is what sort you want. The governmentsays surgical masks and respirators should be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace,,externalsuch as NHS staff and care workers. But you can still buy non-medical disposable face coverings, reusable cloth coverings, or evenitems like scarves and bandanas.,external If single-use coverings are what you're after, you could head to a pharmacy - high street chains like Boots, Superdrug and Lloyds all sell them. And they're available on online sites like Amazon. But more and more clothes retailers are also joining the marketplace with reusable fabric masks. In fact, it seems everywhere now sells reusable masks - from your local corner shop, to your favourite football club, to independent retailers on Etsy. From ditsy designs to animal prints, there are a range of ""fashion masks"" on sites like Asos or Boohoo, or in shops like Oliver Bonas. No, sorry, that's not allowed. Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people cough or sneeze - but also when they talk. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces. So it would defeat the point if you take it off to have a natter, really. This video can not be played Stop your glasses steaming up with a mask on It's a worry that has been burdening many spectacle-wearers. It's a legitimate one, too - lenses can steam up when you wear a mask because your warm breath comes out of the top of the mask, hitting the cooler lenses and clouding them up. The extra moisture can also mean that nose pads become slippery and your frames glasses slide down your face. The key is to try, if possible, to make sure there aren't any gaps for the air to escape around your nose and cheeks. You could try tucking the mask behind your glasses, or tucking some tissue inside the top of the covering. The opticiansSpecsavers recommends,externalresting your glasses on top of your mask to help seal any gap, or using a piece of surgical tape to secure the mask to the bridge of your nose. Failing that you could try washing your glasses in soapy water to stop them misting up. A face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. But if you have a medical issue and suffer from breathing difficulties, it might not be quite that simple. You may well already be among those exempt from wearing face coverings on public transport in England. The government hasn't given the precise wording of the rules for shops yet, so you'll need to check those once they're out. But one tip from Asthma UK,externalis to try a few different types to see if there is one that suits you. It suggests trying one out at home, or on a short walk around the block before heading off to do your weekly shop. No, sorry (again). If your mask isn't washable, or if it's disposable,the government says it should go in your ""black bag"" or general waste bin,external(or a litter bin if you're outside) once you've worn it. Disposable face coverings should be thrown away after each use, or as soon as they are damp, according to the World Health Organization. This includes the lighter, pleated ones as well as the sturdier, particle-filtering masks. This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'The masks you throw away could end up killing a whale' The added waste has caused concern for environmentalists who say they're ending up in the sea. The government says if you're worried about this you can ""wash and reuse cloth face coverings"", or make your own. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, you like cutting up old t-shirts, or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and allow you to breathe comfortably. One study suggests the best materials to use are tightly-woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. We've put togethera guide to different types and step-by-step instructionson how to make them. You should wash your fabric coverings after every use. That might sound like a lot, but the good news is you can put them in the washing machine with the rest of your clothes. Bandanas, face scarves and coverings made of fabric, like cotton, can be washed in your regular laundry using hot water, says US-based Johns Hopkins Medicine. You should wash it on the warmest appropriate water setting,external, but that depends on the type of material it's made from. Or you can hand wash them in hot, soapy water - scrubbing them for at least 20 seconds. After washing, tumble dry them on a high setting and store in a clean place. If you are air drying, keep them flat and try to dry them in direct sunlight. Johns Hopkins Medicine also suggests using a non-scented detergent if you are sensitive to perfumes. Some big high street names (Gap, Boots, Claire's to name just three) sell masks for children, alongside smaller manufacturers that have shifted their focus - including Thumbsie, which usually makes fabric gloves to help children stop sucking their thumbs. Vistaprint offers a range of face coverings with adjustable straps in kid-friendly fabrics, while luxury brand Rachel Riley makes them with a cotton satin lining for children as young as three. In England, only children aged 11 and over will have to wear one in shops. In Scotland, all children aged five and over must cover their faces in shops. Some people have said you should think of your masks like your socks - having a new one every day. That doesn't mean you need to rush out and buy dozens of them, but it's a good idea to perhaps have more than one. That way you can wear a clean one while the other is in the wash. And as for the disposable ones, they are usually sold in large numbers - Boots, for example, has a multipack of 80. That should be more than enough to do the weekly supermarket shop for a few weeks.

"Minister Michael Gove was seen wearing a face mask when buying takeaway food on Tuesday, after being photographed not wearing one the previous week The government has been accused of mixed messaging over where people will have to wear face coverings when new rules come into force. They will be compulsory in shops in England from Friday - but full guidance is yet to be published. Trade bodies and opposition MPs said confusion remained over takeaways. Minister Brandon Lewis said face coverings would be mandatory when purchasing takeaway food and drink, but not if you are eating at the premises. ""If you are going into a takeaway and you are eating in somewhere that's got a takeaway, then that is like hospitality. You are eating - it's not practical to wear a face mask, we recognise that,"" the Northern Ireland Secretary told BBC Breakfast. ""But if you are going in to buy a product and leaving again, then you are treating it like a shop and you should be wearing a face mask."" A Department of Health spokesman said: ""If a shop or supermarket has a cafe or a seating area to eat and drink, you can remove your face covering in that area."" Shops or trains - where do I need to cover my face? Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask How to make your own face mask However, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said this contradicted what the industry had previously been told by the government and it was ""very late in the day"" for this to be confirmed. ""It's really unhelpful to have that confusion because the single biggest thing we need now is to rebuild consumer confidence and that needs clear, unambiguous messaging,"" she told BBC Breakfast. The new regulations will only be published on Thursday, less than 24 hours before they come into effect. The criticism came after Mr Hancock and Boris Johnson's official spokesman contradicted each other over the rules on takeaways and sandwich shops. The health secretary said last week: ""You do need to wear a face mask in Pret because Pret is a shop. If there's table service, it is not necessary to have a mask. But in any shop, you do need a mask. So, if you're going up to the counter in Pret to buy takeaway that is a shop."" But the prime minister's spokesman later said: ""We will be publishing the full guidance shortly but my understanding is that it wouldn't be mandatory if you went in, for example, to a sandwich shop in order to get a takeaway to wear a face covering."" This video can not be played How to wear a face covering Face coverings have been compulsory in shops in Scotland since 10 July. Shoppers are not currently required to wear them in Wales or Northern Ireland,although this is being considered. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced on 14 July that wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets would be compulsory from Friday, 24 July, with anyone failing to comply facing a fine of up to Â£100. The same exemptions as for public transport will apply, with children under 11 and people with breathing problems not required to wear a covering. Anyone who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment or disability is also exempt. The Police Federation, which represents front-line officers, says they can't spend their time patrolling thousands upon thousands of outlets. Shop staff and security guards can already detain shoplifters while waiting for the police to arrive. However, the general power of the citizen's arrest is only exercisable to apprehend criminals committing offences that would go before a judge and jury. A penalty ticket for being socially obnoxious would not cross that high bar. Police leaders hope shop managers will refuse non-mask wearers entry - rather than turning to the police to solve the problem. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said that police in London would only enforce the wearing of coverings in shops ""as a last resort"" - if people not wearing a covering refused to leave a shop or became ""aggressive"". Read more here. Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Munira Wilson called for urgent clarity for businesses and to help people feel safe. ""Clear communication is critical in a public health crisis. Instead, this confusion on guidance shows ministers simply could not organise a bun fight in a bakery,"" she told the PA news agency. ""All this stinks of ministers making it up as they go along instead of listening to the experts."" Tracy Cannard, who works in a supermarket and is a representative of the shopworkers' union USDAW, said while increasing numbers of customers were choosing to wear masks this still only amounted to around 20% and making it compulsory would help her feel safer. James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said the body was advising its members to communicate advice on face coverings through posters and informal conversations rather than challenging customers who did not wear one.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson defends UK union on a visit to Scotland The response to the coronavirus pandemic has shown the ""sheer might"" of the UK union, Boris Johnson has said during a visit to Scotland. Mr Johnson was in Orkney and the north of Scotland one year on from the day he took office as prime minister. He said the work of the military and Treasury job retention schemes had proved the ""merits of the union"". But the SNP said the visit showed Mr Johnson was ""in a panic"" about rising support for Scottish independence. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon did not meet Mr Johnson during the trip but said she would continue to work with his government on the ""immediate priority"" of tackling coronavirus. Follow updates on Boris Johnson's visit to Scotland What's Boris Johnson worried about in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon said she did not think anyone should be ""championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives"" to make a constitutional argument. Mr Johnson said he ""pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the United Kingdom"" when he entered Downing Street one year ago, adding that the response to the pandemic had shown his government's commitment to the whole of the UK. The UK government has coordinated much of the country's economic response to the virus, including the coronavirus job retention furlough scheme. But devolved governments have had control over most public health measures and have been able to set more local timetables and messaging. Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""always happy to meet the prime minister"" Although the whole of the UK entered lockdown in the same week, each constituent part has eased restrictions at a different rate. Phase 3 of Scotland's""route map"" out of lockdownbegan last week, as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and barbers were allowed to reopen. They were allowed to reopen in England slightly earlier on 4 July, along with holiday accommodation - including hotels, B&Bs, cottages, campsites and caravan parks. Boris Johnson must have found recent opinion polls conducted in Scotland to be awkward reading. Surveys suggesting rising support for Scottish independence and a significant gap between his approval ratings and those of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, appear to have prompted him to make his first visit to Scotland since last year's general election. The prime minister wants to use the trip to remind people in Scotland just how much cash the UK treasury has spent in response to the coronavirus crisis. He is stressing that it is the Westminster government that has supported 900,000 people who might have otherwise lost their jobs and produced billions of pounds in extra spending for the NHS. The SNP don't look too worried about a prime ministerial trip denting support for their cause. On her 50th birthday, on Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that a visit for Boris was the best birthday pressie she could hope for. Every time the PM tells voters that it is only as part of the UK that Scottish businesses and public services could afford to cope with the pandemic, the SNP will reply that they are sick of being told that Scotland is ""too wee, too poor and too stupid"" to be independent. Read more from Sarah Smith Speaking in Orkney, where he met local fishermen, Mr Johnson said the ""merits of the union"" had been ""proved throughout this crisis"", citing the work of the military and the Treasury's support for workers and firms. The UK government says the furlough and self-employment schemeshave supported 900,000 jobs in Scotland, and that Â£4.6bn of additional funding was being provided to the Scottish government. The prime minister also said not enough time had passed for another independence referendum to be held, saying the 2014 vote wasa ""once in a generation"" event. He said: ""What I'm saying is that the union is a fantastically strong institution. It's helped our country through thick and thin. ""It's very, very valuable in terms of the support we've been able to give to everybody throughout all corners of the UK, and we had a referendum on breaking up the union a few years ago - I think only six years ago. That is not a generation by any computation and I think what people really want to do is see our whole country coming back strongly together, and that's what we're going to do."" Ms Sturgeontweeted,externalthat the prime minister's visit to Scotland ""highlighted the argument for Scottish independence"". However she said politicians should remain focused on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and ""not use it as a political weapon"". At her coronavirus briefing on Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""worked very hard to have a collaborative approach to the other governments of the UK"". She said financial support from the Treasury was ""very welcome"", but said it should be clear that ""this is borrowed money"" which would have to be repaid by Scottish taxpayers too - ""it's not some kind of favour that has been done"". The first minister said UK-wide actions by Mr Johnson's administration were a reflection of where powers lie, saying that ""if we held the powers we would be doing these things ourselves"". She added: ""I just don't think any of us should be championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political cases we want to make. ""This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we are not out of yet. Too many people people have died and all of us have a really solemn responsibility to focus on and get our countries through, and that's what I'm going to continue to do. ""Campaigning right now is not my priority. Boris Johnson has every right to be on a campaign visit but in his shoes it's not what I would do."" Mr Johnson was greeted by a small group of protestors during his visit to Orkney Mr Johnson also announced Â£50m of funding from the UK government for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles - the latest in a series of ""city and region deals"" which see Scottish and UK ministers each pledge cash to various areas for spending on new infrastructure and local development schemes. The Scottish government has also committed Â£50mto the ""Islands growth deal"", which will target sectors including tourism, energy and skills. The timing of Mr Johnson's visit comes amid a ""perfect storm"" over Scottish independence, according to Sir Tom Devine, an emeritus professor of Scottish history at Edinburgh University. Sir Tom told BBC Two's Newsnight the union is in its most fragile condition since 1745, and that opinion polling suggesting increasing support for independence in Scotland has been consistent for some time. Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt added that a senior SNP source had told him they believed the party's moment ""is at last arriving"". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mr Johnson was visiting due to recent polls suggesting support for independence was on the rise. Mr Blackford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister's message would go down ""particularly badly"" in Scotland. ""I think what we've demonstrated over the course of the last few months [is] that in the areas of devolved responsibility, in the areas of public health, the leadership that's been shown by our first minister is in sharp contrast to the bluster that we've seen from Boris Johnson,"" he said.

"Could a new pro-independence party make the difference in the campaign for indyref2? A series of SNP and pro-independence campaigners have suggested setting up a new party ahead of the Holyrood elections in 2021. Why are they doing this, and are they more likely to split the nationalist vote or secure a mandate for a new referendum? The SNP continues to enjoy a dominant position in Scottish politics, withpolls suggesting,externalthe party will continue its electoral winning streak in 2021. So it might seem odd to many outside the political bubble that supporters of the party - including one of its own MPs - are advocating voting for someone else at that election. The answer lies in the Holyrood electoral system, which makes it hard for one party to win an outright majority of seats. The ""additional member system"" features 73 constituency seats, elected on a traditional first past the post (FPTP) basis, and 56 ""list"" seats scattered across eight regions. The way the system actually works is complex, but the goal is simple - proportional representation. In short, the more constituency seats you win, the harder it is to win list seats. Counting up the votes in an Additional Member System election can prove complicated To take2016's electionas a case study, half a million people voted for Labour in constituency contests, but thanks to the all-or-nothing nature of FPTP this yielded only three MSPs. So 22% of the vote won 4% of the seats. However, the party's 435,000 votes on the list ballot saw them pick up a further 21 seats - meaning that overall, they got roughly a fifth of the votes in the country, and roughly a fifth of the seats at Holyrood. At the other end of the spectrum, in the constituency contest the SNP won 46.5% of the vote, and 80% of the seats (59 of them). This meant that on the list, almost a million votes only produced four regional MSPs. The additional member system balanced things out as it is designed to do - with just under half of the vote, the SNP got just under half the seats on offer overall. To come to the point, some supporters of independence conclude that it would be much easier to win a Holyrood majority if there was a list-only party which could sweep up the regional seats which the SNP may struggle to reach. Proponents argue that a new list party could produce extra pro-independence MSPs - at the expense of unionists The argument is that if the million people who voted SNP on the list in 2016 had backed another party, in theory they could have returned dozens of pro-independence MSPs instead of four. If this party were to stand only on the list, they would not have any constituency seats to hold them back as far as the formulas are concerned. The SNP could take the constituency vote, the new party would clean up on the list and the two would add up to an overwhelming mandate for indyref2 - or so the theory goes. But what is this ""new party""? A number of different vehicles have been suggested, from the ""Independence for Scotland Party"" to one led by Wings Over Scotland blogger Stuart Campbell - who has in turn suggested former SNP leader Alex Salmond could set up his own group. The latest is the ""Alliance for Independence"" proposed by former SNP MSP Dave Thompson, which he envisions as an umbrella group uniting smaller pro-independence campaigns. Proponents believe this would be more productive than the ""both votes SNP"" approach of previous years, which Mr Thompson - a 55-year veteran of the party - says ""will achieve nothing"". This approach has been endorsed by figures including sitting SNP MP Kenny Macaskill, who said: ""With success on the constituency basis resulting in limited progress on the list, 'both votes SNP' just doesn't work."" The SNP is unlikely to stray from its ""both votes SNP"" strategy Perhaps unsurprisingly for a political party, the SNP is loathe to urge people to vote for anyone else. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he ""can't understand the logic"" of a list-only party, citing the precedent of the SNP majority in 2011 successfully triggering a referendum. The last thing the party's leaders want to be is complacent. They cannot simply assume they will walk away with the lion's share of constituency contests - indeed, taking elections for granted is a very good way to lose them. So if the party were to lose a constituency seat, say in Glasgow, they would want to give themselves the best chance possible of picking it up again on the regional ballot by stacking up as many list votes as possible. They will be decidedly wary about splitting the vote. One advantage the SNP have long had over their unionist opponents is that in a country divided pretty evenly down the middle on the constitutional question, they have a near monopoly over one half of the vote - while the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems have to scrap over the other half. Another issue for them is messaging. ""Vote SNP"" is an easy slogan to paint on the side of a bus. ""Vote SNP on one bit of paper and a pro-independence alternative of your choosing on the other"" is slightly less pithy. Other pro-independence parties have contested the Holyrood list in previous years The Scottish Greens would point out that they are quite a prominent pro-independence party that chiefly does well on the regional list. But other smaller outfits have also come forward at previous elections - and failed to make any impact at all. In 2016, RISE contested the regional lists, with a former SNP MSP on their ticket, but ultimately polled fewer votes than the Scottish Christian Party. Solidarity - Tommy Sheridan's breakaway from the Scottish Socialist Party - did a little better, but still only managed 0.6% of the vote and zero seats. There is an argument that a figurehead like Alex Salmond (who, to be clear, has said nothing at all on the subject) and a platform focused solely on independence could see a new party make a bigger impact - but if the SNP actively oppose the idea, that impact could be in splitting the vote. The pro-independence side are not alone in debating whether they should try to game the list system, incidentally - George Galloway is attempting to set up an ""Alliance for Unity"" that sounds a lot like a unionist version of Mr Thompson's umbrella project. The next Holyrood election is due in May 2021 This is the million-dollar question, and the hardest one to answer. The majority of 2011 will be much cited in this debate, but it is actually something of an outlier. In that election, the SNP broke the system - they took 53% of the seats at Holyrood despite ""only"" winning 45.4% of the constituency vote and 44% of the regional one. It happened essentially by fluke - the stars aligned for the party in just the right way, with the placing of the 53 constituencies won around the country somehow still allowing the party to pick up 16 list MSPs. There isn't really a way to strategise for that to happen again in the same way - it is by no means a blueprint for victory in 2021. The only way to be sure of a majority at Holyrood is to literally win a majority of the votes cast in Scotland. That is a tall order for one party alone. The SNP's landslide in the 2015 Westminster election saw them hit 50% of the vote, but in December they were back at 45% - a familiar figure to any Yes voter. Would having two of Scotland's most formidable campaigners in opposing camps be helpful to their cause? The paradox is that, if it had the open support of the SNP, a list-only party could provide a theoretical route to producing a larger cohort of pro-independence MSPs. But at the same time, it is difficult for the SNP to support it without risking their own position. It would be a move fraught with complexity and danger, and Nicola Sturgeon is not exactly known as a gambler. And when it came to the campaign, would any new party really exist harmoniously alongside the SNP, which has become an electoral juggernaut partly by dint of its unity of purpose? Imagine Mr Salmond did end up fronting a new party - would a Salmond vs Sturgeon debate really be beneficial to the cause both politicians champion, or would it exacerbate tensions about the current first minister's cautious approach to indyref2? There are also wider questions over whether a pro-independence majority spread across several parties has the same impact as it does when a single party wins a thumping mandate. After all there is currently a pro-independence majority at Holyrood, with the Greens backing the SNP - which has conspicuously failed to produce a referendum, despite MSPsvoting in favour of one several times. The debate underlines one thing - despite coronavirus continuing to dominate the agenda, Scotland is less than a year away from an election. More and more, party politics is coming out of lockdown.

"Improvements are being promised on congested sections of the route near Leeds Long-awaited improvements to rail services in the north of England will get a Â£589m kick-start, the government has announced. Most of it will go on electrifying the line between Manchester and Leeds, the Department for Transport (DfT) said. The Transpennine route upgrade was first announced in 2011 and a modified Â£2.9bn schemewas confirmed in 2019. A new body to speed up transport investment across the north is also being set up, the DfT added. The improvements include electrification and a doubling of the number of tracks on the most congested sections around Leeds and Huddersfield, allowing faster trains to overtake slower ones. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the additional funding was a ""welcome sign of intent"" from the government. Transport Secretary and Northern Powerhouse Minister Grant Shapps said people in the north ""rightly expect action, progress and ambition"". ""This government is determined to accelerate improvements as we invest billions to level up the region's infrastructure,"" he added. The upgrade will increase capacity and cut journey times He said full electrification, improved digital signalling and doubling of tracks elsewhere on the line were under consideration as part of an Integrated Rail Plan. This would allow all-electric services between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, York and Newcastle, offering increased service frequency and capacity. ""The north has long argued for the existing scheme to be upgraded to bring the full range of passenger and freight benefits and we are glad that the government has listened to this,"" Mr Burnham said. However Diana Johnson, Labour MP for Hull North, said she was concerned there was no mention of rail connections to Hull. ""I think the government and the Northern Powerhouse are missing a massive trick by not making sure that we are included and at the heart of plans around investment in rail infrastructure,"" she said. ""We have one of the biggest port complexes in the country and yet we can't get our rail lines upgraded."" Mr Shapps said the Humber region had not been forgotten and he was focusing on every part of the region. ""I've been speaking to leaders across the north and we're finding out exactly what the concerns are and I am very familiar with what the concerns are in the Humber region and we're going to deliver on them."" Four TransPennine train stations set for revamp PM pledges new northern high-speed rail route Minister 'reneging' on rail electrification Passenger group Transport Focus said the government must keep travellers informed about what disruption caused by the upgrade work would mean for rail users and their journeys. ""How this work is managed over the coming years will be key to passengers' trust in the rail industry,"" the group's director David Sidebottom said. Mr Shapps said the new Northern Transport Acceleration Council would hold its first meeting in September. ""This new council will allow us to engage collectively and directly with elected northern leaders to build the vital projects the region is crying out for,"" he said. Mr Burnham welcomed the new body, saying it felt like a ""gear change"" from the government in delivering transport improvements in the north.

National plan for helping Scotland's islands 'Revival' of islands populations 'Historic' islands bill passed by MSPs Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland local authorities have been campaigning since 2013 for greater support for their communities. In response, the Scottish government produced the Islands Bill and National Islands Plan. Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Secretary Michael Matheson said money from the growth deal would be used to improve the quality of life in island communities over the next 10 years. He said: ""This significant investment will support islanders' ambitions to create world-class visitor destinations, lead the way to a low carbon future, support growth and future industries."" Mr Matheson said it would also help communities to attract and retain younger people. In the Western Isles, the local authority has long been trying find ways to encourage young islanders to stay rather than move away to live and work.

The proportion of people receiving their Covid-19 result within 24 hours of being tested at a regional site or mobile testing unit - a so-called ""in-person"" test - has fallen for the second week in a row. Some 71.4% of people received the result within 24 hours in the week ending 15 July, down from 87.7% in the week to 8 July and 90.7% in the week to 1 July. Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month pledged to get the results of all in-person tests back within 24 hours by the end of June. He told the House of Commons on 3 June he would get ""all tests turned around within 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that"".

"This video can not be played Leeds United players celebrate on a bus outside Elland Road. Leeds United have defended the decision to parade the Championship trophy from an open-top bus in front of fans after previously telling people to stay away. Thousands were at the club's ground on Wednesday night to celebrate its return to the top flight. Four people were arrested for public order offences. Officials had urged fans to stay away but the team made a brief appearance after the4-0 win over Charlton. One fan group described the move as ""a dreadful own goal"" by the club. Hundreds of Leeds fans gathered at Elland Road to celebrate the club lifting the Championship trophy The club's chief executive had earlier urged them to stay home, saying they would ""celebrate when the time was right"" Chief executive Angus Kinnear had urged fans to stay away from the game, saying when the time was right ""we will celebrate in style"". But in a later statement the club said: ""Following consultation with the Safety Advisory Group and council, Leeds United arranged for a bus to be parked outside the East Stand reception as a contingency to assist dispersal should a crowd congregate at Elland Road, despite a month-long campaign from the club and supporter groups to encourage supporters to stay at home. ""The safety group believed that a brief appearance from the players with the Championship trophy would help to signal an end to proceedings, encouraging fans to head home safely. ""In challenging circumstances, fan safety has always been our priority."" Fans cheered the team from outside the ground as they beat Charlton 4-0 Supt Jackie Marsh from West Yorkshire Police said four people had been arrested for public order offences and one officer received a minor injury but did not require hospital treatment. ""While most of those who gathered did so with good intentions, there were some missiles thrown which resulted in officers having to wear protective equipment,"" she said. People of all ages came along to mark the occasion Flares were set off as fans celebrated The Leeds United Supporters' Trust called on the club to apologise to those fans who heeded its original advice to stay at home. The trust said: ""We have received many messages from members outlining their anger, frustration and disappointment at being asked to stay at home and then missing out on the events that unfolded at the ground. ""We completely understand that frustration. We also empathise with those that made a personal decision to attend the ground last night to feel part of a shared moment. ""We do, however, feel that the use of such a potent symbol of celebration, the open-top bus, was a dreadful own goal by the club"". The trust said the presence of the open-top bus begged the question of whether the club's intention was to secure ""powerful video footage"" rather than anything safety-related in respect of the fans. Leeds City Council and West Yorkshire Police had also urged fans to stay away over concerns about coronavirus. In a statement, the council confirmed it was aware of the plan, but claimed the measures were ""effective"", as fans left ""within 40 minutes"" of the event finishing. A spokesperson toldthe Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""All parties involved recognise the difficulties around this decision, which was made only as a method of ensuring the fans dispersed if significant numbers gathered, and would wish to thank all those fans who adhered to the requests to stay safe and stay away."" As it happened: Leeds United fans celebrate promotion to the Premier League. That came after supporters gathered outside the ground on Friday to celebrate the club's return to the Premier League for the first time in 16 years. On Sunday, about 7,000 fans packed the city's Millennium Square. Thousands of fans left piles of rubbish after they celebrated promotion to the Premier League A number of fans arrived at the ground on Thursday morning to help in the clean up operation after piles of litter were left behind. One supporter, Chris, said: ""It's nice to just come down and do my bit really."" ""By the time we'd got here, the council had cleared most of it already. They've done a cracking job, full credit to them."" Chris and other fans helped to clean up litter at Elland Road Leeds United fans gather for trophy presentation Leeds United chief urges fans to stay home for trophy-lift Police officers injured as Leeds fans celebrate In contrast to the scenes outside the ground, the trophy was presented inside an almost empty stadium.

"Boris Johnson claims the UK's response to the pandemic shows the ""sheer might"" of the Union During a visit to Orkney the prime minister said he wanted to show that the Union could cope with the ""economic consequences"" of coronavirus First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says that from tomorrow those who have been shielding in Scotland can go to pubs, restaurants and use public transport In response to questions on the PM's visit, Ms Sturgeon says she will take the best decisions for Scotland and ""will not be influenced by politics or constitutional arguments"" For a full week, Scotland has recorded no new deaths, as a result of a positive test Education Secretary John Swinney says Â£50m of funding will be ring-fenced for 850 new teachers and 200 support staff in schools. BBC Scotland News As we conclude our live coverage this Thursday, 23 July, here is a reminder of today's headlines. Boris Johnson spent time in Orkney on Thursday People working from home have been eating more ice cream but neglecting their grooming habits, consumer goods giant Unilever has suggested. The firm said ice cream sales leapt 26% in the three months to June, but demand for shampoo and deodorant fell. It said it had seen strong ""growth in home consumption of foods, ice cream and tea"" during lockdown. But there had been ""fewer personal care occasions from going to work or socialising"".

Top runners like Haile Gebrselassie (left) have taken part in the Glasgow event The Covid-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of this year's Great Scottish Run, which was scheduled for Sunday, 4 October. The event, which attracts international competitors as well as charity runners, has been held every year round the streets of Glasgow since 1991. Last year's male and female half-marathons were won by Uganda's Timothy Toroitich and Kenya's Edith Chelimo. Organisers said,externalthere was ""no option"" to stage the event any time in 2020. Competitors can roll over their entry to next year's Great Scottish Run, provisionally scheduled for 3 October 2021, or receive a refund. Primary school pupils will not be required to maintain physical distancing, but secondaries will be asked to do so ""where possible"" The Scottish government has ring-fenced funding for 850 new teachers and 200 support staff to help schools build towards reopening on 11 August. Education Secretary John Swinney said pupils would need extra support when they return to classes after lockdown. And he said ministers would decide whether it was safe to go ahead with the plans on 29 July. Guidance is being drawn up on ""extra precautions"" to be put in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Readmore here. Swab tests are used to look for the presence of the virus A network of coronavirus-testing walk-in centres is to be set up across England in an attempt to persuade more people to come forward for testing. Several hundred walk-in units will be up and running by the end of October, in time for winter, when there is concern cases could start to rise. They will complement the existing drive-through centres, mobile testing units and home-ordering service. It comes amid concern people are still not coming forward for testing. Readmore here. BBC Radio Scotland Some pupils have returned to school in England The Scottish government is ""making up plans at the last minute"" to reopen schools from 11 August, according to Scottish Labour's education spokesman Iain Gray. John Swinney gave MSPs anupdate on progress earlier,but no final confirmation will arrive until next Thursday, 30 July. âSchools are due to open in just over two weeks yet we still have no final decision, councils still donât actually have the additional resources they need and guidance on risk mitigation is still being written,"" Mr Gray told BBC Radio Scotland. The government has never had a route map for the return of schools and they still donât. They look as though they are making this up at the last minute."" Iain Gray MSP The additional teachers referred to by Mr Swinney today ""amount to less than half a staff member per school, and councils have two weeks left to try to recruit them,â Mr Gray added. The Conservativesâ education spokesman, Jamie Green, also called on Mr Swinney to end the uncertainty, saying the balance of evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of schools reopening. Sir James Dyson pictured outside Dyson HQ in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, in 2016 Dyson iscutting 600 jobs in the UK and a further 300 worldwideas the coronavirus impact speeds up the company's restructuring plans. The firm, best known for the invention of the bag-less vacuum cleaner, said the pandemic was changing consumer habits as more people shopped online. Founded by inventor Sir James Dyson, it has a global workforce of 14,000, with 4,000 in the UK, but most of its products are manufactured in Asia. Most of the jobs will be lost in retail and customer service roles. Earlier this year the company joined the fight to produce medical ventilators for the NHS, amid fears it would be overwhelmed by coronavirus. But Sir James later told employees these were no longer needed. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Ian Cairns receives regular
treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and says he is ""quite excited"" but a ""wee bit apprehensive"" about the changes that will see a pause to shielding guidelines from 1 August. ""Twenty weeks locked up is hard to take,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. ""I had six months chemo last year but this feels
a lot worse. ""I havenât seen my two grandchildren for four months, Iâm missing my friends and I
need to push myself to go out and do things."" Mr Cairns welcomed the Scottish government's plan to develop a Covid forecasting scheme for each local area. ""The more information we have, the better informed we are to make decisions,"" he adds. Vivien Yu takes immune suppressants
for a skin condition, and is looking forward to returning to work in a ""Covid-secure workplace"" at a pharmacy. ""It is going to be quite strange,"" she says. ""I do love hugging people so it'll be really hard to stop yourself giving friends a hug, like you normally would before this
all happened."" If you are just joining us here's a reminder of the main points from today's Scottish government coronavirus briefing: People in Scotland considered to be at the greatest risk of Covid-19 will be able to go to pubs and restaurants with outdoor spaces from Friday. Nicola Sturgeon said people shielding could also meet indoors with maximum of eight people from up to two households if physical distancing was maintained. Visits to indoors shops or the hairdresser and using public transport will be allowed as well. The changes come ahead of a ""pause"" in shielding guidelines from 1 August. Giving her daily coronavirus briefing, the first minister acknowledged the ""painful journey"" of those in the shielding category over the past four months of lockdown. Chairman Dave Cormack says the club's position had become ""unsustainable"" Aberdeen Football Club have announced Â£1m of pay cuts to help plug a Â£10m shortfall due to the coronavirus pandemic. Staff earning over Â£30,000 per year have agreed to take reductions averaging 20%. The club say the deal will close a ""widening funding gap"" caused by being unable to start the new campaign in front of fans. ""Our situation was becoming unsustainable,"" said chairman Dave Cormack. Readmore here.

It's four months exactly since Scotland went into lockdown, and in the past 15 days there has been just one death of a person who tested positive for Covid-19. Drivetime will be looking at where we are with the virus - as well as reaction to the latest news for people shieldng. As the prime minister visits Scotland today in an effort to strengthen support for the union, the programme will also hear from one of Scotland's leading historians, Sir Tom Devine. Scotland's largest teachers' union has welcomed the Scottish government's announcement of ring-fencedfunding for 850 new teachers and 200 support staff. But the EIS says more must still be done ahead of schools reopening on 11 August. The union's general secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""Clearly, with less than three weeks until schools are set to
reopen, it is vital that local authorities act quickly to ensure that the
promised additional teachers and support staff are recruited prior to the start
of term. ""It also remains essential that the process of reopening schools is
managed safely, with updated risk assessments to be carried out and all
necessary mitigations â such as enhanced cleaning regimens, adequate ventilation
and facilities for regular hand-washing â to be in place in all schools prior
to them reopening.â An Edinburgh businessman who took the Scottish government to court over coronavirus grants has failed in his bid to have reductions overturned. Jon Sharp owns six coffee shops in the city and argued that a 25% reduction to the grants for five of the properties applied from 8 June under the Scottish government grants scheme was ""unlawful"". Mr Sharp argued he had ""a legitimate expectation that a full 100% grant would be paid in respect of all six of his properties"" and suggested ""the decision of the Scottish ministers to restrict the amount of the grant payable in respect of second and subsequent properties is irrational"". But Judge Lord Fairley refused the petition for judicial review, saying Mr Sharp ""did not have such a legitimate expectation"", further saying it was ""not necessary"" to pass judgement on an ""abuse of power"". The Scottish government has apologised for giving out the wrong advice on when funfairs could reopen. Operators were originally told they would  be able to start up from the 15 of July - but days later were told to close again. Codona's Amusement Park in Aberdeen said it was ""astounded"" at the move which could jeopardise 180 jobs. Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said it was ""unfortunate and regrettable"" that conflicting advice had been given out. She said that at one point, funfairs may have been considered as visitor attractions but added that the regulations had a clear definition for funfairs. ""We will move to reopen Scotland's funfairs when it is safe to do so,"" she said. Read more.  A final decision on schools reopening will be announced next Thursday, 30 July, John Swinney confirms. Plans for blended
learning remain an ""essential contingency"" that could be applied at a local, regional or national level in future if required, says the education secretary. Each school will train
additional teachers to provide online provision across a range of subjects. Mr Swinney concludes his statement to the Scottish Parliament by returning to the ""moral and educational imperative"" of getting pupils back in school. ""They have suffered during
lockdown and the government and our partners are focused on putting in
place the opportunity to access school to support their wellbeing and develop their
potential. That drive must lie at the heart of all we do,â he adds. Of the Â£100m announced in June to tackle additional costs for schools, Â£50m will be specifically ring-fenced for the recruitment of additional
teachers and support staff for the next academic year, says John Swinney. Final numbers will be dependent on the precise mix of staff, but the education secretary expects 850 extra teachers to be recruited, while local authorities will be able to bring in about 200 support staff
across Scotland. ""I do not under-estimate the logistical challenge of reopening our
schools safely,"" he says. A further Â£20m will be allocated to local authorities to address additional requirements
such as extra cleaning or capacity constraints on school transport. The government will also make a further Â£3m
investment in youth work to support education recovery, he adds. Around 92% of UK firms were trading in the two weeks to 12 July as more opened their doors to customers on the easing of lockdown restrictions, new figures show. The proportion of active firms jumped from 86% in the first two weeks of June, as the economy got a boost from the reopening of non-essential shops and hospitality venues, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Firms currently trading said 7% of their total workforce had returned from furlough in the past two weeks and another 6% are expected to return in the next two weeks. Guitar sales is one area that has seen a boostfrom the lockdown with a surge in amateur musicians and podcasters, says Gear4Music, the UK's biggest online retailer of instruments and sound equipment. In the April-to-June period, it said the value of UK sales rose 80% on the same time last year to Â£21.2m. And Unilever said it had seenice cream sales soarwhile demand for personal hygiene items had fallen. Mr Swinney reiterates that advice on reopening schools remains conditional on
continued low rates of infection, effective surveillance and a process for
handling any local outbreaks The Scottish government is working to provide guidance by
31 July that will enable schools to reopen in August, he says. A final decision will be
taken by Cabinet next Wednesday, 29 July, and set out
to parliament next Thursday. The guidance has been developed
in partnership with local government, teachers' unions parent
representatives and other public health officials, says the education secretary. This should provide staff, pupils and parents with the reassurance they need, as it is important they all understand the
changes required, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.92854834
"More than 40,000 calls and contacts were made to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline during the first three months of lockdown, most by women seeking help, new figures show. In June, calls and contacts were nearly 80% higher than usual, says the charity Refuge, which runs the helpline. And as restrictions ease, there is a surge in women seeking refuge places to escape their abusers, the charity says. The government says it prioritised help for domestic-abuse victims in lockdown. In a statement, the Home Office said it had recognised early on the risks of a nationwide lockdown for victims of domestic abuse and focused on ensuring vital support services remained available. ""From our ground-breaking legislation in the Domestic Abuse Bill, to additional financial support and regular engagement with charities throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the government remains resolute in combating this vile crime,"" said the Minister for Safeguarding, Victoria Atkins. Hundreds more calls to domestic abuse helpline 'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser' As well as a near doubling in the number of women contacting the helpline, Refuge says, the figures also show more needing to flee their abusers. ""We've seen in the last couple of weeks an increase of 54% of women wanting to access emergency accommodation,"" spokeswoman, Lisa King said. Tanya was among those who fled her abusive husband during the lockdown. ""When we were on lockdown, things became much worse,"" she says. ""Before, he was drinking only in the early hours of the evening. ""Then, when Covid happened, he started drinking in the early hours of the morning. Lockdown has cut off escape routes such as the school run ""And he started getting very aggressive. ""When he was hitting me, mentally it was affecting me more. ""He pulled my hair. ""He threw me against a wall. ""I thought, 'That's it.' ""'I need to end this.'"" Meanwhile, Claire, separated from her ex-partner, continues to receive support from Refuge, as the lockdown has meant fresh emotional abuse in that he has breached custody arrangements - at one point, refusing to hand back their young daughter. With no court hearing in sight, because of the pandemic, Claire says she feels powerless. ""It's like I am in lockdown with him,"" she says. ""It's difficult to feel like I'm handing over my daughter, knowing that potentially I might not get her back."" Too frightened As well as calling Refuge, women have sought help online. During the lockdown the charity set up a live chat service, allowing women too frightened to make a call to tap in and describe in message form what they were going through. The National Domestic Abuse Helpline can be contacted online as well as by phone ""We've been able to talk to women even when their perpetrators are at home with them,"" one support worker said. ""It can be easier to grab 10 minutes in the bathroom on your phone, doing something that is silent."" The helpline deals with complaints from women only. Men reporting abuse are directed to other specialist services. The Men's Advice Line says it received nearly 8,500 calls over the first three months of the lockdown, significantly higher than during the same period last year. During the lockdown, the government announced about Â£30m in extra funding. But Refuge and other charities say as restrictions ease, a longer-term funding strategy is needed. The lockdown proved particularly difficult for migrant women, who are frequently not entitled to financial help from the state, according to the charity Southall Black Sisters. ""As we come out of the lockdown, we are afraid that we are going to see a surge in demand, particularly migrant women with no recourse to public funds,"" director Pragna Patel says. ""They would have been the ones feeling most entrapped in situations of abuse because they would have thought, 'There's nowhere for me to go. ""'I have no money.'"" Tanya found herself in exactly this position when she left her husband with Â£4 in her pocket before going to Southall Black Sisters for help. ""If I had stayed in that house, I don't know whether I would be here today,"" she says. ""I was in a situation where I wanted to finish my life completely. Ms Patel said the Domestic Abuse Bill, currently going through Parliament, had failed to address the plight of women such as Tanya, unable to access state help. Pragna Patel is director of Southall Black Sisters ""Women have put up with really coercive controlling environments, particularly Asian women who live in households with multiple members of a family, which can often translate into multiple perpetrators of abuse,"" she said. ""We had a case just two weeks ago of a woman who took her own life because she felt that was the only way out of the abuse."" The Home Office said it had committed Â£1.5m ""to pilot work later this year to better understand needs in this area"". It urged anyone in immediate danger and fearing for their life to contact the police.

"Minister Michael Gove was seen wearing a face mask when buying takeaway food on Tuesday, after being photographed not wearing one the previous week The government has been accused of mixed messaging over where people will have to wear face coverings when new rules come into force. They will be compulsory in shops in England from Friday - but full guidance is yet to be published. Trade bodies and opposition MPs said confusion remained over takeaways. Minister Brandon Lewis said face coverings would be mandatory when purchasing takeaway food and drink, but not if you are eating at the premises. ""If you are going into a takeaway and you are eating in somewhere that's got a takeaway, then that is like hospitality. You are eating - it's not practical to wear a face mask, we recognise that,"" the Northern Ireland Secretary told BBC Breakfast. ""But if you are going in to buy a product and leaving again, then you are treating it like a shop and you should be wearing a face mask."" A Department of Health spokesman said: ""If a shop or supermarket has a cafe or a seating area to eat and drink, you can remove your face covering in that area."" Shops or trains - where do I need to cover my face? Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask How to make your own face mask However, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said this contradicted what the industry had previously been told by the government and it was ""very late in the day"" for this to be confirmed. ""It's really unhelpful to have that confusion because the single biggest thing we need now is to rebuild consumer confidence and that needs clear, unambiguous messaging,"" she told BBC Breakfast. The new regulations will only be published on Thursday, less than 24 hours before they come into effect. The criticism came after Mr Hancock and Boris Johnson's official spokesman contradicted each other over the rules on takeaways and sandwich shops. The health secretary said last week: ""You do need to wear a face mask in Pret because Pret is a shop. If there's table service, it is not necessary to have a mask. But in any shop, you do need a mask. So, if you're going up to the counter in Pret to buy takeaway that is a shop."" But the prime minister's spokesman later said: ""We will be publishing the full guidance shortly but my understanding is that it wouldn't be mandatory if you went in, for example, to a sandwich shop in order to get a takeaway to wear a face covering."" This video can not be played How to wear a face covering Face coverings have been compulsory in shops in Scotland since 10 July. Shoppers are not currently required to wear them in Wales or Northern Ireland,although this is being considered. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced on 14 July that wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets would be compulsory from Friday, 24 July, with anyone failing to comply facing a fine of up to Â£100. The same exemptions as for public transport will apply, with children under 11 and people with breathing problems not required to wear a covering. Anyone who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment or disability is also exempt. The Police Federation, which represents front-line officers, says they can't spend their time patrolling thousands upon thousands of outlets. Shop staff and security guards can already detain shoplifters while waiting for the police to arrive. However, the general power of the citizen's arrest is only exercisable to apprehend criminals committing offences that would go before a judge and jury. A penalty ticket for being socially obnoxious would not cross that high bar. Police leaders hope shop managers will refuse non-mask wearers entry - rather than turning to the police to solve the problem. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said that police in London would only enforce the wearing of coverings in shops ""as a last resort"" - if people not wearing a covering refused to leave a shop or became ""aggressive"". Read more here. Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Munira Wilson called for urgent clarity for businesses and to help people feel safe. ""Clear communication is critical in a public health crisis. Instead, this confusion on guidance shows ministers simply could not organise a bun fight in a bakery,"" she told the PA news agency. ""All this stinks of ministers making it up as they go along instead of listening to the experts."" Tracy Cannard, who works in a supermarket and is a representative of the shopworkers' union USDAW, said while increasing numbers of customers were choosing to wear masks this still only amounted to around 20% and making it compulsory would help her feel safer. James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said the body was advising its members to communicate advice on face coverings through posters and informal conversations rather than challenging customers who did not wear one. He said incidents of verbal and physical abuse of shop workers had increased during lockdown and retailers did not want to risk creating a ""flashpoint"" for confrontation. Face coverings are already compulsory on public transport in England and Scotland, as well as most buses, trains and ferries in Northern Ireland. They will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work?

"This video can not be played Cerys Evans wants laws on students and funeral benefits changed A student says a flaw in the law means she had to borrow money on a credit card to pay for her father's funeral. Cerys Evans discovered she was not eligible for a special benefit to help cover the costs when her father died unexpectedly. Lyndon Evans was just 51 when he was admitted to hospital in Cardiff in May with sepsis and pneumonia. UK officials saidFuneral Expenses Payments,externalwere only available to those on ""qualifying benefits"". ""It was really unexpected. Dad was diabetic and he'd been unwell before, but he was honestly like a cat with nine lives, he came out of anything,"" said Ms Evans, from Caerphilly. ""When he went into hospital, we were told he can be treated, you know, he should come out the other side, and it went downhill so quickly and then he passed away."" 'Paupers' funerals' hit all time high Crowdfunding to bury your loved ones Tragedy behind Britain's makeshift memorials The 20-year-old, who is studying criminal justice and psychology at the University of South Wales, said as next-of-kin it was up to her to make the funeral arrangements. She had heard of the funeral expenses benefits payments, but told BBC Wales it quickly became clear she would not be eligible, even though she had a severely limited income as a student. ""It absolutely crushed me,"" she said. ""I had a credit card before. I had to use that and another one and borrow money from family members, it was just a nightmare. It was horrible."" She said her only other source of income was a part-time weekend retail job, with savings of just a few hundred pounds and ""everything went towards the funeral"". The family say they struggled to grieve while focusing on funeral costs Ms Evans said the reality of having to find about Â£4,000 from ""virtually nowhere"" was incredibly stressful for the family, including her younger 14-year-old sister and an older 27-year-old sister. ""I don't feel like any of us - especially my younger sister - none of us have taken time to grieve because we've all been focused on: 'Oh my god, there's money, there's this'. ""And Dad really wouldn't have wanted that either. ""We've all been focused on money and how we're going to sort everything out. Everyone has been lovely but it's been awful mentally, to tell you the truth."" The funeral took place in June, and Ms Evans said they could only afford ""the bare minimum"" for their father. She has now started a petition to try and change the system,external, to allow students to apply for help towards funeral costs. ""People don't realise how much we do,"" said Ms Evans. ""I cared for my Dad beforehand. I did his shopping. ""I didn't have a day for myself, and in between that I was helping Dad."" She said if the UK government wanted to encourage individuals to go to university, they should also realise ""we are deserving of this fund just as much as anyone else"". A UK government official responded: ""Losing a loved one is incredibly distressing and our hearts go out to anyone experiencing bereavement. ""The financial assistance we offer is targeted at those on qualifying benefits to ensure that the most vulnerable are supported with these costs.""

"UK aid is distributed with the aim of protecting public health and alleviating global poverty Britain is to cut its global aid budget by Â£2.9bn this year due to the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis, the government has announced. It said a review of aid projects has prioritised the most vulnerable countries for assistance. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would still meet its commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on international development. But MPs criticised the announcement's timing as Parliament breaks for summer. Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the Commons International Development Committee, said it was ""poor practice"" to announce the move on the final day of Parliament before the summer, preventing MPs from asking questions about it. UK aid budget to help boost trade agenda UK aid department to be merged with Foreign Office What's behind the PM's aid department decision? In a letter to Ms Champion, Mr Raab said the UK was ""experiencing a severe economic downturn as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic"". Despite the reductions, Mr Raab said money spent this year ""remains prioritised on poverty reduction"". He added that aid would also focus on ""tackling climate change and reversing biodiversity loss, championing girls' education, UK leadership in the global response to Covid-19, and campaigning on issues such as media freedom and freedom of religious belief"". Spending on Official Development Assistance (ODA) was set to be Â£15.8bn this year, before the Covid-19 crisis emerged. Mr Raab said spending on ODA would remain at 0.7% of GNI. The foreign secretary suggested the cuts were in anticipation of ""potential shrinkage"" in the UK economy in the coming months. He said a Â£2.9bn package of reductions in the government's planned foreign aid spending had been identified ""so we can proceed prudently for the remainder of 2020"". ""The package I have agreed with the prime minister maintains our flexibility and enables the government to manage our ODA spend against an uncertain 0.7% position,"" he added. Boris Johnson has described UK aid spending as a ""giant cashpoint in the sky"" It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the Department for International Development (DFID) would be merged with Mr Raab's department. The PMsaid at the timethat UK aid spending had ""been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests"". Ms Champion said Mr Raab's announcement on the last day of Parliament before the long summer recess raises more questions than it answers"" and queried the timescale of the cuts. ""If it is with immediate effect, do the projects know or will they find out via the media as DFID staff did about the merger? Is there an overarching strategy in place?"" she wrote. She added: ""Clearly there has been no consultation, but to release this news literally as Parliament rises so there can be no scrutiny by MPs is poor practice."" Liberal Democrat international development spokesperson Wendy Chamberlain said assurances over foreign aid were not ""worth the paper they were written on"".

"Indoor performances, with socially distanced audiences, can resume in England from 1 August The government has been too slow to respond to the ""existential threat"" faced by live theatre, music and other culture, a committee of MPs has said. Minsiters ""consistently failed to recognise"" the challenges Covid-19 posed to the arts, the House of Commons culture select committee said. Chair Julian Knight MP said a Â£1.57bn support package was ""nothing more than an Elastoplast over a gaping wound"". The government insisted it had ""worked with urgency"" to provide support. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) disagreed that it had been too slow, saying thousands of organisations and hundreds of thousands of jobs in the sector had been saved by its furlough and loan schemes. The DCMS also pointed to the ""largest ever one-off cash injection into culture"", which was welcomed by many figures in the arts when it was announced earlier this month. However, the national advisory body for theatres has warned that a ""significant proportion"" of theatres are expected to close due to the coronavirus crisis. In written evidence to the committee, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group confirmed it was losing more than Â£6 million a week in box office sales, with shows including London productions of Cinderella, Evita and The Phantom Of The Opera, all cancelled or postponed since lockdown. Mr Knight, Conservative MP for Solihull, told BBC arts editor Will Gompertz: ""The reality is we are facing a cataclysm in the arts and cultural space."" What is needed is ""not just a bailout"" but a ""long-term plan"" that would enable the sector to ""come out the other side"", he said. ""What we've seen is a lack of joined-up thinking across government,"" he went on, suggesting ""huge swathes of our cultural infrastructure"" are at risk. Lloyd Webber: 'At the moment it's limbo-land' Socially distanced indoor shows can open in August Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job' The committee said the cultural industries were likely to face mass redundancies. There could be a lasting impact on diversity, opportunities for audiences and workers, and the UK's position as a cultural world leader, it said. The help available was hampered by the ""lack of spending power"" at the DCMS, and ""a fundamental misunderstanding"" of what is needed, the committee said. Mr Knight said: ""Our report points to a department that has been treated as a 'Cinderella' by government when it comes to spending, despite the enormous contribution that the DCMS sectors make to the economy and job creation."" Shakespeare's Globe in London was among the venues that submitted evidence The committee cited evidence that 70% of theatres and production companies could go out of business by the end of 2020, with more than Â£300m lost in box office revenue in the first 12 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown. It also pointed to figures suggesting that 93% of grassroots music venues faced permanent closure and that 90% of all festivals would be cancelled this year. The report recommended a ""sector-specific recovery deal"", ""clear, if conditional, timelines for reopening"", and ""long-term structural support"". It also called for continued support for workers and freelancers, and help for those who had fallen through the gaps in the current schemes. And it said VAT relief on ticket sales should be extended until 2024 and that Theatre Tax Relief should be halved for the next three years. The Old Vic and Shakespeare's Globe were among those to submit evidence to the committee's inquiry. Last week it was announced that indoor performances with socially distanced audiences can resume in England from 1 August. Yet the report said the announcement did not take into account ""the lead times for performance, the challenges of social distancing or the concerns about audience behaviours"". Responding to the report, a DCMS statement said: ""We have worked with urgency, day-in-day-out since the start of the pandemic in providing support for our sectors and on plans to reopen them safely. It added: ""Our Â£1.57 billion investment is the largest ever one-off cash injection into culture in this country. We have also worked with our arms length bodies on additional emergency packages and provided billions in support to charities to help those most in need.""

"OneWeb has a factory in Florida with the capacity produce two satellites a day MPs have launched an inquiry into the government's $500m (Â£400m) investment in bankrupt satellite firm OneWeb, amid disclosure that a top civil servant warned that taxpayers could lose out. The government took a stake in the satellite broadband company as part of a post-Brexit space strategy. It emerged on Wednesday that an acting permanent secretary raised concerns, warning that the deal was ""unusual"". Parliament's business committee chief Darren Jones called the deal a gamble. Mr Jones, chairman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said in a statement that news of the permanent secretary's worries ""heightens concerns around this investment"" and ""prompts further questions about how the governmentâ¦ came to plump for this largely US-based bankrupt satellite company"". He went on to say that ""using nearly half a billion pounds of taxpayer money to gamble on a 'commercial opportunity' whilst still failing to support manufacturing jobs with a sector deal is both troubling and concerning."" UK takes Â£400m stake in satellite firm OneWeb UK space company blames coronavirus for collapse OneWeb is creating a satellite network to deliver broadband connections. But the firm collapsed in March, blaming the Covid crisis for not being able to raise more financial support. Earlier this month, a joint offer from the UK government and India's Bharti Global mobile operator won a bidding war for the firm. But it was disclosed on Wednesday that Sam Beckett, the top civil servant in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), said all the money put forward could be lost. ""While in one scenario we could get a 20% return, the central case is marginal and there are significant downside risks, including that venture capital investments of this sort can fail, with the consequence that all the value of the equity can be lost,""  she wrote. The comments were part of a letter for ""ministerial direction"", an avenue for civil servants to register a stronger than usual opinion. Ministers are obliged to formally overrule the official's objections to instruct the spending to go ahead. The contents of the letter must also be made public. Ms Beckett said that an assessment by the UK Space Agency had identified ""substantial technical and operational hurdles"" that OneWeb would need to overcome in order to become a ""viable and profitable business"" and there was a high likelihood that further taxpayer funding would be necessary. However, Business Secretary Alok Sharma overrode Ms Beckett's concerns and the government went ahead with the bid. Mr Sharma said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had agreed to the purchase, and other private sector investors were involved in the bid for OneWeb. OneWeb's largest unsecured creditor is the rocket operator Arianespace The government hopes that London-based OneWeb, can take the place of the EU's Galileo programme, which the UK left when Brexit took effect in January this year. Ms Beckett said: ""I completely understand your, the Prime Minister's and the Chancellor's interest in wider benefits such as the potential long-term geopolitical advantages for foreign policy and soft power that would come with sovereign ownership of a fleet of satellites. ""Moreover, I do not underestimate the potential opportunity that this investment represents for UK interests globally. ""It would be the first mega-constellation operator, if it succeeds, and would have the potential to connect millions of people, in particular those in remote, rural locations without broadband access."" However she wrote that she could not be sure that the investment met Whitehall's strict value-for-money requirements and so requested the formal order from Mr Sharma to proceed. OneWeb, which has its headquarters in London and a manufacturing base in Florida, is aiming to complete the construction of a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites. The UK government sees satellites as a way to meet commitments on the roll-out of super-fast broadband and believes OneWeb's constellation could also deliver a precise satellite navigation system. Seventy-four satellites in an initial network of 648 had been launched when the company announced it was seeking bankruptcy protection. Most experts believe a further $3bn at least is needed to bring the full constellation into use.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson defends UK union on a visit to Scotland The response to the coronavirus pandemic has shown the ""sheer might"" of the UK union, Boris Johnson has said during a visit to Scotland. Mr Johnson was in Orkney and the north of Scotland one year on from the day he took office as prime minister. He said the work of the military and Treasury job retention schemes had proved the ""merits of the union"". But the SNP said the visit showed Mr Johnson was ""in a panic"" about rising support for Scottish independence. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon did not meet Mr Johnson during the trip but said she would continue to work with his government on the ""immediate priority"" of tackling coronavirus. Follow updates on Boris Johnson's visit to Scotland What's Boris Johnson worried about in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon said she did not think anyone should be ""championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives"" to make a constitutional argument. Mr Johnson said he ""pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the United Kingdom"" when he entered Downing Street one year ago, adding that the response to the pandemic had shown his government's commitment to the whole of the UK. The UK government has coordinated much of the country's economic response to the virus, including the coronavirus job retention furlough scheme. But devolved governments have had control over most public health measures and have been able to set more local timetables and messaging. Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""always happy to meet the prime minister"" Although the whole of the UK entered lockdown in the same week, each constituent part has eased restrictions at a different rate. Phase 3 of Scotland's""route map"" out of lockdownbegan last week, as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and barbers were allowed to reopen. They were allowed to reopen in England slightly earlier on 4 July, along with holiday accommodation - including hotels, B&Bs, cottages, campsites and caravan parks. Boris Johnson must have found recent opinion polls conducted in Scotland to be awkward reading. Surveys suggesting rising support for Scottish independence and a significant gap between his approval ratings and those of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, appear to have prompted him to make his first visit to Scotland since last year's general election. The prime minister wants to use the trip to remind people in Scotland just how much cash the UK treasury has spent in response to the coronavirus crisis. He is stressing that it is the Westminster government that has supported 900,000 people who might have otherwise lost their jobs and produced billions of pounds in extra spending for the NHS. The SNP don't look too worried about a prime ministerial trip denting support for their cause. On her 50th birthday, on Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that a visit for Boris was the best birthday pressie she could hope for. Every time the PM tells voters that it is only as part of the UK that Scottish businesses and public services could afford to cope with the pandemic, the SNP will reply that they are sick of being told that Scotland is ""too wee, too poor and too stupid"" to be independent. Read more from Sarah Smith Speaking in Orkney, where he met local fishermen, Mr Johnson said the ""merits of the union"" had been ""proved throughout this crisis"", citing the work of the military and the Treasury's support for workers and firms. The UK government says the furlough and self-employment schemeshave supported 900,000 jobs in Scotland, and that Â£4.6bn of additional funding was being provided to the Scottish government. The prime minister also said not enough time had passed for another independence referendum to be held, saying the 2014 vote wasa ""once in a generation"" event. He said: ""What I'm saying is that the union is a fantastically strong institution. It's helped our country through thick and thin. ""It's very, very valuable in terms of the support we've been able to give to everybody throughout all corners of the UK, and we had a referendum on breaking up the union a few years ago - I think only six years ago. That is not a generation by any computation and I think what people really want to do is see our whole country coming back strongly together, and that's what we're going to do."" Ms Sturgeontweeted,externalthat the prime minister's visit to Scotland ""highlighted the argument for Scottish independence"". However she said politicians should remain focused on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and ""not use it as a political weapon"". At her coronavirus briefing on Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""worked very hard to have a collaborative approach to the other governments of the UK"". She said financial support from the Treasury was ""very welcome"", but said it should be clear that ""this is borrowed money"" which would have to be repaid by Scottish taxpayers too - ""it's not some kind of favour that has been done"". The first minister said UK-wide actions by Mr Johnson's administration were a reflection of where powers lie, saying that ""if we held the powers we would be doing these things ourselves"". She added: ""I just don't think any of us should be championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political cases we want to make. ""This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we are not out of yet. Too many people people have died and all of us have a really solemn responsibility to focus on and get our countries through, and that's what I'm going to continue to do. ""Campaigning right now is not my priority. Boris Johnson has every right to be on a campaign visit but in his shoes it's not what I would do."" Mr Johnson was greeted by a small group of protestors during his visit to Orkney Mr Johnson also announced Â£50m of funding from the UK government for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles - the latest in a series of ""city and region deals"" which see Scottish and UK ministers each pledge cash to various areas for spending on new infrastructure and local development schemes. The Scottish government has also committed Â£50mto the ""Islands growth deal"", which will target sectors including tourism, energy and skills. The timing of Mr Johnson's visit comes amid a ""perfect storm"" over Scottish independence, according to Sir Tom Devine, an emeritus professor of Scottish history at Edinburgh University. Sir Tom told BBC Two's Newsnight the union is in its most fragile condition since 1745, and that opinion polling suggesting increasing support for independence in Scotland has been consistent for some time. Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt added that a senior SNP source had told him they believed the party's moment ""is at last arriving"". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mr Johnson was visiting due to recent polls suggesting support for independence was on the rise. Mr Blackford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister's message would go down ""particularly badly"" in Scotland. ""I think what we've demonstrated over the course of the last few months [is] that in the areas of devolved responsibility, in the areas of public health, the leadership that's been shown by our first minister is in sharp contrast to the bluster that we've seen from Boris Johnson,"" he said.
