"Mary Lou McDonald was confirmed as the nominee for Sinn FÃ©in president on Saturday Mary Lou McDonald has been confirmed as the only candidate nominated to replace Gerry Adams as Sinn FÃ©in president. Mr Adams has led the party since 1983. He announced his intention to stand down in November 2017. Sinn FÃ©in's ard comhairle (high council) met in Belfast on Saturday to formally ratify the nominee. This video can not be played Sinn Fein's Mary Lou McDonald said she hoped for a united Ireland Ms McDonald said that no-one would fill the shoes of Gerry Adams, ""but the news is that I brought my own"". A special party conference to elect the new leader will be held on 10 February. It means the party is set to be led by a woman for the first time in its modern history. The last female president was Margaret Buckley, who led the party between 1937 and 1950, however, Sinn FÃ©in has suffered a number of splits since Ms Buckley's time as leader. Profile: 'Marmite' Mary Lou McDonald? Profile: Gerry Adams Ms McDonald said she ""did not for a moment underestimate the scale of this undertaking on a personal and political level"". ""I grew up watching Gerry Adams on the telly, l would certainly never have guessed that come February 10 2018, that I would be the boss of him,"" she said. ""The truth is no-one will ever fill Gerry Adams' shoes, but the news is that I brought my own. ""I will fill my shoes, I will walk in my shoes and we together over the coming years will walk a journey that is full of opportunities, full of challenges but I believe which marks a defining epoch, a defining chapter in our achievement of a united Ireland and the ending of partition."" Mary Lou McDonald had in the past said she would like to see a contest for the Sinn FÃ©in leadership, however she didn't get her wish. She takes over from Gerry Adams at an interesting time in Irish politics; with an expected abortion referendum, on-going Brexit negotiations, possible general and presidential elections in the Republic- never mind the negotiations in Northern Ireland to restore devolution. Ms McDonald is expected to spend most of her time south of the border but as the leader of an all-island party she will also have to keep a close eye on developments in the other jurisdiction. As she has no paramilitary background the party will be hoping that she may help garner Sinn FÃ©in support in more middle class areas and amongst women. Butthe Barry McElduffaffair shows the legacy of the Troubles at the moment is never very far away for Sinn FÃ©in - probably no matter who is leader. Ms McDonald said she believed Irish unity was the best solution ""for all of our people including our unionist brothers and sisters"". Mr Adams said his decision to step down as leader was ""part of Sinn FÃ©in's 10-year plan for the regeneration and renewal of the party"". He also told the meeting of his concerns that politics in Northern Ireland was ""very polarised at this time and that the atmosphere is very toxic"". ""It is my view that this is not good for anyone except a small minority of bigots,"" he said. Nominations for the presidency closed on Friday at 17:00 GMT, and Ms McDonald was the sole candidate. Ms McDonald, 48, an English literature graduate from Trinity College Dublin, has been a TD (MP) for Dublin Central since 2011. Mary Lou McDonald is set to replace Gerry Adams as leader of the party Before getting elected to the DÃ¡il (parliament) she was an MEP representing the Dublin constituency - becoming Sinn FÃ©in's first MEP in the Republic of Ireland in 2004. Her personal story is very different from other leading Sinn FÃ©in politicians. She comes from a middle-class background and was brought up in Rathgar, which is viewed as one of Dublin's most desirable suburbs.

"Firefighters used a rope system because the church's spiral staircase was too steep for a stretcher A teenager has been rescued by fire crews after he became tangled in a church's bell-ringing ropes. Firefighters found the 17-year-old more than 40ft (12m) in the air inside the belfry of St Helens Church in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, at 19:00 GMT on Friday. Crews used a rope rescue system to reach the bell-ringer who had suffered a number of injuries from the ropes. He was lowered to the floor on a stretcher and taken to hospital. The extent of his injuries is unknown. Station manager Paul Webster said ""it was an unusual incident"" for the firefighters. ""Due to the steepness of the spiral staircase to the bell ringing room, there was not the option to carry the casualty out of the church on a stretcher,"" he added.

"Lord Judge said juries ""may wonder"" about sufficient evidence, even in apparently strong cases The collapse of a series of prominent rape trials could deter juries from convicting in genuine cases, a former lord chief justice has warned. Lord Judge, the most senior judge in England and Wales between 2008 and 2013, said juries may lack confidence in the evidence presented to them. He toldThe Times,externalthat recent cases of collapsed trials were ""alarming"". In one case, rape charges were dropped against Oliver Mears, 19, on the eve of his trial on the basis of new evidence. Oxford University student Mr Mears had spent two years on bail, butwas spared a trialafter a diary which supported his case was uncovered and police admitted to errors in investigating the case. Lord Judge told the paper: ""The recent examples in cases involving alleged sexual crime are alarming, both for all the individuals concerned and for public confidence in the administration of criminal justice generally."" He said it was possible that juries were as ""alarmed as everyone else by these cases"". This video can not be played Rape trial collapse student Liam Allan felt 'pure fear' Lord Judge said juries ""may wonder"" - even in an apparently strong cases - if they have been provided with all the admissible evidence. ""These events may reduce the prospects of conviction even when the allegation is genuine,"" he said. Two young menboth had cases against them dropped in December, prompting Scotland Yard to review about 30 sex crime cases. The trial of student Liam Allan, 22, collapsed three days into his trial when police were ordered to hand over phone records showing the alleged victim had pestered Mr Allan for casual sex. Days later, the prosecution case collapsed against Isaac Itiary after police disclosed ""relevant material"" in response to his defence case statement as his trial was about to start. A third rape trial, against Samson Makele,collapsed after images emergedof the accused and his alleged victim ""cuddling"" in bed. The photos had been discovered on his phone by a defence expert, but had not been disclosed by police or prosecutors. Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, agreed with Lord Judge. ""There is an expectation amongst juries now that they expect scientific and digital internet evidence all the time, and if it's not provided they make a judgement about this,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. He added: ""What Lord Judge is saying is that juries have expectations. If those expectations aren't met then people who should be convicted aren't being convicted."" Alison Saunders,the director of public prosecutions, insisted earlier this week that there are ""safeguards in place"" to prevent wrongful imprisonment. Mr Afzal described this as a ""bold statement"". ""I know of cases where digital evidence and DNA evidence would have perhaps meant that person wasn't convicted,"" he told Today. Mr Afzal, who initiated prosecutions against the so-called Rochdale grooming gang, added that internet giants should be required to assist police investigations. ""A police officer shouldn't have to - as they currently do - try and scour the internet for the relevant evidence.""

"This video can not be played Republican Leader Senator Mitch McConnell accused the Democrats of ""irresponsible political games"" Recriminations have begun over the failure of the US Senate to pass a new budget and prevent the shutdown of many federal services. A bill to fund the federal government for the coming weeks did not receive the required 60 votes by the deadline of midnight on Friday. President Trump accused the Democrats of putting politics above the interests of the American people. The Democrats blame him for rejecting bipartisan compromise proposals. Negotiations in both houses of Congress continued on Saturday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would be back in session on Sunday to try to end the impasse. The White House budget chief has expressed optimism that a resolution will be found before Monday. But if not, hundreds of thousands of federal workers face the prospect of no work and shuttered offices at the start of the working week. The last government shutdown was in 2013, and lasted for 16 days. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is the first time a government shutdown has happened while one party, the Republicans, controls both Congress and the White House. The vote on Friday was 50-49, falling far short of the 60 needed to advance the bill. With a 51-seat majority in the Senate, the Republicans did not have enough seats to pass the bill without some support from the Democrats. They want funding for border security - including the border wall - and immigration reforms, as well as increased military spending. The Democrats have demanded protection from deportation of more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The Republicans added a sweetener in the form of a six-year extension to a health insurance programme for children in lower-income families. But Democrats want this programme extended permanently. Mr Trump accused the Democrats of being ""far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border"". But the leading Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, blamed the president, saying Mr Trump was under pressure from ""hard-right forces within the administration"". White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders warned: ""The president will not negotiate on immigration reform until Democrats stop playing games and reopen the government."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The game of chicken ended with a head-on crash. Republicans are anxious to label this the ""Schumer shutdown"" and, essentially, they're right. Chuck Schumer and his fellow Democrats (with the help of a few Republicans) blocked a bill that would have kept the government open - at least temporarily. Determining responsibility and apportioning blame, however, are two decidedly different endeavours. Democrats will argue that they had a deal with the president on their bipartisan compromise that included immigration reform - only to have him back away during that fateful obscenity-laden Oval Office meeting last week. Republicans will frame this as liberals putting undocumented immigrant protections over military readiness and health insurance for poor kids. The winner of the blame game has yet to be decided. Generally, the loser in these types of showdowns is the party entering the fight with the lowest popularity - bad news for Mr Trump and the Republicans. The good news, for both sides, is that their political bases will be thrilled they are playing hardball. Midterm election years, like 2018, tend to encourage this kind of rally-the-base manoeuvres. Now that the line has been crossed, this could become a protracted, ugly fight. The US budget must be approved by 1 October - the start of the federal financial year. But Congress has often failed to meet this deadline and negotiations continue well into the new year, with the previous year's funding to federal agencies extended on a temporary basis. Because Congress failed to agree an extension that would have maintained government funding through to 16 February, it means many federal agencies effectively closed for business as of 00:01 on Saturday (05:01 GMT). Most staff in the departments of housing, environment, education and commerce will be staying at home on Monday.,externalHalf of workers in the treasury, health, defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work. This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown Visa and passport processing could also be delayed, and some national monuments, including New York's Statue of Liberty, have already been closed. But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation. And the Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open - their closure in the 2013 shutdown provoked an angry public reaction. Why the US government has shut down The shutdown began on the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. His trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week has also been called into question. Many federal employees were forced to take a leave of absence - officially known as being furloughed - during the 16 days of shutdown. At its peak, some 850,000 employees were off work each day.

"Afghan security forces have taken up positions around the hotel At least four gunmen have launched an attack on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel, Afghan officials say. Special forces killed two of the attackers, an interior ministry spokesman said, and are trying to get to the others. The gunmen stormed the hotel on Saturday evening, shooting at guests and detonating grenades. At least five people have been injured, officials said. It is not clear how many have been killed. The attack began at about 21:00 local time (16:30 GMT), with reports suggesting the gunmen shot at security guards as they made their way into the five-storey building. They targeted staff and guests before special forces were called in. Security forces then cleared the ground floor of the luxury hotel but the attackers are still on the floors above, spokesman Nasrat Rahimi told the BBC. Some reports said the hotel had been hosting an IT conference attended by provincial officials at the time. One witness told Reuters news agency that the attackers had taken hostages. The attack comes just days after the US embassy in Kabul issued a warning about hotels in the city. ""We are aware of reports that extremist groups may be planning an attack against hotels in Kabul,""the embassy wrote in a public security alert published Thursday,external, though it highlighted another hotel near the international airport as a possible target. ""These groups may also be targeting public gatherings/demonstrations, government facilities, transportation, markets, and places where foreigners are known to congregate."" File photo: The Intercontinental Hotel, photographed in January 2016 A guest at the hotel told AFP news agency that people were hiding in their rooms. ""I don't know if the attackers are inside the hotel but I can hear gunfire,"" the guest said. ""I beg the security forces to rescue us as soon as possible before they reach and kill us."" Another interior ministry spokesman told AFP an investigation had already begun into how the attackers had breached security, which was handed over to a private company two weeks ago. ""They probably used a back door in the kitchen to enter,"" he said. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new ""Great Game"" IS in Afghanistan: How successful has the group been? The Intercontinental is a state-owned hotel which often hosts weddings, conferences and political gatherings. It was attacked by the Taliban in 2011. Twenty-one people were killed including nine attackers. Security has been tightened in Kabul since last May, whena huge truck bomb killed at least 150 people. However, there have been several attacks in recent months.They include a bomb at a Shia cultural centre last monththat killed more than 40 people. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight?

"Outside observers could be forgiven for being a little mystified at news that the US government has shut down. So what is going on and how did we get here? It's when parts of the US government close until the government can decide on spending plans. Many federal agencies close down, so that potentially hundreds of thousands of government employees have to take a leave of absence, often without pay. Services such as national security, electricity generation and air traffic control continue, but others considered non-essential, like visa and passport processing, could be delayed. US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said that over 50% of his department would not go to work, and some of the military's maintenance, training and intelligence operations would come to a halt. The Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open. When they closed during the 2013 shutdown there was an angry public reaction. A spending bill - called an appropriations bill in US political parlance - had to be passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump by midnight on Friday 19 January. This did not happen, and without an agreement on spending the federal government effectively closes its doors. As ever in politics, that depends on your point of view. Republicans are labelling it the Schumer shutdown, blaming Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who led the Democrats to block the bill. But Democrats say they had a deal on immigration - a major sticking point - before the president backed out. Correspondents say the winner of the blame game has yet to be decided, but the Republicans are going into the fight with lower popularity. Yes. The US government has closed for business several times before. The most recent shutdown lasted 16 days in 2013, when Republicans demanded the spending bill have provisions to impede or delay President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. National monuments and parks were closed and hundreds of thousands of government workers put on unpaid leave. Only one person was left to patrol the 5,525 mile (8,891km) border with Canada. But this is the first time since 1980 that a budget impasse has led to a shutdown when both chambers of Congress and the White House are controlled by the same party - the Republicans. 10 consequences of the US shutdown in 2013 Hopes for a long-term spending bill, funding the US government for the entire 2018 budget year that ends in October, have long since vanished. The measure that failed to pass on Friday evening would have kept Washington running until 16 February, and then the whole showdown would have resumed all over again. It was crafted by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate and included a few sweeteners to make it easier to vote for (and more difficult to vote against). Several unpopular healthcare taxes were suspended in this bill. They also offered full re-authorisation for six years of the Children's Health Insurance Programme (Chip), which provides coverage for low-income families but is on the verge of running out of funds. But these sweeteners were not sweet enough, and the bill failed to pass. On Wednesday the Republican game plan seemed clear. Pass the temporary funding, with the sweeteners, over unanimous Democratic opposition in the House of Representatives. Then essentially dare Democrats to block the bill in the Senate, denying money for poor children and forcing a shutdown. The ground beneath the party began to crack on Thursday, however. The president tweeted that he didn't support the inclusion of Chip funding in the stopgap bill, forcing a White House scramble to explain that Mr Trump still backed the legislation. The House of Representatives passed the bill, but a handful of Republicans in the Senate said they would vote no. And the Senate Democrats announced they had enough votes on their own to block passage. Ultimately, the bill failed by a margin of 50-49, well short of the 60 votes required. Take your pick: a comprehensive immigration deal that includes Daca protections (for Democrats) border security, immigration reform and funding for a border wall (for Mr Trump) increasing military spending (for defence hawks) The presences (or absence) of any of the above could all have been reasons for legislators to go from yes to no. Mr Trump has called for a ""nuclear option"" of lowering the number of votes required to pass. An absolute majority (51%) would be easier for the Republicans to reach than the current 60% threshold. This would need to be led by Mr McConnell, but he has said he and other Republicans are opposed to it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"IS's Afghanistan chief Hafiz Saeed Khan was killed in a US air strike in July last year Amid a rise in attacks in Afghanistan attributed to the so-called Islamic State (IS), the BBC's Dawood Azami examines what kind of threat the militant group poses in the conflict-hit nation and the wider region. IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It was the first time that IS had officially spread outside the Arab world. Within a few weeks, the group appeared in at least five Afghan provinces, including Helmand, Zabul, Farah, Logar and Nangarhar, trying to establishpockets of territory from which to expand. It was the first major militant group to directly challenge the Afghan Taliban's dominance over the local insurgency. Its first aim was to drive Afghan Taliban fighters out of the area and it also hoped to evict Taliban ally al-Qaeda from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, or absorb its fighters. Yet despite efforts to energise battle-weary militants, IS struggled to build a wide political base and the indigenous support it expected in Afghanistan. Instead, it made enemies of almost everyone, including the Afghan Taliban. In the first half of 2015, IS managed to capture large chunks of territory in eastern Nangarhar province. This became the de facto ""capital"" principally for two reasons - its proximity to the tribal areas of Pakistan, home of IS Khorasan's top leaders, and the presence of some people who follow a similar Salafi/Wahhabi interpretation of Islam to IS. IS is also trying to get a foothold in northern Afghanistan, where it aims to link up with Central Asian, Chechen and Chinese Uighur militants. But it has largely been eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and military operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces. Six Red Cross workers were killed earlier this month in northern Afghanistan by suspected IS militants It has also lost territory in eastern Afghanistan in recent months. But it still has control over some parts of Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, where it plans attacks and trains fighters. Small IS pockets have also been reported in Zabul and Ghazni, as well as a few northern provinces. Since its emergence in Afghanistan, IS has lost hundreds of militants in US air strikes and ground fighting with the Afghan military. Meanwhile, several hundred IS fighters have been killed in clashes with the Afghan Taliban. Around a dozen top leaders of the group's Afghanistan-Pakistan branch, including founding leader Hafiz Saeed Khan, a former Pakistani Taliban commander, and his deputies, have been killed in Afghanistan, mostly in US drone attacks. Estimates about IS's numerical strength inside Afghanistan vary, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000. US General John Nicholson, the top commander of US and Nato troops in Afghanistan, estimates that between 1,000 and 1,500 IS fighters are in Afghanistan. He says their number has been cut in half, from an estimated 3,000, by military operations over the past year or so. Afghan security forces have been battling IS fighters, but the group has survived the onslaught He adds that about 70% of those fighters come from the Pakistani Taliban group (TTP), some of whom moved to Afghanistan after the Pakistani military launched an operation in North Waziristan tribal area in 2014. But Afghan security officials insist that 80% of IS militants are Pakistanis. The other members were part of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), a group focused on Central Asian countries, and former Afghan Taliban or new recruits, they say. IS has so far survived the onslaught and it seems the group is attracting new recruits to replace those killed. After losing territory, IS Khorasan is emulating its Middle East counterparts by resorting to guerrilla tactics such as suicide attacks, targeted killings and the use of IEDs. It says it carried out some of the deadliest recent attacks in Afghanistan, several of them in the capital, Kabul. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed around 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. All of these attacks targeted minority Shia Muslims. IS has also claimed responsibility for attacks in other parts of the country and has killed civilians, including tribal elders and religious scholars opposed to its extreme ideology and brutal tactics. Nato estimates that there are between 1,000 and 1,500 IS fighters in Afghanistan Like its counterparts in the Middle East, IS Khorasan has taken violence to new levels, even by the bloody standards of the region. While al-Qaeda introduced suicide bombings into the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, IS brought new and more ruthless tactics. In one notorious example an IS video released in August 2015 showed 10 blindfolded community elders in Achin district in Nangarhar being forced to sit on holes in the ground filled with explosives. They were then blown to pieces. Beheadings and abductions, including of women and children, are other tactics. In addition, IS propaganda on the internet and air waves is strong. The group has several Twitter and Facebook accounts and has been broadcasting on an FM radio station in Nangarhar since December 2015. Radio Caliphate can be heard in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, as well as adjacent parts of Pakistan. The station was once hit in a US airstrike but was back on air within a few weeks. IS has also carried out attacks in Pakistan, where it relies mainly on the support of certain anti-Shia sectarian groups. The first major attack in Pakistan for which IS claimed responsibility was in May 2015 when about 40 minority Shias were killed in a gun attack on a bus in the country's biggest city, Karachi. On 16 February, IS said it carried outan attack on the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Sufi shrinein the town of Sehwan in Sindh province. Police say 90 people were killed. The attack at the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Sufi shrine shocked Pakistan The conflict in Afghanistan has been going on for nearly four decades, but the country has largely remained immune to the sectarian violence that has hit other regional nations. IS, however, aims to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war between the majority Sunnis and minority Shias, as it has tried in Syria and Iraq. Shias are considered apostates by IS, which follows an austere version of Sunni Islam. The new 'Great Game' in Afghanistan Pakistan's bloody week: Who is to blame? Islamic State group: The full story Although IS has also killed many of its Sunni opponents, it has clearly stated sectarian goals in a number of its attacks. Justifying the July 2016 attack on the Shia rally in Kabul, IS called it retaliation for the activities of Afghan Shia Hazaras who have gone to Syria via Iran to fight for the government of President Bashar al-Assad, an Alawi-Shia, against the Islamic State group. Deliberate attacks by IS against Shia in Afghanistan add a dangerous complication to the conflict. The future of IS in Afghanistan and Pakistan is in many ways linked to the fate of IS in Syria and Iraq. Western and Afghan military officials confirm the group has financial ties to, and is in communication with, the main IS leadership. It also has contacts with IS cells operating in South and Central Asian countries. So far, IS has not been able to carry out attacks outside Afghanistan and Pakistan. But the group has many sympathisers in the region. Additionally, thousands of volunteers from nine South and Central Asian states - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for IS. They have been trained and radicalised there. The return of these militants will pose a new threat and might strengthen the existing IS infrastructure in the region. Such developments further complicate the conflict in Afghanistan and pose a long term risk to regional stability. Regional powers, such as Russia, China and Iran, are concerned about the threat that IS poses to their internal security. These powers have established contacts withthe Afghan Taliban, which is fighting IS, to hedge against the potential risk. Mutual mistrust is preventing regional players from reaching a consensus to end the conflict in Afghanistan. Six Afghan ICRC workers 'killed by IS' Pakistan's bloody week: Who is to blame?

"Mary Lou McDonald was confirmed as the nominee for Sinn FÃ©in president on Saturday Mary Lou McDonald has been confirmed as the only candidate nominated to replace Gerry Adams as Sinn FÃ©in president. Mr Adams has led the party since 1983. He announced his intention to stand down in November 2017. Sinn FÃ©in's ard comhairle (high council) met in Belfast on Saturday to formally ratify the nominee. This video can not be played Sinn Fein's Mary Lou McDonald said she hoped for a united Ireland Ms McDonald said that no-one would fill the shoes of Gerry Adams, ""but the news is that I brought my own"". A special party conference to elect the new leader will be held on 10 February. It means the party is set to be led by a woman for the first time in its modern history. The last female president was Margaret Buckley, who led the party between 1937 and 1950, however, Sinn FÃ©in has suffered a number of splits since Ms Buckley's time as leader. Profile: 'Marmite' Mary Lou McDonald? Profile: Gerry Adams Ms McDonald said she ""did not for a moment underestimate the scale of this undertaking on a personal and political level"". ""I grew up watching Gerry Adams on the telly, l would certainly never have guessed that come February 10 2018, that I would be the boss of him,"" she said. ""The truth is no-one will ever fill Gerry Adams' shoes, but the news is that I brought my own. ""I will fill my shoes, I will walk in my shoes and we together over the coming years will walk a journey that is full of opportunities, full of challenges but I believe which marks a defining epoch, a defining chapter in our achievement of a united Ireland and the ending of partition."" Mary Lou McDonald had in the past said she would like to see a contest for the Sinn FÃ©in leadership, however she didn't get her wish. She takes over from Gerry Adams at an interesting time in Irish politics; with an expected abortion referendum, on-going Brexit negotiations, possible general and presidential elections in the Republic- never mind the negotiations in Northern Ireland to restore devolution. Ms McDonald is expected to spend most of her time south of the border but as the leader of an all-island party she will also have to keep a close eye on developments in the other jurisdiction. As she has no paramilitary background the party will be hoping that she may help garner Sinn FÃ©in support in more middle class areas and amongst women. Butthe Barry McElduffaffair shows the legacy of the Troubles at the moment is never very far away for Sinn FÃ©in - probably no matter who is leader. Ms McDonald said she believed Irish unity was the best solution ""for all of our people including our unionist brothers and sisters"". Mr Adams said his decision to step down as leader was ""part of Sinn FÃ©in's 10-year plan for the regeneration and renewal of the party"". He also told the meeting of his concerns that politics in Northern Ireland was ""very polarised at this time and that the atmosphere is very toxic"". ""It is my view that this is not good for anyone except a small minority of bigots,"" he said. Nominations for the presidency closed on Friday at 17:00 GMT, and Ms McDonald was the sole candidate. Ms McDonald, 48, an English literature graduate from Trinity College Dublin, has been a TD (MP) for Dublin Central since 2011. Mary Lou McDonald is set to replace Gerry Adams as leader of the party Before getting elected to the DÃ¡il (parliament) she was an MEP representing the Dublin constituency - becoming Sinn FÃ©in's first MEP in the Republic of Ireland in 2004. Her personal story is very different from other leading Sinn FÃ©in politicians. She comes from a middle-class background and was brought up in Rathgar, which is viewed as one of Dublin's most desirable suburbs.

"Turkish war planes hit Kurdish positions on the Syrian side of the border on Saturday Turkish war planes have launched air strikes on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria in a move likely to raise tensions with the US. Turkey wants to oust the YPG militia, which it calls a terrorist group, from Afrin region on its southern border. The US-backed YPG says at least nine people were killed in the air strikes. Russia has moved its troops away from Afrin, saying it is concerned but will not interfere. Syria denounced Turkey's ""aggression"" and ""brutal attack"". Turkey had been shelling the area for two days, ahead of its declaration of a military operation on Saturday. In a nutshell: The 100, 300 and 700-word story Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says Turkey has notified all parties involved - including the Syrian government - about the offensive. Syria denied this was the case. This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains On Saturday, Turkey announced that an air and ground campaign, dubbed ""Olive Branch"", had been launched at 14:00 GMT, targeting the Kurdish YPG (Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units) and Islamic State (IS) group jihadists. The operation would be carried out ""with respect for Syria's territorial integrity"", it added.  A later statement said 108 targets belonging to Kurdish militants had been hit. Pro-Turkey rebels, known as the Free Syrian Army, also began moving into the area, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. The YPG said the strikes had killed at least six civilians and three fighters, with another 13 civilians wounded. One of the fighters belonged to the YPG and the other two were from its all-female affiliate, spokesperson Birusk Hasaka said. Ankara also said there were casualties, but they were all Kurdish militants. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters that ground forces would join the operation on Sunday. Turkey's military has been shelling the area since Thursday, a move which it said was in response to fire coming from the area. On Saturday, a spokesperson for the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said it would have no choice but to defend itself if attacked. Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent, near border with Syria In mid-afternoon the Turkish air strikes began, with plumes of smoke rising above Afrin. On the ground, Syrian rebel fighters backed by Turkey moved in, the military incursion rather inappropriately named Operation Olive Branch. President Erdogan has vowed to wipe out a corridor, first Afrin and then the nearby town of Manbij, from where the YPG has failed to withdraw. Nobody can object when what we do is necessary, he said. We will get rid of these messy terrorists trying to invade our country. But the risks are huge - the offensive pits Turkey against its Nato ally the US, which backs the Kurdish militia against IS, infuriating Ankara. Russia, which has troops in the area, has urged restraint - an MP in Moscow says it will be discussed at the UN. The Syrian regime warned it would be seen as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. An estimated half a million people have been killed in the Syrian war. With this new front, the danger is that number will rise again. The YPG has been a key part of the battle against IS in Syria, and has been supported by the US. Turkey, however, believes the group has links to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), and has for several months been threatening to clear Kurdish fighters from Afrin and another city, Manbij, which lies 100km away. Turkey's military plans seem to have been accelerated by an announcement from the US that it will help the SDF alliance build a new ""border security force"" to prevent the return of IS. Saturday's air strikes raise the prospect of deeper strains between Turkey and the US The YPG and SDF deny any terrorist links - a claim backed by the US government. But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the border force a ""terror army"". Disagreement over the Kurdish fighters has created a sharp division between the Nato allies. The US state department has appealed for calm, and attempted to downplay portrayals of a new ""border force"", instead characterising the new development as security training. Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria Who are the Kurds? Russia's foreign ministry says it is concerned by news of the offensive, and is urging restraint. It said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his American counterpart Rex Tillerson had discussed ""measures to take aimed at securing stability in the north of the country"". Russian senator Frants Klintsevich - who is the deputy chairman of the defence and security committee - earlier told Interfax news agency that Moscow would only respond if Russian bases in Syria were threatened. He said that Russia has been placed in a difficult situation, as it has ""good relations with both Damascus and Ankara"". Turkey's military and intelligence chiefs had been trying to get Russia's agreement to allow Turkish planes to use the Russian-controlled airspace above Afrin. Moscow is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and until now, had a contingent of soldiers at the airport in the centre of Afrin. It is not yet clear if Russia's claim that it will not interfere precludes allowing use of its airspace. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also discussed the military offensive with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. No details of the conversations have been provided.

"Syrian refugees in Lebanon often face tough conditions during the winter months Fifteen Syrian refugees - some of them children - have been found frozen to death while trying to cross the mountainous border into Lebanon. Thirteen bodies were found on Friday and two more were discovered on Saturday after the area was hit by a fierce snowstorm. Lebanese civil defence officials found the bodies after being told a group of refugees were in trouble near Masnaa. Local reports say the group had been abandoned by smugglers. Two smugglers have reportedly been arrested. Several refugees were rescued, including a young boy who was found wandering by himself. The group were taking the same route hundreds of thousands of Syrians have taken before them trying to flee the conflict at home. Lebanon, with a population of four million, has taken in nearly one million Syrians since the war began in 2011.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ""[Tourists] should follow local advice including restrictions in selected areas, and exercise particular care if travelling at night. ""[They] should stay in their resorts and limit travel beyond their respective security perimeters."" Jamaica PM Andrew Holness says the government had been planning the operation ""for some time"" On Thursday the country's prime minister, Andrew Holness, said the state of emergency was ""necessary"" in order to ""restore public safety"" in the St James area. Chief of defence, Major General Rocky Meade, said forces were targeting gangs, with ""particular focus on those that are responsible for murders, lotto scamming, trafficking of arms and guns, and extortion"". He added: ""We ask that you co-operate with the troops."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Simon Calder, the Independent newspaper's travel editor, said gang crime in the area had been ""intensifying"". He told Radio 5 live: ""Last year there were an average of six killings a week - and since the start of the year it has got even worse."" Jamaican newspaperthe Gleaner reported that there were 335 murders in the St James parish in 2017.,external It also estimated there had been 38 killings across the country in the first six days of 2018, compared with 23 over the same period last year. Tourists are drawn to Montego Bay's white sandy beaches As the UK Foreign Office has not warned against travel to Jamaica, Mr Calder said holiday firms have no obligation to offer customers alternative destinations. He added: ""I've never seen Foreign Office advice quite like this before. Normally the UK government says either 'it's OK' or 'don't go'."" Becks Palou says the military told her group it was fine to travel around the country Bristol-based Becks Palou is part of a group of friends on holiday in Montego Bay. They left their hotel early this morning to drive to Kingston, the capital, after staff said it was safe to travel. Ms Palou, who is originally from Spain, said they were delayed by stops at military checkpoints but were able to reach their destination. She said: ""When we went out on the road, we arrived at the checks and we were let through. Soldiers felt it was fine to travel. ""It feels safe, more than usual because the roads are quieter."" Sean Tipton, from the Association of British Travel Agents, said that hotels in Montego Bay have ""very strict security"" which means tourists can feel safe. He told the BBC: ""If you look at the incidents that have occurred, they have been directed at local people. ""It's obviously terrible for them, but in terms of instances affecting tourists, I haven't actually come across one in Jamaica for quite some time."" He also stressed the importance of following the advice from tour operators and the Foreign Office and not leaving resorts unless on an organised excursion. Are you in Montego Bay?

"This video can not be played President Macron: ""You can't have full access to the single market if you don't tick the box"" French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested the UK could get a special trade deal with the EU after Brexit. But he warned that Britain would not have full access to the single market without accepting its rules. Speaking to Andrew Marr, he warned - as Brussels has already done - that the UK could not ""cherry-pick"" the elements it liked. A deal might fall somewhere between the single market and a trade agreement, he said. Mr Macron's comments came during hisfirst visit to the UK since becoming French president, where he held talks with Prime Minister Theresa May. In the interview, to be broadcast on Sunday, the leader said the UK should not gain access to the single market without accepting its ""preconditions"", which include freedom of movement across the EU, budget contributions and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. UK and France sign Calais migrant treaty The key Brexit dates in 2018 ""There should be no cherry-picking in the single market because that's a dismantling of the single market,"" he said. ""As soon as you decide not to join the [EU] preconditions, it's not a full access. ""What is important is to not make people believe that it is possible to [have your cake and eat it]."" He said the UK could have ""deeper relations"" with the EU than other countries, as with Norway, but ruled out full single market access as ""you decided to leave"". Speakingin a separate interview, with German newspaper Bild,external, Mrs May insisted any new deal between the UK and the EU was ""not about cherry-picking"". ""We want to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement and a security partnership,"" she said. ""Because we don't start from the position of, say, Canada or Norway - there are significant and long-grown economic links between us. ""What I want and hope is that the importance of a lasting good relationship for people on both sides of the Channel is recognised."" By BBC Europe editor Katya Adler Essentially President Macron is looking for a negotiated Brexit deal that is in France's interest. And this is what the British government is hoping: that each EU country will now push its own agenda in trade talks, allowing the UK to get the bespoke deal it wants. But the cold water on that argument is that every EU member benefits from the European single market. They don't want rules to be broken just for the UK if that might hurt them in the long run. President Macron believes EU interests are France's interests. He aims to ""make France great again"" and wants his country to be the most influential in Europe (taking from Germany, which is now hobbled by domestic political problems). He won't endanger his grand plan by advocating special deals for the UK that might damage the EU as a whole. Mr Macron said access to the EU for the UK's financial services sector was ""not feasible"" if the UK did not accept the obligations of the single market. But he insisted he did not want to ""unplug"" the City from the EU, adding: ""It doesn't make sense, because it's part of the whole financing of our European Union."" He told Marr it was not too late for the UK to change its mind about remaining - describing the 2016 referendum as a ""mistake"". ""I do respect this vote, I do regret this vote, and I would love to welcome you again,"" he said. ""It's a mistake when you just ask 'yes' or 'no' when you don't ask people how to improve the situation and explain how to improve it."" Mr Macron said he believed the Brexit vote mainly came from the middle and working classes, and older people, who ""decided that the recent decade was not in their favour"". ""When I look at your debate it was too much favourable just for the City and less favourable for the rest of the country,"" he said. But, speaking to Bild, Mrs May once again flatly denied there would be a second referendum: ""Parliament gave the British public the choice and they made their decision. I think it's important that politicians then deliver on that."" Mr Macron took a selfie at a reception in the Victoria and Albert Museum, with Theresa May On his first visit to the UK this week, President Macron signed a treaty with the Prime Minister to speed up the processing of migrants in Calais. Mrs May praised the ""uniquely close relationship"" between the two nations. She said both leaders remained committed to the Le Touquet border agreement which established French border controls in Britain and UK controls in Calais. The UK also announced an extra Â£44.5m to be spent on beefing up Channel border security. The visit was punctuated by asmiling selfie taken of Mr Macron and Mrs May, at an evening reception in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Firefighters found the 17-year-old more than 40ft (12m) in the air inside the belfry of St Helens Church in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, at 19:00 GMT on Friday. Crews used a rope rescue system to reach the bell-ringer who had suffered a number of injuries from the ropes. He was lowered to the floor on a stretcher and taken to hospital. The extent of his injuries is unknown. Station manager Paul Webster said ""it was an unusual incident"" for the firefighters.

"Paul Bocuse has been described as the ""pope"" of French gastronomy France's most celebrated chef Paul Bocuse has died at the age of 91, after suffering from Parkinson's disease for several years. He died in his famous restaurant near Lyon, a local chef close to the family told AFP news agency. French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute, describing him as the ""incarnation of French cuisine"". Bocuse rose to fame in the 1970s as a proponent of ""nouvelle cuisine"", a healthier form of cooking. The movement ""profoundly changed"" French cooking, Mr Macron said. ""His name alone summed up French gastronomy in its generosity and respect for tradition but also its inventiveness,"" the French president said. Chefs across the country would be ""crying in their kitchens"", he added. Bocuse's restaurant, L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges, has had three Michelin stars since 1965 and he was named ""chef of the century"" by Michelin's rival guide, the Gault-Millau, in 1989, and again by the Culinary Institute of America in 2011. He was also a larger-than-life character who reportedly referred to himself in the third person, told People magazine in 1976 that women were ""good cooks, but they are not good chefs"" and maintained two long-term extramarital relationships while also having a series of shorter affairs. He defended his lifestyle in a 2005 interview with the Daily Telegraph,external. ""A lot is being made about my private life, and why not?"" he said. ""I adore women and we live too long these days to spend a whole life with only one. I work as if I will live to be 100, and I enjoy life as if the next day will be my last."" Tributes have poured in. French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb tweeted: ""Paul Bocuse is dead. Gastronomy is in mourning. ""Mr Paul was France. Simplicity and generosity. Excellence and art of living. The pope of gastronomes leaves us. May our chefs, in Lyon, as in the four corners of the world, long cultivate the fruits of his passion."" Allow Twitter content?

"Turkish war planes hit Kurdish positions on the Syrian side of the border on Saturday Turkish war planes have launched air strikes on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria in a move likely to raise tensions with the US. Turkey wants to oust the YPG militia, which it calls a terrorist group, from Afrin region on its southern border. The US-backed YPG says at least nine people were killed in the air strikes. Russia has moved its troops away from Afrin, saying it is concerned but will not interfere. Syria denounced Turkey's ""aggression"" and ""brutal attack"". Turkey had been shelling the area for two days, ahead of its declaration of a military operation on Saturday. In a nutshell: The 100, 300 and 700-word story Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says Turkey has notified all parties involved - including the Syrian government - about the offensive. Syria denied this was the case. This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains On Saturday, Turkey announced that an air and ground campaign, dubbed ""Olive Branch"", had been launched at 14:00 GMT, targeting the Kurdish YPG (Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units) and Islamic State (IS) group jihadists. The operation would be carried out ""with respect for Syria's territorial integrity"", it added.  A later statement said 108 targets belonging to Kurdish militants had been hit. Pro-Turkey rebels, known as the Free Syrian Army, also began moving into the area, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. The YPG said the strikes had killed at least six civilians and three fighters, with another 13 civilians wounded. One of the fighters belonged to the YPG and the other two were from its all-female affiliate, spokesperson Birusk Hasaka said. Ankara also said there were casualties, but they were all Kurdish militants. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters that ground forces would join the operation on Sunday. Turkey's military has been shelling the area since Thursday, a move which it said was in response to fire coming from the area. On Saturday, a spokesperson for the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said it would have no choice but to defend itself if attacked. Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent, near border with Syria In mid-afternoon the Turkish air strikes began, with plumes of smoke rising above Afrin. On the ground, Syrian rebel fighters backed by Turkey moved in, the military incursion rather inappropriately named Operation Olive Branch. President Erdogan has vowed to wipe out a corridor, first Afrin and then the nearby town of Manbij, from where the YPG has failed to withdraw. Nobody can object when what we do is necessary, he said. We will get rid of these messy terrorists trying to invade our country. But the risks are huge - the offensive pits Turkey against its Nato ally the US, which backs the Kurdish militia against IS, infuriating Ankara. Russia, which has troops in the area, has urged restraint - an MP in Moscow says it will be discussed at the UN. The Syrian regime warned it would be seen as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. An estimated half a million people have been killed in the Syrian war. With this new front, the danger is that number will rise again. The YPG has been a key part of the battle against IS in Syria, and has been supported by the US. Turkey, however, believes the group has links to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), and has for several months been threatening to clear Kurdish fighters from Afrin and another city, Manbij, which lies 100km away. Turkey's military plans seem to have been accelerated by an announcement from the US that it will help the SDF alliance build a new ""border security force"" to prevent the return of IS. Saturday's air strikes raise the prospect of deeper strains between Turkey and the US The YPG and SDF deny any terrorist links - a claim backed by the US government. But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the border force a ""terror army"". Disagreement over the Kurdish fighters has created a sharp division between the Nato allies. The US state department has appealed for calm, and attempted to downplay portrayals of a new ""border force"", instead characterising the new development as security training. Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria Who are the Kurds? Russia's foreign ministry says it is concerned by news of the offensive, and is urging restraint. It said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his American counterpart Rex Tillerson had discussed ""measures to take aimed at securing stability in the north of the country"". Russian senator Frants Klintsevich - who is the deputy chairman of the defence and security committee - earlier told Interfax news agency that Moscow would only respond if Russian bases in Syria were threatened. He said that Russia has been placed in a difficult situation, as it has ""good relations with both Damascus and Ankara"". Turkey's military and intelligence chiefs had been trying to get Russia's agreement to allow Turkish planes to use the Russian-controlled airspace above Afrin. Moscow is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and until now, had a contingent of soldiers at the airport in the centre of Afrin. It is not yet clear if Russia's claim that it will not interfere precludes allowing use of its airspace. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also discussed the military offensive with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. No details of the conversations have been provided.

"The first episode of Britannia is more confusing than a technical lecture on Bitcoin delivered in Mandarin by someone with a partial grasp of both subject and language. Characters are introduced at a rate that makes speed-dating look like a form of courtship, storylines are scattered as if seeds to the wind, and the overuse of sweeping drone shots of fields and gorges left me reaching for a travel sickness pill. All of this while indistinguishable tattooed blokes with long hair go at each other hammer-and-tongs in a blood bath overflowing with gore. At this early stage it didn't feel so much like an epic fantasy to compete with Game of Thrones, more an ancient version of Rugby Special. We're in Britain, AD43. A Roman army of 20,000 troops led by General Aulus Plautius (who looks like Ed Balls but is actually David Morrissey) has invaded our Scepter'd Isle to do what Caesar couldn't; that is, to tame, tax, and take control. David Morrisey as the ruthless Roman general, Aulus Plautius This time around the competition doesn't appear to be up to much. The two main tribes are too busy fighting each other to care about foreign invaders, while the Druids are preoccupied with inhaling vast quantities of weed and just being plain weird. There is also an outcast (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) who howls at the moon and runs about, but what could one dishevelled loony do against the might of Rome (the top brass of which have been ordered to speak like Russell Crowe in Gladiator)? Not a lot you'd think. Nikolaj Lie Kaas as Divis, once a Druid, who has fallen out of favour But then as the writer Jim Thompson once said about the art of telling tales, 'there is really only one story, and that is nothing is what it seems.' And so it is with Britannia, a nine-part series that appears to be an incomprehensible mess at first, but turns into a reasonably compelling mythical tale liberally laced with violence, humour and otherworldliness. It is in the strange rites and rituals to be found in the edgelands of rural Britain that Jez Butterworth, one of the three-man writing team behind Britannia, specialises. There is nobody better at capturing the sacred and profane nature of our age-old cults and cultures. Anyone who has seen his play The Ferryman currently running in the West End, or before it Jerusalem with Mark Rylance as Jonny 'Rooster' Byron, will know that. Mackenzie Crook, almost unrecognisable, as the chief Druid, Veran, who speaks for the gods Mackenzie Crook was in Jerusalem with Rylance, playing a local lad under Byron's charismatic spell. In Britannia, Crook has been upgraded to the main man - a wizardy sort called Veran who has terrible skin and a wicked stare. He is the leader of the Druids, and as such, has a direct line to the gods, who are unseen but ultimately control everything. A bit like bankers, I suppose. It is to the gods everyone must answer, even the cold and calculating Aulus, whose Machiavellian tactics are to divide and rule. It is a job made much easier for him by the leaders of the two tribes who are constantly, and literally, at each other's throats. ZoÃ« Wanamaker as Antedia, the fierce Queen of the Regni The foul-mouthed Queen Antedia (ZoÃ« Wanamaker in a role too trivial for such a talented actor) of the Regni wants vengeance for her son's private parts, which were whipped off the unsuspecting dope by the Cantii's flame-haired maverick, Kerra (Kelly Reilly). She couldn't care less, as long as she can wear green and continue to flirt with her hunky Gaul friend (Stanley Weber). Kerra (Kelly Reilly), the headstrong warrior and daughter of King Pellenor The acting, directing, scripting are all fine, sometimes they are very good, but the show has yet to really take off, although the potential is there. Obviously the whole thing is silly. It is not a history programme, it's a fantasy drama with all the swords, sorcery and stone circles you could hope for. If you like that sort of thing you'll probably like Britannia, if you don't you won't.

"This video can not be played The team took 62 days to complete the challenge Six women from the British Army have become the largest all-female group to ski coast-to-coast across Antarctica. The Ice Maiden team began the 1,000-mile expedition on 20 November - each pulling an 80kg sledge behind them. After 62 days on the ice, the six soldiers crossed the finish line at the Hercules Inlet just before 10:00 GMT. Completing the challenge, Maj Nics Wetherill said: ""I'm just so incredibly proud of the team. I can't believe how far we've come."" The women left Heathrow on the 25 October The group was expected to take between 75 and 90 days, with the women tackling winds of up to 60mph and temperatures reaching as low as -40C. Maj Wetherill, of the Royal Army Medical Corps in Portsmouth, added: ""This journey has had good times, bad times and great times for all concerned, and each of them, I know, has made us better people."" Congratulations have been coming in for the group. The Countess of Wessex, who met the team at the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst in September, sent a series of tweets congratulating the women, saying: ""You have achieved your dream and performed an incredible feat of endurance physically and mentally, all while smashing the previous record!""

The soldiers also received congratulations from Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. He said: ""They are an inspiration to us all and are role models to young people across the country."" The team held a Remembrance service on 11 November Maj Wetherill came up with the idea along with Maj Nat Taylor, also of the Royal Army Medical Corps. They said they wanted to inspire women of all ages and abilities. The only conditions for applicants were they were serving in the Army, regular or reserve. In total, 250 people came forward. Applicants were put through rigorous tests in the UK and Norway before the final six were picked. The team have been skiing through temperatures as low as -40C The other four members of the team were reservist Maj Sandy Hennis of the Royal Signals, Capt Zanna Baker and Lt Jenni Stephenson, both of the Royal Artillery, and Honourable Artillery Company reservist Lance Sgt Sophie Montagne. Maj Taylor said: ""I have spent the last few days trying to imprint this beautiful landscape in my mind. ""We have called it home for close to two months now and I will, in a strange way, miss it a lot."" The women celebrated Christmas during the expedition Maj Hennis told the BBC: ""It feels pretty amazing. ""It was really key for me to be part of an all-female team because I really want to inspire other women, specifically women, to get out there and do things they wouldn't normally be doing, or think would be possible. ""We set what was an impossible challenge and achieved it, so anything is possible."" Speaking from base camp, Capt Baker said she had dreamt of taking on the challenge for 10 years.

The case - which happened in Lowestoft on 27 December - is one of 41 in the east of England highlighted to the BBC by an ambulance service whistleblower. The leaked document lists patients who died or suffered harm over the Christmas and New Year period. The East of England Ambulance Trust said it was formally investigating the patient's death. The whistleblower's information comes in the wake ofseparate revelations from the Norwich South Labour MP Clive Lewis earlier this week that 20 people had died during delays in a 12-day period. Commenting on the Lowestoft case, the ambulance service said police called in with concerns about a man who was sitting outside his home. As he was breathing and conscious with ""no obvious injuries"", the service said it decided he did not need an ambulance. A second call about the same man was made about 19 hours later by a third party who reported him not to be breathing and in cardiac arrest. An ambulance arrived within eight minutes of that second call, the service said. The man was found to be dead. The leaked document said the patient ""appears to have frozen to death"". The ambulance trust said it was not in a position to confirm the cause of death as that could only be done by a doctor or a coroner. The BBC understands the patient involved was a man in his 50s. Suffolk police has been approached for a comment on its involvement in the case. All of the delays listed in the document sent to the BBC happened between 18 December and 3 January. The 17 cases listed in Essex include one in Benfleet in which a patient fell before going into cardiac arrest. The ambulance was delayed by more than six hours. The patient died In Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, a patient died on 27 December while waiting for an ambulance that took more than 13 hours to arrive A patient in Norwich waited more than seven hours after going into cardiac arrest. The patient died A patient in Bushey, Hertfordshire, died after going into cardiac arrest. The ambulance took 47 minutes to arrive OnThursday it emerged the ambulance trust's medical director Mark Patten was leaving. The trust said the decision had been made some time ago. Mr Patten, who had served as medical director at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital, joined the board of the ambulance trust in July 2016. A trust spokeswoman said: ""The trust had plans in place however experienced extreme levels of demand over the new year period in particular. ""The trust was unable to respond to a very small number of the 50,000 calls we handled over a 15 day period as quickly as we would like. ""The trust is undertaking a rigorous analysis of that small proportion of calls. Where any suspected cases of potential harm are identified, then the trust will exercise its duty of candour to notify patients or their families.""

"Celine Dookhran was found dead in an empty house in Kingston Upon Thames A woman who survived an alleged attack by an accused rapist and murderer has described what she thought would be her last moments alive. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told a court how Mujahid Arshid, 33, raped her then slashed her neck and wrists with a knife before telling her she had 10 minutes to live. Mr Arshid is also accused of raping and murdering 20-year-old Celine Dookhran. He denies all charges. Ms Dookhran's body was found ""stuffed"" inside a chest-high freezer in July 2017 in an empty house in Kingston, south London. On day three of the trial, the Old Bailey was played a video interview the surviving woman gave from her hospital bed to detectives two days after the attack. Jurors heard how both women ""tried to relate"" to Mr Arshid before he took Ms Dookhran, his niece, upstairs. The woman, in her 20s, described hearing screaming and thudding, before eventually ""there was no more noise."" When the alleged killer emerged he said Ms Dookhran was ""sleeping upstairs,"" jurors heard. Mujahid Arshid (left) and Vincent Tappu are charged with kidnapping Ms Dookhran and the second woman Arshid then ordered the woman to get into the freezer but she wedged her body and claimed she could not fit in, she said. She started fighting the defendant, but he overpowered her before attacking her with a knife, the court heard. ""I was trying to play dead. He molested Celine's body while she was dead and then he molested me thinking I was dead. He's such a psycho. ""He said okay you've got 10 minutes to live,"" the woman said. ""I genuinely thought I was dying,"" she added. After the defendant realised she was still alive she convinced him not to attack her further by saying ""I love you"" and ""we can run away together,"" the court heard. He initially refused, but she insisted that ""I can take this pain away"" and held his hands to keep them away from the knife, jurors heard. She then described seeing the defendant put Ms Dookhran's bloodied body in the freezer and having ""to act like it wasn't affecting me."" Jurors heard the woman's ordeal ended when Mr Arshid drove her to meet his brother, who intervened and took her to hospital. The court previously heard how Mr Arshid was ""sexually fixated"" with both women and was""inspired"" by infamous acid bath killer John George Haigh. He and co-defendant Mr Tappu both deny the kidnap of Ms Dookhran and the second woman, conspiracy to falsely imprison them both, and possessing a firearm with intent, namely a Taser. Mr Tappu, 28, from Acton, is accused of assisting in the initial kidnap, but is not said to have travelled to Kingston. Mr Arshid, of no fixed address, is further charged with sexual assault and assault by penetration against the second woman. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Republican Leader Senator Mitch McConnell accused the Democrats of ""irresponsible political games"" The US government has begun shutting down many of its services after the Senate failed to agree on a new budget. A bill to fund the federal government until 16 February did not receive the required 60 votes amid a bitter dispute over immigration and border security. It is the first shutdown ever to happen while the same party, the Republicans, controls Congress and the White House. The impasse will affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and the recriminations have already begun. President Donald Trump accused Democrats of putting politics above the interests of the American people. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But the leading Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, blamed the president, saying Mr Trump had turned down two bipartisan compromise deals and ""did not press his party in Congress"". The last government shutdown was in 2013, and lasted for 16 days. As of 00:01 Saturday (05:01 GMT), many federal agencies are no longer open for business - although essential services will continue to run. Most staff in the departments of housing, environment, education and commerce will stay at home.,externalHalf of workers in the treasury, health, defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work on Monday. This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown National parks and monuments could face closure, which provoked an angry public reaction during the 2013 shutdown. Visa and passport processing could also be delayed. But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation. Why the US government has shut down Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The game of chicken ended with a head-on crash. Republicans are anxious to label this the ""Schumer shutdown"" and, essentially, they're right. Chuck Schumer and his fellow Democrats (with the help of a few Republicans) blocked a bill that would have kept the government open - at least temporarily. Determining responsibility and apportioning blame, however, are two decidedly different endeavours. Democrats will argue that they had a deal with the president on their bipartisan compromise that included immigration reform - only to have him back away during that fateful obscenity-laden Oval Office meeting last week. Republicans will frame this as liberals putting undocumented immigrant protections over military readiness and health insurance for poor kids. The blame game began at midnight, and the winner has yet to be decided. Generally, the loser in these types of showdowns is the party entering the fight with the lowest popularity - bad news for Mr Trump and the Republicans. The good news, for both sides, is that their political bases will be thrilled they are playing hardball. Midterm election years, like 2018, tend to encourage this kind of rally-the-base manoeuvres. Now that the line has been crossed, this could become a protracted, ugly fight. The main bone of contention has been Democrats' demands for more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children to be protected from deportation. These ""Dreamers"", as they are known, were granted temporary legal status under a programme established by former President Barack Obama. In September, Mr Trump announced he was ending the programme and allowing Congress until March to come up with a replacement. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The Republican president and congressional conservatives have been using the issue as a bargaining chip in an attempt to wring concessions from Democrats. Mr Trump wants funding for tough new border controls, including his proposed US-Mexico wall. Republicans added a sweetener to the bill in the form of a six-year extension to a health insurance programme for children in lower-income families. But Democrats want this programme extended permanently. This video can not be played ""America is the only country I've known"" says this Dreamer The legislative negotiations went up in flames last week after Mr Trump allegedly complainedthe US was letting in immigrants from certain ""shithole countries"". Despite blaming each other, both the Republican and Democratic leaders said they would continue to talk over the weekend. Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said there was a ""really good chance"" it could be resolved before government offices open again on Monday. But the White House took a tough line after the midnight deadline passed,external, tweeting that it would ""not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands"". However, with mid-term elections looming in November, neither party wishes to be held accountable for closing the government. The shutdown began on the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. He has delayed a trip to his Florida resort where he is due to host a party - with attendees paying as much as $250,000 (Â£180,000; â¬204,500) - to mark the event. Many federal employees were forced to take a leave of absence - officially known as being furloughed - during the 16 days of shutdown. At its peak, some 850,000 employees were off work each day. It cost the government $2bn in lost productivity andled to ""significant negative effects on the economy"", the OMB said at the time.,external Donald Trump, interviewed by Fox and Friends at the time, laid the blame for the shutdown with the then president, Barack Obama.,external ""The problems start from the top and have to get solved from the top,"" he said.

"The bus crashed into several trees, causing many casualties Eleven people have been killed after a bus taking families on a school holiday skiing trip crashed while travelling on a motorway in north-western Turkey, local officials say. Some 46 others were injured in the accident, they add. The bus was travelling overnight from the capital, Ankara, to the Uludag resort near the city of Bursa. It crashed into trees in the region of Eskisehir in what were said to be good road conditions, reports say. Eskisehir governor Ozdemir Cakacak, quoted by the Dogan news agency, said it was not clear what caused the accident as the road was not wet or frozen. Those injured were currently being treated at three different hospitals, he added. It is not known if there are any children among the victims. The two drivers, who were slightly injured, have been arrested, and an investigation has been launched, according to Dogan. Turkey has a poor track record in road safety, with more than a million accidents in 2016 and 7,300 deaths, according to official statistics, the AFP news agency reports.

"Mary Lou McDonald was confirmed as the nominee for Sinn FÃ©in president on Saturday Mary Lou McDonald has been confirmed as the only candidate nominated to replace Gerry Adams as Sinn FÃ©in president. Mr Adams has led the party since 1983. He announced his intention to stand down in November 2017. Sinn FÃ©in's ard comhairle (high council) met in Belfast on Saturday to formally ratify the nominee. This video can not be played Sinn Fein's Mary Lou McDonald said she hoped for a united Ireland Ms McDonald said that no-one would fill the shoes of Gerry Adams, ""but the news is that I brought my own"". A special party conference to elect the new leader will be held on 10 February. It means the party is set to be led by a woman for the first time in its modern history. The last female president was Margaret Buckley, who led the party between 1937 and 1950, however, Sinn FÃ©in has suffered a number of splits since Ms Buckley's time as leader. Profile: 'Marmite' Mary Lou McDonald? Profile: Gerry Adams Ms McDonald said she ""did not for a moment underestimate the scale of this undertaking on a personal and political level"". ""I grew up watching Gerry Adams on the telly, l would certainly never have guessed that come February 10 2018, that I would be the boss of him,"" she said. ""The truth is no-one will ever fill Gerry Adams' shoes, but the news is that I brought my own. ""I will fill my shoes, I will walk in my shoes and we together over the coming years will walk a journey that is full of opportunities, full of challenges but I believe which marks a defining epoch, a defining chapter in our achievement of a united Ireland and the ending of partition."" Mary Lou McDonald had in the past said she would like to see a contest for the Sinn FÃ©in leadership, however she didn't get her wish. She takes over from Gerry Adams at an interesting time in Irish politics; with an expected abortion referendum, on-going Brexit negotiations, possible general and presidential elections in the Republic- never mind the negotiations in Northern Ireland to restore devolution. Ms McDonald is expected to spend most of her time south of the border but as the leader of an all-island party she will also have to keep a close eye on developments in the other jurisdiction. As she has no paramilitary background the party will be hoping that she may help garner Sinn FÃ©in support in more middle class areas and amongst women. Butthe Barry McElduffaffair shows the legacy of the Troubles at the moment is never very far away for Sinn FÃ©in - probably no matter who is leader. Ms McDonald said she believed Irish unity was the best solution ""for all of our people including our unionist brothers and sisters"". Mr Adams said his decision to step down as leader was ""part of Sinn FÃ©in's 10-year plan for the regeneration and renewal of the party"". He also told the meeting of his concerns that politics in Northern Ireland was ""very polarised at this time and that the atmosphere is very toxic"". ""It is my view that this is not good for anyone except a small minority of bigots,"" he said. Nominations for the presidency closed on Friday at 17:00 GMT, and Ms McDonald was the sole candidate.

"The bus crashed into several trees, causing many casualties Eleven people have been killed after a bus taking families on a school holiday skiing trip crashed while travelling on a motorway in north-western Turkey, local officials say. Some 46 others were injured in the accident, they add. The bus was travelling overnight from the capital, Ankara, to the Uludag resort near the city of Bursa. It crashed into trees in the region of Eskisehir in what were said to be good road conditions, reports say. Eskisehir governor Ozdemir Cakacak, quoted by the Dogan news agency, said it was not clear what caused the accident as the road was not wet or frozen. Those injured were currently being treated at three different hospitals, he added. It is not known if there are any children among the victims. The two drivers, who were slightly injured, have been arrested, and an investigation has been launched, according to Dogan. Turkey has a poor track record in road safety, with more than a million accidents in 2016 and 7,300 deaths, according to official statistics, the AFP news agency reports.

"Mary Lou McDonald was confirmed as the nominee for Sinn FÃ©in president on Saturday Mary Lou McDonald has been confirmed as the only candidate nominated to replace Gerry Adams as Sinn FÃ©in president. Mr Adams has led the party since 1983. He announced his intention to stand down in November 2017. Sinn FÃ©in's ard comhairle (high council) met in Belfast on Saturday to formally ratify the nominee. This video can not be played Sinn Fein's Mary Lou McDonald said she hoped for a united Ireland Ms McDonald said that no-one would fill the shoes of Gerry Adams, ""but the news is that I brought my own"". A special party conference to elect the new leader will be held on 10 February. It means the party is set to be led by a woman for the first time in its modern history. The last female president was Margaret Buckley, who led the party between 1937 and 1950, however, Sinn FÃ©in has suffered a number of splits since Ms Buckley's time as leader. Profile: 'Marmite' Mary Lou McDonald? Profile: Gerry Adams Ms McDonald said she ""did not for a moment underestimate the scale of this undertaking on a personal and political level"". ""I grew up watching Gerry Adams on the telly, l would certainly never have guessed that come February 10 2018, that I would be the boss of him,"" she said. ""The truth is no-one will ever fill Gerry Adams' shoes, but the news is that I brought my own. ""I will fill my shoes, I will walk in my shoes and we together over the coming years will walk a journey that is full of opportunities, full of challenges but I believe which marks a defining epoch, a defining chapter in our achievement of a united Ireland and the ending of partition."" Mary Lou McDonald had in the past said she would like to see a contest for the Sinn FÃ©in leadership, however she didn't get her wish. She takes over from Gerry Adams at an interesting time in Irish politics; with an expected abortion referendum, on-going Brexit negotiations, possible general and presidential elections in the Republic- never mind the negotiations in Northern Ireland to restore devolution. Ms McDonald is expected to spend most of her time south of the border but as the leader of an all-island party she will also have to keep a close eye on developments in the other jurisdiction. As she has no paramilitary background the party will be hoping that she may help garner Sinn FÃ©in support in more middle class areas and amongst women. Butthe Barry McElduffaffair shows the legacy of the Troubles at the moment is never very far away for Sinn FÃ©in - probably no matter who is leader. Ms McDonald said she believed Irish unity was the best solution ""for all of our people including our unionist brothers and sisters"". Mr Adams said his decision to step down as leader was ""part of Sinn FÃ©in's 10-year plan for the regeneration and renewal of the party"". He also told the meeting of his concerns that politics in Northern Ireland was ""very polarised at this time and that the atmosphere is very toxic"". ""It is my view that this is not good for anyone except a small minority of bigots,"" he said. Nominations for the presidency closed on Friday at 17:00 GMT, and Ms McDonald was the sole candidate. Ms McDonald, 48, an English literature graduate from Trinity College Dublin, has been a TD (MP) for Dublin Central since 2011. Mary Lou McDonald is set to replace Gerry Adams as leader of the party Before getting elected to the DÃ¡il (parliament) she was an MEP representing the Dublin constituency - becoming Sinn FÃ©in's first MEP in the Republic of Ireland in 2004. Her personal story is very different from other leading Sinn FÃ©in politicians. She comes from a middle-class background and was brought up in Rathgar, which is viewed as one of Dublin's most desirable suburbs.

"Boonchai Bach faces up to four years in jail for smuggling parts of protected animals Thai police have arrested a man alleged to be the head of Asia's biggest illegal wildlife trading networks. Boonchai Bach, a 40-year-old Thai of Vietnamese origin, was detained in a town on the border with Laos. He faces up to four years in jail for smuggling protected animal parts like rhino horns and elephant ivory. Animal trafficking is a lucrative black market trade. Police said the suspect was ""ringleader"" of a ""major smuggling syndicate"" operating over a decade. He was arrested on Friday over the smuggling of 14 rhino horns worth around $1m (Â£700,000) from Africa to Thailand. After tracking all the people involved in the consignment of rhino horn which was stopped last month, the police say they have enough evidence to charge him. Photo of butchered rhino wins top award Ivory seizures hit record levels last year, report says Laos is 'world's fastest growing' ivory market Boonchai Bach was known to run a business from a small border town on the Mekong River, over which illicit goods are often smuggled to Laos, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. Laos is one of the main routes through which poached animal parts from Africa and Asia are moved to buyers in Vietnam and China. However, despite the recent success of the Thai authorities in intercepting shipments of wildlife parts, they have been unable to break up the large and powerful trafficking networks, our correspondent says. The anti-trafficking group Freeland, which helped to find the evidence, believes Boonchai Bach's arrest will seriously disrupt his alleged wildlife smuggling operation, which it says is one of the biggest in this region. The Bachs have ""long run the international supply chain of illicit wildlife from Asia and Africa to major dealers in Laos, Vietnam and China"", Freeland said in statement.

"Tom Petty died in October aged 66 US musician Tom Petty died of an accidental overdose after taking various painkillers, according to a statement issued by his family. Petty ""suffered from many serious ailments...most significantly a fractured hip"", the statement said. Family members say they believe he was overusing prescription pain medication when he died in October aged 66. Petty found fame as the lead singer of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, with hits like American Girl and Breakdown. Tom Petty: A quiet, unassuming rock legend He was also a co-founder of the Traveling Wilburys group in the late 1980s, recording albums with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne and George Harrison. Petty was found unconscious, not breathing and in full cardiac arrest at his Malibu home on 2 October. He was taken to hospital, but could not be revived and died later that evening. Petty's family met with a medical examiner on Friday morning and updated his fans on Facebook.,external ""On the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication"", the statement said. ""We knew before the report was shared with us that he was prescribed various pain medications for a multitude of issues including Fentanyl patches and we feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident."" They added that his death ""may spark a further discussion on the opioid crisis and we feel that is a necessary and healthy discussion"". Why opioids are such an American problem The Los Angeles coroner's office attributed his death to ""multisystem organ failure"" due to a ""mixed toxicity"" of seven medications. They are fentanyl, oxycodone, emazepam, alprazolam, citalopram, acetyl fentanyl, and despropionyl fentanyl. Years of over-prescription of opioid painkillers in the US has created a nationwide addiction crisis, with patients turning to heroin and other street drugs when their prescriptions stop. In 2016, opioid-related overdoses increased by 28%, killing 42,249 people.

"Chris Young was 13 when Lynn Ward taught him English An author is trying to trace the English teacher who supported him after his mother died and his alcoholic father could not cope. Chris Young appealed on Twitter for help in finding Lynn Ward, who taught at Lodge Park School in Corby in 1978. He tweeted: ""I'd dropped into the bottom quarter for English at school. My #EnglishTeacher Miss Ward pulled me out of that ditch."" The message has been shared and retweeted 30,000 times. Chris Young was about nine when this photo was taken Lodge Park's principal Leo Gilbert said he hopes Mr Young ""can share with Ms Ward just what she has meant to him over the years"" Mr Young was 12 when his mother died and 13 when Miss Ward ""treated me like a rock star, loved what I wrote and got me to talk in front of the class"". ""I went from being in the bottom quarter for English to fourth in the year, so it was a huge transition,"" he said. The former Edinburgh-based social workeris now a mental health campaigner,externalliving in Ilmington in Warwickshire. He recently published his first book,externaland would like Miss Ward to attend its launch in Edinburgh on 1 February.

Mr Mutch is contacting a former colleague who may still be in touch with Miss Ward. The school, now called Lodge Park Academy, has retweeted his appeal and also has ""a number of feelers out"". Principal Leo Gilbert said: ""It is wonderful when teachers get the recognition they deserve for having a lasting impact on young people's lives.""

"It was a busy morning for Donald Trump on Twitter, and his latest fusillade is creating headaches for his own party. First, the president denied a statement from his chief of staff yesterday that his views on a Mexican border wall had ""evolved"" (despite the fact that he has, in fact, changed his position). Then he threw sand, a wrench, an entire toolbox into the gears of his party's efforts to pass a temporary spending bill to keep the government open past Friday night. The Republican strategy, crafted by congressional leadership, was to pass a bill that would receive enough Republican support to overcome unified Democratic resistance in the House and then jam Senate Democrats into either grudgingly voting for the bill or forcing a politically fraught shutdown over protections for undocumented immigrants. A key piece of this strategy was to include long-term funding for Chip, a health insurance programme for children from low-income families, in the measure. It's something most Republicans support and Senate Democrats would be reluctant to be seen voting against. The glide path to a temporary budget extension, while bumpy, was realistic. Instead, the president shot down the Chip provision in a Thursday morning tweet. ""Chip should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 day, or short term, extension!""he wrote,external. Donald Trump's Thursday morning tweet could complicate matters for Republican congressional leaders The White House press shop has since scrambled to insist the president supports the funding legislation, but in the meantime hardline House conservatives are dragging their feet and some Republican senators have said they're done with stopgap measures. If they stick to their guns, Democrats will have all the cover they need to blow up the Republican plan and put immigration back on the table as a government shutdown looms at midnight on Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan are insisting that it is congressional Democrats who are endangering efforts to keep the government open and reach long-term solutions on military spending, the federal budget, immigration and Chip. Those types of assertions, however, are much more difficult when the president isn't reading from the same script, and members of the party - on the right and the middle - are pulling in different directions. In the end, this could be a test of exactly how much influence the president, with his early morning tweets and contradictory public statements, wields over the legislative process. On Wednesday, Mr McConnell said he had no idea what the president wanted out of an immigration compromise. ""As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels,"" Mr McConnell said. That's a remarkable statement coming from a high-ranking Republican in the midst of a budget crisis. And the reality is that, whether they know what the president wants or not, Congress needs to do something by the end of Friday to prevent a government shutdown. At present, Republicans - who control the White House and Congress - seem all over the map on how to stop everything from grinding to a halt. When, in just over 10 months, the party will be making a pitch to voters across the US that you should be entrusted to continue running the country, that's a very dangerous place to be. Democrats will certainly be quick to point out that, last May, the presidenttweeted,externalthat he thought the country needed a ""good shutdown"" to fix the Washington mess.

"Outside observers could be forgiven for being a little mystified at news that the US government has shut down. So what is going on and how did we get here? It's when parts of the US government close until the government can decide on spending plans. Many federal agencies close down, so that potentially hundreds of thousands of government employees have to take a leave of absence, often without pay. Services such as national security, electricity generation and air traffic control continue, but others considered non-essential, like visa and passport processing, could be delayed. US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said that over 50% of his department would not go to work, and some of the military's maintenance, training and intelligence operations would come to a halt. The Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open. When they closed during the 2013 shutdown there was an angry public reaction. A spending bill - called an appropriations bill in US political parlance - had to be passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump by midnight on Friday 19 January. This did not happen, and without an agreement on spending the federal government effectively closes its doors. As ever in politics, that depends on your point of view. Republicans are labelling it the Schumer shutdown, blaming Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who led the Democrats to block the bill. But Democrats say they had a deal on immigration - a major sticking point - before the president backed out. Correspondents say the winner of the blame game has yet to be decided, but the Republicans are going into the fight with lower popularity. Yes. The US government has closed for business several times before. The most recent shutdown lasted 16 days in 2013, when Republicans demanded the spending bill have provisions to impede or delay President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. National monuments and parks were closed and hundreds of thousands of government workers put on unpaid leave. Only one person was left to patrol the 5,525 mile (8,891km) border with Canada. But this is the first time since 1980 that a budget impasse has led to a shutdown when both chambers of Congress and the White House are controlled by the same party - the Republicans. 10 consequences of the US shutdown in 2013 Hopes for a long-term spending bill, funding the US government for the entire 2018 budget year that ends in October, have long since vanished. The measure that failed to pass on Friday evening would have kept Washington running until 16 February, and then the whole showdown would have resumed all over again. It was crafted by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate and included a few sweeteners to make it easier to vote for (and more difficult to vote against). Several unpopular healthcare taxes were suspended in this bill. They also offered full re-authorisation for six years of the Children's Health Insurance Programme (Chip), which provides coverage for low-income families but is on the verge of running out of funds. But these sweeteners were not sweet enough, and the bill failed to pass. On Wednesday the Republican game plan seemed clear. Pass the temporary funding, with the sweeteners, over unanimous Democratic opposition in the House of Representatives. Then essentially dare Democrats to block the bill in the Senate, denying money for poor children and forcing a shutdown. The ground beneath the party began to crack on Thursday, however. The president tweeted that he didn't support the inclusion of Chip funding in the stopgap bill, forcing a White House scramble to explain that Mr Trump still backed the legislation. The House of Representatives passed the bill, but a handful of Republicans in the Senate said they would vote no. And the Senate Democrats announced they had enough votes on their own to block passage. Ultimately, the bill failed by a margin of 50-49, well short of the 60 votes required. Take your pick: a comprehensive immigration deal that includes Daca protections (for Democrats) border security, immigration reform and funding for a border wall (for Mr Trump) increasing military spending (for defence hawks) The presences (or absence) of any of the above could all have been reasons for legislators to go from yes to no. Mr Trump has called for a ""nuclear option"" of lowering the number of votes required to pass. An absolute majority (51%) would be easier for the Republicans to reach than the current 60% threshold. This would need to be led by Mr McConnell, but he has said he and other Republicans are opposed to it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A type of shallot used in Iranian cooking could help ""reverse the tide"" of drug-resistant TB, researchers found A type of onion could help the fight against antibiotic resistance in cases of tuberculosis, a study has suggested. Researchers believe the antibacterial properties extracted from the Persian shallot could increase the effects of existing antibiotic treatment. They said this could help ""reverse the tide"" ofdrug-resistant TB, which infected 490,000 people in 2016.,external But they said the research was still in its early stages and clinical trials would need to follow. Why is it so difficult to discover new antibiotics? Patients 'need rest, not antibiotics' In the ongoing study, led by Birkbeck, University of London and University College London, the research team conducted tests on four different molecules from the shallots, which are a staple of Iranian cooking. They found all four showed a significant reduction in the presence of the bacteria in the multidrug-resistant TB - the most promising candidate of which inhibited growth of the isolated TB cells by more than 99.9%. The team concluded that the chemical compounds could be used alongside existing antibiotics to combat strains of TB which have developed resistance to anti-bacterial drugs. The team concluded that the chemical compounds may work as templates for the discovery of new drug treatment to combat strains of TB Dr Sanjib Bhakta, one of the study's authors, from Birkbeck's department of biological sciences, said: ""Despite a concerted global effort to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, approximately 10 million new cases and two million deaths were reported in 2016. ""In searching for new anti-bacterials, we tend to focus on molecules that are potent enough to be developed commercially as new drug entities by themselves. ""However, in this study we show that by inhibiting the key intrinsic resistance properties of the TB, one could increase the effects of existing antibiotic treatment and reverse the tide of already existing drug resistance."" Prof Simon Gibbons, another of the authors, and head of UCL's department of pharmaceutical and biological chemistry, said: ""Natural products from plants and microbes have enormous potential as a source of new antibiotics. ""Nature is an amazingly creative chemist and it is likely that plants such as the Persian shallot produce these chemicals as a defence against microbes in their environment."" In October, England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, urged global leaders to tackle the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Medical experts say these drugs are being used too much, and that 25,000 people die across Europe each year because of drug-resistant infections.

"Facebook said it will now tell users which news outlets are reliable Facebook has announced it will prioritise news sources deemed to be more trustworthy on its News Feed. The firm said,externalthe social network community would determine which outlets are reliable via the use of user surveys. Founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said news content would soon make up around 4% of what appeared in people's News Feeds - down from 5% before. The move is the latest attempt by the company to quell the spread of so-called fake news and propaganda on the network. Mark Zuckerberg vows to 'fix' Facebook As part of that continuing battle,Twitter also announced on Friday,externalthat it had notified 677,775 US-based users who had retweeted, liked or followed Russian bot accounts on the network in the run up to the 2016 US presidential election. The change is an attempt to shift the key judgements over bias and accuracy away from Facebook's employees, and onto its user base. ""We could try to make that decision ourselves, but that's not something we're comfortable with,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""We considered asking outside experts, which would take the decision out of our hands but would likely not solve the objectivity problem. Or we could ask you - the community - and have your feedback determine the ranking."" Users will be asked, as they sometimes are about advertising, whether they recognise a news brand and if they trust it. Facebook's theory - yet to be tested on a large scale - is that while there are many partisan outlets that have readers that trust them, there is a smaller subset of media companies that a majority people find ""broadly trustworthy"", whatever their particular leanings. Representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were grilled on the issue of online disinformation at a US Senate hearing last October ""There's too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarisation in the world today,"" wrote Mr Zuckerberg, who recently announced that his challenge this year was to essentially ""fix"" Facebook. ""Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don't specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them."" The news ranking system will first be tested on US-based users only, and the results of the survey will not be made public. ""This is one of many signals that go into News Feed ranking,"" a Facebook spokesman told the BBC. ""We do not plan to release individual publishers' trust scores because they represent an incomplete picture of how each story's position in each person's feed is determined."" As with any algorithm change, be it Facebook or any other major web service, there will be some that benefit and others that will struggle. Facebook - the secret election weapon Among the winners will likely be traditional media organisations with long histories or a strong broadcast presence, such as the New York Times or BBC. However, emerging brands will suffer if recognition is not as strong, regardless of whether the content is trustworthy or not. For instance, Buzzfeed's initial beginnings as a viral site would have almost certainly hindered its growth into a serious news organisation had it been subject to the ideas about to be put in place by Mr Zuckerberg's team. Also, it is unclear how trustworthy, specialist news organisations with smaller readerships - such as science publications - will be treated under these rules, though Facebook's head of News Feed Adam Mosseri said local news would at least be protected. ""We're making it easier for people to see local news and information in a dedicated section. ""We'll continue to work on ways to show more local news that is relevant to where people live.""

"Prime Minister Theresa May and President Donald Trump will meet at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week, Downing Street has confirmed. It comes afterMr Trump cancelled plans to open the new $1bn (Â£720m) US Embassy in London next month. The White House said Mr Trump ""looks forward"" to strengthening the countries' ""special relationship"". Mr Trump is the first sitting US president to attend the forum in the Swiss city since Bill Clinton in 2000. A Downing Street spokesman said the ""bilateral meeting"" would take place ""in the margins"" of the forum. Mrs May was the first foreign leader to visit Mr Trump at the White House,after his inauguration in January 2017. The two leaders also met at theG7 summit in Sicily in mayand at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July. However, in November, the prime minister criticised Mr Trump for retweeting three inflammatory videos posted online by the far-right group, Britain First. After Mrs May's spokesman said it was""wrong for the president to have done this"", he hit back on Twitter and told the British leader to not ""focus on me, focus on the destructive radical Islamic terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom"".

Mrs May more recently discussed Brexit and events in the Middle East in a pre-Christmas phone call with Mr Trump.

Reality Check: Who sold the US embassy in London? However, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who has clashed with the president in the past - said Mr Trump had ""got the message"" that many Londoners were staunchly opposed to his policies and actions.

"The Church of England has warned the future existence of people with Down's Syndrome is ""under question"". It has called for expectant mothers to be given ""comprehensive, unbiased information"" ahead of the NHS roll-out of Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) in England and Wales this year. The blood test for high-risk women can offer an estimate of Down's risk. But the Church is concerned it could lead to more abortions on women carrying children with Down's Syndrome. The Church's ruling General Synod will debate ""valuing people with Down's Syndrome"" when it meets next month. Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that typically causes some level of learning disability and characteristic physical features. NIPT involves taking a blood sample from the woman to look for DNA from the baby circulating in her blood. The new test should cut the number of women who need riskier diagnostic tests in pregnancy that can cause a miscarriage. A world without Down's syndrome? Safer Down's test backed for NHS use But Rev Dr Brendan MCCarthy, the CoE's national adviser on medical ethics, said there was ""anecdotal"" evidence that some women were told there was ""bad news"" if their unborn children were diagnosed with Down's Syndrome - and immediately offered terminations. Actress and screenwriter Sally Phillips, whose son Olly has Down's, addressed this in the BBC documentary, A world without Down's syndrome. ""The doctor said to us: 'I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.' The nurse on duty cried. I don't think anyone said anything at all positive,"" she said. ""It wouldn't have been any different if they'd told me my child wasn't going to make it."" Sally Phillips and her son Olly Dr McCarthy said information given to mothers should include advice on whether they want to undergo NIPT at all. The NHS test is optional and women who find out their baby has Down's will get support from health professionals to help make a decision on whether to continue their pregancy, NHS England says. Church of England policy opposes abortion, though recognises that there can be circumstances in which a termination is ""the lesser moral difficulty"". ""There is a problem that if women are not given up to date information with regard to Down's syndrome, it is possible that it may seem the natural thing to do, the normal thing to do is to go along a pathway that would lead to increased terminations of pregnancy,"" Dr McCarthy said. The National Screening Committee has said while it is aware there may be an impact on abortion, the voluntary test was there to give women information and it was up to them what happened next. NIPT is also offered by private clinics. The Church said these providers should be subject to increased regulation. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics previously found some private clinics givingtoo little advice and support.

"Jewish leaders have called for the resignation of a coroner in north London in a dispute over delays in releasing bodies for burial. Under Jewish and Islamic law, bodies must be buried on the day of death or as soon as possible afterwards. But Mary Hassell has said she would not fast-track inquests based on religion. Her jurisdiction includes parts of north London which are home to large communities of orthodox Jews and Muslims. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said they had a ""deeply disappointing"" meeting with the senior coroner for Inner North London. Abdul Hai, councillor with responsibility for community cohesion in the London borough of Camden, has also called for Ms Hassell to quit. The board's vice president, Marie Van Der Zyl, told BBC News: ""It's disrupting family life to such an extent that people don't want to die within Inner London North. ""To say they don't want to die there, they're too frightened to die, is something that's so traumatising and so against Jewish values and indeed it affects Muslims as well. ""It's at the heart of both of our faiths for there to be speedy burial."" Ms Van Der Zyl described the early release of bodies to those families who want it as ""basic human rights"" and added: ""Not only is Ms Hassell failing to respect those rights, but she shows no inclination to do so. ""She has lost the confidence of the Jewish community, and appears to have no interest in winning it back."" Ms Hassell said, in response to a complaint, that ""no death reported to my office will be prioritised over any other because of the religion of the deceased or family"". Judicial and council officials refused to respond to the allegations, and there was no response at St Pancras Coroner's court, where Ms Hassell works.

"This video can not be played Peruvian indigenous people greeted the Pope on Friday Pope Francis has used a visit to Peru to sound a stark warning about the pressure on the Amazon and its peoples posed by business interests. He told indigenous people in the small town of Puerto Maldonado that the region had never been so threatened. Tribal elders called on him to help protect them, saying they were being driven from their lands. The pontiff arrived in Peru from Chile, where he became embroiled in a row over clerical sex abuse. He drew anger by accusing victims of a paedophile priest of slandering a bishop they accuse of trying to cover up the priest's crimes. The Argentine Pope, 81, is on the second and final leg of a week-long tour of Latin America. Profile: Pope Francis Peru country profile Bare-chested tribesmen, their bodies painted and their heads crowned with colourful feathers, danced and sang for the pontiff in Puerto Maldonado, an AFP news agency correspondent reports. The pontiff is in Peru for a three-day visit People from across the Amazon basin region of Peru, Brazil and Bolivia had travelled in their thousands to meet him. ""The native Amazonian peoples have probably never been so threatened on their own lands as they are at present,"" Francis said, his speech punctuated by applause and the beating of drums. ""The Amazon is a territory that is being disputed on many fronts.  On the one hand, pressure being exerted by great business interests seeking petroleum, gas, lumber, and gold and on the other, the threat against the territories also comes from the perversion of several policies that promote conservation without considering humans. ""Yes, for some, you are considered an obstacle or a disturbance but all of you are the cry to the conscience."" Illegal gold mining camps have blighted the Madre de Dios region ""They enter into our territories without asking us and we suffer a lot and we will die when they drill into our land to retrieve the black metal water,"" Yesica Patiachi, a Peruvian indigenous representative, told the Pope. ""We will suffer when they poison and spoil our rivers, converted into black water of death. The outsiders see us as weak people and insist in taking away our territory in different ways. If they succeed in taking away our lands we might disappear."" Madre de Dios, the region around  Puerto Maldonado, has been blighted in recent years by unregulated gold mining, leading to dangerous levels of mercury in rivers, Reuters news agency reports. Activists and tribespeople have been attacked by illegal loggers and drug traffickers in other parts of the Peruvian Amazon. The Camisea gas reserves in the Cusco region are coveted by legal foreign companies. ""We have to break with the historical paradigm that views Amazonia as an inexhaustible source of supplies for other countries without concern for its inhabitants,"" the Pope added on Friday. On a visit near the northern city of Iquique,Francis said there was ""no proof"" for claims that abuse by Father Fernando Karadima had been covered upby Bishop Juan Barros. One of Karadima's victims, Juan Andres Murillo, responded by saying the Pope's words were unacceptable. ""The Pope called our statements against Bishop Barros's concealments 'slander',"" he told AFP. ""As we confirmed with our lawyers, 'slander' is the imputation of a false fact. This is serious and we can't accept that."" Bishop of Osorno, Juan Barros, denies allegations he covered up sexual abuse The Catholic Church suffered a body blow in Chile in 2010 when Karadima was publicly accused of molesting several teenage boys in the capital, Santiago, starting in the 1980s. In 2011 the Vatican found him guilty and sentenced him to a lifetime of  ""penance and prayer"". He never faced criminal prosecution in Chile as too much time had passed, butthe judge who heard victims' testimony in a year-long investigation described them as ""truthful and reliable"".

"President Donald Trump has called off a trip to his Florida golf club this weekend until a deal can be struck The US government is approaching a federal shutdown after the Senate failed to agree on a new budget. It was unclear which way the vote would go as the midnight deadline approached, with Republicans and Democrats split on key issues. Despite last minute bipartisan meetings, the bill to fund the government until 16 February did not receive the required 60 votes. The last US shutdown happened in 2013 and lasted for 16 days. The House of Representatives voted 230-197 on Thursday night to extend funding until next month, but the measure failed to pass the Senate. Many government offices will close unless a compromise is found before the midnight deadline. If the shutdown goes ahead essential services will still run. That includes national security, post, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity production. National parks and monuments could face closure, which provoked an angry public reaction during the last shutdown. In the hours before the vote, President Donald Trump sounded pessimistic, tweeting that it was ""not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border"". He had invited Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, to the White House for last-ditch talks but they failed to find sufficient common ground. Emerging about an hour later, Mr Schumer told reporters ""some progress"" had been made, but a ""good number of disagreements"" remained, including a difference in opinion regarding the Democrats' desire to extend talks for another five days.

A sticking point has been the deportation threat hanging over more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children The main bone of contention has been Democrats' demands for more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children to be protected from deportation. These ""Dreamers"", as they are known, were granted temporary legal status under a programme established by former President Barack Obama. In September, Mr Trump announced he was ending the programme and allowing Congress until March to come up with a replacement. This video can not be played ""America is the only country I've known"" says this Dreamer The Republican president and congressional conservatives have been using the issue as a bargaining chip in an attempt to wring concessions from Democrats. Mr Trump wants funding for tough new border controls, including his proposed US-Mexico wall. Republicans have added to the bill a sweetener in the form of a six-year extension to a health insurance programme for children in lower-income families. They are essentially daring Democrats to vote against a measure that has been a longstanding liberal priority. But Democrats say they want this programme extended permanently. The legislative negotiations went up in flames last week after Mr Trump allegedly complainedthe US was letting in immigrants from certain ""shithole countries"". This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The blame game is already in full swing with neither party wishing to be held accountable for closing the government as midterm elections loom in November. This would be the first shutdown while one party is in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, which could be politically embarrassing for Republicans. A new Washington Post-ABC poll,externalsuggests that by a 20-point margin more Americans blame President Trump and his party for the imbroglio, rather than Democrats. But a shutdown would also be problematic for 10 Democratic senators who are up for re-election this year in states won by Mr Trump. They would face voters this autumn amid a hail of attack ads claiming they closed the US government to help illegal immigrants. Be careful what you wish for, Mr Trump In a late-night speech on the Senate floor, top Republican Mitch McConnell accused Democrats of trying to ""hold the entire country hostage"". Mindful of the risks, Democrats have shifted their messaging in recent days to say their opposition is about much more than just immigration. Democrats hope to make it instead about the president and Republicans' ability to govern. Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen tweeted of Mr Trump: ""This man doesn't comprehend work ethic, the office of President, or duty to the country. He understands golf, ice cream, and Big Macs!"" US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said that over 50% of his department would not go to work, and some maintenance, training and intelligence operations would come to a halt. ""We do a lot of intelligence operations around the world and they cost money, these obviously would stop,"" Mr Mattis said when asked about the impending shutdown, ""it's got a huge morale impact."" The Trump administration is reportedly making contingency plans to keep the parks running if no deal is reached. Visa and passport processing could also be delayed.

"Trump signed a bill to increase Nasa funding last March It's a quarter of the way through Donald Trump's presidential term - long enough to judge his performance so far. There have been promises kept, promises broken and promises ignored. But how much have his policies changed things? A business tycoon with no political experience, he said he came to Washington to make waves. Has he succeeded? The Trump administration tackled the immigration issue pretty much right out of the gate, with its ill-fated executive order closing the US border to entrants from a handful of majority-Muslim nations. Implementation of that effort led to chaos at US airports and a quick suspension at the hands of US courts. Since then, the White House has rolled out two new border orders, adding a few countries to the banned list and removing one (Sudan). The latest measures have, at least so far, largely withstood legal challenge. Immigration enforcement has also been ramped up - 143,470 arrests for violations for the year ending in October - a 30% increase. Mr Trump also announced an end to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, which granted normalised residency status to roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US when they were young. The order has been temporarily suspended by the court, and is the subject of ongoing negotiations in Congress. About 200,000 Salvadoreans face an uncertain future because the White House has brought their temporary protected status (TPS) to an end. Mr Trump is pushing for sweeping changes to the US immigration system, including reductions in the total number of entrants, the termination of the visa lottery system and greatly reducing the ability of current US residents to bring relatives into the country. Those measures will be strongly opposed by Democrats, however. As for the Mexican border wall, perhaps the most memorable of Mr Trump's campaign promises, funding is still in doubt and - and the money to pay for it will almost certainly come from US taxpayers, not Mexico. Making waves?The president has sweeping authority on immigration and border issues - and he's used it, even if some lower courts have tried to clip his wings. Still, there's nothing Mr Trump would like more than to stand in front of a shiny, new border wall. Because of the controversial move by Senate Republicans to block consideration of Barack Obama's nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat in 2016, Mr Trump had the opportunity to put his mark on the high court just months after taking office. The president's judicial accomplishments stretch well beyond one Supreme Court pick, however. Senate Republicans also largely refused to confirm Mr Obama's lower court nominees for the last two years of his term, leaving a record number of open slots for Mr Trump to fill. He's had 12 circuit court and six district court judges confirmed so far. There are currently 149 vacancies left - with 47 presidential nominees awaiting Senate approval. All these judges will hold lifetime appointments, guaranteeing that after one year in office Mr Trump has already cemented a lasting conservative legacy on the US judicial branch. It's also a reason Republicans are eager to maintain control of the Senate in the upcoming mid-term elections. If Democrats take control, expect Mr Trump's ability to get his people on the federal bench to be sharply curtailed. Making waves?Through fortune and political force of will, the stars have aligned for conservatives eager to make their mark on the judiciary. Some were concerned that Mr Trump may be unreliable when it comes to picking nominees, but he's more than exceeded their expectations. In his inaugural address, Mr Trump outlined an ambitious new programme of US infrastructure investment. ""We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels, and railways, all across our wonderful nation,"" he said. ""We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labour."" Since then, Mr Trump's big infrastructure plan has always been just around the next bend of the road. Instead, Congress and the administration first focused on healthcare reform, an effort that ended in a string of disappointments. Then they turned their gaze on tax reform, which had a much happier ending. Aside from a few press events, such as a June announcement of an air traffic control initiative that has since gone nowhere, infrastructure talk has been little more than empty words. ""It's infrastructure week"", in fact, has become a running joke among Washington insiders grown used to seeing the White House's intended talking points and objectives derailed by controversies big and small. Making waves?Where would Mr Trump be today if he had led with a bipartisan infrastructure programme that was met with overwhelming public approval, instead of travel bans and an extended, acrimonious fight over healthcare? For much of the year, it looked as though Mr Trump's efforts to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a conservative plan would fall flat. It took two tries for the House of Representatives to pass a bill - which was unceremoniously abandoned by the Senate. The upper chamber's efforts to craft their own version were dramatically derailed by Senator McCain's late-night ""no vote"", and a subsequent, bare bones effort met with defeat as well. Beneath those dramatic legislative failures, however, the administration has taken significant steps to chip away at the foundations of the Democrat's signature law. The president suspended payments to insurance companies to help them control the costs of insuring poorer, sicker Americans. The administration greatly curtailed efforts to encourage Americans to sign up on the government-run health insurance exchanges - although enrolment numbers held firm in 2017. Congressional Republicans also placed a stick of Obamacare dynamite in the tax bill the passed in December, repealing the requirement that all Americans buy health insurance as of January 2019. The move could lead healthier Americans to forego insurance until they get sick, driving up premiums. Meanwhile, under Mr Trump's watch, Congress has yet to renew a health-insurance programme for children from less-affluent families, causing concern among states that manage the system. In October Mr Trump declared opioid addiction to be a public-health emergency, although no new resources have been allotted to deal with the situation and the order will expire later in January. Making waves?It's taken a year, but Mr Trump is making strides toward repealing Obamacare. The ""replace"" portion of the task, however, is still far out of reach. In meetings with foreign leaders, the president has repeatedly emphasised ""reciprocal"" trade and encouraged friendly nations to buy US-made products. The president quickly ended US participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and initiated talks with Canada and Mexico to restructure the North American Free Trade Agreement - negotiations that presently seem to be severely strained. The US and Canada have also been mired in a dispute over softwood lumber, dairy products and aircraft sales, leading to US ""duty investigations"" that could lead to new tariffs. In January, Canada filed a formal complaint against the US with the World Trade Organisation, alleging violations of international rules. What will Trump impact be on world trade? Although Mr Trump talked up confrontation with China on the campaign stump, action toward the US's largest trading partner has been muted. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit with China grew to $35.4bn in November, the largest gap over two years. The overall US trade deficit in November was $50.5bn, the largest in five years, indicating that the total mark for 2017 could reach five-year highs as well. While Mr Trump campaigned on closing the US trade gap, the widening deficit can be attributed largely to continued US economic growth. Making waves?Mr Trump has hinted at big trade moves to come, but in the first year the primary change is that US support for expanding free trade across the world has ground to a halt. This video can not be played What the world thinks of Trump What promises has Trump kept as president? 11 things we never said before Trump Trump defeat still haunts Democratic voters At the end of 2017, Mr Trump boasted that he had signed more legislation than any previous president. While that claim was clearly not true - the 94 bills that reached his desk rank well behind John F Kennedy's 684 and trail all modern presidents - he did close out the year with one major legislative accomplishment. Mr Trump promised voters he would enact major tax reform on individuals and businesses, and in the waning days of 2017 Republicans - with no Democratic support - enacted sweeping tax cuts for businesses and many Americans. Top personal rates were slashed, a tax credit for families with children was doubled and the standard deduction for individuals who do not itemise their tax returns was increased. The total cost of the changes to the tax code has been estimated at $1.5tn over 10 years - and it would be more, except the individual tax reductions are set to expire after eight years. Some of Mr Trump's more ambitious reform goals were left on the cutting room floor, however. While there are provisions to allow corporations to repatriate overseas earnings and changes to a more territorial-based business tax system to discourage outsourcing, there's little to encourage existing overseas factories to relocate back to the US. Another survivor was the carried-interest loophole used by hedge-fund managers and other powerful Wall Street investors to pay greatly reduced taxes - which was condemned repeatedly by Mr Trump during the campaign. There were also some prominent losers in the president's tax reforms, namely individuals in high-tax, largely Democratic states, who will lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes over a $10,000 cap. Mr Trump is revelling in the recent announcements by major corporations that they are passing some of their tax savings along to employees and customers - although polls continue to show that many Americans think the new law won't help their bottom line. Making waves?Mr Trump can lay claim to the most substantive change to US tax law in 16 years, enacting the kind of massive corporate tax cut that Republicans have been after for decades. In a mid-December press event, Mr Trump stood in a White House room next to a towering mound of white papers. ""For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regulations, rules, restrictions has cost our country trillions and trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, and devastated many industries,"" the president said. ""But all that changed the day I took the oath of office."" While it may not have happened quite so instantly, the first year of the Trump administration has seen a significant reduction in the amount of federal regulation, and no place has that been more marked than in the way the government deals with environmental issues. Shortly after his inauguration, Mr Trump gave final approval to several long-delayed oil pipelines. The recently completed tax bill opened vast swaths of Alaskan wilderness up to new oil and gas drilling. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt recently announced energy exploration would be permitted off much of the rest of the US coastline (although Florida, with its Republican governor, became a notable exception). The government's environmental department, the EPA, also rescinded Obama-era regulations on carbon emissions from coal-based power plants, although those changes will likely be bogged down in legal challenges for years. According to a New York Times tracker, the administration has sought to reverse at least 60 federal environmental regulations and has succeeded in 29 instances. Mr Trump also greatly reduced the amount of federal protected land in Utah, opening the door for increased development in the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. It was the largest such rollback in US history. On 1 June the president also announced the US was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, although the benchmarks the US agreed to were not mandatory. Making waves?President Obama had taken significant administrative steps to increase environmental regulation and enforcement over the objection of Republicans in Congress. Now the Trump administration is using that same authority to tear it all down. Mr Trump's first year in office has been filled with economic good news. The stock market, as the president frequently points out, is driving to new highs, with the Dow Jones index recently passing the 25,000 mark. Unemployment, which was at 4.8% when the president took office, has reached a 17-year low of 4.1%. In the third quarter of 2017, gross domestic product growth hit 3.2%, the highest level since the first quarter of 2015. The hard numbers indicating robust growth are translating into new levels of economic optimism. The US Consumer Confidence Index hit a 17-year high in November, before dropping slightly in December. Also in November, asmall-business confidence,externalindex hit the highest level in its 45-year history. Of course all these glowing numbers represent the continuation of trend-lines that began during the Obama administration - a fact that a majority of the nation seems to acknowledge. In a recentQuinnipiac survey,externalthat showed 66% of the public believes the economy is ""excellent or good"",  49% think it is because of Mr Obama while only 40% credit Mr Trump. Making waves?The rising economic tide is buoying Mr Trump's hopes that a public presently divided about his presidency will eventually give him his due. He has three more years to make his case. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump promised an ""America First"" foreign policy that asked allies to carry more of the financial and military burden. He's now had a year to show what that looks like in action. The president delivered a blunt speech to Nato allies in Belgium, surprising many observers by declining to reiterate US support for the pact's mutual-defence arrangements Mr Trump engaged in a very public exchange of insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, calling him ""little rocket man"" and saying his nation would be met with ""fire and fury"" if they continued their bellicose rhetoric. The most notable use of US military force during Mr Trump's first year was his missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to that nation's use of chemical weapons. The highest-profile incident of US combat casualties, on the other hand, came when a group of special forces were ambushed in Niger leading to four deaths - drawing attention to the increased US military presence in Africa. In Syria and Afghanistan, Mr Trump has given his generals a free hand to prosecute the ongoing military engagements. Over the course of the year, the so-called Islamic State has been largely defeated on the battlefield and its influence curtailed. The conflict in Afghanistan drags on, however, as the president increased the number of US troops there to 14,000. He also recently threatened to cut off aid to Pakistan if it does not do more to support the US fight against Islamic militants. Mr Trump put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, although the most dramatic development in that area was the president's move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital - thrilling the Israeli government but prompting stern condemnations from Palestinian officials and much of the global community. With great fanfare, he declined to recertify Iranian compliance with multinational nuclear deal, although that is largely a symbolic act unless sanctions that have been suspended are reimposed. Making waves?Mr Trump talks about foreign policy like no other modern American president. Critics will say he's undermining US standing on the world stage, but when it comes to actual policy this isn't the paradigm shift feared - or hoped for - by some There's never been an American president quite like Donald Trump. No one has ever held the office with no prior elective or military leadership experience. No one, in modern times at least, has been as blunt or as disruptive a force on the national and international stage. For many of the president's supporters, this is exactly what they wanted. They supported the candidate who told them the system was broken, the other politicians on the stage with him were phony and the process was a joke. They asked for different, and different is what they got. Mr Trump has said he is defining ""modern day presidential"" with his free-form use of social media, his continued practice of giving unscripted campaign-style rally speeches and his willingness to disregard many of the time-honoured traditions of politics. In some ways his has been a conventional presidency. His court appointments are largely in keeping with conservative desires, his tax package was a longtime Republican wish-list and his efforts at deregulation are out of the party's anti-big-government playbook. But the way Mr Trump has operated, and the way he has talked about how he is going about running the nation, has been one-of-a-kind. Making waves?It remains to be seen whether Donald Trump is permanently changing the way politics is conducted in the US. A quarter of the way through his term in office, however, it should be quite clear that US politics isn't changing Donald Trump.

"You can read an updated version of this pagehere. Donald Trump is a man who prefers plain speaking to the language of diplomacy. Find out what he has said about your country, which foreign leaders he has met or called since taking office, and which countries he has mentioned in his tweets. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001.On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country.Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated.Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,targeting a tunnel complexnear Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in thehuge blastand President Trumppraisedhis armed forces for ""another successful job"".Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzaisaidthe country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"".Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied.Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House.Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia.A Washington Postreportsaid Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before â maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump'sfirst visitto Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit.Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"".He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far.The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela.Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.As the African Union expressed ""shock, dismay and outrage"" and demanded an apology, Botswanasummoned the US ambassadorand asked the envoy ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US.""According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada.Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec.When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade beforetweetingthat the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president.With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (Â£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US.Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"".He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power andbannedthe Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off.President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"".The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June.But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods.""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" hetweetedin March.China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017.Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor.But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation.Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods.During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House.Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence.The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him.Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013.Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group.Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on aglowing orbat the meeting also set social media abuzz.The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president .Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in atweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"".But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"".President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel.But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence.During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world.Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017.President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year.The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"".The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit withone eye-catching moment of awkwardness- butsome reportssuggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.On immigration, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, hetweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"".While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix,according to BBC Reality Check. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"".He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation.""The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Hetweetedthat he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Securityannouncedthat Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidortold the BBCthe idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster.The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US,tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November.At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"".She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authoritiesreportedto have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017.The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting.Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US.Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country.One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless.During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives.However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phoneon 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters.Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear.Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends â fast friends â over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders alsodiscussedtheir continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.In August, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers.The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough.But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June.After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan.Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions.The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunkeron the course.Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea.Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis.Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now.In June, hetweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation.King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well.Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help.""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan.Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country.The two leadersdiscussedsecurity in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia.The US in Maysuspended$21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS.But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!""It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency.Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017.Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall.""More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall.""Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president.The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall.Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump.How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda ArderndeniedMr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" shetoldthe website newsroom.co.nz. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin November 2017 that it would remove the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Nicaragua, introduced in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America.Thousands of Nicaraguans living in the US will now have until 5 January 2019 to seek ""an alternative lawful immigration status"" or leave. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year.During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade.Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader.It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US.The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk.President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed.In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting.""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trumptweetedin March.Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"".The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US presidenttweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister SolbergmetMr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jetonly available in Call of Duty, a computer game.A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017.He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"".The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914.""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"".During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House.As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (Â£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.""Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila.His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far.After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people.During avisitthere in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance.""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition.Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"".In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia.At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election.""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia.A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia.In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump.Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (Â£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip.Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June.Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder.Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America.Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion.Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US.The proposed ban has beenpartly reinstatedby the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days.He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year.The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa,tweetingthat the country was a ""mess"".He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries.The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well.Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US.In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel.South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (Â£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year.Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year.At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence.Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"".Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list.The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US.It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry.More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February.""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes.It later emerged that Mr Trumphad been referringto a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013.But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape.Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he didphonethe Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president.When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trumptweetedin September 2013.But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action.""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trumpsaid. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy shipsfired 59 Tomahawk cruise missilesat a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trumpon the phonein February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"".One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"",according to the New York Times.The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list.The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality.President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" ina phone callwith its leader in February. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on.Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012.Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point).But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, whenclashesbroke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel.US Congress has called for criminalchargesagainst those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC.Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State.Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdoganreaffirmed their rejectionof the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017.The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments.Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say.But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift thesanctionswould be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko andencouragedthe European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trumpon the phonejust a few days after the former businessman became the new US president.The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East.The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move.Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al NahyandescribedMr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with.In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July.His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper.In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead.""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"".Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit.He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (Â£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled.Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela.""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" hetweetedin mid-February.Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him.Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro.In anOctober tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflectedstatements made by Mr Trumpat a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent aword of warningto President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company,gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committeeand a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"".Mr Trump waskeen to highlighta $12bn (Â£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruledPresident Donald Trump's travel banon six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has alsocalled on Saudi Arabiato ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of thefirst military operationauthorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader.The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed.It later emergedthat a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump.In aninterview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan.""ANew York Times articleclaimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.Mr Trump responded to criticism bytweetingthat it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"".Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She gota standing ovationand as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"". Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan.Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions.The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunkeron the course.Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea.Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis.Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now.In June, hetweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July.His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper.In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead.""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"".Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit.He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (Â£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled.Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president .Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in atweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"".But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"".President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel.But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders alsodiscussedtheir continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.In August, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world.Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017.President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year.The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"".The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit withone eye-catching moment of awkwardness- butsome reportssuggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.On immigration, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, hetweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"".While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix,according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US.Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"".He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power andbannedthe Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off.President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"".The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June.But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods.""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" hetweetedin March.China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada.Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec.When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade beforetweetingthat the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president.With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation.King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well.Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help.""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June.Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder.Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America.Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion.Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers.The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough.But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June.After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him.Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013.Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group.Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on aglowing orbat the meeting also set social media abuzz.The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House.Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia.A Washington Postreportsaid Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before â maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well.Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US.In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel.South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (Â£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year.Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017.He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"".The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia.At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election.""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia.A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia.In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump.Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (Â£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip.Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017.The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments.Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say.But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift thesanctionswould be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko andencouragedthe European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on.Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012.Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point).But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, whenclashesbroke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel.US Congress has called for criminalchargesagainst those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC.Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State.Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdoganreaffirmed their rejectionof the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year.At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence.Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"".Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November.At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"".She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authoritiesreportedto have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year.During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade.Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"".Mr Trump waskeen to highlighta $12bn (Â£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914.""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"".During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition.Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"".In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017.Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear.Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends â fast friends â over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!""It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency.Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017.Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall.""More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall.""Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president.The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall.Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump.How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far.The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela.Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February.""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes.It later emerged that Mr Trumphad been referringto a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013.But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape.Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he didphonethe Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence.During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001.On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country.Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated.Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,targeting a tunnel complexnear Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in thehuge blastand President Trumppraisedhis armed forces for ""another successful job"".Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzaisaidthe country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"".Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"".He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation.""The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS.But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied.Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda ArderndeniedMr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" shetoldthe website newsroom.co.nz. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump'sfirst visitto Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit.Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"".He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House.Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence.The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader.It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US.The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk.President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed.In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting.""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trumptweetedin March.Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"".The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US presidenttweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister SolbergmetMr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jetonly available in Call of Duty, a computer game.A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa,tweetingthat the country was a ""mess"".He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries.The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017.The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting.Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US.Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House.As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (Â£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.""Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila.His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far.After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people.During avisitthere in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance.""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives.However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phoneon 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters.Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trumpon the phonejust a few days after the former businessman became the new US president.The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East.The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move.Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al NahyandescribedMr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with.In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US.The proposed ban has beenpartly reinstatedby the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days.He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year.The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president .Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in atweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"".But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"".President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel.But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan.Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions.The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunkeron the course.Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea.Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis.Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now.In June, hetweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July.His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper.In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead.""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"".Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit.He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (Â£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled.Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well.Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US.In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel.South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (Â£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year.Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump.Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (Â£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip.Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada.Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec.When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade beforetweetingthat the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president.With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world.Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017.President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year.The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"".The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit withone eye-catching moment of awkwardness- butsome reportssuggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.On immigration, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, hetweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"".While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix,according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US.Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"".He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power andbannedthe Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off.President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"".The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June.But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods.""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" hetweetedin March.China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him.Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013.Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group.Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on aglowing orbat the meeting also set social media abuzz.The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition.Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"".In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia.At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election.""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia.A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia.In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on.Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012.Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point).But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, whenclashesbroke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel.US Congress has called for criminalchargesagainst those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC.Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State.Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdoganreaffirmed their rejectionof the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!""It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency.Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017.Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall.""More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall.""Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president.The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall.Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump.How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied.Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trumpon the phonejust a few days after the former businessman became the new US president.The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East.The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move.Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al NahyandescribedMr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with.In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House.As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (Â£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders alsodiscussedtheir continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.In August, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November.At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"".She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authoritiesreportedto have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives.However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phoneon 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters.Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation.King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well.Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help.""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017.Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June.Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder.Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America.Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion.Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001.On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country.Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated.Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,targeting a tunnel complexnear Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in thehuge blastand President Trumppraisedhis armed forces for ""another successful job"".Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzaisaidthe country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"".Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House.Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia.A Washington Postreportsaid Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before â maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017.He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"".The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda ArderndeniedMr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" shetoldthe website newsroom.co.nz. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers.The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough.But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June.After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year.At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence.Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"".Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (Â£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"".Mr Trump waskeen to highlighta $12bn (Â£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017.The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting.Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US.Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year.During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade.Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914.""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"".During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.""Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila.His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far.After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear.Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends â fast friends â over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa,tweetingthat the country was a ""mess"".He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries.The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan.Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country.The two leadersdiscussedsecurity in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia.The US in Maysuspended$21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February.""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes.It later emerged that Mr Trumphad been referringto a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013.But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape.Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he didphonethe Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trumpon the phonein February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"".One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"",according to the New York Times.The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list.The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality.President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" ina phone callwith its leader in February. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017.The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments.Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say.But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift thesanctionswould be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko andencouragedthe European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far.The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela.Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia.At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election.""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia.A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia.In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader.It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US.The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk.President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed.In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting.""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trumptweetedin March.Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"".The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US presidenttweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US.Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"".He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power andbannedthe Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off.President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"".The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June.But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods.""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" hetweetedin March.China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!""It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency.Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017.Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall.""More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall.""Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president.The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall.Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump.How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan.Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions.The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunkeron the course.Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea.Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis.Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now.In June, hetweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country.One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless.During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada.Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec.When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade beforetweetingthat the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president.With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president .Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in atweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"".But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"".President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel.But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president.When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trumptweetedin September 2013.But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action.""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trumpsaid. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy shipsfired 59 Tomahawk cruise missilesat a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well.Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US.In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel.South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (Â£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year.Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world.Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017.President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year.The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"".The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit withone eye-catching moment of awkwardness- butsome reportssuggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.On immigration, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, hetweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"".While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix,according to BBC Reality Check. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders alsodiscussedtheir continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.In August, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June.Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder.Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America.Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion.Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017.The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments.Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say.But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift thesanctionswould be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko andencouragedthe European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July.His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper.In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead.""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"".Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit.He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (Â£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled.Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump.Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (Â£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip.Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"".Mr Trump waskeen to highlighta $12bn (Â£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House.Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia.A Washington Postreportsaid Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before â maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives.However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phoneon 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters.Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation.King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well.Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help.""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on.Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012.Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point).But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, whenclashesbroke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel.US Congress has called for criminalchargesagainst those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC.Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State.Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdoganreaffirmed their rejectionof the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people.During avisitthere in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance.""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied.Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him.Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013.Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group.Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on aglowing orbat the meeting also set social media abuzz.The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers.The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough.But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June.After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela.""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" hetweetedin mid-February.Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him.Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro.In anOctober tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflectedstatements made by Mr Trumpat a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent aword of warningto President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company,gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committeeand a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year.At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence.Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"".Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001.On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country.Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated.Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,targeting a tunnel complexnear Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in thehuge blastand President Trumppraisedhis armed forces for ""another successful job"".Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzaisaidthe country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"".Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor.But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation.Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods.During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November.At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"".She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authoritiesreportedto have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February.""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes.It later emerged that Mr Trumphad been referringto a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013.But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape.Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he didphonethe Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017.He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"".The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump'sfirst visitto Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit.Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"".He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious""Belgium is a beautiful city"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition.Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"".In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"".He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation.""The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear.Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends â fast friends â over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster.The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US,tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US.The proposed ban has beenpartly reinstatedby the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days.He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year.The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence.During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914.""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"".During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017.Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.""Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila.His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far.After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Hetweetedthat he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Securityannouncedthat Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidortold the BBCthe idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year.During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade.Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. When Prime Minister SolbergmetMr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jetonly available in Call of Duty, a computer game.A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS.But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House.Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence.The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list.The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US.It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry.More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruledPresident Donald Trump's travel banon six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has alsocalled on Saudi Arabiato ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of thefirst military operationauthorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader.The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed.It later emergedthat a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump.In aninterview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan.""ANew York Times articleclaimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.Mr Trump responded to criticism bytweetingthat it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"".Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She gota standing ovationand as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"".

"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have spoken of their happiness about having adaughter by a surrogate. And for some surrogate mums, the experience of carrying another family's baby is just as joyful. Chloe is 28, a mum of three, and she gave birth to her first surrogate child in August 2017. She's been talking to Newsbeat about why she decided to become a surrogate after having her three children. ""When my daughter was born, it was the most amazing experience,"" she said. ""I instantly fell in love with this little baby and it broke my heart to think there are parents out there who will never have this."" Kim and Kanye welcomed a new daughter this week via a surrogate mum Chloe has a five-year-old and three-year-old twins. After the birth of their twins, she and her husband decided together that they wanted to help other families. Chloe joined Surrogacy UK, an organisation which supports surrogates and couples who are unable to have children, who they refer to as ""intended parents"". She was introduced to a couple and describes getting to know them as ""almost like dating."" ""You offer to exclusively get to know them,"" she says. ""We then spent just over four months getting to know each other. We did days out, takeaways in. Normal things you do with friends. ""We built up a relationship and we had faith and trust in each other so we started the IVF process. ""They used the biological mum's egg, the biological father's sperm - I was just the oven at the end. I did the cooking."" Chloe says it was easier explaining the surrogacy to her children than to many adults Chloe says her experience of surrogate pregnancy was very different to when she was expecting her own children. ""I was excited to be a mum and to welcome my babies into the world,"" she says. ""This time, I'd liken it to looking after someone else's child. ""I very much view it as a baby to give back, I don't view it as mine to give up."" And Chloe found it easier to explain the situation to her children than she did some adults. ""I said to my children the intended mother's tummy is broken and doesn't work properly so she can't have her babies so mummy is going to grow their baby and when it's all grown and born, we're going to give it back,"" she said. ""Adults on the whole tend to be a bit nosier, know biology a little bit better so they tend to ask a few more questions."" Chloe built a friendship with the intended family before starting IVF In the UK, it is illegal for surrogates to get paid for a baby, but during the pregnancy the intended parents will pay for the mum's essentials. And this comes in handy when pregnancy cravings strike. ""My expenses are covered, so things like fuel, clothing and all the extras that come with pregnancy, all the strange food cravings, all the late night trips to McDonalds for instance,"" says Chloe. ""I had a real hankering for those milkshakes."" She was able to claim expenses such as hospital trips and late night McDonald's from the intended family When Chloe gave birth, the intended parents had a room in the same hospital so the child could be a part of their family immediately. She says many adults struggle to understand why she would be a surrogate, but less than six months after giving birth, Chloe is ready to do it all over again. ""I am in that 'get to know' period with another couple,"" she says. ""I do feel like I've been pregnant forever but to be honest I adore pregnancy. I love being pregnant and I don't suffer like some people do. ""I honestly feel like I breeze it and my husband is willing to put up with me hormonal again."" ""It seems like a good time to do it again while I'm young and then I can say I've done my piece.""

"There's a warning that workers in your local nail bar could be victims of human trafficking. Rachel Harper, from the modern slavery charity Unseen, says they ""see a lot of cases"" in the nail salon industry. They want people to be able to spot the signs of modern slavery, as thenumber of potential victims is going up. It's not as simple as saying that all cheap nail bars exploit their staff, so it's important to be able to recognise those that do. Otherwise, says Rachel, victims of human trafficking will remain ""invisible to the person who doesn't know what to look for."" Nail salons illegally using victims of modern slavery are often cheaper for customers, the charity says. ""Unfortunately if we always go for the bargain then we might unwittingly be supporting the situation that's actually really exploitative for the staff,"" says Rachel. She wants us to ask ourselves: ""Is my discount worth the fact that someone might have lost all of their choice?"" ""[Illegal salons] are often not much cheaper than their legitimate counterparts,"" says Lesley Blair, chair of the British Association of Beauty Therapy & Cosmetology. ""You can get treatments that are price-competitive in legitimate salons,"" says Jean-Michel Chalayer, the founder of beauty treatment company LeSalon. That's why spotting other signs - like those listed above - are important. ""We are an industry which is supposed to pamper customers and make them feel good about themselves,"" he says. ""Having these problems give the whole industry a bad name."" His company checks paperwork and ensures all his beauticians have the right to work in the UK. If you think you have seen nail bars which may be exploiting victims of modern slavery, call the police. Rachel Harper from Unseen also says ""being a responsible customer is key."" She adds: ""I'm hoping that we as a society recognise it for the scourge that it is, and vote with our feet.""

"This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke says there will not be a judicial review The government will not challenge the decision to release rapist John Worboys, the justice secretary says. David Gauke said ""it would not be appropriate"" to seek a judicial review of the Parole Board's ruling to free Worboys after less than 10 years. Victims as well as the mayor of London are seeking a judicial review. The Parole Board has said it is ""confident correct procedures were followed"". Worboys, 60, was jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London. Mr Gauke said there would be a wider review of how the Parole Board deals with victims. The cabbie who preyed on young women The government had been considering the possibility of a legal challenge to Worboys's release, but the justice secretary said that, after consulting lawyers, it would not be appropriate for him to proceed. He said: ""I know this will disappoint the victims in this case and members of this House given the crimes for which he has been convicted. ""On a personal level, candidly I share those concerns."" He added his decision should not stop others from making their own legal challenge. ""Let me be absolutely clear, Worboys will not be released until his victims' representations have been properly considered and his licence conditions are in place."" Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them At his trial, the court heard how Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne, claiming he was celebrating a big lottery win. The former black cab driver was given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, with a minimum term of eight years, for public protection. Prosecutors believe Worboys - who changed his name by deed poll to John Radford - may have carried out more than 100 sexual assaults and rapes on women in London between 2002 and 2008. Victims' groups and representatives were outraged by the news of Worboys's imminent release earlier this month, saying many were not informed before it was made public. In response to the justice secretary, two women - a victim and a second woman who says Worboys attacked her in 2003 although her complaints never reached court - said theyintended to move forwardwith judicial review proceedings next week. They said, in a letter to the Parole Board on 16 January, he ""remains a danger to women and that everything should be done to stop his imminent release"". They are crowdfunding their action and have received more than Â£25,000. Lawyer Richard Scorer, from the firm Slater and Gordon which represented 11 victims in civil cases against Worboys, said his clients were ""disappointed"" at the government's decision, but would go forward with the victim judicial review. ""It is crucial that the decision to release this manipulative, calculating and dangerous man can be considered by the courts as soon as possible."" Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon called for an independent review of the case, saying it raised ""many serious questions"" and urging the government to ""restore public confidence in our justice system"". Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he would seek a separate judicial review, adding: ""I am deeply concerned and unhappy about the prospect of John Worboys's impending release. ""At the very least his victims and Londoners need the Parole Board's decision to be properly scrutinised by the courts. I will do all I can to ensure this happens."" Conservative MP and former mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmithpraised Mr Khan,externalfor ""taking the initiative"" against a ""perverse and appalling"" decision. But former prisons minister Crispin Blunt said Mr Gauke had ""rightly resisted the temptation to do a populist thing which would have been wasteful of taxpayers' money"", as a legal challenge from government would have had no reasonable prospect of success. The Parole Board said it welcomed the review into how it deals with victims. ""We think this is a sensible course of action to take to make sure that the public and especially victims have confidence in the Parole Board's work."" A judicial review is where a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision made by a public body - in this case, the Parole Board. It is less about whether the decision was right or wrong, and more about challenging whether proper procedures were followed to reach the decision. Hearings consider a number of different factors including whether prisoners have changed their behaviour, where they're going to live and what kind of support network they will have after release, Lucy Gampell, a Parole Board member,told Radio 4's The Briefing Room. In Worboys's hearing, the panel considered a dossier of 363 pages, questioned Worboys himself, heard evidence from four psychologists and prison and probations staff and were given a written statement from one of his victims. The final decision is based on future risk - not whether the original sentence was appropriate, Mr Hardwick said. In this case, Mr Gauke said he had two grounds open to him to order such a review: that a decision was one that no Board could reasonably have taken; or that there were significant procedural failings in the way that that decision was taken. His decision not to go ahead suggests he couldn't prove either, says QC and legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg. As Mr Gauke said in his statement, the bar for a review to succeed is ""very high"" and it is unprecedented for a secretary of state to bring a judicial review. As justice secretary, Mr Gauke can always advise Parliament to change the rules by which the Parole Board works. It's unusual for victims to challenge Parole Board decisions as - unsurprisingly - most disputes are about prisoners being denied release. A lawyer acting on behalf of two women who say they were sexually assaulted by Worboys has said they will bring their own review on two grounds: that the Parole Board rules are unlawful in that they prevent the publication of reasons for decisions; and the decision to release Worboys in light of facts surrounding his offence and reports of his progression in prison appears to be wholly irrational. On the first ground, David Gauke has called on a wider review of the Parole Board which is likely to cover this. The second ground will be difficult to prove without the publication of the details from the hearing. Mr Rozenberg said he struggles to see how the the victims would have a better chance of success than Mr Gauke. ""Judicial reviews are difficult and rightly so,"" he added. By BBC home affairs correspondent, Dominic Casciani We don't know why the justice secretary abandoned a proposed judicial review - but given the Parole Board is sponsored by his ministry, it's rather hard to see how he could challenge its workings if staff in prison supported the release decision. Judicial reviews are difficult to win. A claimant must prove that the public body acted illegally or took a decision that was so irrational or perverse that nobody else would come to the same conclusion. The potential judicial review from Worboys's victims is likely to argue that the Parole Board's rules are illegal because there is a clear public interest in revealing the secret reasons for the release decision - but also that whatever those reasons were, they must have been irrational given everything that is known about the serial attacker. While the Parole Board is a quasi court - arguments are put and judgements are made - its processes are entirely private. Victims and the public can't sit in and listen. In contrast, any of us can go to court and hear the detailed arguments presented to a judge deciding whether or not to jail a criminal.

"Kardashian West was told there could be health risks if she got pregnant again Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West have named their new-born daughter, delivered by surrogate on Monday, Chicago West. Kardashian West said that not carrying the child herself was ""so hard"", but that the couple had an instant connection with her. West was raised in the US city Chicago. Kardashian West carried and gave birth to her older children but was advised against getting pregnant again because of possible medical complications. Her daughter North is now four years old and her son Saint is two. But she suffered from pre-eclampsia and placenta accreta on those occasions. Pre-eclampsia is a condition that usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy and can cause serious complications including seizures and death if not monitored and treated. Placenta accreta is when the placenta attaches itself too deeply into the wall of the uterus and remains attached after childbirth. Kardashian West's daughter North was born in 2013 Kardashian West, a reality TV star, said in a post on her app that ""doctors said that it wasn't safe for my, or the baby's, health to carry my own"". The 37-year-old said she and her rapper husband decided to use a ""gestational carrier"", meaning the baby is ""biologically mine and Kanye's"". 'The greatest gift': How I became a surrogate Kim and Kanye welcome third baby Why I wanted to be a surrogate mum She wrote: ""Having a gestational carrier is definitely different, but anyone who says or thinks it's the easy way out is completely wrong. ""People assume it's better because you don't have to deal with the physical changes, pain or complications with delivery, but for me it was so hard to not carry my own child, especially after I carried North and Saint."" Kardashian West's surrogate was discussed on her reality show Keeping up with the Kardashians, but her identity was not revealed. The star said she had a ""great"" relationship with the surrogate, and ""trusted her completely throughout the entire process"". She added: ""I'm so grateful for modern technology and that this is even possible. It's not for everyone, but I absolutely love my gestational carrier and this was the best experience I've ever had. ""Having a gestational carrier was so special for us and she made our dreams of expanding our family come true."" The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star announced that her daughter was born at 12.47am on Monday and weighed 7lb 6oz. Meanwhile, a lawsuit filed by Blac Chyna against Kim Kardashian West and mother Kris Jenner has been ""tentatively"" dropped,according to TMZ,external. Blac Chyna, who has a daughter with Kim's brother Rob, was suing the pair after claiming they stopped the second series of E! show Rob & Chyna from being commissioned. The show documented the birth of their now one-year-old daughter Dream and was not renewed for another series. In December, lawyers for Jenner and the Kardashians filed for a dismissal of the lawsuit against them, which a judge has granted because there was no contract for the show's renewal.

"President Donald Trump has called off a trip to his Florida golf club this weekend until a deal can be struck The US government is approaching a federal shutdown after the Senate failed to agree on a new budget. It was unclear which way the vote would go as the midnight deadline approached, with Republicans and Democrats split on key issues. Despite last minute bipartisan meetings, the bill to fund the government until 16 February did not receive the required 60 votes. The last US shutdown happened in 2013 and lasted for 16 days. The House of Representatives voted 230-197 on Thursday night to extend funding until next month, but the measure failed to pass the Senate. Many government offices will close unless a compromise is found before the midnight deadline. If the shutdown goes ahead essential services will still run. That includes national security, post, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity production. National parks and monuments could face closure, which provoked an angry public reaction during the last shutdown. In the hours before the vote, President Donald Trump sounded pessimistic, tweeting that it was ""not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border"". He had invited Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, to the White House for last-ditch talks but they failed to find sufficient common ground. Emerging about an hour later, Mr Schumer told reporters ""some progress"" had been made, but a ""good number of disagreements"" remained, including a difference in opinion regarding the Democrats' desire to extend talks for another five days.

"This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke says there will not be a judicial review The government will not challenge the decision to release rapist John Worboys, the justice secretary says. David Gauke said ""it would not be appropriate"" to seek a judicial review of the Parole Board's ruling to free Worboys after less than 10 years. Victims as well as the mayor of London are seeking a judicial review. The Parole Board has said it is ""confident correct procedures were followed"". Worboys, 60, was jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London. Mr Gauke said there would be a wider review of how the Parole Board deals with victims. The cabbie who preyed on young women The government had been considering the possibility of a legal challenge to Worboys's release, but the justice secretary said that, after consulting lawyers, it would not be appropriate for him to proceed. He said: ""I know this will disappoint the victims in this case and members of this House given the crimes for which he has been convicted. ""On a personal level, candidly I share those concerns."" He added his decision should not stop others from making their own legal challenge. ""Let me be absolutely clear, Worboys will not be released until his victims' representations have been properly considered and his licence conditions are in place."" Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them At his trial, the court heard how Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne, claiming he was celebrating a big lottery win. The former black cab driver was given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, with a minimum term of eight years, for public protection. Prosecutors believe Worboys - who changed his name by deed poll to John Radford - may have carried out more than 100 sexual assaults and rapes on women in London between 2002 and 2008. Victims' groups and representatives were outraged by the news of Worboys's imminent release earlier this month, saying many were not informed before it was made public. In response to the justice secretary, two women - a victim and a second woman who says Worboys attacked her in 2003 although her complaints never reached court - said theyintended to move forwardwith judicial review proceedings next week. They said, in a letter to the Parole Board on 16 January, he ""remains a danger to women and that everything should be done to stop his imminent release"". They are crowdfunding their action and have received more than Â£25,000. Lawyer Richard Scorer, from the firm Slater and Gordon which represented 11 victims in civil cases against Worboys, said his clients were ""disappointed"" at the government's decision, but would go forward with the victim judicial review. ""It is crucial that the decision to release this manipulative, calculating and dangerous man can be considered by the courts as soon as possible."" Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon called for an independent review of the case, saying it raised ""many serious questions"" and urging the government to ""restore public confidence in our justice system"". Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he would seek a separate judicial review, adding: ""I am deeply concerned and unhappy about the prospect of John Worboys's impending release. ""At the very least his victims and Londoners need the Parole Board's decision to be properly scrutinised by the courts. I will do all I can to ensure this happens."" Conservative MP and former mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmithpraised Mr Khan,externalfor ""taking the initiative"" against a ""perverse and appalling"" decision. But former prisons minister Crispin Blunt said Mr Gauke had ""rightly resisted the temptation to do a populist thing which would have been wasteful of taxpayers' money"", as a legal challenge from government would have had no reasonable prospect of success. The Parole Board said it welcomed the review into how it deals with victims. ""We think this is a sensible course of action to take to make sure that the public and especially victims have confidence in the Parole Board's work."" A judicial review is where a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision made by a public body - in this case, the Parole Board. It is less about whether the decision was right or wrong, and more about challenging whether proper procedures were followed to reach the decision. Hearings consider a number of different factors including whether prisoners have changed their behaviour, where they're going to live and what kind of support network they will have after release, Lucy Gampell, a Parole Board member,told Radio 4's The Briefing Room. In Worboys's hearing, the panel considered a dossier of 363 pages, questioned Worboys himself, heard evidence from four psychologists and prison and probations staff and were given a written statement from one of his victims. The final decision is based on future risk - not whether the original sentence was appropriate, Mr Hardwick said. In this case, Mr Gauke said he had two grounds open to him to order such a review: that a decision was one that no Board could reasonably have taken; or that there were significant procedural failings in the way that that decision was taken. His decision not to go ahead suggests he couldn't prove either, says QC and legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg. As Mr Gauke said in his statement, the bar for a review to succeed is ""very high"" and it is unprecedented for a secretary of state to bring a judicial review. As justice secretary, Mr Gauke can always advise Parliament to change the rules by which the Parole Board works. It's unusual for victims to challenge Parole Board decisions as - unsurprisingly - most disputes are about prisoners being denied release. A lawyer acting on behalf of two women who say they were sexually assaulted by Worboys has said they will bring their own review on two grounds: that the Parole Board rules are unlawful in that they prevent the publication of reasons for decisions; and the decision to release Worboys in light of facts surrounding his offence and reports of his progression in prison appears to be wholly irrational.

"Matt is a 28-year-old nurse but he's decided to leave the profession, less than four years after qualifying. He's not alone.Figures given to the BBCfrom NHS Digital show that there are now more leavers than joiners to the profession. Nurse leaders said it was a ""dangerous and downward spiral"", but NHS bosses said the problem was being tackled. Matt has written a letter to his patients about why he's had to give up. ""To my patients. ""As a nurse, one of the joys of my job is working with a wide variety of patients, like yourselves. ""I enjoy talking to you all, talking to your relatives, getting to know you and hearing your stories. ""Meeting you on day one, when you come onto the ward, when you might be very poorly and feeling rubbish. ""When I make you feel better with the treatment I've given you, the goal of getting you to walk out feeling like a different person - it's so rewarding. ""Seeing that positive impact that I've had, on yourselves and your families, that is one of the big things that I'll really miss. ""The decision I have made was not an easy one, as my love for nursing and caring for people is difficult to put into words. ""However, I feel with the current situation of the NHS, now is the time to leave before the situation becomes any worse. ""It was after two weeks signed off with depression that discussions started between myself and my wife. ""We talked about how a change needs to be made and that the focus within the NHS is purely financial rather than the safety of patients and staff. ""With more and more cuts to budgets, all hospital staff, not just nurses, are being asked to pick up more and more responsibility. ""And this is without any prospect of recognition in the form of removing the pay cap for nurses. ""Coming into work every day filled me with dread. ""This was because I had to risk my job and personal reputation due to poor hospital trust management. ""Throughout my training and working within the NHS, every single nurse I have worked with would always go that extra mile to ensure the highest level of patient care is given. ""Often this meant working extra hours, staying late or working shifts. ""Unfortunately, this extra demand, from personal experience is both physically and mentally draining. ""It is with regret, and I am really sorry to you all, that I have to leave the NHS in the current situation that it is in. ""I do feel like I am abandoning you slightly, but I feel it is a change that needs to be made for people higher up, such as Jeremy Hunt, who need to see the scale that this problem is. ""But hopefully, one day, I will be able to return once the problem is sorted and continue to help build your futures as well as my own. ""Kind regards, Matt.""

"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have spoken of their happiness about having adaughter by a surrogate. And for some surrogate mums, the experience of carrying another family's baby is just as joyful. Chloe is 28, a mum of three, and she gave birth to her first surrogate child in August 2017. She's been talking to Newsbeat about why she decided to become a surrogate after having her three children. ""When my daughter was born, it was the most amazing experience,"" she said. ""I instantly fell in love with this little baby and it broke my heart to think there are parents out there who will never have this."" Kim and Kanye welcomed a new daughter this week via a surrogate mum Chloe has a five-year-old and three-year-old twins. After the birth of their twins, she and her husband decided together that they wanted to help other families. Chloe joined Surrogacy UK, an organisation which supports surrogates and couples who are unable to have children, who they refer to as ""intended parents"". She was introduced to a couple and describes getting to know them as ""almost like dating."" ""You offer to exclusively get to know them,"" she says. ""We then spent just over four months getting to know each other. We did days out, takeaways in. Normal things you do with friends. ""We built up a relationship and we had faith and trust in each other so we started the IVF process. ""They used the biological mum's egg, the biological father's sperm - I was just the oven at the end. I did the cooking."" Chloe says it was easier explaining the surrogacy to her children than to many adults Chloe says her experience of surrogate pregnancy was very different to when she was expecting her own children. ""I was excited to be a mum and to welcome my babies into the world,"" she says. ""This time, I'd liken it to looking after someone else's child. ""I very much view it as a baby to give back, I don't view it as mine to give up."" And Chloe found it easier to explain the situation to her children than she did some adults. ""I said to my children the intended mother's tummy is broken and doesn't work properly so she can't have her babies so mummy is going to grow their baby and when it's all grown and born, we're going to give it back,"" she said. ""Adults on the whole tend to be a bit nosier, know biology a little bit better so they tend to ask a few more questions."" Chloe built a friendship with the intended family before starting IVF In the UK, it is illegal for surrogates to get paid for a baby, but during the pregnancy the intended parents will pay for the mum's essentials. And this comes in handy when pregnancy cravings strike. ""My expenses are covered, so things like fuel, clothing and all the extras that come with pregnancy, all the strange food cravings, all the late night trips to McDonalds for instance,"" says Chloe. ""I had a real hankering for those milkshakes."" She was able to claim expenses such as hospital trips and late night McDonald's from the intended family When Chloe gave birth, the intended parents had a room in the same hospital so the child could be a part of their family immediately. She says many adults struggle to understand why she would be a surrogate, but less than six months after giving birth, Chloe is ready to do it all over again. ""I am in that 'get to know' period with another couple,"" she says. ""I do feel like I've been pregnant forever but to be honest I adore pregnancy. I love being pregnant and I don't suffer like some people do. ""I honestly feel like I breeze it and my husband is willing to put up with me hormonal again."" ""It seems like a good time to do it again while I'm young and then I can say I've done my piece.""

"The show ran from 1994 to 2004 Ahh, Friends. The US sitcom that took over the world. Millennials may look back fondly to the heady days of the ultimate 20-something Manhattan lifestyle enjoyed by our favourite flatmates - Monica, Ross, Chandler, Joey, Rachel and Phoebe. But nearly a quarter of a century - yikes! - since it began, a new generation of fans are discovering the hit show for the first time on Netflix. And some of them are clearly finding it a bit uncomfortable. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Freelance writer James Baldock,who wrote about the Friends issue in Metro,external, told BBC News the backlash against Friends ""was inevitable"". ""People my age tend to think of Friends as 'current', but it's as steeped in nostalgia as, say, Miami Vice was 10 or 15 years ago."" Writer Rebecca Reid toldBBC Radio 5 liveshe ""couldn't believe how badly it has aged"". ""The homophobia is staggering - the punchline of every joke about Ross is that his ex-wife is a lesbian, as if that's some failing of his and that it's hilarious that she's a lesbian. Will & Grace returned to TV screens last year ""The sexism's pretty rampant as well... [and] it's the whitest show in the whole world."" She did acknowledge, however, that ""she did sort of love it"". ""It's really dangerous to start looking at stuff that was written a long time ago through the lens of what we do now.""

More recent shows have also split opinion, such as Will & Grace. The show, which debuted in 1998 and was about the lives of a straight woman and her gay best friend, was groundbreaking at a time when you rarely saw gay characters on TV. But the sitcom, whichrecently returned to our TV screens, was alsocriticised for stereotyping.,external Fawlty Towers is still hugely popular Fawlty Towers - the 1970s sitcom was based in a rundown hotel in Torquay and starred John Cleese as Basil Fawlty. One of the show's best-known scenes featured Basil's argument with a group of German guests, during which he stresses: ""Don't mention the war!"" It wasrecently namedthe best British sitcom of all time in a survey of comedians and comedy writers and actors. In 2013, the BBC removed a scene from a re-run of an episode in which one of the characters, Major Gowen (Ballard Berkeley), made derogatory marks about the Indian cricket team. Love Thy Neighbour - this 70s series saw the main black character, Bill Reynolds, called racist names. Reynolds was played by Rudolph Walker, who became the first black actor to have a major part on prime-time television in the UK. He went on to play Patrick Trueman in EastEnders. It Ain't Half Hot Mum was based on the real experiences of co-creator Jimmy Perry with the Royal Artillery in Burma.Michael Bates, who played bearer Rangi Ram, was not ""blacked up"" but wore ""a light tan"", according to Perry,external, who also said telling fictional soldiers that they were ""a bunch of poofs"" was what Sergeant Majors did in the 1940s. It hasn't been shown since the 1990s. Baldock said: ""The issue is that there are a good many classic programmes that embody values and employ stereotypes that are no longer tolerated in our society [like] It Ain't Half Hot Mum - a programme I watched as a child, without ever once wondering why Michael Bates was covered in make-up. ""People get very twitchy about this now, and with good reason, but that's not in itself [a reason] to 'censor' these programmes - if anything they stand as decent historical archives explaining what the world was like. He added: ""Homophobia, racism and misogyny are not and have never been acceptable [but] if it's 20 years old, why on earth are you surprised if it's different? If it makes you uncomfortable, why on earth are you watching it?"" The Daily Star's TV critic, Mike Ward, agrees. Friends is now running on Netflix He told the BBC his reaction to the criticism of Friends was ""sigh and despair"". ""If you take it at face value and apply modern day sensibilities to it and look at it as someone who went out to make it in 2018, you would be shocked. ""We have to be grown up about this, we have to look at perspective and look at the context in which it was made. ""It's fine to say it's uncomfortable by today's standards but if you're not careful you look at the world from an insular, narrow perspective."" Ward says ""we're in such a sensitive era now"" with comedy. ""Friends has been on Comedy Central for ages, it's not as if someone's just found it and put it out there. I don't think it's caused any major harm. And the characters - by and large we were laughing at their ridiculousness. They're not role models."" Ward adds Fawlty Towers is one of his favourite shows. ""I'm not thinking, 'Wow, I'm laughing at it because it's racist - it's a long, long time ago, it's a different age. I'd like to think we're smart enough not to have to be protected as if things have never been different. ""And there's a bit of arrogance - thinking we're so perfect now. Not that I endorse the old attitudes, but I suspect if you fast forward 50 years into the future you could put people in front of the TV now and people will cringe as we do.""

"Ten months ago, thirty-something Jessica was eager to get pregnant. A series of relationships had failed so she tried a radically new approach - she posted an advert online. The outcome turned out to be far better than she had hoped. ""Safe, bareback babymaking,"" the advert read. ""I'm in my 30s & have given up on Messrs Right & Wrong. I want a baby."" The request was posted on Craigslist, a website better known for second-hand goods. The potential father needed to be over 5ft 9in, under 40 and prepared to take an STD test. He would also be required to have ""a few days of frequent sex"". Jessica makes no apology for her businesslike approach. ""Our grandparents didn't spend years and years cohabiting and watching boxsets,"" she says. ""Starting a family was very much the goal of their endeavour."" She'd also watched many of her friends start families after falling ""madly in love"", only to split up later in a cloud of angry recriminations. ""I decided I could sacrifice romantic fulfilment as long as my child had two parents who loved and cared for them,"" she says. She posted her advert on Craigslist while on a bus from her home in the suburbs into central London - and by the time she arrived at Oxford Street, she already had a number of replies. She set up a meeting with the most promising one that very evening. Jessica spoke to theEmma Barnett Showon BBC 5 live You canlisten again here(start at 38 minutes 50 seconds) A year earlier, Jessica had been in a long-term relationship with David. Like her, he wanted children... but he was in no rush. ""He was aimless. He wanted to wait until he felt better about his life and his career. You just think, 'Come on!'"" Jessica says. She had wanted children since she turned 30 and was envious of friends who were starting families. She was also shaken by a visit to her aunt in hospital. Her aunt didn't have children, and Jessica believed she had been ignored by doctors as there had been no-one to insist on better care. ""I thought there was a risk of me ending up in a similar situation if I had no kids of my own. They can act as insurance for when you get older."" She ended her relationship with David in March 2016 and almost immediately started dating her colleague, Scott. He was keen to have a baby, but after six months of trying they had nothing to show for it. So they went to a GP, who suggested blood tests - and while Jessica's results were clear, Scott's revealed a range of fertility issues. ""He didn't react well to the news and basically fell apart. I didn't feel I had the ability to support him through it,"" Jessica says. ""Also I didn't really want to go through IVF."" They split up after a make-or-break Christmas holiday in 2016. Jessica then spoke to a gynaecologist, who suggested artificial insemination using donor sperm. Jessica wanted her child to have a caring father, so she wasn't keen on the idea, but she discussed it with a friend anyway. ""She asked, 'Why would you spend Â£700 for sperm when you could go down to Yates's [wine bar] and find someone who would gladly give you it for free?'"" Jessica says. ""But I didn't want to go to a pub and have unprotected sex with someone who'd had no STD checks. I also didn't want to entrap someone into parenthood."" However, this prompted her to post an advert on a co-parenting website. Scrolling through the potential fathers, she came across quite a few married gay couples, but feared she'd lose out as one among three parents. ""I was worried a 50-50 split would soon become 70-30 in their favour,"" she says. She then started chatting to a single man on the website, until an insurmountable barrier got in the way - Brexit. ""He voted to leave Europe and I'm very much for remain,"" Jessica says. ""I said, 'I'm not really sure we can parent like this.'"" Jessica quit the website, which charged a monthly fee, and considered dating apps. But as a teacher she didn't want to post a photograph of herself. Then she thought about Craigslist. ""I didn't want to use a dating website or Tinder in case a student saw a picture of me. Plus I knew Craigslist got a lot of traffic and was free to use,"" she says. She typed out her advert on the bus to Oxford Street last March, and posted it in the personals section. ""I don't use turkey basters when cooking and am not using one at conception,"" one line read. ""God, it sounds completely crazy looking back,"" Jessica says. She didn't set many parameters for the potential father of her child, only height, age and sexual health. ""I just wanted to meet a good person with shared values,"" she says. She received a flurry of replies, including the obligatory slew of penis pictures. A number of men wrote claiming they had helped several women, which turned Jessica off. ""The last thing I needed was for my child to end up at a party and snog their sibling without knowing,"" Jessica says. Another young man wrote to say he was desperate for a baby after his previous partner had a miscarriage. Jessica felt he was too vulnerable. Then she received an email from Ross. ""He was 33 and also lived in London. He said he'd had some disastrous relationships but he loved being an uncle and wanted children of his own,"" Jessica says. They agreed to meet for drinks that evening. This video can not be played Jessica (voiced by an actress) tells Emma Barnett about her first meeting with Ross ""I thought he was much better-looking in person than the photo he sent,"" she says. They discovered they were of different faiths but agreed they wanted a ""London approach"" to religion. ""We agreed there was one God who loved pretty much everybody and we would want a child to be comfortable with people of any faith or no faith."" Jessica and Ross kissed at the end of their first meeting. ""I felt very comfortable around him,"" she says. A few days later they had dinner and arranged to have STD checks. After their fourth date they decided to have sex, to see if they were physically compatible. ""It was really good,"" Jessica says. ""We decided to start trying for a baby, knowing it could take a while."" But within weeks Jessica was holding a positive pregnancy test. She had conceived during her very next cycle. ""I found out I was pregnant about six weeks after I'd posted the advert,"" Jessica says. ""That was a bit of a surprise. It definitely wasn't what I had expected."" There hadn't even been time for Ross to get a sperm count. They didn't have a written contract but agreed they wouldn't sleep with anyone else. ""I didn't want to label what my relationship with Ross was,"" Jessica says. ""I was delighted I was pregnant but I was wary that might make me think I was in love with him."" Why don't I want to have sex with the man I love? Hollie McNish: The things new mothers aren't always told Why I chose to donate my eggs Ross was very involved during the pregnancy and accompanied Jessica to hospital appointments. It wasn't all plain sailing, though. They clashed about who got to keep the original ultrasound pictures and whether to spend money finding out the sex of the baby early. However, this led Jessica to an unexpected discovery. She had advertised for a father for her baby rather than a partner, but the quarrels made her realise that she actually had feelings for Ross. ""I realised being angry with him made me sad, as I did love him. ""But I was concerned that perhaps he was caring and attentive just because I was carrying his baby."" The couple told their parents Jessica was expecting a baby after the pregnancy had lasted 12 weeks, but didn't reveal how they had met. ""Our families get on well. It may be because there was a child involved but everyone was very accepting and tolerant of each other,"" Jessica says. Jessica had been living alone and Ross moved in two months before their baby was due. She had a Caesarean after her baby was found to be in a breech position, and spent a week recovering in hospital. ""Ross slept on a sleeping bag on the floor next to me the whole time. There was another dad there but he lasted one night before he said it was too uncomfortable and went home."" Having a newborn baby has left Jessica and Ross ""bone-achingly tired"". However, Jessica thinks that if anything their relationship has got stronger. ""We're coping and getting through it - maybe it's because we don't have the energy to argue!"" Jessica is on maternity leave and Ross can work some days from home. It means they share a lot of the parenting duties. ""It's great, when there is a particularly icky nappy, being able to hand the baby over to dad and say, 'This is yours,'"" Jessica says. The couple have now been together just under a year and parents for two months. They are still discovering new things about each other. ""Like the other day in a text conversation I found out he liked Billie Holiday,"" Jessica says. ""It's great when we get time together and we always have a meal when he gets back from work. We enjoy being together and it makes it easier raising a child."" They have already discussed having another. Jessica says she is pleased she went down an unconventional route to starting a family. ""I don't regret the advert,"" she says. ""I don't think you can get what you want by sitting there patiently and waiting for it to land in your lap.""

"James Dowley said he was passing the lake when he noticed the floating figure A man waded into a lake to rescue what he thought was a lifeless baby, only to discover it was a life-sized doll. James Dowley, 28, from Welshampton, was passing the water at Ellesmere, Shropshire, with his father when he saw the figure floating in the water. Mr Dowley wrote on Facebook the figure looked ""life-like"" and he could not go home without checking on its welfare. The Royal Lifesaving Society (RLSS) said it advised people to refrain from entering ""cold and unfamiliar"" water. Midlands Live: Van rams police car and goes into house; Curry house fined for clogging sewers with fat and grease Mr Dowley removed his trousers to perform his ""rescue"" Mr Dowley said he was in the water for about 20 minutes after wading in about 20 metres [65 ft] when he spotted the figure on 9 January. ""I felt a bit of an idiot carrying a doll but thought it better to be safe than sorry,"" he said. ""Dad and I both looked and decided we had to do something. ""If we had gone home and discovered it had been what we dreaded, it would have been awful. ""We would have been left wondering if we could have done more when we were at the scene."" He said he felt, ""a bit of an idiot"" for rescuing a doll Lee Heard, the RLSS's head of volunteering, said the society commended the bravery and quick instincts of Mr Dowley. ""We recognise the risk-based approach he took in removing himself from the water as soon as he was aware no live casualty was in danger,"" he said. ""However, our advice is that people refrain from entering cold and unfamiliar water at all times.

"Stephen Paddock smuggled more than 20 weapons into the hotel overlooking the Las Vegas Strip Police say they do not expect to file charges against the girlfriend of a gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas in October. Marilou Danley, girlfriend of gunman Stephen Paddock, had previously been named a person of interest in the case. Sheriff Joe Lombardo told a news conference that police still did not know the motive for the mass shooting. Paddock opened fire on hundreds of concertgoers from a 32nd floor window of the Mandalay Bay hotel. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Sheriff Lombardo told reporters that investigators believed Paddock had acted alone but that the FBI was investigating ""a person of interest"" whom he could not identify. He said 851 people attending the music concert on Las Vegas Strip were injured, including 422 who had wounds associated with gunfire. What was Stephen Paddock's motive? Paddock used 'bump-stock' device to shoot faster In a public update to the investigation on Friday, he revealed that Paddock had searched for other potential targets and taken photographs of possible sites. Sheriff Lombardo said Paddock had also searched online for tactics used by police and Swat teams. During the investigation child pornography images had been found on Paddock's laptop computer, he added. ""This report is not going to answer every question or even answer the biggest question as to why he did what he did,"" the sheriff said. After the shooting, officers stormed the hotel room and found Paddock dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He had smuggled 24 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition into the hotel, concealed in 10 suitcases. Ms Danley, speaking through her lawyer in October, said she had had no idea Paddock was planning violence. She said she had known him as a ""kind, caring, quiet man"".

"Facebook said it will now tell users which news outlets are reliable Facebook has announced it will prioritise news sources deemed to be more trustworthy on its News Feed. The firm said,externalthe social network community would determine which outlets are reliable via the use of user surveys. Founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said news content would soon make up around 4% of what appeared in people's News Feeds - down from 5% before. The move is the latest attempt by the company to quell the spread of so-called fake news and propaganda on the network. Mark Zuckerberg vows to 'fix' Facebook As part of that continuing battle,Twitter also announced on Friday,externalthat it had notified 677,775 US-based users who had retweeted, liked or followed Russian bot accounts on the network in the run up to the 2016 US presidential election. The change is an attempt to shift the key judgements over bias and accuracy away from Facebook's employees, and onto its user base. ""We could try to make that decision ourselves, but that's not something we're comfortable with,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""We considered asking outside experts, which would take the decision out of our hands but would likely not solve the objectivity problem. Or we could ask you - the community - and have your feedback determine the ranking."" Users will be asked, as they sometimes are about advertising, whether they recognise a news brand and if they trust it. Facebook's theory - yet to be tested on a large scale - is that while there are many partisan outlets that have readers that trust them, there is a smaller subset of media companies that a majority people find ""broadly trustworthy"", whatever their particular leanings. Representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were grilled on the issue of online disinformation at a US Senate hearing last October ""There's too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarisation in the world today,"" wrote Mr Zuckerberg, who recently announced that his challenge this year was to essentially ""fix"" Facebook. ""Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don't specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them."" The news ranking system will first be tested on US-based users only, and the results of the survey will not be made public. ""This is one of many signals that go into News Feed ranking,"" a Facebook spokesman told the BBC. ""We do not plan to release individual publishers' trust scores because they represent an incomplete picture of how each story's position in each person's feed is determined."" As with any algorithm change, be it Facebook or any other major web service, there will be some that benefit and others that will struggle. Facebook - the secret election weapon Among the winners will likely be traditional media organisations with long histories or a strong broadcast presence, such as the New York Times or BBC. However, emerging brands will suffer if recognition is not as strong, regardless of whether the content is trustworthy or not. For instance, Buzzfeed's initial beginnings as a viral site would have almost certainly hindered its growth into a serious news organisation had it been subject to the ideas about to be put in place by Mr Zuckerberg's team. Also, it is unclear how trustworthy, specialist news organisations with smaller readerships - such as science publications - will be treated under these rules, though Facebook's head of News Feed Adam Mosseri said local news would at least be protected. ""We're making it easier for people to see local news and information in a dedicated section. ""We'll continue to work on ways to show more local news that is relevant to where people live.""

"Jewish leaders have called for the resignation of a coroner in north London in a dispute over delays in releasing bodies for burial. Under Jewish and Islamic law, bodies must be buried on the day of death or as soon as possible afterwards. But Mary Hassell has said she would not fast-track inquests based on religion. Her jurisdiction includes parts of north London which are home to large communities of orthodox Jews and Muslims. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said they had a ""deeply disappointing"" meeting with the senior coroner for Inner North London. Abdul Hai, councillor with responsibility for community cohesion in the London borough of Camden, has also called for Ms Hassell to quit. The board's vice president, Marie Van Der Zyl, told BBC News: ""It's disrupting family life to such an extent that people don't want to die within Inner London North. ""To say they don't want to die there, they're too frightened to die, is something that's so traumatising and so against Jewish values and indeed it affects Muslims as well. ""It's at the heart of both of our faiths for there to be speedy burial."" Ms Van Der Zyl described the early release of bodies to those families who want it as ""basic human rights"" and added: ""Not only is Ms Hassell failing to respect those rights, but she shows no inclination to do so. ""She has lost the confidence of the Jewish community, and appears to have no interest in winning it back."" Ms Hassell said, in response to a complaint, that ""no death reported to my office will be prioritised over any other because of the religion of the deceased or family"". Judicial and council officials refused to respond to the allegations, and there was no response at St Pancras Coroner's court, where Ms Hassell works.

"West Midlands Police say they would like to speak to this man after bleach was sprayed into the eyes of a Poundland worker A man sprayed bleach into the eyes of a Poundland worker when she asked him not to queue-jump, police have said. Officers said the woman, 24, also had the liquid poured over her head in the attack at the shop in Wolverhampton. She only escaped serious injury because quick-thinking colleagues helped remove clothing and rinse her skin, West Midlands Police said. CCTV images have been issued of a man police want to speak to over the ""serious assault"", on 5 January. Midlands Live: Van rams police car and goes into house; Suicide-pact woman sentenced The customer of the store, in Wulfrun Square, sprayed bleach into the woman's eyes and poured the remaining liquid over her head, causing burning and reddening to her eyes and body. ""Our investigations so far suggest that the incident occurred as the woman, who was working in the store at the time of the attack, requested that the man re-join his correct place in the queue after appearing to push to the front,"" said Det Con David Firth. ""While her physical injuries will heal, we are certainly not underestimating the psychological impact this incident has had."" Police say they are looking to speak to the man in the CCTV images, who is described as being  white man, with short dark hair and stubble, about 5ft 6ins tall and slim. Investigations are continuing and police have urged anyone with information, or who recognises the man, to come forward.
