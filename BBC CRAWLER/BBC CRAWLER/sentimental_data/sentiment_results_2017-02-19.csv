"As peers begin debating the Brexit legislation, theGuardian says it has been told by European politicians that British attempts to ""blackmail and divide"" EU countries,externalin the run-up to Brexit negotiations will lead to a disastrous ""crash landing"" out of the bloc. They say the approach being pursued by Theresa May's government will leave the UK without a free trade deal and facing perilous consequences, reports the paper. TheDaily Express is concerned there is a plot by ""remainer"" Lords to delay Britain's exit from the EU.,external It leads with a warning from Tory MP Philip Davies that any attempt by peers to block Brexit could lead to the demise of the House of Lords. Elsewhere, there are divergent views on the value of advice from New Labour's elder statesmen after Lord Mandelson urged the House of Lords not to ""throw in the towel"" over Brexit. According to the Sun, Lord Mandelson may think it fine to treat voters as an annoying irrelevance,external, but for them, that is exactly what he has become. TheDaily Mail accuses him of acting like an 18th Century aristocrat,externalplanning a last stand against the peasantry. ButMatthew d'Ancona in the Guardian,externalwelcomes Tony Blair's earlier decision to take on Brexit. ""If not him, then who?"" he asks. And theDaily Telegraph reports Brexit could lead Oxford University to break with more than 700 years of tradition by establishing its first foreign campus.,external The paper says French officials met senior staff at Oxford to discuss proposals that they hope will guarantee future EU funding for a satellite base in Paris. Other universities, including Warwick, are also said to have been approached. TheTimes says ministers risked enraging small businesses over April's business rate revaluation.,external It says it has seen a private letter to Conservative MPs in which ministers claim that a growing revolt over changes to business rates is being fuelled by lies. TheDaily Telegraph says Theresa May is facing a Cabinet split over the issue.,externalAn unnamed cabinet source tells the paper: ""The last thing you want to do is whack the confidence of small businesses."" Meanwhile,the Daily Mirror reports Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has paid for what it describes as ""a massive secret opinion poll on his leadership"",externalas rumours grow that he might quit before 2020. It says he has ordered a 10,000 person survey but will keep the results secret from all but his closest ally, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell. The Mirror believes it is a legitimate exercise, but that keeping the findings confidential is less defensible, saying they should be shared, ""warts and all"". Themain news in the Daily Telegraph is a warning from Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon,externalthat millions of refugees will head to Europe from Afghanistan unless British troops maintain their roles in training local forces. His words, says the Telegraph, are a stark reminder that, whether we like it or not, the consequences of previous Western interventions continue to this day. According tothe lead in the Daily Mail, a report has revealed that the NHS in England has cut 15,000 beds,externalover the past six years. The paper says that amounts to the equivalent of closing 24 hospitals at the same time as demand for beds is soaring due to the pressures of the social care crisis, immigration and an ageing population. But ministers are disputing the accuracy of the British Medical Association's findings and NHS England tells the paper that modern treatment advances mean patients need to spend less time in hospital. Finally, theDaily Mail, reports on research carried out by Hungarian scientists,externalstudying the effects of separating young people from their mobile phones. More than 80 18 to 26-year-olds were wired up to heart monitors. The paper says researchers found that if their phones were taken away for even a short time they exhibited heartbeat patterns usually associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

" Friday 17th February 2017 It only takes a minute to fall in love, but divorce is an altogether lengthier, messier process. The same goes for bands: nobody thinks about future royalties when they're jamming in a garage, but when a band ends is when the litigation starts. For a start, who gets custody of the name? What if some of the members want to carry on while others insist the band is a travesty without them? When it comes to bands looking to reform, the picture can be cloudier still - especially when there are numerous ex-members claiming that their version of the group is the definitive iteration. Here are eight cases of bands that split into competing factions. [LISTEN] Ali Campbell on UB40's sound It’s always a sad day when former bandmates have to face each other across a courtroom; sadder still when it's not just a band but a family that's being torn apart. Take the case of Birmingham reggae stalwartsUB40, whose fraternal frontmen Ali and Robin Campbell are currently locked in a bitter legal battle for the use of the band name. As arecent BBC documentarydetailed, despite selling more than 70 million albums worldwide, UB40 were declared bankrupt in 2011. When Ali felt like he wasn't getting straight answers about where all the money had gone, he quit the band; Robin contends that Ali left because he thought he'd earn more as a solo artist. Their family feud was compounded when Robin replaced Ali as lead singer with another Campbell brother, Duncan. Ali has regularly lambasted the other UB40, once tellingthe Birmingham Mailthat he's ""heard better tribute bands"", and in recent years has taken to touring alongside two former bandmates as UB40 Featuring Ali Campbell, Astro and Mickey. With Robin's version of the band still very much operational, he initiated court proceedings against Ali for sole use of the UB40 brand, an action that has already cost both parties an estimated £250,000 each. As in the past, UB40 are hoping that Red Red Wine might be their financial saviour - before Christmas, asthe Mirror reported, Ali's camp began flogging UB40-branded Bordeaux for £28.50 a bottle. Classic singles such as Whatta Man and Free Your Mind gave the impression ofEn Vogueas a tight-knit girl gang. But that illusion was shattered a few years ago when Dawn Robinson and Maxine Jones walked out of the group for a second time, exposing a history of contractual disputes and intra-band rivalry. In 2013, Jones began touring with two new singers as En Vogue to the Max,telling Rumorfix, ""I am En Vogue!"" But, asTMZ reported, an arbitration judge disagreed and Jones was forced to drop the name, filing for bankruptcy soon afterwards. The version of En Vogue touring the UK this summer will feature only Cindy Herron and Terry Ellis from the original line-up. A full En Vogue reunion? Looks like you're never gonna get it (sorry). [LISTEN] The Beach Boys introduce themselves to the UK Behind the balmy Californian harmonies,The Beach Boysare one of the most fractious bands in history. Numerous terrible business decisions only served to exacerbate the tensions between Mike Love, who wrote in his autobiography, ""For those who believe that Brian walks on water, I will always be the Antichrist,"" party boy Dennis Wilson (he died in 1983) and troubled musical mastermind Brian Wilson. Love's determination to keep The Beach Boys show on the road at all costs has led to him fronting a version of the band in which he is the only original member (although long-serving bassist/singer Bruce Johnston also features). His 2017 tour will run almost simultaneously with the extension of Brian Wilson's Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary World Tour, featuring fellow original member Al Jardine and fleeting Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin. Who does the best version of Good Vibrations? Our tip - listen to the record. Throughout the 00s,Sugababesoperated one of the most notorious revolving door policies in pop. Hoping to exploit the brand power established with early smashes like Overload and Freak Like Me, the group's management kept faith in the Sugababes name when first Siobhan Donaghy, then Mutya Buena, and finally Keisha Buchanan all jumped ship, leaving the band with no original members. When their respective solo careers foundered, it was no great surprise that the three 'Origibabes' announced their intention to reform. But with a replicant Sugababes still nominally on the circuit, they were forced to call themselvesMutya Keisha Siobhan. Sadly their 2013 comeback single Flatline stalled outside the Top 40 and an album never materialised. The trio have reportedly since been in talks to buy back the Sugababes name, but is it still worth the crop top it's written on? In 2013, punk fans were moshing excitedly at the news that legendary hardcore trailblazersBlack Flagwere reforming and touring. But which version of the band would be coming to their town? Was it Black Flag, featuring the band's mastermind Greg Ginn and sometime vocalist Ron Reyes? Or was it Flag, led by original singer Keith Morris and three others who served time during the band's combustible late-70s/early-80s heyday? Ginn quickly tabled an injunction against Black Flag's rival incarnation but they were eventually allowed to carry on using the shortened name. In fact, Flag continue to tour while Ginn's version of Black Flag imploded in November 2013 when, asNME reported, Reyes was effectively sacked mid-set during a gig in Australia. The band's most famous singer Henry Rollins declined, perhaps sensibly, to get involved with either reunion. Starship - We Built This City 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info WhenStarshiphit No.1 in 1985 with sugary power-ballad Nothing's Gonna Stop Us, not all of their new fans - moved to buy the single following its appearance in uber-corny rom-com Mannequin - may have been aware of the band's origins in the 60s counterculture. Starship could trace their lineage back to seminal San Francisco psych bandJefferson Airplane, who morphed intoJefferson Starshipin the 70s. However, by 1984 the band's increasingly ""mundane"" pop direction,according to Ultimate Classic Rock, alienated founder Paul Kantner who quit, taking legal action to prevent them using the 'Jefferson' part of the name. Despite Kantner's death in 2016, a version of Jefferson Starship continue to tour, while anyone with a desperate urge to hear We Built This City live can sign up for a show by Starship Featuring Mickey Thomas. [WATCH] The Beat ft. Ranking Roger - Ranking Full Stop / MIrror in the Bathroom Not every story of subdividing bands has to end in acrimony. Two versions of 2-tone bandThe Beathave been co-existing in relative harmony for a while now. Last year, The Beat ft.Ranking Rogerfound themselves touring the UK about two weeks behind The English Beat - led by Roger's former co-frontman Dave Wakeling, now based in California. Yet it seems relations between the two are cordial. In 2015, Wakeling toldthe Washington Timesthat his relationship with Roger was ""very pleasant"" while talking positively about uniting the two Beats. UB40 take note. [LISTEN] Steve Lamacq catches up with The Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne Don't worry, your favourite unicorn-riding psychedelic uncles haven't turned on each other - not in real life, at least. A recent episode of hipster-baiting US sitcom Portlandia found them expertly spoofing the phenomenon outlined in this article, as two rival versions ofThe Flaming Lips- The Flaming Lips featuring Wayne Coyne and More Flaming Lips (led by multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd) - turned up to fulfill a festival booking. The two camps had done so much suing and countersuing, it transpired that their lawyer was the only person now legally permitted to sing the chorus of Do You Realize? Thankfully, the spectacle of a man in a suit murdering their signature song (while charging them for the privilege) was enough to make Coyne and Drozd see sense, and The Flaming Lips were reunited for a triumphant finale. 10 long-awaited albums that will be the soundtrack of 2019 8 predictions for music in 2019 from expert pop forecasters 7 of the most scathing record reviews of the year 9 brilliant music videos that you may have missed in 2018 Test your knowledge of the year in music with our poptastic quiz 7 heartbreaking Christmas songs that might make you cry Check out the artists we're taking to SXSW! 5 things we learned from Bros' chat on Radio 2 How Bring Me the Horizon became one of the UKâs biggest bands Seven of the most outrageous bands ever  Sign into the BBC,orRegister",Negative,0.0015073847
"This video can not be played Tornado crossed the Ribblehead Viaduct More than 5,000 people travelled on the first timetabled steam train service on the Settle to Carlisle railway line in 50 years, Northern Rail has said. Tornado, the newest steam locomotive in Britain, pulled 12 Northern services over three days from 14 -16 February. The company described the event as ""a remarkable success"" and has not ruled out running similar services again. It was part of celebrations to mark the upcoming reopening of the line after landslides closed a long stretch. Paul Barnfield, Northern Rail regional director, said: ""During the three days just over 5,500 people travelled on the steam services and it was great to see so many entering into the spirit of the celebration. ""This was the first timetabled steam service in England for almost 50 years and to be able to bring Tornado to such an iconic and visually stunning line, as a way of saying thank you, was a genuine pleasure.""

""I am very proud of my team for their part in ensuring the services ran so successfully."" The landslip was caused by heavy rain Douglas Hodgins, of the Friends of Settle to Carlisle Line, added: ""There must be lessons here about the demand for steam, scenery and rail travel in general. It was the perfect curtain-raiser for the reopening of the line on 31 March."" It took 18 years for the trust to build the Â£3m Tornado 60163, which can achieve speeds of 75mph (120km/h).

"This video can not be played The SpaceX rocket was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida Private rocket firm SpaceX has successfully launched a rocket carrying a cargo ship for the International Space Station following the postponement of take-off on Saturday because of technical problems. Witnesses said the rocket was only briefly visible before making its way into the clouds. The launch was made from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket booster successfully landed nine minutes after taking off. The touchdown is part of the company's strategy of returning rockets to earth so they can be reused rather than jettisoning them in the ocean after a single launch. Moments after the rocket landed, the SpaceX Dragon supply ship successfully reached orbit, prompting cheers inside the SpaceX Mission Control room. Witnesses said the rocket was only briefly visible before making its way into the clouds The Dragon is now making its way to the International Space Station, and is expected to arrive on Wednesday. On 14 January SpaceX resumed flightsby launching a Falcon 9 vehicle from the Vandenberg Air Force Base on the California coast. It was the first mission by the company since one of its vehicles exploded on the launch pad in September. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, wants his company to be at the forefront of the race involving several companies to deploy satellite-based internet services over the next few years. The company also has a long queue of customers all waiting for a ride to orbit - including America's civil space agency (Nasa), the US military and multiple outfits in the commercial sector.

The Ibrox side failed to keep pace thanks to their 2-1 defeat away to Dundee, who overtake Killie and Partick Thistle and move into sixth place. Meanwhile, St Mirren beat TNS to advance to the final of the Irn Bru Cup. There's more football on BBC Two at the moment, with Sportscene's Premiership highlights programme. Join us for more live coverage on the website on Wednesday, when Hibernian host Hearts in what should be a thrilling Edinburgh derby in the Scottish Cup's fifth round. Aberdeen defeated Kilmarnock 2-1 at Rugby Park FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren will face Dundee United in the finalÂ on the weekend of 25/26 March, with the specific date and venue to be confirmed this week. United manager Ray McKinnon says he expects the Buddies to take confidence and improve ahead of the final as they look to escape relegation in the Championship. With TNS failing to become the first non-Scottish team into the Challenge Cup final, it will be between two Championship rivals and McKinnon expects a large crowd and a tough game for his side. FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren manager Jack Rosson BBC Alba: ""First-half, horrendous, second half, very good. ""I was very angry with them at half-time and the reaction was terrific in the second half and, prior to the sending off they were good and thoroughly deserved it in the end. ""I thought we had the momentum and were the better team before the sending off. ""I feel the sending off comes because of the way were playing and forcing them to make rash tackles.

""They have even had the luxury of missing a penalty. ""It was very even in the first half, but I think the change Jack made bringing on Lewis Morgan and pressing high up the park, basically going 4-2-4 and keeping TNS back was fantgastic and they definitely deserved it in the second half."" FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren midfielder Stephen McGinnon BBC Alba: ""I was here as a young player when we last won the Challenge Cup and it was a brilliant day, a great game and we took a good crowd there.

FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren midfielder Stevie Mallanon BBC Alba: ""We are very delighted.Â ""It was a tough team we played against on a good run of form and they've come across and beat a few teams in the cup already. ""The boys are just delighted to get a win on the board and give the fans something to sing about. ""In the first half, we were a bit sluggish and I think we just pressed them more."" TNS suffer only their second defeat in 32 games as St Mirren take advantage of Stephen Saunders' second-half yellow card to run out convincing winners in the semi-final of the Irn Bru Cup. The Welsh Premier League leaders were worthy of their lead, but the Saints made them pay for the former Motherwell defender's inadvisable lunge.

St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon has named St Mirren midfielder Stevie Mallan, the scorer of his side's second goal, as his man of the match on BBC Alba. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints TNS have four minutes, plus a bit of stoppage time, to stage an unlikely comeback with 10 men if they are to keep their Irn Bru Cup fairytale alive. It looks an impossible task. John Sutton John Sutton makes up for that penalty miss as Kyle Magennis weaves his way into the penalty box and his cut-back is fired high into the TNS net by the striker from eight yards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints The Buddies squander a great chance to virtually kill the game as John Sutton has his penalty saved by TNS captain Paul Harrison. It was awarded after the ball struck the arm of midfielder Aeron Edwards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints  Stephen McGinn fired St Mirren's equaliser St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints St Mirren are eight points behind Ayr United at the foot of the Scottish Championship, but they are turning into cup specialists. They have only won twice in their last nine outings and those have both come in knock-out competitions. Manager Jack Ross would probably trade those for league points! St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints Suddenly, St Mirren are looking like a different team and they look unfortunate not to win a penalty when Philip Baker comes in behind John Sutton as the striker looks likely to score from four yards out. Stevie Mallan Talk about a quick change in fortunes. St Mirren have gone from looking hopeless at 1-0 down to being 2-1 ahead against 10 men within a few minutes in Paisley. From the free-kick that led to Stephen Saunders' dismissal, Stevie Mallan curls low into the bottom corner. St Mirren 1-1 The New Saints Referee Keith Kennedy goes straight to his red card as Steven Saunders flies into a tackle on Buddies scorer Stephen McGinn. It was a strong challenge from the former Motherwell, Ross County and Dumbarton defender, but he is a tad unfortunate not to escape with a yellow.

"Writer Patrick Marber said Tennant usually plays 'decent' people David Tennant's new West End role will show him in a new light, according to the play's writer and director. The Broadchurch and Doctor Who star is going to be a ""real anti-hero"" in Don Juan in Soho, says Patrick Marber - the man behind Oscar-nominated film Closer. It's been described as a ""savagely funny and filthy"" update of Moliere's 17th century tragicomedy Don Juan, with the action taking place in modern-day London. Marber says Tennant has been known for playing ""decent"" people in recent years, but all that will change when he takes on the title role. ""It's a great part for him,"" says Marber as rehearsals get under way at Wyndham's Theatre. ""I think it's going to be very funny and very rude. It's really exciting to see my play again."" The play was first staged in 2006, with Rhys Ifans playing Don Juan as the seducer who's hell-bent on pleasure, and couldn't care less about the consequences. Of the new Don Juan, Marber - who's also been an actor and comedian - says: ""It's a part we haven't seen David play before, really. ""The man is an amoral hedonist, and is wicked. You love to hate him, and hate to love him - he's a real anti-hero."" Patrick Marber says Don Juan in Soho is 'naughty but nice' And, according to Marber, Tennant is funny - very, very funny indeed. ""He's always a great comedian,"" he says. ""When I met him 20 years ago, he was the best light comedian I'd ever seen at the time. This is an opportunity to give full rein to his comic skills."" Asked quite how rude Don Juan is going to be, Marber replies: ""I think it's naughty but nice. I don't think it's shocking."" It's a busy time for the playwright. He directed the just-opened West End transfer of Tom Stoppard's Travesties, which enjoyed a sell-out run at London's Menier Chocolate Factory last year. Fans can also see his version of Hedda Gabler at the National Theatre, with Affair star Ruth Wilson giving what Marber describes as ""one of the greatest performances"" he has ever seen. So how is he getting through this hectic period? ""I'm getting as much sleep as I possibly can and drinking a lot of coffee,"" he says. Travesties stars Rev's Tom Hollander as Henry Carr, a man recalling his memories as a diplomat living in Zurich in 1917, and the people he met there - including James Joyce and Lenin. ""I think it sold out on the two Toms names - Hollander and Stoppard. It's a really nice combination of people,"" said Marber. ""It's not been on in London since the early 1990s. so I think there's some curiosity there too."" Tom Hollander appears as Henry Carr in Travesties He described it as a ""very funny play"" which is ""about universal things like love, sex, art and politics"". It is especially relevant in 2017, he added. ""At the time it's set, in Europe 1917 - exactly 100 years ago - the world is at war. ""It talks to that anxiety, that feeling that the world is disturbing and troubled. And it feels increasingly relevant, the play. ""I think that in troubled times, people want to be entertained, and it's a very entertaining evening at the theatre. It wears its politics lightly. ""It speaks to the soul and intellect, the heart and the head."" Travesties is at the Apollo Theatre until 29 April. Don Juan in Soho is at Wyndham's Theatre from 17 March.

"An exhibition tracing the changing styles of Diana, Princess of Wales is due to open in Kensington Palace. Diana: Her Fashion Story will display iconic outfits from throughout her life - from before she was married to after her divorce in the 1990s. Curator Eleri Lynn said the exhibition showed how the princess was ""growing in confidence throughout her life"". A ""White Garden"" celebrating Diana's life will also be planted in the palace grounds this summer. Princess Diana commissioned this tartan coat and skirt from designer Emanuel for an official royal visit to Italy in 1985. The boxy style may have been fashionable in the 1980s but many commentators thought little of the coat. This silk chiffon evening gown was worn by Diana at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, and for a performance of Miss Saigon at the Theatre Royal, London in 1989. It was created by Catherine Walker who took inspiration for the dress from the gown worn by Grace Kelly in Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 film, To Catch A Thief. Princess Diana hit the headlines when she danced with actor John Travolta at a state dinner in the White House in 1985. The velvet silk evening dress which she wore that night was designed by Victor Edelstein and was said to be one of her favourites. This cocktail dress, which Diana wore for a concert at the Barbican in 1989, was considered an unusual choice for a princess given it was based on a masculine tuxedo. Designer David Sassoon said it was an example of how Diana started to ""break the rules"" as she experimented with styles and learned what clothes worked for different occasions. This sequined evening dress created by Catherine Walker in 1986 was said to be typical of Diana's ""Dynasty"" phase when the media noted her taste for ""large shoulder pads, lavish fabrics and metallic accessories"". The princess wore it for an official visit to Austria in 1986 as well as two charity balls in 1989 and 1990. Diana increasingly worked with Catherine Walker during her life to develop what the designer called her ""royal uniform"". She wore this red day suit created by Walker for her famous visit to the London Lighthouse, a centre for people affected by HIV and AIDS, in October 1996.

"Museums are searching for unusual ways to raise money Fancy learning how to practise taxidermy on roadkill? Or visiting the lawnmowers of the rich and famous? As our arts centres and museums suffer funding cuts, several are seeking innovative ways to increase income and footfall. But can quirky fundraisers keep our tourist attractions afloat? Years ago, a day out at a museum may have meant trawling round glass cases full of dusty but worthy exhibits, before stopping in the teashop for a stale scone and a lukewarm drink. But pitch up at some of England's museums nowadays and you could find yourself wandering into a film set or a cocktail bar. The former head of Arts Council England, Sir Peter Bazalgette, suggests arts venues need to be imaginative about raising funds Funding cuts have meant England's 1,300 accredited museums have had to find imaginative ways to raise money. Indeed, the former head of Arts Council England, Sir Peter Bazalgette, suggested museums go even further if they want to survive. He said theatresshould open charity shops, art galleries should run bed and breakfasts and museums should become film sets,externalto make more money. Sir Peter pointed to examples such as the Roses Theatre in Tewkesbury, which runs a charity shop and Islington Mill, an arts centre in Salford, which runs a B&B. Some museums say they might have limited appeal as a B&B Alistair Brown, policy officer for the Museums Association, the sector's membership organisation, said: ""Lots of museums are looking at new ways to generate income and are being quite creative about it. ""But it's probably a mistake to think that is the best way of saving them. The levels of income they are losing through cuts are greater than the amount they are able, in the short term, to raise through entrepreneurial activities."" So what are the quirkiest ways museums have found of raising funds? And is opening a guesthouse or running as a film set feasible for all of them? The Grant Museum is not, at first glance, an obvious stand-up comedy venue An Edwardian library jam-packed with animal skeletons and jars of pickled frogs might not seem, on the face of it, a barrel of laughs. But the Grant Museum of Zoology, in London, decided its quirky setting was the perfect location to stage stand-up comedy gigs. ""It's a cabaret-style comedy night. We hold three of them a year and they are hugely popular,"" said Jack Ashby, the museum manager. ""The events are compÃ¨red by a professional comedian who introduces different members of staff to the audience. We have people working here who get particularly nerdy about animals nobody has ever heard of - and audiences find that pretty entertaining."" Comedy nights have proved successful The museum holds other events, such as improvised opera nights and animal adoption schemes, to raise funds and make its displays of everything from elephant skulls to jars of tapeworms slightly more accessible. But Mr Ashby has a word of caution as museums try to diversify. ""Museums have to think very carefully about what they can do to make money,"" he said. ""Some museums take a significant amount from weddings or corporate hire but you really have to invest in the staff to support those events. And realistically, you can only offer your venue as a film set if there is a film industry in your town or city."" Outdoor museums make ideal film sets, as the Black Country Living Museum has found Several museums have sought extra funds by offering up their locations as film sets. ""We've always had filming at the museum,"" said Laura Wakelin, deputy chief executive of the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley. ""But previously it was much more sporadic. ""When I arrived in 2013, we decided we needed to start actively promoting the museum as a unique venue for filming."" Since then, the museum has famously been the backdrop for BBC drama Peaky Blinders and the ITV period adaptation Arthur and George, as well as reality shows and a Bollywood movie. In 2015 alone, filming raised about Â£50,000 for the museum, which has also capitalised on its raised profile in other ways. The museum is capitalising on its appeal by holding themed weekends for visitors ""As Peaky Blinders took off, we started to see flat caps in our gift shop and we run Peaky Blinders nights,"" said Miss Wakelin. ""They usually sell out and bring in a slightly younger demographic. ""It's about finding what works for your venue. Yes, we have wonderful assets here but we are in the middle of quite an economically disadvantaged area so we do have to pitch these things right."" The Pathology Museum, in London, is hosting taxidermy workshops The idea of setting up as a bed and breakfast or a film set might be tempting if your attraction is charmingly photogenic. But such ventures would not work for every location, explains Carla Valentine, technical curator of the Pathology Museum, in London. ""This isn't the kind of museum that has space to be a B&B and we couldn't do that anyway as it contains human remains,"" she said. However, the museum, which showcases medical specimens owned by Queen Mary University London, does put on macabre fundraising events. The classes have a wide appeal, according to the museum Among the most successful have been its Stuff and Nonsense beginners' taxidermy classes. Amanda Sutton, who runs them, said: ""They are very popular and tend to sell out. I think it's the experience of doing something so unusual that appeals to people. ""We are running a special class for Valentine's Day. People come as couples and work together on their animals, which is quite sweet in a weird kind of way. ""When we set these classes up, some other London museums didn't seem to think it was very appropriate but they have now started running their own weird events. I don't think museums can just run stuffy events for academics - they need to appeal to the general public."" The Museum of Curiosities venue includes a cocktail bar that it hires out Of course, online communities bring added scope for museums to reach out to like-minded enthusiasts and nowhere is this better demonstrated than in a Hackney basement, which plays home to London's Museum of Curiosities. The museum, which revels in the incoherence of its collections - ranging from dodo bones to fast food collectables - was initially funded by 500 people on Kickstarter and it has also used crowdfunding to add to its displays, most notably with a mummy. Its premises include a small cocktail bar, which it hires out to raise funds. Mr Wynd also meets running costs via sponsorship. Viktor Wynd says it is important museums are self-reliant Founder Viktor Wynd is passionate about such enterprises being relatively self-reliant. ""The government's involvement in the arts is often disastrous,"" he said. ""It creates vast bureaucracies and the money would be better spent on the police or NHS. ""Museum culture in the UK has centred around the misguided idea that funding should only come from the government, meaning that most cultural bodies put huge amounts of resource into getting grants - resources that if applied successfully to raising money from the private sector would probably do just as well. ""I believe the government ought to support a handful of major national collections - but even those should be encouraged to generate as much of their revenue as possible."" Celebrity donations, such as comedian Lee Mack's dibber, helped the museum broaden its appeal Diversifying some museums would be a push too far, according to Brian Radam, the curator of the British Lawnmower Museum in Southport. ""I can't see the British Lawnmower Museum becoming the latest blockbuster set - especially as most of our exhibits were destined for the scrapyard,"" he said. ""As for the idea of a B&B - well, they would be extremely uncomfortable to sleep on."" Finding funding to keep the museum going is exhausting work, Mr Radam says. ""Over the last 25 years we have become experts on saving money, running the museum on a shoestring,"" he said. Brian Radam says keeping the museum going is exhausting work The venue does not receive public funding so relies on its visitors and innovative ideas to secure its future. As well as ticket sales, the museum also makes money through restoring beloved family grass-cutting heirlooms. ""One of our ideas was to create an exhibition of lawnmowers of the rich and famous,"" said Mr Radam. ""We had Prince Charles and Princess Diana's mower, Brian May's and Albert Pierrepont's on display,"" he said. ""Lawnmowers are not the sexiest of subjects but the exhibition created a lot of interest and revenue."" But as museums and public arts venues face significant financial pressures, is it realistic to say that all can find ways to raise funds independently? The Museums Association believes there are more than 2,500 museums across the UK but says more than 60 have closed in the past 10 years. ""The bulk of closures are happening in areas that are less well-off, where there has been a severe decline in public spending,"" said Mr Brown. ""We have also seen several museums opening over that time - these tend to be small, independent museums that are volunteer-run. Dozens of museums have closed over the past decade ""A lot of our museums date from the 19th Century at a time of great national and civic pride. ""I don't think the number of museums is unsustainable but clearly there is a trend for some types of museums - particularly those run by local authorities - to close at the moment. ""It feels as if museums are being asked to make an extremely quick transformation into business organisations, but that can't take place overnight. ""There's also a philosophical question about what the role of museums is and the extent to which they should be focusing their energies on generating income or on their public role of inspiring and educating people.""

"Sportscene on BBC Two Scotland FT: St Mirren 4-1 TNS (McGinn, Mallan, Sutton, Loy; Brobbel) Buddies will play Dundee United in Challenge Cup final FT: Dundee 2-1 Rangers (O'Hara, Holt; Garner) Win lifts Dundee into Premiership's top six FT: Kilmarnock 1-2 Aberdeen (McKenzie; Pawlett, Stockley) Aberdeen take six-point lead over third-placed Rangers Clive Lindsay So, at the end of a long and topsy turvy day, we have Aberdeen six points clear of Rangers in second place in the Scottish Premiership after they came from behind to defeat Kilmarnock with two late goals. The Ibrox side failed to keep pace thanks to their 2-1 defeat away to Dundee, who overtake Killie and Partick Thistle and move into sixth place. Meanwhile, St Mirren beat TNS to advance to the final of the Irn Bru Cup. There's more football on BBC Two at the moment, with Sportscene's Premiership highlights programme. Join us for more live coverage on the website on Wednesday, when Hibernian host Hearts in what should be a thrilling Edinburgh derby in the Scottish Cup's fifth round. Aberdeen defeated Kilmarnock 2-1 at Rugby Park FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren will face Dundee United in the finalÂ on the weekend of 25/26 March, with the specific date and venue to be confirmed this week. United manager Ray McKinnon says he expects the Buddies to take confidence and improve ahead of the final as they look to escape relegation in the Championship. With TNS failing to become the first non-Scottish team into the Challenge Cup final, it will be between two Championship rivals and McKinnon expects a large crowd and a tough game for his side. FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren manager Jack Rosson BBC Alba: ""First-half, horrendous, second half, very good. ""I was very angry with them at half-time and the reaction was terrific in the second half and, prior to the sending off they were good and thoroughly deserved it in the end. ""I thought we had the momentum and were the better team before the sending off. ""I feel the sending off comes because of the way were playing and forcing them to make rash tackles. ""We are starting to build momentum and have to go and make it a third win in a row next week at Ayr."" A goal from Stephen McGinn (centre) helped St Mirren to victory FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints Dundee United manager Ray McKinnonon BBC Alba: ""I think St Mirren have been excellent in the second half and have kept TNS very quiet. ""They have even had the luxury of missing a penalty. ""It was very even in the first half, but I think the change Jack made bringing on Lewis Morgan and pressing high up the park, basically going 4-2-4 and keeping TNS back was fantgastic and they definitely deserved it in the second half."" FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren midfielder Stephen McGinnon BBC Alba: ""I was here as a young player when we last won the Challenge Cup and it was a brilliant day, a great game and we took a good crowd there. ""Us versus Dundee United is a Premier League final. they'll take a big crowd, we'll take a big crowd and it will be a great occasion to be a part of."" FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren midfielder Stevie Mallanon BBC Alba: ""We are very delighted.Â ""It was a tough team we played against on a good run of form and they've come across and beat a few teams in the cup already. ""The boys are just delighted to get a win on the board and give the fans something to sing about. ""In the first half, we were a bit sluggish and I think we just pressed them more."" TNS suffer only their second defeat in 32 games as St Mirren take advantage of Stephen Saunders' second-half yellow card to run out convincing winners in the semi-final of the Irn Bru Cup. The Welsh Premier League leaders were worthy of their lead, but the Saints made them pay for the former Motherwell defender's inadvisable lunge. The Buddies go forward to face Championship rivals Dundee United in the final. Rory Loy It is all over now as Rory Loy turns in a low cross from 10 yards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon has named St Mirren midfielder Stevie Mallan, the scorer of his side's second goal, as his man of the match on BBC Alba. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints TNS have four minutes, plus a bit of stoppage time, to stage an unlikely comeback with 10 men if they are to keep their Irn Bru Cup fairytale alive. It looks an impossible task. John Sutton John Sutton makes up for that penalty miss as Kyle Magennis weaves his way into the penalty box and his cut-back is fired high into the TNS net by the striker from eight yards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints The Buddies squander a great chance to virtually kill the game as John Sutton has his penalty saved by TNS captain Paul Harrison. It was awarded after the ball struck the arm of midfielder Aeron Edwards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints  Stephen McGinn fired St Mirren's equaliser St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints St Mirren are eight points behind Ayr United at the foot of the Scottish Championship, but they are turning into cup specialists. They have only won twice in their last nine outings and those have both come in knock-out competitions. Manager Jack Ross would probably trade those for league points! St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints Suddenly, St Mirren are looking like a different team and they look unfortunate not to win a penalty when Philip Baker comes in behind John Sutton as the striker looks likely to score from four yards out. Stevie Mallan Talk about a quick change in fortunes. St Mirren have gone from looking hopeless at 1-0 down to being 2-1 ahead against 10 men within a few minutes in Paisley. From the free-kick that led to Stephen Saunders' dismissal, Stevie Mallan curls low into the bottom corner. St Mirren 1-1 The New Saints Referee Keith Kennedy goes straight to his red card as Steven Saunders flies into a tackle on Buddies scorer Stephen McGinn. It was a strong challenge from the former Motherwell, Ross County and Dumbarton defender, but he is a tad unfortunate not to escape with a yellow.

The Ibrox side failed to keep pace thanks to their 2-1 defeat away to Dundee, who overtake Killie and Partick Thistle and move into sixth place. Meanwhile, St Mirren beat TNS to advance to the final of the Irn Bru Cup. There's more football on BBC Two at the moment, with Sportscene's Premiership highlights programme. Join us for more live coverage on the website on Wednesday, when Hibernian host Hearts in what should be a thrilling Edinburgh derby in the Scottish Cup's fifth round. Aberdeen defeated Kilmarnock 2-1 at Rugby Park FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren will face Dundee United in the finalÂ on the weekend of 25/26 March, with the specific date and venue to be confirmed this week. United manager Ray McKinnon says he expects the Buddies to take confidence and improve ahead of the final as they look to escape relegation in the Championship. With TNS failing to become the first non-Scottish team into the Challenge Cup final, it will be between two Championship rivals and McKinnon expects a large crowd and a tough game for his side. FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren manager Jack Rosson BBC Alba: ""First-half, horrendous, second half, very good. ""I was very angry with them at half-time and the reaction was terrific in the second half and, prior to the sending off they were good and thoroughly deserved it in the end. ""I thought we had the momentum and were the better team before the sending off. ""I feel the sending off comes because of the way were playing and forcing them to make rash tackles. ""We are starting to build momentum and have to go and make it a third win in a row next week at Ayr."" A goal from Stephen McGinn (centre) helped St Mirren to victory FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints Dundee United manager Ray McKinnonon BBC Alba: ""I think St Mirren have been excellent in the second half and have kept TNS very quiet. ""They have even had the luxury of missing a penalty. ""It was very even in the first half, but I think the change Jack made bringing on Lewis Morgan and pressing high up the park, basically going 4-2-4 and keeping TNS back was fantgastic and they definitely deserved it in the second half."" FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren midfielder Stephen McGinnon BBC Alba: ""I was here as a young player when we last won the Challenge Cup and it was a brilliant day, a great game and we took a good crowd there. ""Us versus Dundee United is a Premier League final. they'll take a big crowd, we'll take a big crowd and it will be a great occasion to be a part of."" FT: St Mirren 4-1 The New Saints St Mirren midfielder Stevie Mallanon BBC Alba: ""We are very delighted.Â ""It was a tough team we played against on a good run of form and they've come across and beat a few teams in the cup already. ""The boys are just delighted to get a win on the board and give the fans something to sing about. ""In the first half, we were a bit sluggish and I think we just pressed them more."" TNS suffer only their second defeat in 32 games as St Mirren take advantage of Stephen Saunders' second-half yellow card to run out convincing winners in the semi-final of the Irn Bru Cup. The Welsh Premier League leaders were worthy of their lead, but the Saints made them pay for the former Motherwell defender's inadvisable lunge. The Buddies go forward to face Championship rivals Dundee United in the final. Rory Loy It is all over now as Rory Loy turns in a low cross from 10 yards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon has named St Mirren midfielder Stevie Mallan, the scorer of his side's second goal, as his man of the match on BBC Alba. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints TNS have four minutes, plus a bit of stoppage time, to stage an unlikely comeback with 10 men if they are to keep their Irn Bru Cup fairytale alive. It looks an impossible task. John Sutton John Sutton makes up for that penalty miss as Kyle Magennis weaves his way into the penalty box and his cut-back is fired high into the TNS net by the striker from eight yards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints The Buddies squander a great chance to virtually kill the game as John Sutton has his penalty saved by TNS captain Paul Harrison. It was awarded after the ball struck the arm of midfielder Aeron Edwards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints  Stephen McGinn fired St Mirren's equaliser St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints St Mirren are eight points behind Ayr United at the foot of the Scottish Championship, but they are turning into cup specialists. They have only won twice in their last nine outings and those have both come in knock-out competitions. Manager Jack Ross would probably trade those for league points! St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints Suddenly, St Mirren are looking like a different team and they look unfortunate not to win a penalty when Philip Baker comes in behind John Sutton as the striker looks likely to score from four yards out. Stevie Mallan Talk about a quick change in fortunes. St Mirren have gone from looking hopeless at 1-0 down to being 2-1 ahead against 10 men within a few minutes in Paisley. From the free-kick that led to Stephen Saunders' dismissal, Stevie Mallan curls low into the bottom corner. St Mirren 1-1 The New Saints Referee Keith Kennedy goes straight to his red card as Steven Saunders flies into a tackle on Buddies scorer Stephen McGinn. It was a strong challenge from the former Motherwell, Ross County and Dumbarton defender, but he is a tad unfortunate not to escape with a yellow.

""The boys are just delighted to get a win on the board and give the fans something to sing about. ""In the first half, we were a bit sluggish and I think we just pressed them more."" TNS suffer only their second defeat in 32 games as St Mirren take advantage of Stephen Saunders' second-half yellow card to run out convincing winners in the semi-final of the Irn Bru Cup. The Welsh Premier League leaders were worthy of their lead, but the Saints made them pay for the former Motherwell defender's inadvisable lunge. The Buddies go forward to face Championship rivals Dundee United in the final. Rory Loy It is all over now as Rory Loy turns in a low cross from 10 yards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon has named St Mirren midfielder Stevie Mallan, the scorer of his side's second goal, as his man of the match on BBC Alba. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints TNS have four minutes, plus a bit of stoppage time, to stage an unlikely comeback with 10 men if they are to keep their Irn Bru Cup fairytale alive. It looks an impossible task. John Sutton John Sutton makes up for that penalty miss as Kyle Magennis weaves his way into the penalty box and his cut-back is fired high into the TNS net by the striker from eight yards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints The Buddies squander a great chance to virtually kill the game as John Sutton has his penalty saved by TNS captain Paul Harrison. It was awarded after the ball struck the arm of midfielder Aeron Edwards. St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints  Stephen McGinn fired St Mirren's equaliser St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints St Mirren are eight points behind Ayr United at the foot of the Scottish Championship, but they are turning into cup specialists. They have only won twice in their last nine outings and those have both come in knock-out competitions. Manager Jack Ross would probably trade those for league points! St Mirren 2-1 The New Saints Suddenly, St Mirren are looking like a different team and they look unfortunate not to win a penalty when Philip Baker comes in behind John Sutton as the striker looks likely to score from four yards out. Stevie Mallan Talk about a quick change in fortunes. St Mirren have gone from looking hopeless at 1-0 down to being 2-1 ahead against 10 men within a few minutes in Paisley. From the free-kick that led to Stephen Saunders' dismissal, Stevie Mallan curls low into the bottom corner. St Mirren 1-1 The New Saints Referee Keith Kennedy goes straight to his red card as Steven Saunders flies into a tackle on Buddies scorer Stephen McGinn. It was a strong challenge from the former Motherwell, Ross County and Dumbarton defender, but he is a tad unfortunate not to escape with a yellow.

"Germany's Angela Merkel, seen here with US Vice-President Mike Pence, asked in a speech whether countries would return to ""parochial policies"" The Munich Security Conference is at one and the same time an annual jamboree for senior officials and think-tankers and a place where former officials and corporate movers-and-shakers meet up. But it also affords an opportunity for a whole series of behind the scenes bilateral meetings. And once every four years it is the place where Europe takes stock of a new US administration. This year the meeting had added significance since the man in the White House, Donald Trump, is unlike any other president in living memory. His supporters believe he is the man to overturn the ""establishment"" in Washington and to get things done. His detractors believe he is unfit for high office, his erratic behaviour leading some even to question his mental state. Remember this was a man who on the campaign traildescribed Nato as ""obsolete""and who said that he would end the free ride that he believed many allies - especially in Europe - were taking at the American taxpayers' expense. So this encounter in Munich was an opportunity for Nato allies to weigh up the new Trump team and to try to gauge the new administration's likely direction. Mr Trump sent his Vice-President Mike Pence to Munich to deliver a series of clearly worded messages. Trump 'unwavering' in support for Nato allies, says Pence What does Nato want from Trump? And to avoid any doubt his new defence chief, General James Mattis, provided awarm-up act at Nato headquartersat the end of last week - and to ensure nobody mistakes the message Mr Pence himself will be heading to Brussels, the seat of Nato, once the Munich conference is over. Mr Pence used his Munich speech to bring a message of reassurance from the new president. ""The US,"" he said, strongly supports Nato and will be ""unwavering in its commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance"" . Mike Pence's words were an attempt to calm nerves ruffled when President Trump called the alliance 'obsolete' But with so few allies actually meeting the agreed target for defence spending, there was a warning too. ""Let me be clear on this point,"" he stressed, ""the president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word to fulfil this commitment and for most that means the time has come to do more"". This statement was met with hesitant applause - an indication that many Europeans do not welcome being bullied by the Trump White House. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had emphasised that military spending alone was not the only measure of the Europeans' commitment to security. She calmly - but pointedly - took issue with many of the Trump team's putative policies, noting the importance of international multilateral institutions like the EU and the UN (both of which have been condemned by Mr Trump). Indeed at the end of her speech she seemed to take on the central tenet of the Trump campaign - enshrined in the slogan ""America First!"" Looking to the future she posed a fundamental question. ""Will we be able,"" she asked, ""to act in concert together or (will we) fall back into parochial policies?"" One of Europe's greatest fears has been Mr Trump's apparent willingness to do a deal with Moscow - not to mention his evident admiration for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin. Mr Trump's emissaries pretty much convinced their European hosts that on key issues - at least for now - there would be no change. General Mattis insisted that Russia had to abide by international law and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a recent visit to Bonn, stressed that agreements like the Minsk accords to end the fighting in Ukraine had to be fully implemented by all sides - including Moscow. Sergei Lavrov, represented Russia, who were almost bystanders at this Nato conference Vice-President Pence emphasised the message saying here in Munich that the US would continue to hold Russia to account, even as it searched for areas of common ground. The Russians have almost been bystanders here watching the internal Nato debate from the sidelines. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov returned to a familiar theme - that Nato was essentially an institution of the past. The expansion of the Atlantic Alliance, he said, had led to an unprecedented level of tensions. What was now needed was what he called a ""post-western world order"". So there seems little chance here for President Trump's hope for fresh understanding with Moscow - or at the very least that it will not come at the expense of the European Nato allies, or perhaps even of Ukraine. If there is a deal to be done between Washington and Moscow it will lie elsewhere, perhaps over Syria. This Munich conference will end on Sunday with many of the concerns of the Europeans only partially stilled. For they relate more to the character and outlook of the new US president himself. One of his tweets can undermine policies that have received bipartisan support in Washington for decades. And its not just a style thing: many of Mr Trump's policies remain unclear, even as so many positions inside his team remain unfilled.

"The apparent killing of Kim Jong-nam raises tricky questions for China Beijing needs to do more to rein in North Korea: that's the view of US President Donald Trump and his new team. But how much leverage does China really have there and what are the chances of it being used, asks the BBC's Stephen McDonell in Beijing. China and North Korea seem to be heading into yet another tense period in their recently rocky relationship. Once brothers-in-arms fighting against ""imperialist aggression"" during the Korean War, now Beijing accuses Pyongyang publicly of breaching United Nations sanctions in the pursuit of its missile and nuclear weapons programmes. And the apparent assassination of Kim Jong-nam - the half brother of North Korea's brutal leader - is being seen as a fresh point of tension between these official allies. In fact, some view it as direct slap in the face for China. Kim Jong-nam: North Korea's critic in exile Death in a dynasty: What led to the demise of Kim Jong-nam? Will the the latest sanctions on North Korea work? North Korea's missile programme It appears Mr Kim was murdered in Kuala Lumpur airport, on his way back to Macau, by female killers using of some type of poison. Kim Jong-nam died at Kuala Lumpur airport as he prepared to board a flight Kim Jong-nam spent much of the past decade in a type of self-imposed exile inside the former Portuguese colony. There he was seen to have the protection of China. The eldest son of North Korea's late leader Kim Jong-il, he said time and again that he had no interest in becoming involved in his country's politics. What's more, whenever he was cornered by reporters in the Asian casino city, with his shirt unbuttoned to number three and sporting a three-day growth, you could really believe him when he said it. After all, why would he want to? There has been speculation that he operated some sort of North Korean sanction-busting slush fund out of Macau and that this was the reason that Beijing and Pyongyang tolerated his hedonistic life style. But for China there was something else too. He was an ally inside the North Korean elite: somebody who thought the best way forward for his homeland was a Chinese-style opening up. For years, China has been trying to promote this style of thinking with its isolated, impoverished neighbour. Before he died, Kim Jong-il was shown around the prosperous Chinese city of Dalian. The message: ""You too could have some of this at home with a bit of opening up!"" But the Kim dynasty has appeared petrified by the prospect of such openness, and that Kim Jong-nam would side with the Chinese. So despite his apparent lack of interest in political power, the fact that he could be seen hanging around down in Macau as a possible leader to be called on by Beijing in the event of regime collapse in Pyongyang made him a threat to the paranoid figure in power there today. If this was a political assassination, then most North Korea observers think the order came right from the top. China joined UN Security Council condemnation of North Korea's latest missile test This will not go down well with the government of Xi Jinping in Beijing. In recent days the two countries' relationship has become even more murky. South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported that China turned back a $1m (Â£800,000) coal shipment from North Korea. China has long been criticised for turning a blind eye to North Korean coal exports, in violation of UN sanctions, but maybe not this time. In the wake of last weekend's North Korean ballistic missile test, 16,295 tonnes of its coal were denied entry to Wenzhou Port in Zhejiang Province. You see the sequence of events: Sunday 12 February missile test, next morning an ally of China is murdered, later that afternoon Beijing criticises the test, two days later the coal shipment is turned back. What's next? When asked about the death of Kim Jong-nam, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said his government had ""seen the media reports"" and that that they were ""following the developments"". I'll bet they are. Coal had been one of North Korea's main exports with most going to China At a social function run by the Chinese military recently, I was speaking to a Chinese officer about the US demand that they do more to bring pressure on North Korea. He shrugged his shoulders. He said they didn't know what the North Koreans would do next and that they had no idea what China could do to change their minds. Yet by far and away the vast majority of trade in and out of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), as the country prefers to be called, is with China. If you take Chinese trade out of the equation there's not much left. So why would Beijing put up with all this? Why put up with the waves of instability flowing out of Korean peninsula? The answer is US troops. US and South Korean marines recently conducted a joint military exercise It's often said that a meltdown in North Korea could lead to millions of refugees pouring into China but, even if this did happen, it would likely only be a temporary problem. No. The real fear is that a complete collapse of the North Korean regime could lead to Korean unification, with American soldiers based in a country with a land border with China. Beijing will not let that happen and Pyongyang's current ruler, Kim Jong-un, knows it. So no matter how many times North Korea drives its powerful protector to distraction, in the end, Beijing believes it doesn't have much choice but to put up with its weirdness, with its basket-case economy, with its erratic behaviour and probably also with its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
