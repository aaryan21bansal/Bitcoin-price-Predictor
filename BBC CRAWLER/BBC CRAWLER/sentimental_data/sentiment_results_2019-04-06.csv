"Both passports were issued in the week following the UK's scheduled departure from the EU A British couple who applied for their passports on the same day received different versions - one with European Union on the cover, the other without. The new burgundy passports were introduced from 30 March, the day after the UK was supposed to leave the EU. Peter Brady said he was ""very happy"" he received one of the new passports and his partner was ""unhappy"" she did not. The Home Office said some people may still receive the old version until stocks run out. The decision to remove the European Union label was made in the expectation that the UK would be leaving the EU at the end of last month, as scheduled. Dark blue passports resembling the pre-EU British design are due to be issued from the end of the year. Mr Brady and his partner Jan both sent off their passport renewal applications on 21 March. His passport, which does not have any references to the European Union on the cover or inside, was printed on 1 April. His partner's passport, which was printed on 4 April, features the EU logo on the front and the inside. Mr Brady said he feels like he has his ""identity back"" as he was a great believer in the UK coming out of Europe, adding it was a ""shame"" his passport was not blue. ""For me to have the European Union wiped completely off my passport is good news,"" he said. His partner Jan was ""very unhappy"" as she too wanted a UK passport without the EU on it, according to Mr Brady. Should the British passport be blue? Blue passport to return after Brexit Could a no-deal hit my holiday plans? A possible reason for the difference in their passports might be that Mr Brady's came from Glasgow and his partner's came from Peterborough. A Home Office spokeswoman said that ""in order to use leftover stock and achieve best value to the taxpayer"", passports that include the words European Union will continue to be issued for ""a short period"". She said: ""There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not. Both designs will be equally valid for travel."" A change in the design of the UK passport has proved a rallying point for Brexit supporters, with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage describing the 2017 decision to bring back the dark blue design as ""Brexmas"". This video can not be played Why British passports are changing colours after Brexit â and do Brits welcome the switch? Not everyone is happy at receiving one of the new passports - one recipient said she was ""truly appalled"" at the change. Susan Hindle Barone, who received her new passport on Friday, told the Press Association she thought the design should not change for as long as the UK remains an EU member. Allow Twitter content?

She said: ""I was just surprised - we're still members of the EU. I was surprised they've made the change when we haven't left, and it's a tangible mark of something which I believe to be completely futile. ""What do we gain by leaving? There's certainly a whole lot we lose."" Meanwhile others are pleased they received one of the old passports after 30 March. Steve Rowe said: ""I received my new passport this week with a start date of 1 April, happy to say it still says European Union; I think we'll still be discussing Brexit when it runs out in 2029.""

"The Duke of Cambridge has spent a ""humbling"" three weeks on work placements with three of Britain's security and intelligence agencies. MI5, MI6 and GCHQ were ""full of people from everyday backgrounds doing the most extraordinary work to keep us safe"", Prince William said. GCHQ's head of counter-terrorism said the duke worked ""exceptionally hard"". The royal learned about risks to the UK's national security and economy, Kensington Palace said. He also observed counter-terrorism teams analysing intelligence and carrying out investigations. Why real-life spooks love spy dramas MI5 'too slow' over Manchester bomber The prince's attachments came to an end on Saturday. ""Spending time inside our security and intelligence agencies, understanding more about the vital contribution they make to our national security, was a truly humbling experience,"" he said. Staff at the security and intelligence agencies ""work in secret, often not even able to tell their family and friends about the work they do or the stresses they face"", he continued. He added: ""We all owe them deep gratitude for the difficult and dangerous work they do."" UK will be 'less safe' without a Brexit deal, says former MI5 head MI5 and law firm among 'best LGBT employers' Prince William's attachment comes after the Queen celebrated GCHQ's centenary earlier this year with a visit to its former top secret base, Watergate House in London. The head of counter-terrorism operations at GCHQ, who is anonymous, said in a statement: ""William worked exceptionally hard to embed himself in the team and comfortably held his own amongst some highly skilled analysts and operators. ""His Royal Highness asked some probing questions and demonstrated a real grasp of our mission."" The threat to the UK from international terrorism is currently classed as severe, which means a terror attack is ""highly likely"".

"Beji Caid Essebsi won Tunisia's first free presidential election in 2014 Tunisia's 92-year-old president has announced he does not plan to stand in elections expected this November, despite calls for him to run. Beji Caid Essebsi told a meeting of his ruling Nidaa Tounes party someone younger should take charge. Mr Essebsi won the country's first free presidential poll in 2014. Former leader Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali was ousted in 2011 after 23 years in office during the Arab Spring uprisings across the region. Essebsi wins Tunisia president vote Read more about Tunisia here Tunisia has won praise as the only democracy to emerge from the revolutions. However, in recent years the country has suffered attacks by Islamists and economic problems, with unemployment a persistent issue. Mr Essebsi's party have called for him to run, as under the constitution he is entitled to stand for a second term. But the leader said he did not think he would put himself forward, saying it was time to ""open the door to the youth"". Members of Mr Essebsi's party had wanted the 92-year-old to run in the elections He also urged his party to end its feud with Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, who split from the government and formed his own party. Presidential elections are scheduled for 17 November, although none of the main political parties have yet announced a candidate. Mr Essebsi's announcement he does not intend to run comes days after neighbouringAlgeria's 82-year-old president Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned following weeks of huge street protests.

"This video can not be played Thousands rally in the capital, Khartoum Thousands of demonstrators across Sudan have taken part in what appears to be the biggest series of rallies against President Omar al-Bashir since protests began in December. In Khartoum, demonstrators reached the army headquarters for the first time. The presidential compound is nearby. Security forces used tear gas and made several arrests. The rallies mark the 34th anniversary of the coup that overthrew the regime of former President Jaafar Nimeiri. So far, the army has not intervened in the protests. Demonstrators remained outside the compound in the evening after authorities pulled back, as organisers reportedly called on protesters to hold a sit-in to keep up the pressure. Some reportedly vowed to stay until President Bashir resigned. Sudan's information minister meanwhile reaffirmed the government's plan to resolve the crisis through talks and praised the security forces. Police told the state news service Suna that one civilian - who protest organisers reportedly said was a medic - had died in Khartoum's sister city Omdurman. Civilians and officers were also reportedly wounded. Journalist Mohamed Ali Fazari, who was at the scene in Khartoum, said protesters were urging the army to side with the people against the government. The crowd chanted ""freedom, freedom, justice - one people one army"", he told BBC Focus on Africa radio. The protests were originally sparked by a hike in the cost of living but are now calling for the president, who has been in power for nearly 30 years, to step down. Sudan's economy has long been strained since the US imposed sanctions more than 20 years ago, accusing Khartoum of sponsoring terror groups. Authorities have used tear gas to try to disperse the protesters In December last year, the Sudanese government announced the price of fuel and bread would rise. In the year leading up to this, inflation had risen while the Sudanese pound fell rapidly in value. The announcement of the price rises triggered protests, which evolved into calls for President Bashir to step down. Biggest protests 'in memory' hit Sudan His rule has been blighted with accusations of human rights abuses. In 2009 and 2010, the International Criminal Court (ICC) charged him with counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. A warrant for his arrest has been issued. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) - a collaboration of health workers and lawyers - has been organising the protests. Doctors have emerged as a leading force and as a result are being targeted by the authorities. 'Why Sudan is shooting medics' 'We're not cleaners' - sexism amid Sudan protests Tear gas used as Sudan protests continue It is estimated that up two thirds of the protesters are women, who say they are demonstrating against Sudan's sexist and patriarchal society. This video can not be played Sudan protests: 'No amount of beating will make us stop' In February, it looked like he might give in to protests and step down, but insteadMr Bashir declared a state of national emergency. President Bashir spoke to the National Dialogue Committee at his palace on 5 April On the streets, security has been heavy, with tear gas used indiscriminately and reports of violence commonplace. This video can not be played Sudan protests: People flee gunshots in deadly protest Sudanese authorities have been accused ofarresting prominent activists and targeting medics, which the National Intelligence Security Service has denied. Authorities say 31 people have died in protest-related violence so far, but Human Rights Watch says the figure is more like 51. The pressure group Physicians for Human Rights says it has evidence of killing, persecution and torture of peaceful protesters and the medics caring for them.

"This video can not be played Protesters outside the Dorchester in London called for the British royal family to cut ties with the Sultan Brunei should be ""chucked out"" of the Commonwealth if it does not revoke its anti-LGBT laws, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has said. The South-East Asian nationintroduced strict Islamic lawsthis week that make gay sex punishable by stoning to death. Dozens of protesters chanted ""shame on you"" outside the Brunei-owned Dorchester hotel in London on Saturday. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had expressed ""deep UK opposition"" to the new laws to Brunei's government. But the Foreign Office said ""threatening to kick countries out of the Commonwealth"" was not the ""best way"" to encourage Brunei to uphold its human rights obligations. Addressing the crowd outside the Dorchester, Ms Thornberry said actions should have consequences and Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei should be shunned until the anti-LGBT laws are revoked. She added: ""Any hatred against anyone is hatred against all of us. ""Our fight is with the sultan of Brunei. Our fight is with this terrible law. We say no."" Ms Thornberry and the shadow minister for women and equalities Dawn Butler on Friday wrote to the foreign secretary to call for the prime minister to ""take a leading role in condemning these laws and calling for strong action to be taken"". UK PM Theresa May is the current Commonwealth chair-in-office - a main leadership role in the association. Labour's Emily Thornberry said ""hatred against anyone is hatred against all of us"" Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who organised the demonstration and is calling for a boycott of all of the sultan's companies, said: ""There can be no normal business relations with an abnormal tyrannical regime like that of Brunei. ""What the sultan has done has introduced punishments the same as Isis implemented in Iraq and Syria during its so-called caliphate, including brutal stoning to death of people convicted of homosexuality, adultery and insulting the Prophet Muhammad."" He described the ""close"" relationship between the Queen and the sultan as ""quite wrong"", saying she should not ""collude and consort with dictators like the sultan"". More than 65,000 people had signed a petition on the UK parliament website on Saturday evening that called on the government to ""urgently call for an end to human rights violations against the LGBT community in Brunei"". Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres andactor George Clooney are among those urging the public to boycott luxury hotels owned by Brunei. Organisations including English National Ballet and the Financial Times have cancelled events at The Dorchester amid the backlash. Brunei hotels deleted from social media Brunei honour recommended for revocation Dorchester Collection, the company that manages nine hotels including the Park Lane venue,has said it does not tolerate any form of discrimination.. On Saturday, the University of Oxford joined theUniversity of AberdeenandKing's College Londonin saying it would reconsider its decision to award an honorary degree to the sultan of Brunei. Mr Hunt said on Thursday he had spoken to Brunei Foreign Minister Dato Erywan ""to express deep UK opposition, shared by many, to the introduction of Sharia law"". ""We understand countries are responsible for their rules, but we will always speak out to defend our values, including the freedom to be who you are and love without fear,"" he said. The Foreign Office said in a statement Brunei's laws were ""cruel, inhumane and degrading"". ""But rather than threatening to kick countries out of the Commonwealth, we believe the best way to make progress and encourage Brunei to uphold its international human rights obligations is via a constructive dialogue on this issue,"" it added. Brunei: What you need to know Before the new laws were announced, homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The former British colony has retained the death penalty but has not carried out an execution since 1957. The new laws mostly apply to Muslims - who make up about two-thirds of the country's population of 420,000 - though some aspects will apply to non-Muslims.

"The EastEnders star says she no longer drives and does not go out socially EastEnders veteran June Brown has said she can no longer recognise her friends as she deals with age-related macular degeneration at the age of 92. The actress, who plays Dot in the BBC One show, says she has lived with the condition for 10 years. The sight-losing condition is common and can first affect people in their 50s and 60s. Speaking to the Daily Mirror,external, Brown said she has no central vision at all and can no longer respond to fan mail. ""I haven't driven for years and I can't really go out socially due to my eyesight,"" said the actress. Brown has starred in EastEnders since 1985 and revealed in 2018 that this will be her last year on the show. June Brown has starred in Eastenders since 1985 The actress said her condition was getting worse despite undergoing eye surgery in 2017. ""I never go to soap awards or suchlike now."" she said. ""I don't recognise people that I know and they would think I was snubbing them. ""Just pray for your health and strength, hearing and eyesight, and an active mind,"" she added. Degeneration of the macula leads to loss of vision at the centre of the field of view Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition which usually starts to affect people in their 50s and 60s. Although it does not cause total blindness, it can make everyday activities like reading, watching TV and recognising faces very difficult and can worsen without treatment. Symptoms can include seeing straight lines as wavy or crooked, objects looking smaller than normal and seeing things that are not there. The exact cause of macular degeneration is unknown, but it has been linked to smoking, high blood pressure, being overweight and having a family history of the condition. There are two types of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), dry AMD and wet AMD. There is no treatment for dry AMD but vision aids can help with day-to-day life. People diagnosed with wet AMD may need regular eye injections.

"Unlike previous presidents, Mr Trump has not published his tax details Donald Trump has the right to keep his tax returns private and Democrats' demands to see them are ""harassment"", a lawyer for the president has said. William Consovoy's statement hints at the shape of a possible future legal battle over the issue. On Thursday a Congressional tax committee demanded to see six years of Mr Trump's returns, saying it was necessary to ensure accountability. Unlike previous presidents, Mr Trump has refused to publish his tax details. On Friday he said he believed that the law was ""100% on my side"". NY to examine Trump tax affairs in 1990s How did Donald Trump make his fortune? Mr Trump has maintained his business interests during his presidency, prompting  questions about possible conflicts of interest. Questions also remain about his net worth, tax profile and past financial dealings. The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in mid-term elections last year, giving them the ability to launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs. Mr Consovoy said the tax committee did not have a valid legislative reason to see Mr Trump's tax returns. ""His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech,"" Mr Consovoy said of tax committee chairman Bill Neal. He said the request was a ""misguided attempt"" to politicise tax laws and could also end up interfering with audits. He said the US Treasury should not comply with the demand. Mr Trump has in the past said that he is unable to release his tax returns because they were being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However the IRS has said that he could release the returns even if they are under audit.

"Pro-government militias from the city of Misrata have been moving to defend Tripoli Fresh fighting has flared near the Libyan capital, Tripoli, between pro-government forces and fighters from the east of the country. Reports say clashes between Gen Khalifa Haftar's rebels and pro-government groups are taking place in three suburbs to the south of the city. Tripoli is the base of the UN-backed, internationally recognised government. The UN's Libya envoy has insisted that a planned conference on possible new elections will still go ahead. In a televised address the head of the UN-backed government, Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, accused Gen Haftar of launching a coup. Mr al-Sarraj said his government had ""extended our hands towards peace"", but said Gen Haftar will now be met with ""nothing but strength and firmness"". Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? Libya has been torn by violence and political instability since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. General Haftar - who was appointed chief of the Libyan National Army (LNA) under an earlier UN-backed administration - ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli on Thursday, as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in the city to discuss the ongoing crisis. The Libyan air force, which is nominally under government control, targeted an area 50km (30 miles) south of the capital on Saturday morning. It is unclear if there were casualties but the LNA has vowed to retaliate. Fighting has taken place in several areas, including near the disused international airport south of Tripoli. Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to march on Tripoli Gen Haftar spoke to Mr Guterres in Benghazi on Friday, and reportedly told him that his operation would not stop until his troops had defeated ""terrorism"". Tripoli residents have begun stocking up on food and fuel, AFP reported. LNA troops seized the south of Libya and its oil fields earlier this year. The G7 group of major industrial nations has urged all parties ""to immediately halt all military activity"". The UN Security council has issued a similar call. Russia has also called on parties in the escalating conflict to find an agreement. Speaking in Egypt, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov warned against what he called foreign meddling in Libya, while Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry said Libya's problems could not be solved by military means. Both countries have provided support to Gen Haftar. UN envoy Ghassan Salame said on Saturday that the conference planned for 14-16 April would still be held in time, despite the escalation - ""unless compelling circumstances force us not to"". By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor It's still unclear how much this is a show of force to bolster Gen Haftar's position or a genuine effort to seize Tripoli. Libya country profile He returned during the revolution and he's subsequently become the most powerful military leader in a country rife with militias, allied to a rival government in the east. Despite the chorus of international concern over his actions, he has had support from powerful outside players, including the UAE and Egypt. Efforts towards a political resolution for Libya have foundered time after time. The most recent hopes may once again have been dashed. Born in 1943, the former army officer helped Colonel Muammar Gaddafi seize power in 1969 before falling out with him and going into exile in the US. He returned in 2011 after the uprising against Gaddafi began and became a rebel commander. In December Haftar met Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj from the UN-backed government at a conference but refused to attend official talks. He visited Saudi Arabia last week, where he met King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for talks.

"The chancellor is meeting EU finance ministers in Bucharest Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he is ""optimistic"" Brexit discussions between the government and Labour can reach ""some form of agreement"". Mr Hammond said there were ""no red lines"" in the meetings. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""waiting to see the red lines move"" and had not ""noticed any great change in the government's position"". Three days of talks ended on Friday without agreement and Labour said no more talks were planned this weekend. Downing Street responded by saying it was prepared to pursue alterations to the deal and ready to hold further discussions with Labour over the weekend. The talks have been taking place to try to find a proposal to put to MPs which could break the Brexit deadlock in the Commons before an emergency EU summit on Wednesday. Speaking ahead of an EU finance ministers' meeting in Bucharest, Mr Hammond told reporters: ""We are expecting to exchange some more text with the Labour Party today, so this is an ongoing process."" Reality Check: What's in the Brexit political declaration? Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit explained in flowcharts Mr Hammond said: ""We should complete the process in Parliament... Some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions to us. Of course, we have to be prepared to discuss them. ""Our approach to these discussions with Labour is we have no red lines. We will go into these talks with an open mind and discuss everything with them in a constructive fashion."" Jeremy Corbyn said the government's position had not changed Speaking while campaigning for next month's local elections in Plymouth, Mr Corbyn suggested votes in Parliament were now the most likely way of providing a breakthrough on Brexit, saying his key priority was ""to avoid crashing out of the EU with no deal"". Mr Corbyn told the BBC: ""We have a party position on the future relationship with Europe... and we will responsibly discharge those duties, but we are determined to make sure there is no crashing out."" The prime minister has been unable to get Parliamentary backing for the withdrawal agreement she secured with the EU in November last year, which sets out the terms of the UK's departure. Labour has said it wants fundamental changes to a document drawn up at the same time, known as the political declaration. It sets out ambitions for the future relationship between the UK and EU after Brexit - including on trade, regulations, security and fishing rights - but does not legally commit either party. Shadow home secretary Ms Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Labour had engaged in the talks ""in good faith"" and shadow Brexit minister Sir Keir Starmer had written to the government to say he wants them to continue. She said there was concern that the government has made ""no movement"" on altering the political declaration and ""that is key"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott highlighted Labour's concerns over the political declaration A Downing Street spokesman said after Friday's talks that ""serious proposals"" were made and it was ""prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says there was a sense that the government has ""only offered clarifications on what might be possible from the existing documents, rather than adjusting any of their actual proposals"". She added that both sides agreed the talks are not yet over, but there were no firm commitments for when further discussions might take place. The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by the House of Commons. Prime Minister Theresa May has written to European Council President Donald Tusk torequest an extension to the Brexit process until 30 Junebut says if MPs agree a deal, the UK should be able to leave before European parliamentary elections are held on 23 May. She says the UK would prepare to field candidates in May's European Parliament elections if MPs failed to back a deal. But education minister Nadhim Zahawi told the Today programme it would be ""a suicide note of the Conservative Party if we had to fight the European elections"". He added the elections would pose an ""existential threat"" to both the Conservatives and Labour if they ""haven't been able to deliver Brexit"". Mr Zahawi suggested that if an agreement could not be found from the talks with Labour, MPs should be asked to find a compromise on a deal through a preferential voting system. Any extension to the UK's departure would have to be unanimously approved by EU leaders. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button A senior EU source told BBC Europe editor Katya Adler thatDonald Tusk would propose a 12-month ""flexible"" extension, with the option of the UK leaving sooner once Parliament had ratified a deal. French Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin said such a delay would require the UK to put forward a proposal with ""clear and credible political backing"". ""In the absence of such a plan, we would have to acknowledge that the UK chose to leave the EU in a disorderly manner,"" she added. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE it was unlikely that a UK request for a delay would be vetoedby any EU member nations as it could cause economic hardship in the bloc and ""they wouldn't be forgiven for it"". But he said there was growing frustration from some nations which see Brexit as distracting from other things.

"Israel has established more than 100 Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if he is re-elected. Israelis go to the polls on Tuesday and Mr Netanyahu is competing for votes with right-wing parties who support annexing part of the West Bank. The settlements are illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Last month the US recognised the occupied Golan Heights, seized from Syria in 1967, as Israeli territory. Can Jewish settlement issue be resolved? What Trumpâs Golan Heights move really means Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Israel has settled about 400,000 Jews in West Bank settlements, with another 200,000 living in East Jerusalem. There are about 2.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians want to establish a state in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. What happens to the settlements is one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians - Palestinians say the presence of settlements makes a future independent state impossible. Israel says the Palestinians are using the issue of settlements as a pretext to avoid direct peace talks. It says settlements are not a genuine obstacle to peace and are negotiable. He was asked during an interview on Israeli TV why he had not extended Israeli sovereignty to large settlements in the West Bank. ""You are asking whether we are moving on to the next stage - the answer is yes, we will move to the next stage,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu is seeking re-election ""I am going to extend [Israeli] sovereignty and I don't distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlements."" Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said the statement by Mr Netanyahu was ""not surprising"". He added: ""Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump administration's support and endorsement of Israel's violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine."" A spokesman for Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas told Reuters: ""Any measures and any announcements will not change the facts. Settlements are illegal and they will be removed."" By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor These comments by Benjamin Netanyahu are potentially explosive over an issue that has helped stall peace efforts for years. They will resonate with several parties with which he'll try to form a coalition government if he wins the biggest share of votes. But the very idea of annexation will rouse new Palestinian fury, as well as international condemnation. Mr Netanyahu may have been emboldened by the Trump administration, which just last month recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party is in a tight race with the new centre-right Blue and White alliance. However other parties, some of which support annexation, could end up being kingmakers when they try to form a governing coalition. Israel election: Who are the key candidates? The ex-military chief trying to unseat Netanyahu In Mr Netanyahu's own Likud party, 28 out of the 29 lawmakers running for re-election are on record as supporting this approach. Until now the prime minister was the only exception. Mr Trump's administration is preparing to unveil a long-awaited Middle East peace plan, which US officials say will be fair. However the Trump administration has carried out a series of actions that have inflamed Palestinian opinion and generally pleased Israel. In 2017Mr Trump announced that the US recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, overturning decades of official US policy. In response Mr Abbas cut off relations with the US, saying Washington could no longer be a peace broker. Last yearthe US stopped contributing to the UN Relief and Works Agency(Unrwa), which has been supporting Palestinian refugees since 1949. In MarchPresident Trump officially recognised Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights. On Saturday, speaking at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition, he warned that a Democratic victory in 2020 could ""leave Israel out there"", in an effort to make the case to Jewish voters to support his re-election. Peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians have been at a standstill since 2014, when a US-brokered attempt to reach a deal collapsed.

"Retail tycoon Mike Ashley has offered a Â£150m cash injection to ailing retailer Debenhams - as long as he can become its chief executive. Mr Ashley, who is Debenhams' biggest shareholder,has been embroiled in a battle for control with its board. Last week, the retailer challenged Mr Ashley to table a firm takeover offer or abandon his attempt to take control and provide funding instead. Debenhams has refused to comment on the offer.

Debenhams is planning a restructuring of the business to put it on a more sustainable financial footing. That's expected to lead to the closure of about 50 stores in the longer term.

"This video can not be played Labour would consider voting to revoke Article 50 to avoid no deal - shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey Prime Minister Theresa May has insisted she had to reach out to Labour in a bid to deliver Brexit or risk letting it ""slip through our fingers"". The PM said there was a ""stark choice"" of either leaving the European Union with a deal or not leaving at all. And shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey says if no-deal became an option Labour would consider ""very, very strongly"" voting to cancel Brexit. Some Tories have criticised the PM for seeking Labour's help on her deal. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the Tories were working with Labour ""through gritted teeth"", adding that no deal would be better than cancelling Brexit. MPs have rejected Mrs May's Brexit plan three times and last week's talks between the two parties were aimed at trying to find a proposal which could break the deadlock in the Commons before an emergency EU summit on Wednesday. However, the three days of meetings stalled without agreement on Friday. In a video message posted on Sunday, Mrs May said she could not see MPs accepting her deal ""as things stand"". She added that she had been looking for ""new ways"" to get a deal through Parliament, but it would require ""compromise on both sides"". ""I think people voted to leave the EU, we have a duty as a Parliament to deliver that,"" she added. Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit explained in flowcharts Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he was ""waiting to see the red lines move"" and had not ""noticed any great change in the government's position"". He is coming under pressure from his MPs to demand a referendum on any deal he reaches with the government, with 80 signing a letter saying a public vote should be the ""bottom line"" in the negotiations. In a statement issued on Saturday night, Mrs May said after doing ""everything in my power"" to persuade her party - and its backers in Northern Ireland's DUP - to approve the deal she agreed with the EU last year, she ""had to take a new approach"". ""We have no choice but to reach out across the House of Commons,"" the PM said, insisting the two main parties agreed on the need to protect jobs and end free movement. ""The referendum was not fought along party lines and people I speak to on the doorstep tell me they expect their politicians to work together when the national interest demands it."" Mrs May has been criticised by some Conservatives for reaching out to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Getting a majority of MPs to back a Brexit deal was the only way for the UK to leave the EU, Mrs May said. ""The longer this takes, the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all."" Ms Long-Bailey, who was involved in Labour's meetings with the government, told BBC's Andrew Marr Show they were ""very good-natured"" and there had been ""subsequent exchanges"". She said Labour was yet to see the compromise proposals needed to agree a deal but she was ""hopeful that will change in the coming days and we are willing to continue the talks"". However, she added Labour would ""keep all options in play to keep no deal off the table"", including supporting a vote to revoke Article 50 - the legal mechanism through which Brexit is taking place. Tory Brexiteers have reacted angrily to the prospect of Mrs May accepting Labour's demands, particularly for a customs union with the EU which would allow tariff-free trade in goods with the bloc but limit the UK from striking its own deals. Ms Long-Bailey indicated Labour might be willing to be flexible over its support for a customs union but said the government proposals on the issue have ""not been compliant with the definition of a customs union"". This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom: ""It is appalling to consider another referendum"" Interviewed on the Andrew Marr Show, Ms Leadsom reiterated hercomments in the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat holding another referendum on the UK's departure would be the ""ultimate betrayal"". She said that taking part in the European elections in the event of a Brexit delay would be ""utterly unacceptable"". Ms Leadsom said: ""Specifically provided we are leaving the European Union then it is important that we compromise, that's what this is about and it is through gritted teeth. But nevertheless the most important thing is to actually leave the EU,"" she said. The Commons leader also told the BBC's Brexitcast there is the potential for bringing Mrs May's deal back before MPs this week. The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by the House of Commons. This week Mrs May is to ask Brussels for an extension to 30 June, with the possibility of an earlier departure if a deal is agreed. Labour says it has had no indication the government will agree to its demand for changes to the political declaration - the section of Mrs May's Brexit deal which outlines the basis for future UK-EU relations. The document declares mutual ambitions in areas such as trade, regulations, security and fishing rights - but does not legally commit either party. Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab says the talks could help Mr Corbyn into No 10 Leaving the EU's customs union was a Conservative manifesto commitment, and former party whip Michael Fabricant predicted ""open revolt"" among Tories and Leave voters if MPs agreed to it. However, Downing Street has described the prospect as ""speculation"". Meanwhile, theSunday Telegraph reported some activists,externalwere refusing to campaign for the party, while donations had ""dried up"". And former Brexit SecretaryDominic Raab writes in the Mail on Sunday,externalthat Mrs May's approach ""threatens to damage the Conservatives for years"". ""There is now a danger that Brexit could be lost and that the government could fall - handing the keys to Downing Street to Corbyn,"" he says. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said including Mr Corbyn in the Brexit process was a ""mistake"" as ""he is not sympathetic to the government, obviously, and is a Remainer"". He told Sky News the reason Mrs May has not been able to secure the backing of all Conservative MPs was ""her own creation"" and because she failed to ""deliver"" a deal they could support. Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss dismissed the idea of a long delay to Brexit, which could be ended if Parliament approved a deal. Ms Truss told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics a so-called flextension ""sounds like purgatory"", adding: ""We haven't yet negotiated the free trade deal we need... So I think the British public are going to be pretty horrified if we go into more limbo than we've already had."" In a letter to Mr Corbyn, some Labour MPs have pointed out that - because the political declaration is not legally binding, and with Mrs May having promised to stand down - a future Tory PM could simply ""rip up"" any of her commitments. Four shadow ministers were among 80 signatories of the Love Socialism Hate Brexit campaign letter pressing for a further public vote.

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"Thedraft political declaration,externalon the future relationship between the EU and the UK, after Brexit, is out. Theresa May describes it as the right deal for the UK. A few points to rememberâ¦ This is not a legally binding document. It's not very long either, but it has grown from last week's seven-page outline to 26 pages. It sits alongside the 585-page Draft Withdrawal Agreement (which will be legally binding if it gets ratified). This is also a draft, agreed by negotiators, but it still needs to be approved by the leaders of all 28 EU countries at a summit scheduled to take place on Sunday. Don't expect major changes. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened - currently after 29 March 2019. It contains plenty of aspirations involving shared interests, close partnerships and ambitious co-operation, but many of the details are still to come. Here's an initial look at what's in the text: A reminder that this really is about everything, not just about trade: the entire scope of the future relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbours. Both sides want that relationship to be as close and co-operative as possible but that aspiration will be tested in the years ahead. Again, it's worth emphasising that this is not a legally binding document, so there are no guarantees about what the post-Brexit world will look like. And no-one can say for certain how long it will all take to negotiate. The bottom line of both parties is included early on. Anything that is negotiated must be consistent with the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. And nothing will be agreed that threatens the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. As we've seen for months now, the issue of the Irish border is where the combination of these core principles becomes most complicated. So trade in goods should be ""as close as possible"", but that's not the same as being frictionless. It leaves a lot of wriggle room in negotiations, with no guarantee of the final outcome. The two sides are committing themselves to an ""ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced"" economic partnership, based on a comprehensive free trade agreement. But there is also repeated emphasis that there must be a level playing field, which ensures open and fair competition. The more economic rights you retain, the EU is reminding the UK, the more obligations to which you have to sign up. When the outline of this draft emerged last week, this was a notion that raised alarm bells for many supporters of Brexit. Dominic Raab mentioned it in his resignation statement. Their fear, which will not be dispelled by this draft text, is that temporary customs arrangements could easily turn into some form of permanent customs union, preventing the UK from doing its own trade deals on goods around the world. The government denies this, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future, including the need to avoid checks on what are known as ""rules of origin"". The declaration also mentions explicitly an ""independent trade policy"" for the UK in the future. We are, this emphasises, open to any solution that will avoid the proposed backstop solution, to keep the Irish border open. That includes technological and other solutions that critics of the Brexit negotiations say have been ignored for too long. The trouble is that technological solutions that avoid the need for any border infrastructure are not in operation anywhere in the world. UK officials see this as a key sentence, which suggests there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the negotiations to come. It makes clear, they argue, that it is not the case that the UK can only have either a basic free trade agreement (like Canada) or membership of the single market (like Norway), with nothing in-between. But none of the language here commits the EU to anything specific. As expected, the regulation of financial services will be based on a system of ""equivalence"" and the aim is to negotiate the details in this key sector before the end of June 2020. There's nothing in the language here to suggest that the UK will get better terms than any other third country dealing with the EU - but that will be a key negotiating aim. There are also plenty of aspirational words on ""ambitious and comprehensive"" plans for the service sector in general, but there is an awful lot to negotiate. There are plenty of nods towards the way the world economy is changing, and the importance of comprehensive agreements on data. The UK hopes that in the negotiations to come, it can be well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and the digital economy. But the EU has already made it clear that the UK cannot expect to have the same access to all EU databases - in various economic and security areas - as it would have as an EU member state. This fulfils the prime minister's pledge that the UK will take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK will come to an end. But it means, of course, that free movement for UK citizens travelling to the EU will also stop. The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays. There is neutral language here, including the ""best endeavours"" principle that commits both sides to doing everything they can to reach a deal. But that disguises the fact that there are still deep disagreements on fishing, and on getting the right balance between access for UK produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK fishing waters. Expect this one to run and run, because the UK is not alone in having a vocal fishing lobby with more political power than its overall contribution to the economy might suggest. There is a lot in this document on security - both on internal police co-operation and on broader foreign policy and defence co-operation. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the draft makes clear that - on internal security matters in particular - there is a variety of legal and technical issues to overcome. We can expect, though, that UK and EU foreign policy will be co-ordinated as closely as possible in the future. Rather like the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration envisages a system of dispute resolution involving a joint committee and an arbitration panel. But once again, on matters of EU law (and there will be a lot of that involved in any future relationship) the final word will rest with the European Court of Justice. The government will point out that after Brexit the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end. There is a plethora of other issues in the draft document that this article hasn't covered: transport, energy, intellectual property and so on. Both sides say they hope all these issues and more can be wrapped up by the end of 2020. It's an ambitious timetable.

"The Students' Union at the University of Leicester started the campaign Students inspired to share stories about harassment and sexual abuse have been warned about ""naming and shaming"" alleged rapists. The #MeToo-inspired campaign, led by those studying in Leicester, encouraged young women to share their stories. However, the names and pictures of rumoured sex abusers have been shared on Twitter by students across the country. Legal experts said identifying someone could risk any future court cases. Leicestershire Police said it was aware of the tweets and encouraged victims to contact officers. University of Leicester Students' Union started its campaign on Monday. Since then stories have emerged of harassment in clubs, drink spiking, sexual assaults and rape. Tweets naming alleged attackers in areas including Hertfordshire, Leeds, Leicester, Nottingham and Wolverhampton have been shared. Students at De Montfort University in Leicester held a vigil on Friday to raise awareness about consent The University of Leicester said it took allegations of sexual violence ""extremely seriously"" and would be working closely with the Students' Union. The University of Nottingham said it was currently investigating an allegation of sexual harassment. It added there was ""no place for violence and sexual harassment on a university campus"". A legal expert at Justice, a human rights and law reform campaign group, said ""naming and shaming"" online could be dangerous because everyone had a right to a fair trial. Legal director Jodie Blackstock, said: ""Publicly identifying someone as guilty before trial risks a court being biased, which could prevent the perpetrator being brought to justice"". Leicestershire Police said it was aware of the tweets, but had so far received no reports. Oge Obioha, a law student turned wellbeing officer, who organised the Leicester campaign, said: ""Harassment is a nationwide problem - it happens on a day-to-day basis and we need to stop normalising it.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Man City 1-0 Brighton Manchester City stayed on course for the quadruple as they reached the FA Cup final after edging out Brighton at Wembley. Pep Guardiola's side were nowhere near their best but a largely undistinguished contest was settled by Gabriel Jesus' stooping header after only four minutes, converted from Kevin de Bruyne's perfect right-wing cross. Brighton battled manfully but could not turn possession into prolonged threat, although City were grateful to Aymeric Laporte's clearance from right under his own crossbar after the break with Glenn Murray poised to score. Manchester City defender Kyle Walker was fortunate to escape a first-half red card after a VAR review for thrusting his head into the face of Alireza Jahanbakhsh after the pair clashed - and ultimately they were happy to simply close out the win. They will now face either Watford or Wolves in the final at Wembley on 18 May and also remain in the hunt for the Premier League and Champions League after winning the Carabao Cup. How you rated the players Quadruple will be almost impossible - Guardiola Gabriel Jesus' flying header gave Manchester City the lead Manchester City have a list of three further targets as they chase a historic quadruple - the FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League. Some may regard as the FA Cup as the least pressing of those priorities but Pep Guardiola's team selection and body language here at Wembley illustrates the importance he attaches to this historic competition, a trophy that has so far eluded him since his arrival in England. The Catalan was animated throughout, often in fury, but his fist-pump to his backroom team as City moved into an attacking position in stoppage time showed he wants the FA Cup on his - and his club's - CV very badly. Make no mistake, City were were light years away from their imperious best, failing to confirm their authority after an early goal that ripped up Brighton's blueprint of containment. But, for a side that has world-class attacking football as its trademark, City gave very little away at the back and most key aerial challenges were won. City did not excel - but they are in the FA Cup Final and move on to face Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League quarter-final first leg in the Londoners' majestic new stadium on Tuesday. Brighton's players were given a standing ovation at the final whistle from the supporters who packed their portion of Wembley, in recognition of the endeavour they had displayed. It was deserved for the effort they put in which kept them in contention right until the end after it had looked like they may be swept aside once City struck the early blow. In reality, however, they barely laid a glove on City for all their possession, the only real scare coming when Laporte had to hoist that second-half clearance over his own crossbar with Murray poised. The Seagulls were never lacking in application but they just did not have the pace or threat to provide the final flourish to decent build-up work. Chris Hughton's side will take credit from their performance but, on reflection, may also regard it as something of a missed opportunity as they came up against an off-colour and uninspired City team. The hopes of their first FA Cup final appearance since 1983 have disappeared and now it is back to the more routine business of ensuring Premier League safety. Aymeric Laporte has been a defensive stalwart for Manchester City this season, and his clearance from under his own crossbar was crucial to protecting City's safe passage to the final Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola:""It was a semi-final, Brighton are an incredible defensive team, we knew that set pieces were huge, massive. We conceded too many but only one dangerous situation. We are in the final, we are there. ""My opinion is that nobody has done it [won the quadruple] so why can we do it? It is almost impossible to achieve everything, that is the truth. Our fans will come, more than today, for the final, we are losing players every game but still we will try to do it. ""I am happy to be in the final, we extend our season by one more week and we are happy for that."" Brighton manager Chris Hughton:""I am incredibly proud. After conceding after three minutes I don't think there was anyone in the stadium that thought the second wasn't going to come. We hung in and to go through the 90 minutes and, apart from the goal, I struggle to think of a real clear chance. That wouldn't have happened often. if at all, to them this season. ""We have raised the bar today in the level of our performance. The most important thing is to take that into the difficult games. We have got vitally important home games. We have to get something from those two."" Manchester City have reached their 11th FA Cup final, and first since 2013 when they eventually lost to Wigan. City have become the ninth different team to reach both major domestic English cup finals within the same season, after Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Sheffield Wednesday and Tottenham Hotspur. Brighton have never won in five competitive matches at Wembley in all competitions, drawing one and losing four. City have scored 20 goals in the FA Cup this season, the most by a team in a single season in the competition since Chelsea in 2011-12 (also 20). City are unbeaten in their last six games at Wembley in all competitions (W5 D1), conceding just one goal in those matches. Forty percent of Brighton's shots in this match were taken by centre-back Shane Duffy (2/5). City boss Pep Guardiola has become the first manager to reach both major domestic English cup finals in the same season since Kenny Dalglish with Liverpool in the 2011-12 campaign. City striker Gabriel Jesus has scored 12 goals in 15 appearances in cup competition this season (FA Cup, League Cup and Champions League) compared to six goals in 25 appearances in the Premier League. City's bid for the quadruple continues on Tuesday as they return to Champions League action. They meet Tottenham in the first leg of their quarter-final at 20:00 BST. Brighton's next game is an important home Premier League fixture against Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00) as they bid to avoid relegation.

"Some ""panthers"" have turned out to be domestic cats - this one was seen in east Ayrshire last year Paw prints, apparently from a big cat, have been found in a garden in Cornwall, following a report of a ""possible panther"" attacking a dog. Police were told about the incident in Harrowbarrow, Cornwall, on 29 March and called in the RSPCA. Police said a resident ""claimed that a panther had been in their garden and attacked their dog, and was later seen with another animal in its mouth"". Officers took a cast of a paw print which was ""the pad of a large cat"". A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesperson said: ""Police have received a single report of a big cat sighting in the Callington area. ""An officer attended the property and located the footprints in the garden. ""We called the RSPCA for advice and took a cast of the print which they confirmed was the pad of a large cat."" Was this the Beast of Bodmin seen in the 1990s? The police moved to reassure the public, saying: ""Over the years, there have been a number of similar reports across Devon and Cornwall. ""There is no evidence that such animals represent a danger to humans. ""It is highly likely that they would avoid human contact and only represent a danger if trapped. ""If any animal is sighted it should not be approached."" The RSPCA said: ""Our officer attended after reports that a Labrador had been scratched by a large, black cat. ""Thankfully, the dog is fine although he has scratch marks, and the owner is taking precautions to keep an eye on the dog in case of further sightings."" In the 1990s, there was aspate of big cat sightingsreported on Bodmin Moor, about 10 miles from Harrowbarrow. This caused the government to call in investigators to search for the creature which became known as the ""beast of Bodmin"". There have also been more recent reports of big cats in Cornwall and Devon.

"Allan Beckett was in a coma in 2016 - now he plans to tackle a 240km race When Allan Beckett woke from a coma, he was unable to understand the meaning of certain idioms such as ""rush hour"" - which for a long-distance cyclist was a little too ironic for comfort. The 41-year-old from Glasgow says it was as though well-known phrases had been wiped from his memory following a road accident in 2016. He was told that while pedalling down a slope on Polnoon Street in Eaglesham, East Renfrewshire, his bike crashed. Beyond that details are scarce. The impact left him out cold for three days with a head injury, while his pregnant wife Nicola visited him in hospital. He still can't remember several weeks of his life surrounding the collision - but otherwise, he says he is fighting fit. ""There were no witnesses,"" said Allan. ""I don't really know anything - whether it was a mistake or mechanical."" Allan has done a number of long distance cycles including the length of the UK - from Dunnet Head to Lizard Point Around three months later, having physically recovered, Allan took his bike back to the crash site to tackle another run down the hill - and crashed again. He said: ""I hit a pothole I couldn't avoid, it was so bad it knocked my handle bars out of alignment. ""It gave me a fright, but I did it a third time. People do give me odd looks, but I went back to get my confidence back."" Allan has tried countless different sports from snowboarding to archery, but started endurance racing in 2014. He has attempted a number of long distance rides including the entire length of the UK - a 270-mile cycle from Dunnet Head to Lizard Point. A torn ligament in his leg, broken arms and ankles, a broken back and a fractured chin are just some of the injuries he has suffered because of sport - but he remains unflappable. The year after his coma, he was back on a mountain bike when he crashed on ice and broke two ribs, yet continued to cycle a further 50km. Be it fearlessness or an appetite for danger, Allan is now preparing to tackle the Tour of Flanders in Belgium - a 260km route with 18 cobbled climbs, notorious for their difficulty. Dutchman Niki Terpstra claims Tour of Flanders win The terrain causes a terrible pain that Allan likens to breaking his arm all over again. He said: ""It's a shaky pain you feel through your wrists, hands, legs, undercarriage, teeth and head - it'll take me about nine hours. ""The 2017 crash was a bad one since it was my first real crash after the coma - I will admit it did bring back a lot of bad memories, I was a lot more vocal than I would usually be following a crash in terms of distress. ""So when I say that the Ronde Van Vlaanderen will hurt, I am speaking from a position of knowledge of riding through pain."" Niki Terpstra became the first Dutchman since Adrie van der Poel in 1986 to win the race last year Allan claims that in addition to keeping him physically and mentally fit, cycling also makes him a better businessman. A chartered accountant and director at Black and Lizars, he often uses cycling to clear his mind and bring what he calls a ""better flow"" into his day. He is a firm believer in the Japanese principle kaizen - which is to do with continuous improvement. Oldham teenager in coma wakes up with 'surprise' baby Inverness woman breaks record for cycling around world Â£400k bicycle parking hub launched in Dundee He said: ""A former colleague and I were struggling with how to get round an issue that affected the business and he jokingly said you should get on your bike and go for a ride. ""So I did - I went out for two hours and came up with a concept - the guys thought 'that'll work'. ""The thing I love to practice is flow, how to live your life as well as you can and how to read the situation around you. ""That's what you need to do on the bike - to do those distances you need to flow, you can't constantly stop and change your energy output. ""Think of when you approach a roundabout in a car, do you speed up then hammer on the brakes or do you ease off and glide through?"" Allan and his son Finn on a bike for the first time In light of his coma, Allan says he does not take as many risks in the name of sport, although his dedication to cycling has raised an eyebrow among friends and colleagues. But wife Nicola and two-year-old son Finn are fully behind him as he sets off for Belgium. ""I don't think it's an addiction,"" he said. ""I believe there are benefits of setting yourself challenges mentally and physically. ""If you have something that's positive for you then why wouldn't you do it? ""My mental health degrades quite significantly when I'm not exercising; it's just an overall feeling, the lack of space and lack of reflection. That's the key thing about being on a bike.""

"Pro-government militias from the city of Misrata have been moving to defend Tripoli Fresh fighting has flared near the Libyan capital, Tripoli, between pro-government forces and fighters from the east of the country. Reports say clashes between Gen Khalifa Haftar's rebels and pro-government groups are taking place in three suburbs to the south of the city. Tripoli is the base of the UN-backed, internationally recognised government. The UN's Libya envoy has insisted that a planned conference on possible new elections will still go ahead. In a televised address the head of the UN-backed government, Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, accused Gen Haftar of launching a coup. Mr al-Sarraj said his government had ""extended our hands towards peace"", but said Gen Haftar will now be met with ""nothing but strength and firmness"". Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? Libya has been torn by violence and political instability since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. General Haftar - who was appointed chief of the Libyan National Army (LNA) under an earlier UN-backed administration - ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli on Thursday, as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in the city to discuss the ongoing crisis. The Libyan air force, which is nominally under government control, targeted an area 50km (30 miles) south of the capital on Saturday morning. It is unclear if there were casualties but the LNA has vowed to retaliate. Fighting has taken place in several areas, including near the disused international airport south of Tripoli. Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to march on Tripoli Gen Haftar spoke to Mr Guterres in Benghazi on Friday, and reportedly told him that his operation would not stop until his troops had defeated ""terrorism"". Tripoli residents have begun stocking up on food and fuel, AFP reported. LNA troops seized the south of Libya and its oil fields earlier this year. The G7 group of major industrial nations has urged all parties ""to immediately halt all military activity"". The UN Security council has issued a similar call. Russia has also called on parties in the escalating conflict to find an agreement. Speaking in Egypt, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov warned against what he called foreign meddling in Libya, while Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry said Libya's problems could not be solved by military means. Both countries have provided support to Gen Haftar. UN envoy Ghassan Salame said on Saturday that the conference planned for 14-16 April would still be held in time, despite the escalation - ""unless compelling circumstances force us not to"". By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor It's still unclear how much this is a show of force to bolster Gen Haftar's position or a genuine effort to seize Tripoli. Libya country profile He returned during the revolution and he's subsequently become the most powerful military leader in a country rife with militias, allied to a rival government in the east. Despite the chorus of international concern over his actions, he has had support from powerful outside players, including the UAE and Egypt. Efforts towards a political resolution for Libya have foundered time after time. The most recent hopes may once again have been dashed. Born in 1943, the former army officer helped Colonel Muammar Gaddafi seize power in 1969 before falling out with him and going into exile in the US. He returned in 2011 after the uprising against Gaddafi began and became a rebel commander. In December Haftar met Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj from the UN-backed government at a conference but refused to attend official talks. He visited Saudi Arabia last week, where he met King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for talks.

"The 19-year-old was pushed from his bike in West Thomson Street A 19-year-old man has been scarred for life following an attack in Clydebank. He was cycling in the town's West Thomson Street at about 22:30 on Friday when two men assaulted him.

He was taken by a relative to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley for treatment to face, arm and hand injuries. His condition was described as ""stable"".

The suspects were wearing balaclavas and dark clothing. One of them had a black Berghaus fleece top. Det Con Adam McCreery said: ""This was a very frightening incident for the young man concerned who has received injuries which will leave him scarred for life. ""We are still trying to establish a motive for this serious assault however we would appeal to anyone in the area of West Thomson Street who may have witnessed the incident to come forward to police. We are not yet sure whether this was an attack in which the victim was the intended target but we are keeping an open mind to all possibilities.

"Emma Appleby with her daughter Teagan in the Netherlands Medicinal cannabis was confiscated from a woman as she tried to bring the drug into the UK illegally for her daughter, who has severe epilepsy. Emma Appleby and Teagan, nine, were stopped at Southend Airport after they flew from Amsterdam. Mrs Appleby bought Â£4,000 of the THC oil capsules in the Netherlands after being refused a prescription in the UK. But it was seized by the Border Force before the family, from Aylesham, Kent, was released from the airport. It was illegal to bring the drug into the UK without a prescription,which doctors have been able to issue legally since 2018. Doctors in the UK have refused to prescribe Teagan THC, a psychoactive compound found in cannabis. But Mrs Appleby believes the drug will help reduce her daughter's symptoms. She bought a three-month supply of THC and Cannabidiol (CBD), using money raised through crowdfunding, at a pharmacy in The Hague. ""I'm absolutely gutted,"" she said after the drugs were seized. ""They just took everything."" Mrs Appleby bought a three-month supply of THC from a Dutch pharmacy Speaking in the Netherlands on Friday, Mrs Appleby said her daughter had seizures ""every single night, every single day and I don't know if she's going to wake up in the morning"". ""This is our last resort. There's nothing else. We've tried all the medications at home,"" she explained. ""If there's a single, slight chance that this medication will help and save her I'm going to be here."" 'Duty to enforce law'. While it is legal in the UK for specialist doctors to prescribe THC, in general they will not because they say there is a lack of evidence that it's safe and effective. The government says it has asked for new guidelines to be drawn up for doctors, and is encouraging further clinical research. A government spokesman said: ""The decision to prescribe cannabis-based products for medicinal use is a clinical decision for specialist hospital doctors, made with patients and their families, taking into account clinical guidance, which is based on the best international evidence.

"Both passports were issued in the week following the UK's scheduled departure from the EU A British couple who applied for their passports on the same day received different versions - one with European Union on the cover, the other without. The new burgundy passports were introduced from 30 March, the day after the UK was supposed to leave the EU. Peter Brady said he was ""very happy"" he received one of the new passports and his partner was ""unhappy"" she did not. The Home Office said some people may still receive the old version until stocks run out. The decision to remove the European Union label was made in the expectation that the UK would be leaving the EU at the end of last month, as scheduled. Dark blue passports resembling the pre-EU British design are due to be issued from the end of the year. Mr Brady and his partner Jan both sent off their passport renewal applications on 21 March. His passport, which does not have any references to the European Union on the cover or inside, was printed on 1 April. His partner's passport, which was printed on 4 April, features the EU logo on the front and the inside. Mr Brady said he feels like he has his ""identity back"" as he was a great believer in the UK coming out of Europe, adding it was a ""shame"" his passport was not blue. ""For me to have the European Union wiped completely off my passport is good news,"" he said. His partner Jan was ""very unhappy"" as she too wanted a UK passport without the EU on it, according to Mr Brady. Should the British passport be blue? Blue passport to return after Brexit Could a no-deal hit my holiday plans? A possible reason for the difference in their passports might be that Mr Brady's came from Glasgow and his partner's came from Peterborough. A Home Office spokeswoman said that ""in order to use leftover stock and achieve best value to the taxpayer"", passports that include the words European Union will continue to be issued for ""a short period"". She said: ""There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not. Both designs will be equally valid for travel."" A change in the design of the UK passport has proved a rallying point for Brexit supporters, with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage describing the 2017 decision to bring back the dark blue design as ""Brexmas"". This video can not be played Why British passports are changing colours after Brexit â and do Brits welcome the switch? Not everyone is happy at receiving one of the new passports - one recipient said she was ""truly appalled"" at the change. Susan Hindle Barone, who received her new passport on Friday, told the Press Association she thought the design should not change for as long as the UK remains an EU member. Allow Twitter content?

She said: ""I was just surprised - we're still members of the EU. I was surprised they've made the change when we haven't left, and it's a tangible mark of something which I believe to be completely futile. ""What do we gain by leaving? There's certainly a whole lot we lose."" Meanwhile others are pleased they received one of the old passports after 30 March. Steve Rowe said: ""I received my new passport this week with a start date of 1 April, happy to say it still says European Union; I think we'll still be discussing Brexit when it runs out in 2029.""

Col Palmer, of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, was on his daily rush-hour commute on the District Line in London when there was an explosion as the train pulled in to Parsons Green Underground station. The married father-of-three, who is originally from Stockton-on-Tees, was two carriages away, but he pushed through screaming crowds towards the danger. A bomb built at home by a teenager had left 23 people with injuries from burns, while another 28 were hurt in the panic and crush afterwards. This video can not be played CCTV of Parsons Green Tube bomb fireball After 26 years of experience in the Army and following two earlier attacks that year in London, Col Palmer said he felt ""conditioned"" to take action if this incident turned out to be terrorism. ""Everyone was trying to get away while I was going forward,"" he said. ""I couldn't see a terrorist, but I could see what I thought was a burning bomb and realised the terrorist must be on the run - I saw horrified people, school children, all running past me."" Knowing that it was vital to gather evidence in the moments following an attack, he took three photos of the bomb in a carrier bag on the floor before alerting police. He said: ""It was still venting fumes and could have gone off at any moment. It was a calculated risk - Army officers are in the business of taking such risks, and I thought there's a 50/50 chance that if it goes off, I die."" The bomb was still smouldering when Col Palmer photographed it for police The citation for his bravery award said that this photographic evidence enabled police to declare a major incident and rapidly begin investigating the attack. The bomber was caught the next day in Dover. Col Palmer gave evidence in 2018 at the trial of 18-year-old Ahmed Hassan in the Old Bailey, which led tohis conviction and imprisonment for life. ""My instinct on the day was to stand firm in the chaos, step up and try to do the right thing. I believe that my actions represent the values of British soldiers which are deeply woven in to our DNA,"" he said. He said he had been motivated by the members of the British public on the train that day. ""It was witnessing their horror which gave me the courage to act."" Also honoured with the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service was Acting L/Cpl Jacob Fisher, an ""inexperienced"" combat medical technician who saved the lives of Somali soldiers after a truck accident in 2018. Part of a team working with the Somali National Army, L/Cpl Fisher was the only Royal Army Medical Corps member on the scene when an open-backed truck rolled over twice, leaving dozens of casualties strewn over a large area. Nine needed immediate life-saving treatment and two had serious injuries, but L/Cpl Fisher helped to ensure that they all survived.

"If there is an art to sugaring the pill, then Netflix and the production team at Silverback Films have perfected it with their 8x1-hour natural history TV series, Our Planet. The world might be going to hell in a handcart as wildlife populations plummet, rain forests are decimated, and for the first time in human history we are told the ""stability of nature can no longer be taken for granted"". But somehow it doesn't seem so awful or imminent when one of the greatest broadcasters who has ever lived is giving you the bad news. Having the warm, intelligent, measured voice of Sir David Attenborough repeatedly stating that man's reckless approach to managing Earth's delicate resources is putting it, and therefore our, very existence in grave danger, is a bit like Dr Doug Ross giving you a terminal diagnosis in ER: you don't really hear him because it's GEORGE CLOONEY. And, so it is with Our Planet. Sir David is emphatic and uncompromising in his assessment of the state of the natural world. We have ruined it, basically. Our rapaciousness aligned to industrial-scale destruction and over-population has put us on the brink of an ecological disaster from which there will be no return. ""What we do in the next 20 years will determine the future for all life on Earth"", he warns. Albatross parent feeding its chick on Bird Island, South Georgia, where numbers have declined by 40% It is a stark and important message but it never really lands in the way it is intended. It comes across more as ""Oh, and by the way"", as opposed to ""We're all doomed"". And that is because, when all is said and done, this is a classic Attenborough-narrated series full of his inherent optimism and love of the natural world in all its resilient, adaptable, magnificent glory. To be shown orangutans' habitat mercilessly eroded by the commercial exploitation of palm oil plants is awful, but soon forgotten when you watch mother teach son how to fillet a dead tree for ants. It is a narrative paradox that runs through Our Planet. However dire Sir David's warnings, they are always overshadowed by his enthusiasm to show us one more piece of amazing never-seen-before footage filmed deep inside the animal kingdom. This orangutan uses a stick tool to winkle out ants from a tree hole, and is part of a long-term study into these apes in Sumatra This is what he is best at, and when this series is at its best. The highly experienced production team who have Blue Planet and Frozen Planet among their credits, have delivered some stunning, unforgettable sequences, such as the mating ritual of a twerking Red-capped manakin bird, or, better still, those of a male western parotia. Western parotia bird of paradise; here the female looks down from her perch at the displaying male Cameraman Doug Anderson waits by a Callipterus shell pile, and starts the camera recording by pulling on a piece of string attached to the trigger in Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania From tip-toeing Flamingos to ancient worms with inbuilt glue-guns, Our Planet gives us some of the most dazzling images you are ever likely to view on TV. When necessary, they are embellished with Attenborough's commentary, which is never obtrusive and always written with brevity and wit. He doesn't do pomposity; his style is more down to planet Earth. If there is an everyday allusion needed to make the exotic images we are seeing feel more relatable, he generally has one to hand.

Frankly, by and large, you wouldn't know the difference. It is like a car manufacturer re-badging a model for another market: same product, different idents. I do wonder, though, if the experienced exec producers at BBC would have sharpened up the first episode a little. Its job is to be a scene-setter for the more editorially focused programmes that follow, but it feels slightly tentative and tends to jump about like a young Philippine eagle preparing to embark on its first flight. The Philippine eagle is one of the largest birds of prey in the world, but there are thought to be only 400 pairs remaining It is also possible there was another, perhaps more effective way, to make the very serious points about what the programme-makers think needs to be done to save our world from disaster. I know David Attenborough is not one to finger-wag, but maybe there was scope to make a single, no-holds-barred wake-up call episode with every last grain of sugar removed from the bitter pill. But these are moot points about a world-class television series made available in its entirety to the world on Friday. It has been created by masters of their craft with an exceptional narrator (though it's instructive to note that Attenborough doesn't entirely traverse all cultural borders - the Spanish version is voiced by Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek narrates for Latin America).

"Unlike previous presidents, Mr Trump has not published his tax details Donald Trump has the right to keep his tax returns private and Democrats' demands to see them are ""harassment"", a lawyer for the president has said. William Consovoy's statement hints at the shape of a possible future legal battle over the issue. On Thursday a Congressional tax committee demanded to see six years of Mr Trump's returns, saying it was necessary to ensure accountability. Unlike previous presidents, Mr Trump has refused to publish his tax details. On Friday he said he believed that the law was ""100% on my side"". NY to examine Trump tax affairs in 1990s How did Donald Trump make his fortune? Mr Trump has maintained his business interests during his presidency, prompting  questions about possible conflicts of interest. Questions also remain about his net worth, tax profile and past financial dealings. The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in mid-term elections last year, giving them the ability to launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs. Mr Consovoy said the tax committee did not have a valid legislative reason to see Mr Trump's tax returns. ""His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech,"" Mr Consovoy said of tax committee chairman Bill Neal. He said the request was a ""misguided attempt"" to politicise tax laws and could also end up interfering with audits. He said the US Treasury should not comply with the demand. Mr Trump has in the past said that he is unable to release his tax returns because they were being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However the IRS has said that he could release the returns even if they are under audit. In February Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen suggested during testimony to Congress that Mr Trump's taxes were not under audit during the 2016 presidential campaign - when Mr Trump said they were. Mr Trump had not wanted to release the tax returns because the resulting scrutiny could have led to an audit and ""he'll ultimately have taxable consequences, penalties and so on"".

"The Students' Union at the University of Leicester started the campaign Students inspired to share stories about harassment and sexual abuse have been warned about ""naming and shaming"" alleged rapists. The #MeToo-inspired campaign, led by those studying in Leicester, encouraged young women to share their stories. However, the names and pictures of rumoured sex abusers have been shared on Twitter by students across the country. Legal experts said identifying someone could risk any future court cases. Leicestershire Police said it was aware of the tweets and encouraged victims to contact officers. University of Leicester Students' Union started its campaign on Monday. Since then stories have emerged of harassment in clubs, drink spiking, sexual assaults and rape. Tweets naming alleged attackers in areas including Hertfordshire, Leeds, Leicester, Nottingham and Wolverhampton have been shared. Students at De Montfort University in Leicester held a vigil on Friday to raise awareness about consent The University of Leicester said it took allegations of sexual violence ""extremely seriously"" and would be working closely with the Students' Union. The University of Nottingham said it was currently investigating an allegation of sexual harassment. It added there was ""no place for violence and sexual harassment on a university campus"". A legal expert at Justice, a human rights and law reform campaign group, said ""naming and shaming"" online could be dangerous because everyone had a right to a fair trial. Legal director Jodie Blackstock, said: ""Publicly identifying someone as guilty before trial risks a court being biased, which could prevent the perpetrator being brought to justice"". Leicestershire Police said it was aware of the tweets, but had so far received no reports. Oge Obioha, a law student turned wellbeing officer, who organised the Leicester campaign, said: ""Harassment is a nationwide problem - it happens on a day-to-day basis and we need to stop normalising it.

"The white pick-up truck overturned in the crash Three men have been seriously hurt in a car crash after they had earlier failed to stop for police in the early hours. The men have been taken to hospital after the Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck they were in crashed, shutting the main road between Newport and Caerphilly. The car failed to stop for police twice after officers had initially tried to pull them over in the Adamsdown area of Cardiff at 04:00 GMT on Saturday. The car was found overturned after a crash on the A468 near Machen. The three men were found near the crashed white pick-up after it came off the road and overturned in woodland near the main road between Machen and Trethomas in Caerphilly county. The casualties were taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport with serious but non life-threatening injuries. Gwent Police said the pick-up truck has been recovered and the road has since re-opened. The main road between Newport and Caerphilly has re-opened since the crash The force said the car had been seen travelling at speed on the A48 road near Newport before the one-vehicle crash at about 05:30. Officers say the men are helping with their enquiries. Newport Road between Trethomas and Machen was closed in both directions for seven hours as police examined the scene near the Waterloo road junction at a place known locally as Ash Tip Bend.

"Teachers' pay in Wales was devolved to the Welsh Government in 2018 Supply teachers in Wales are to be boosted by a government-imposed minimum daily pay rate to help prevent them getting paid just Â£85 a day with agencies ""creaming off"" profits. Campaigners say some are quitting over low pay as it emerged directors of the Welsh Government'spreferred teaching supplier got nearly Â£1m in payouts. The reform will make it law for firms to show how much is being paid to the teacher and how much to the agency. Agencies say they offer good value. More than a quarter of agency supply teachers - of which there are about 4,500 in Wales - are being paid less than Â£100 a day, according to a National Education Union (NEU) report last year. ""Teachers are being ripped off,"" AM Neil McEvoy told aWelsh Assembly petitions committee meeting,externalas he claimed some of the 60 agencies in Wales ""cream off"" as much as Â£160 per teacher, per day while ""teachers get paid on average Â£85 a day"". Â£40m spent on supply teachers in Wales Supply teachers 'quitting over low pay' 'I know teachers doing pizza delivery' A petition to the assembly, submitted by former supply teacher Sheila Jones, claimed stand-in teachers were ""exploited"" and ""leaving the profession as they cannot afford to be supply teachers"" because ""agencies reduce teachers' pay by 40-60%"". AboutÂ£40m was spent on supply teachers in Walesin 2016-17 and the education minister has revealed a controversial and ""flawed"" national agency contract is being scrapped because of ""legitimate concern"". The government is in talks with the National Procurement Service and unions to agree the contract and minimum fee which will be introduced in September. Former supply teacher Sheila Jones is now a union official Sheila Jones, who is now Wales' supply teacher representative for the National Education Union, said while agency teachers' roles offered flexibility they did not receive the same pay as colleagues employed by local authorities. ""It's unjust,"" she said. ""There should not be a difference. ""I'm concerned that there are still going to be agencies in existence that can offer a different pay rate. ""Two people doing the same job should not be getting different pay and conditions, it's as simple as that."" Analysis from BBC Wales education correspondent Bethan Lewis: Problems with the system for arranging supply teachers have been flagged up for many years, but a solution has been more elusive. Councils used to have their own lists or schools had a handful of trusted contacts to draft in to cover sickness or courses. That still happens, but agencies have now become the main players - taking care of the checks and the training so head teachers just have to make a phone call. Agencies argue it is more cost-effective, others object to private companies profiting while schools struggle financially. The minister's plans could address some concerns, particularly on pay, though it will not deliver the all-Wales register of supply teachers some have been calling for. Education Minister Kirsty Williams admitted agency costs were ""murky"" and hoped the new deal would ensure ""those working in the system are better protected"". ""I acknowledge the previous contract had flaws and led to a situation I was uncomfortable with,"" she told the petitions committee. ""I have been concerned about the lack of transparency around fees and profits that are made by these organisations."" A Â£2.7m pilot project where supply teachers were employed full-time by a group of schools has showed ""benefits"" She added that agency fees would be ""publicly available"" to help ""better practices"" so employers can ""look very carefully how public resources that are meant to educate our children are properly deployed"". New Directions has dominated supply teacher provision in Wales but the new contract, which will start in September, will be on a local authority rather than Wales-wide basis. The Cardiff-based firm said it has operated an ""open and transparent rates matrix"" with government agreement and ""schools decide what rates they are willing to pay"". ""Over the term of the framework we have saved schools in excess of Â£15m, in turn providing relevant continuing professional development opportunities to over 4,000 education workers,"" said Gary Williams, the firm's group director. ""We welcome the changes for the new framework and see them as a positive for Wales."" Teacher recruitment agencies face fees crackdown Â£2.7m supply teacher project to help schools Schools have also been told they do not have to employ teachers through agencies and could hire them directly - so avoiding fees altogether. And theWelsh Government has sponsored a Â£2.7m pilot project- involving 52 newly-qualified staff - where supply teachers are employed full-time and fill in for absent teachers across 106 schools in 15 counties. Ms Williams said early signs show there were ""better pupil outcomes and behaviour benefits"" as well as ""wider benefits for school improvement"". Unions have ""begrudgingly welcomed"" the government's reform as they want supply staff to be paid depending on experience and not ""get them on the cheap"". ""It is a step in the right direction,"" said NEU Welsh secretary David Evans. ""But we still have some way to go.""

Police teams began fresh searches in Ballyhalbert for the body of Lisa Dorrian on Monday Ms Dorrian's killing is one of the most high-profile unsolved murders in Northern Ireland. Before the latest search operation began this week,police had pursued more than 3,500 lines of inquiry and carried out almost 400 searches including extensive air, land and sea operations along the Ards Peninsula.

"If there is an art to sugaring the pill, then Netflix and the production team at Silverback Films have perfected it with their 8x1-hour natural history TV series, Our Planet. The world might be going to hell in a handcart as wildlife populations plummet, rain forests are decimated, and for the first time in human history we are told the ""stability of nature can no longer be taken for granted"". But somehow it doesn't seem so awful or imminent when one of the greatest broadcasters who has ever lived is giving you the bad news. Having the warm, intelligent, measured voice of Sir David Attenborough repeatedly stating that man's reckless approach to managing Earth's delicate resources is putting it, and therefore our, very existence in grave danger, is a bit like Dr Doug Ross giving you a terminal diagnosis in ER: you don't really hear him because it's GEORGE CLOONEY. And, so it is with Our Planet. Sir David is emphatic and uncompromising in his assessment of the state of the natural world. We have ruined it, basically. Our rapaciousness aligned to industrial-scale destruction and over-population has put us on the brink of an ecological disaster from which there will be no return. ""What we do in the next 20 years will determine the future for all life on Earth"", he warns.

It comes across more as ""Oh, and by the way"", as opposed to ""We're all doomed"". And that is because, when all is said and done, this is a classic Attenborough-narrated series full of his inherent optimism and love of the natural world in all its resilient, adaptable, magnificent glory. To be shown orangutans' habitat mercilessly eroded by the commercial exploitation of palm oil plants is awful, but soon forgotten when you watch mother teach son how to fillet a dead tree for ants. It is a narrative paradox that runs through Our Planet. However dire Sir David's warnings, they are always overshadowed by his enthusiasm to show us one more piece of amazing never-seen-before footage filmed deep inside the animal kingdom. This orangutan uses a stick tool to winkle out ants from a tree hole, and is part of a long-term study into these apes in Sumatra This is what he is best at, and when this series is at its best. The highly experienced production team who have Blue Planet and Frozen Planet among their credits, have delivered some stunning, unforgettable sequences, such as the mating ritual of a twerking Red-capped manakin bird, or, better still, those of a male western parotia. Western parotia bird of paradise; here the female looks down from her perch at the displaying male Cameraman Doug Anderson waits by a Callipterus shell pile, and starts the camera recording by pulling on a piece of string attached to the trigger in Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania From tip-toeing Flamingos to ancient worms with inbuilt glue-guns, Our Planet gives us some of the most dazzling images you are ever likely to view on TV. When necessary, they are embellished with Attenborough's commentary, which is never obtrusive and always written with brevity and wit. He doesn't do pomposity; his style is more down to planet Earth. If there is an everyday allusion needed to make the exotic images we are seeing feel more relatable, he generally has one to hand.

I know David Attenborough is not one to finger-wag, but maybe there was scope to make a single, no-holds-barred wake-up call episode with every last grain of sugar removed from the bitter pill. But these are moot points about a world-class television series made available in its entirety to the world on Friday. It has been created by masters of their craft with an exceptional narrator (though it's instructive to note that Attenborough doesn't entirely traverse all cultural borders - the Spanish version is voiced by Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek narrates for Latin America).

"This video can not be played Minimum auto-enrolment pension contributions are rising Ten million workers in the UK will now see a bigger chunk of their wages automatically diverted to a pension, starting with their next pay packet. New rates taking effect on Saturday mean employees, employers and the government will all contribute more to these pension pots. That will mean less take-home pay for many people who are automatically enrolled into a workplace pension. However, workers have the option of opting out of the scheme at any time. This creates a choice between saving for the future or taking money now. Ten million people aged 22 and over, who earn more than Â£10,000 a year and who were not already in a company pension scheme, have beenautomatically enrolled,externalinto saving for old age through a scheme which began in 2012. More will be enrolled in the future as they start work or new jobs. This latest change marks the final increase in contribution rates designed under the scheme. For someone earning Â£30,000 a year who is in an auto-enrolment scheme, the change means putting an extra Â£32 a month from their pre-tax pay into their pension pot. But any dilemma on whether to continue with these contributions or opt-out of contributing to a pension has been eased by a tax cut which also takes effect from now. More than 30 million people now only have to pay income tax on earnings above Â£12,500 a year, rather than above Â£11,850. Analysts also say that by choosing to opt-out of this automatic pension saving, workers would actually lose out on the money their employer puts into their pension pot. ""Anyone who chooses to opt-out is basically taking a voluntary pay cut,"" said Tom Selby, of senior analyst at investment company AJ Bell. ""If you turn down the matched contribution [from an employer] you won't get it back elsewhere."" Women are more likely to work part-time, and typically earn less - a so-called motherhood penalty. That means the pension contribution change could have more of a noticeable impact in terms of pounds and pence. For example, someone earning Â£20,000 a year will see their contribution to a pension rise from Â£335 to Â£555 a year. Women face 'glaring' gender pension gap Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too Gender pay: Fewer than half of UK firms narrow gap But for London hairdresser Chloe Cornwall, the long-term gain outweighs any short-term financial pain. ""This is a little bit of money that goes straight out of my wages before I even see it, that is for the future when I might need it,"" she said. There has also been some criticism of the system, as many women who work part-time do not earn the Â£10,000 a year required to qualify for these automatic pension contributions. Taneika Boyle says women working part-time are unfairly excluded That is true of Chloe's colleague, Taneika Boyle, who said that she used to be automatically enrolled until she went on maternity leave, returned part-time, and so no longer earned enough to be included to receive her employer's top-up too. ""Once you have a baby, you are put to the side,"" she said. Emma-Lou Montgomery, from Fidelity International, who wrote a report on the financial power of women, said: ""We need a system where as soon as women start earning anything they are automatically enrolled, encouraging women to save for their futures."" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""The government is committed to removing the lower earnings limit and will consult on the best approach in due course."" But Martyn Maxey, who owns the hairdressing firm, argued that it was ""too big a burden"" for small businesses to cover these increasing pension contribution costs, rather than the government. Under the scheme, a 24-year-old earning Â£30,000 a year should build up a pension pot which would buy a retirement income of about Â£11,000 a year in today's money, according to Mr Selby, of AJ Bell. This makes a number of assumptions, so the actual result could be significantly different. Individuals will have a choice of various other ways to access the money at retirement, which would affect how much they get. The final total also depends on the performance of one of a number of pension companies that hold and invest people's savings. But figures compiled for the BBC by data company Defaqto show a wide variation in that performance. Over the past five years, pension pots with Standard Life have gained an average of 4.5% a year in value, compared with those with Nest - the biggest overseer of auto-enrolment pensions - which has seen an average return of 8.9% a year over the same period. Various other changes to our finances come into force on Saturday - the first day of the 2019-20 tax year - including: A rise in the state pension by 2.6%, meaning the basic state pension for most existing claimants is Â£129.20 a week A slight rise in the amount that can be saved into Junior Individual Savings Accounts A rise in the threshold at which taxpayers start paying the higher rate of tax to Â£50,000, except in Scotland where it remains at Â£43,430 State pension calculatorDepartment for Work and Pensions,external Combined state, workplace and DC calculator, fromStandard Life,external How much can I earn from a DC pot?Money Advice Service,external Pension contribution hike to see pay fall Women face 'glaring' gender pension gap Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too Pension savers 'cash in, but lose out' Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

""This is a little bit of money that goes straight out of my wages before I even see it, that is for the future when I might need it,"" she said. There has also been some criticism of the system, as many women who work part-time do not earn the Â£10,000 a year required to qualify for these automatic pension contributions. Taneika Boyle says women working part-time are unfairly excluded That is true of Chloe's colleague, Taneika Boyle, who said that she used to be automatically enrolled until she went on maternity leave, returned part-time, and so no longer earned enough to be included to receive her employer's top-up too. ""Once you have a baby, you are put to the side,"" she said. Emma-Lou Montgomery, from Fidelity International, who wrote a report on the financial power of women, said: ""We need a system where as soon as women start earning anything they are automatically enrolled, encouraging women to save for their futures."" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""The government is committed to removing the lower earnings limit and will consult on the best approach in due course."" But Martyn Maxey, who owns the hairdressing firm, argued that it was ""too big a burden"" for small businesses to cover these increasing pension contribution costs, rather than the government. Under the scheme, a 24-year-old earning Â£30,000 a year should build up a pension pot which would buy a retirement income of about Â£11,000 a year in today's money, according to Mr Selby, of AJ Bell. This makes a number of assumptions, so the actual result could be significantly different. Individuals will have a choice of various other ways to access the money at retirement, which would affect how much they get. The final total also depends on the performance of one of a number of pension companies that hold and invest people's savings. But figures compiled for the BBC by data company Defaqto show a wide variation in that performance. Over the past five years, pension pots with Standard Life have gained an average of 4.5% a year in value, compared with those with Nest - the biggest overseer of auto-enrolment pensions - which has seen an average return of 8.9% a year over the same period. Various other changes to our finances come into force on Saturday - the first day of the 2019-20 tax year - including: A rise in the state pension by 2.6%, meaning the basic state pension for most existing claimants is Â£129.20 a week A slight rise in the amount that can be saved into Junior Individual Savings Accounts A rise in the threshold at which taxpayers start paying the higher rate of tax to Â£50,000, except in Scotland where it remains at Â£43,430 State pension calculatorDepartment for Work and Pensions,external Combined state, workplace and DC calculator, fromStandard Life,external How much can I earn from a DC pot?Money Advice Service,external Pension contribution hike to see pay fall Women face 'glaring' gender pension gap Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too Pension savers 'cash in, but lose out' Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"J Hus made a surprise appearance on stage with Drake at London's O2, four months after being jailed for carrying a knife. The rapperwas sentencedto eight months behind bars in December after he was caught with the weapon at Westfield Shopping Centre in east London. He's served less than half of that. ""We're about to celebrate one of our brothers tonight"", Drake told the crowd, before the words ""welcome home"" appeared on the stage floor. ""I've missed you so much, I swear I missed you so much,"" said J Hus as he joined Drake on stage. ""I waited for this all week so I could give you this stage so you can do exactly what you've been waiting to do,"" said Drake. The day after the performance, J Hus shared a video thanking Drake and showing parts of the show and footage of him reuniting with friends. Allow Twitter content?

J Hus - real name Momodou Jallow - was jailed on 14 December 2018 after admitting carrying a knife in a public place. Judge Sandy Canavan told the rapper that he was a ""role model to many"" but ""failed"" to leave his past behind him. ""This, in such a young life, is the fourth occasion when you have gone out armed with a knife,"" she said. After previous arrests J Hus said the reason he carried a knife was fear. Following the gig, Drake shared a photo of the pair hugging on his Instagram, saying that his 5 April show had a ""different energy"" because of J Hus's appearance and that people were ""truly all so happy"" to see him home.

"Some ""panthers"" have turned out to be domestic cats - this one was seen in east Ayrshire last year Paw prints, apparently from a big cat, have been found in a garden in Cornwall, following a report of a ""possible panther"" attacking a dog. Police were told about the incident in Harrowbarrow, Cornwall, on 29 March and called in the RSPCA. Police said a resident ""claimed that a panther had been in their garden and attacked their dog, and was later seen with another animal in its mouth"". Officers took a cast of a paw print which was ""the pad of a large cat"". A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesperson said: ""Police have received a single report of a big cat sighting in the Callington area. ""An officer attended the property and located the footprints in the garden. ""We called the RSPCA for advice and took a cast of the print which they confirmed was the pad of a large cat."" Was this the Beast of Bodmin seen in the 1990s? The police moved to reassure the public, saying: ""Over the years, there have been a number of similar reports across Devon and Cornwall. ""There is no evidence that such animals represent a danger to humans. ""It is highly likely that they would avoid human contact and only represent a danger if trapped. ""If any animal is sighted it should not be approached."" The RSPCA said: ""Our officer attended after reports that a Labrador had been scratched by a large, black cat. ""Thankfully, the dog is fine although he has scratch marks, and the owner is taking precautions to keep an eye on the dog in case of further sightings."" In the 1990s, there was aspate of big cat sightingsreported on Bodmin Moor, about 10 miles from Harrowbarrow. This caused the government to call in investigators to search for the creature which became known as the ""beast of Bodmin"". There have also been more recent reports of big cats in Cornwall and Devon.

"The Students' Union at the University of Leicester started the campaign Students inspired to share stories about harassment and sexual abuse have been warned about ""naming and shaming"" alleged rapists. The #MeToo-inspired campaign, led by those studying in Leicester, encouraged young women to share their stories. However, the names and pictures of rumoured sex abusers have been shared on Twitter by students across the country. Legal experts said identifying someone could risk any future court cases. Leicestershire Police said it was aware of the tweets and encouraged victims to contact officers. University of Leicester Students' Union started its campaign on Monday. Since then stories have emerged of harassment in clubs, drink spiking, sexual assaults and rape. Tweets naming alleged attackers in areas including Hertfordshire, Leeds, Leicester, Nottingham and Wolverhampton have been shared. Students at De Montfort University in Leicester held a vigil on Friday to raise awareness about consent The University of Leicester said it took allegations of sexual violence ""extremely seriously"" and would be working closely with the Students' Union. The University of Nottingham said it was currently investigating an allegation of sexual harassment. It added there was ""no place for violence and sexual harassment on a university campus"". A legal expert at Justice, a human rights and law reform campaign group, said ""naming and shaming"" online could be dangerous because everyone had a right to a fair trial. Legal director Jodie Blackstock, said: ""Publicly identifying someone as guilty before trial risks a court being biased, which could prevent the perpetrator being brought to justice"". Leicestershire Police said it was aware of the tweets, but had so far received no reports. Oge Obioha, a law student turned wellbeing officer, who organised the Leicester campaign, said: ""Harassment is a nationwide problem - it happens on a day-to-day basis and we need to stop normalising it.

"Forces loyal to the Tripoli government have reportedly come from Misrata to help defend the capital World powers and the United Nations have condemned fresh fighting in Libya as rebel forces from the east of the country march on the capital. The G7 group of rich countries urged all parties ""to immediately halt all military activity"". The UN Security council issued a similar call. Khalifa Haftar, leader of the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), has ordered the advance on Tripoli. The unrest comes ahead of a planned UN conference on possible new elections. Tripoli is the home of Libya's internationally recognised government, which has the backing of the UN. Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? Violence and division have riven Libya since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. The LNA's leader Haftar ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli on Thursday, as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in the city to discuss the ongoing crisis. Gen Haftar spoke to Mr Guterres in Benghazi on Friday, and reportedly told him that his operation would not stop until his troops had defeated ""terrorism"". Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to march on Tripoli On Thursday, LNA forces took the town of Gharyan 100km (62 miles) south of Tripoli. There are now reports troops have taken the capital's airport, which has been closed since 2014 - although these are disputed. Residents of Misrata east of Tripoli told Reuters news agency that militias from their city had been sent to defend the capital. Armed groups allied to the Tripoli government told the news agency on Friday that they had taken a number of LNA fighters prisoner. LNA troops seized the south of Libya and its oil fields earlier this year. In a tweet,Mr Guterres said he left Libya ""with a heavy heart and deeply concerned"",external, saying he still hoped there was a way to avoid a battle around the capital. The G7 later responded to the fighting with a statement urging an end to military operations. ""We strongly oppose any military action in Libya,"" the statement read, reiterating their support for UN-led efforts to bring elections and calling on all countries to support the ""sustainable stabilisation of Libya"". The UN Security Council held a close-door meeting late on Friday. Afterwards the German UN ambassador Christoph Heusgen said members had ""called on LNA forces to halt all military movements"". ""There can be no military solution to the conflict,"" he said. A Russian spokesman earlier told reporters the Kremlin does not support Gen Haftar's advance and said it wants a solution by ""peaceful political means"". UN envoy Ghassan Salame said on Saturday that the conference planned for 14-16 April would still be held in time, despite the escalation - ""unless compelling circumstances force us not to"". By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor Khalifa Haftar's forces have met with mixed fortunes. To the south, they appear to have got close to the outskirts of the capital, at one point claiming to have taken the airport. But to the west, they appear to have been pushed back. It's still unclear how much this is a show of force to bolster Gen Haftar's position or a genuine effort to seize Tripoli. Libya country profile He returned during the revolution and he's subsequently become the most powerful military leader in a country rife with militias, allied to a rival government in the east. Despite the chorus of international concern over his actions, he has had support from powerful outside players, including the UAE and Egypt. Efforts towards a political resolution for Libya have foundered time after time. The most recent hopes may once again have been dashed. Born in 1943, the former army officer helped Colonel Muammar Gaddafi seize power in 1969 before falling out with him and going into exile in the US. He returned in 2011 after the uprising against Gaddafi began and became a rebel commander. In December Haftar met Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj from the UN-backed government at a conference but refused to attend official talks. He visited Saudi Arabia last week, where he met King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for talks.

"This video can not be played 'My house has taken over my life' When Justin Revell bought his new-build house near Norwich, he thought it was the dream home. ""I think currently it's actually taken over my life,"" he says. He shows us around, pointing out what he calls the ""endless list"" of problems he's encountered since October 2016 when he moved in. ""You find one problem and that escalates into another problem - it's like opening a can of worms."" Justin Revell and Lyn Whiteman helped each other manage their house trouble From substandard ceilings to badly-fitted fire-doors, missing insulation and condensation issues. Both his kitchen and a bathroom have had to be ripped out and replaced. He and his wife have moved out twice while repairs were done. It has been dealing with builder Taylor Wimpey, as well as the issues themselves, that have taken its toll. ""They make it deliberately difficult to contact them, they don't respond to you, they'll tell you something is fixed when it isn't."" Mr Revell says. ""A lot of people don't have the time or the knowledge to take the builders on."" He's joined forces with his neighbour Lyn Whiteman to help manage the problem. ""It's not a coincidence that two houses two doors down from each other with identical problems,"" she says. ""This is not isolated to this particular property or this estate - it's got to be national."" Taylor Wimpey says it apologises for the issues experienced by Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman and for the inconvenience caused. But could the two be right about a broader problem? The Homeowners Alliance says they have seen an increase in the number of people approaching them for help over the last two years because of serious defects with their new-build homes. Justin Revell and his wife moved into their ""dream"" home in Peter Pulling Drive in September 2016 Research from the organisation, which represents the interests of homeowners to the house building industry, suggest that only two-thirds of new homeowners are happy with the way their builder resolved any defects with their home. And even the developers themselves acknowledge the problem. The Home Builders Federation own satisfaction surveys show a rise in the number of customers reporting snags - from 93% in 2015 to 99% in 2018. That data comes just weeks after the government said they were considering removing Persimmon from the Help To Buy scheme after increasing concerns over the quality of its building work. And there is rising alarm from consumers and experts about the severity of these so-called snags. Timothy Waitt has become a specialist on construction cases at Anthony Gold solicitors. ""I'm not talking about dodgy kitchen units - I'm talking about major structural failings that affect health and safety."" Mr Waitt is getting enquiries on a near-daily basis on these kinds problems and is fearful a skills shortage in construction means that it is just the tip of the iceberg. ""I do not think we're talking about deliberate decisions to miss out on key expensive structural elements,"" he explains. ""This is about carelessness. I think what is arising is that people are making mistakes, potentially because they do not realise the significance of what they are doing, due to a lack of training, a lack of experience and a lack of supervision."" Taylor Wimpey, Britain's third largest homebuilder, reported profits up 19% to Â£810m for 2018, after selling 15,275 homes Like Mr Waitt, the BBC has spoken to a broad spectrum of homeowners across the country and across developers, whose ""snags"" go far beyond the kind of teething problems often anticipated with new builds. From Debbie, dealing with rising damp and poor drainage in East Sussex, to Saima in Wokingham where damp and mould drove her family out of their home or Robert in north London who has endured eight years of fighting to fix floors dipping in his home. What unites them all is the severe emotional strain it's placed on them. As a result, The Home Owners Alliance is campaigning to boost the rights or protection for buyers. ""There is no incentive for a builder to build right and move on,"" explains chief executive Paula Higgins. ""So that's why we're calling for a snagging retention so people can hold back some money and the builders will get things done properly."" Issues with snags occur across developers and building businesses. In this case, Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman's homes were built by Taylor Wimpey. ""I think currently it's actually taken over my life,"" Mr Revell says Taylor Wimpey says: ""We sincerely apologise to Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman for the issues experienced with their homes and for the inconvenience caused as we undertook remedial action. ""We are committed to delivering homes of the highest quality and service and we take our responsibilities to our customers extremely seriously. ""We have taken actions to put things right for these customers and all necessary works for both residents have now been completed as agreed. These works are in line with, and in some parts exceed, building regulations."" ""All our homes are subject to strict quality checks throughout construction, examined by the NHBC at key stages and are not handed over until a full quality inspection has taken place."" As well as a developer's guarantee for the first two years, warranties are provided on new build homes. The National House-Building Council protects 80% of them from years three to ten in a property, and they say the quality of new homes continues to improve. ""While we cannot be on site at all times, these visual, spot-check inspections are designed to target critical elements of the build process and allow us to highlight potential defects to the builder,"" says the NHBC. ""As most problems that arise in the first two years will be dealt with by the builder without reference to NHBC, we do not collect data on snagging; however, one barometer would be complaints received by NHBC, and these have not increased. ""In addition, new warranty claims continue to fall, with this trend being a clear sign that the quality of new homes covered by NHBC continues to improve."" A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson says the government wants to see more good quality homes:  ""We know more needs to be done to protect consumers, and our New Homes Ombudsman will protect the rights of homebuyers and hold developers to account.""

"Bulgaria's Sunny Beach is the cheapest European resort for UK travellers, an analysis of 20 seaside haunts suggests. Prices at the Black Sea resort are a third lower than at its closest competitor, Portugal's Algarve,Post Office Travel Money said,external. The analysis took into account the cost of nine tourist staples, including lunch and evening meals, drinks, sun cream and insect repellent. Portugal's Algarve was next cheapest, followed by Marmaris in Turkey. Sorrento in Italy was the most expensive of the featured destinations, with prices three times more expensive than in Sunny Beach. Brexit and holidays: What do I need to know? UK drivers in EU told to swap licence At the Bulgarian resort, where prices have dropped 10.7% in the past year, holidaymakers could find a two-course lunch for two people for Â£8.42, pay just Â£1.17 for a glass of wine in a bar and Â£2.34 for a premium brand bottle of suncream. The Post Office said that while sterling was stronger against the euro than a year ago, competitive pricing in restaurants, bars and shops meant prices had dropped in more than two-thirds of the destinations it analysed. ""The price falls could be an indication that tourist businesses in European resorts are keen to attract UK visitors and will keep costs low to do so,"" said its head, Nick Boden. ""There are significant variations between the prices we found in resorts this year so it will really pay dividends to do some holiday homework before booking to avoid busting the budget.

"This video can not be played Thousands of homes destroyed as Iran braces for more floods Flood-hit Iran is evacuating more towns and villages, with further rain expected on Saturday. Three weeks of heavy rainfall have left much of the country submerged and cost at least 70 lives. More downpours are forecast for the south-west, with 400,000 people at risk. Dangerously full dams are being opened to ease water build-up. Women and children are being moved to safer areas while men have been asked to stay to assist with relief efforts. Iran floods see 70 villages evacuated Flash floods kill at least 19 in Iran The south-western province of Khuzestan, which borders Iraq, is the main focus. Six towns and cities along the Karkheh river needed to be evacuated as soon as possible, Khuzestan's governor Gholamreza Shariati said. He said the situation was critical and, despite the fears of renewed flooding, the Karkheh dam was being opened to release build-up. Around 70 villages in the province have been evacuated in the past week. There is no order of evacuation yet for Khuzestan's capital, Ahvaz. Khuzestan province is now seeing the worst of the flooding Iraq on Saturday closed its Sheeb border crossing to both travellers and trade until further notice. Energy companies in the oil-rich region have helped the relief effort by using pumps to remove water. Severe flooding began hitting the north-east, particularly Golestan on the Turkmenistan border, on 19 March. On 25 March, the west and south-west were struck, with more rain in the same area on 1 April. Lorestan province was the worst hit then, with cities and villages cut off. Some 12,000km (7,500 miles) of road, more than a third of the country's network, has been affected. This video can not be played There are scenes of flooding across the country Thousands of roads, bridges and buildings have been destroyed. So far, 86,000 people are living in emergency shelters, 1,000 of whom were airlifted to safety. Aid agencies are struggling to cope with the scale of the crisis and Iran's state budget is under pressure due to US sanctions on energy and banking. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the sanctions - reimposed afterPresident Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year- had impeded aid efforts and caused a shortage of rescue helicopters. ""This isn't just economic warfare, it's economic terrorism,"" Mr Zarif tweeted on 1 April. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

According to Iran's Natural Resources and Forestry Organization, widespread and unregulated deforestation has destroyed around half of Iran's northern forests, areas where major floods have occurred.

"Teachers' pay in Wales was devolved to the Welsh Government in 2018 Supply teachers in Wales are to be boosted by a government-imposed minimum daily pay rate to help prevent them getting paid just Â£85 a day with agencies ""creaming off"" profits. Campaigners say some are quitting over low pay as it emerged directors of the Welsh Government'spreferred teaching supplier got nearly Â£1m in payouts. The reform will make it law for firms to show how much is being paid to the teacher and how much to the agency. Agencies say they offer good value. More than a quarter of agency supply teachers - of which there are about 4,500 in Wales - are being paid less than Â£100 a day, according to a National Education Union (NEU) report last year. ""Teachers are being ripped off,"" AM Neil McEvoy told aWelsh Assembly petitions committee meeting,externalas he claimed some of the 60 agencies in Wales ""cream off"" as much as Â£160 per teacher, per day while ""teachers get paid on average Â£85 a day"". Â£40m spent on supply teachers in Wales Supply teachers 'quitting over low pay' 'I know teachers doing pizza delivery' A petition to the assembly, submitted by former supply teacher Sheila Jones, claimed stand-in teachers were ""exploited"" and ""leaving the profession as they cannot afford to be supply teachers"" because ""agencies reduce teachers' pay by 40-60%"". AboutÂ£40m was spent on supply teachers in Walesin 2016-17 and the education minister has revealed a controversial and ""flawed"" national agency contract is being scrapped because of ""legitimate concern"". The government is in talks with the National Procurement Service and unions to agree the contract and minimum fee which will be introduced in September. Former supply teacher Sheila Jones is now a union official Sheila Jones, who is now Wales' supply teacher representative for the National Education Union, said while agency teachers' roles offered flexibility they did not receive the same pay as colleagues employed by local authorities. ""It's unjust,"" she said. ""There should not be a difference. ""I'm concerned that there are still going to be agencies in existence that can offer a different pay rate. ""Two people doing the same job should not be getting different pay and conditions, it's as simple as that."" Analysis from BBC Wales education correspondent Bethan Lewis: Problems with the system for arranging supply teachers have been flagged up for many years, but a solution has been more elusive. Councils used to have their own lists or schools had a handful of trusted contacts to draft in to cover sickness or courses. That still happens, but agencies have now become the main players - taking care of the checks and the training so head teachers just have to make a phone call. Agencies argue it is more cost-effective, others object to private companies profiting while schools struggle financially. The minister's plans could address some concerns, particularly on pay, though it will not deliver the all-Wales register of supply teachers some have been calling for. Education Minister Kirsty Williams admitted agency costs were ""murky"" and hoped the new deal would ensure ""those working in the system are better protected"". ""I acknowledge the previous contract had flaws and led to a situation I was uncomfortable with,"" she told the petitions committee. ""I have been concerned about the lack of transparency around fees and profits that are made by these organisations."" A Â£2.7m pilot project where supply teachers were employed full-time by a group of schools has showed ""benefits"" She added that agency fees would be ""publicly available"" to help ""better practices"" so employers can ""look very carefully how public resources that are meant to educate our children are properly deployed"". New Directions has dominated supply teacher provision in Wales but the new contract, which will start in September, will be on a local authority rather than Wales-wide basis. The Cardiff-based firm said it has operated an ""open and transparent rates matrix"" with government agreement and ""schools decide what rates they are willing to pay"". ""Over the term of the framework we have saved schools in excess of Â£15m, in turn providing relevant continuing professional development opportunities to over 4,000 education workers,"" said Gary Williams, the firm's group director. ""We welcome the changes for the new framework and see them as a positive for Wales."" Teacher recruitment agencies face fees crackdown Â£2.7m supply teacher project to help schools Schools have also been told they do not have to employ teachers through agencies and could hire them directly - so avoiding fees altogether. And theWelsh Government has sponsored a Â£2.7m pilot project- involving 52 newly-qualified staff - where supply teachers are employed full-time and fill in for absent teachers across 106 schools in 15 counties. Ms Williams said early signs show there were ""better pupil outcomes and behaviour benefits"" as well as ""wider benefits for school improvement"". Unions have ""begrudgingly welcomed"" the government's reform as they want supply staff to be paid depending on experience and not ""get them on the cheap"". ""It is a step in the right direction,"" said NEU Welsh secretary David Evans. ""But we still have some way to go.""

"Donald Tusk's plan would need to be agreed by EU leaders European Council President Donald Tusk is proposing to offer the UK a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to its Brexit date, according to a senior EU source. His plan, which would need to be agreed by EU leaders at a summit next week, would allow the UK to leave sooner if Parliament ratifies a deal. The UK's Conservatives and Labour Party are set to continue Brexit talks later. Theresa May has written to Mr Tusk with the UK's request for a further delay to Brexit until 30 June. The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by MPs. Downing Street said ""technical"" talks between Labour and the Conservatives on Thursday had been ""productive"" and would continue on Friday. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has told the BBC that if they fail, the delay is ""likely to be a long one"". Cross-party Brexit talks end after 4.5 hours Germany 'stands with Ireland' over Brexit Labour chair offered to quit over referendum vote Germany: CDU leader hopes for second referendum Prime Minister Theresa May has said a further postponement to the Brexit date is needed if the UK is to avoid leaving the EU without a deal, a scenario both EU leaders and many British MPs believe would create problems for businesses and cause difficulties at ports. OnWednesday, MPs voted- by a majority of one - in favour of a backbench bill which would force Mrs May to ask the EU for a further extension. However, the PM wants to keep any delay as short as possible. To do that, she and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would need to agree a proposal for MPs to vote on before 10 April, when EU leaders are expected to consider any extension request at an emergency summit. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: ""We will be having further discussions with the government"" If they cannot, Mrs May has said a number of options would be put to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"". Mr Cox told theBBC's Political Thinking podcastthat particular scenario would involve accepting whatever postponement the EU offered, which was likely to be ""longer than just a few weeks or months"". But Conservative Brexiteer Sir Bernard Jenkin said the EU was ""toying"" with the UK and the PM was under no obligation to accept the terms of any extension, even if mandated to by MPs. ""The government just wants cover,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""They want an excuse to do what they are going to do anyway, which is to take us into some kind of extension. The British people don't want that."" But he said an extension of a year or so would be better than leaving on the terms agreed by the PM, accusing her of being ""pretty dishonest"" about her willingness to countenance a no-deal exit. Europe's leaders have been split over whether, and how, to grant any extension. However, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler has been told by a senior EU official that Mr Tusk ""believes he's come up with an answer"", after several hours of meetings in preparation for the summit. But his proposal would have to be agreed unanimously by EU leaders next week.The prime minister wrote to Mr Tusk,externalto request the extension ahead of Wednesday's meeting. You could almost hear the sound of collective eye-rolling across 27 European capitals after Theresa May requested a Brexit extension-time (till 30th June) that Brussels has already repeatedly rejected. Most EU leaders are leaning toward a longer Brexit delay to avoid being constantly approached by the PM for a rolling series of short extensions... with the threat of a no-deal Brexit always just around the corner. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, believes he has hit on a compromise solution: his ""flextension"", which would last a year with the UK able to walk away from it as soon as Parliament ratifies the Brexit deal. But EU leaders are not yet singing from the same hymn sheet on this. Expect closed-door political fireworks, although it's unclear whether it'll be a modest display or an all-out extravaganza - at their emergency Brexit summit next week. Under EU law, they have to hammer out a unanimous position. Read more from Katya Adler The EU has previously said that the UK must decide by 12 April whether it will stand candidates in May's European Parliamentary elections, or else the option of a long extension to Brexit would become impossible. Talks between Conservative ministers and Labour lasted nearly five hours on Thursday. Mr Corbyn has written to his MPs saying discussions included customs arrangements, single market alignment, internal security, the need for legal underpinning to any agreements and a ""confirmatory"" vote. The main item of business in the last frantic 24 hours has been the cross-party talks between the Conservatives and the Labour Party. From both sides, it sounds like they are serious and genuine, and negotiators got into the guts of both their positions and technical details on Thursday. Remember, behind the scenes there isn't as much difference between the two sides' versions of Brexit as the hue and cry of Parliament implies. But the political, not the policy, distance between the two is plainly enormous. Read more from Laura Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis told the BBC the party would not be talking to the government if a ""confirmatory referendum"" was not an option. But 25 Labour MPs - including a number representing Leave-voting seats - have written to Mr Corbyn, saying another referendum should not be included in any compromise Brexit deal. Asked whether another referendum on any final deal was a credible option, Mr Cox said: ""A good deal of persuasion might be needed to satisfy the government that a second referendum would be appropriate. But of course we will consider any suggestion that's made."" If the talks fail, the government faces an additional obstacle in the form of a backbench bill which would force the PM to seek a new delay. Passed by MPs by one vote on Wednesday, the bill is being scrutinised by the House of Lords, who will next consider the draft legislation on Monday. Ministers have argued it could increase ""the risk of an accidental no-deal"" in the event the EU agreed to an extension but argued for a different date than one specified by MPs. That would mean Mrs May having to bring the issue back to the Commons on 11 April, when European leaders would have returned home, the prime minister's spokesman said. After ameeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin,German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country still hoped for an ""orderly Brexit"". Angela Merkel visited Dublin for the first time in five years ""We will do everything in order to prevent... Britain crashing out of the European Union,"" she said. ""But we have to do this together with Britain and with their position that they will present to us."" Will cross-party talks work? The Brexit sticking points Did my MP vote to delay?

"This video can not be played 'My house has taken over my life' When Justin Revell bought his new-build house near Norwich, he thought it was the dream home. ""I think currently it's actually taken over my life,"" he says. He shows us around, pointing out what he calls the ""endless list"" of problems he's encountered since October 2016 when he moved in. ""You find one problem and that escalates into another problem - it's like opening a can of worms."" Justin Revell and Lyn Whiteman helped each other manage their house trouble From substandard ceilings to badly-fitted fire-doors, missing insulation and condensation issues. Both his kitchen and a bathroom have had to be ripped out and replaced. He and his wife have moved out twice while repairs were done. It has been dealing with builder Taylor Wimpey, as well as the issues themselves, that have taken its toll. ""They make it deliberately difficult to contact them, they don't respond to you, they'll tell you something is fixed when it isn't."" Mr Revell says. ""A lot of people don't have the time or the knowledge to take the builders on."" He's joined forces with his neighbour Lyn Whiteman to help manage the problem. ""It's not a coincidence that two houses two doors down from each other with identical problems,"" she says. ""This is not isolated to this particular property or this estate - it's got to be national."" Taylor Wimpey says it apologises for the issues experienced by Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman and for the inconvenience caused. But could the two be right about a broader problem? The Homeowners Alliance says they have seen an increase in the number of people approaching them for help over the last two years because of serious defects with their new-build homes. Justin Revell and his wife moved into their ""dream"" home in Peter Pulling Drive in September 2016 Research from the organisation, which represents the interests of homeowners to the house building industry, suggest that only two-thirds of new homeowners are happy with the way their builder resolved any defects with their home. And even the developers themselves acknowledge the problem. The Home Builders Federation own satisfaction surveys show a rise in the number of customers reporting snags - from 93% in 2015 to 99% in 2018. That data comes just weeks after the government said they were considering removing Persimmon from the Help To Buy scheme after increasing concerns over the quality of its building work. And there is rising alarm from consumers and experts about the severity of these so-called snags. Timothy Waitt has become a specialist on construction cases at Anthony Gold solicitors. ""I'm not talking about dodgy kitchen units - I'm talking about major structural failings that affect health and safety."" Mr Waitt is getting enquiries on a near-daily basis on these kinds problems and is fearful a skills shortage in construction means that it is just the tip of the iceberg. ""I do not think we're talking about deliberate decisions to miss out on key expensive structural elements,"" he explains. ""This is about carelessness. I think what is arising is that people are making mistakes, potentially because they do not realise the significance of what they are doing, due to a lack of training, a lack of experience and a lack of supervision."" Taylor Wimpey, Britain's third largest homebuilder, reported profits up 19% to Â£810m for 2018, after selling 15,275 homes Like Mr Waitt, the BBC has spoken to a broad spectrum of homeowners across the country and across developers, whose ""snags"" go far beyond the kind of teething problems often anticipated with new builds. From Debbie, dealing with rising damp and poor drainage in East Sussex, to Saima in Wokingham where damp and mould drove her family out of their home or Robert in north London who has endured eight years of fighting to fix floors dipping in his home. What unites them all is the severe emotional strain it's placed on them. As a result, The Home Owners Alliance is campaigning to boost the rights or protection for buyers. ""There is no incentive for a builder to build right and move on,"" explains chief executive Paula Higgins. ""So that's why we're calling for a snagging retention so people can hold back some money and the builders will get things done properly."" Issues with snags occur across developers and building businesses. In this case, Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman's homes were built by Taylor Wimpey. ""I think currently it's actually taken over my life,"" Mr Revell says Taylor Wimpey says: ""We sincerely apologise to Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman for the issues experienced with their homes and for the inconvenience caused as we undertook remedial action. ""We are committed to delivering homes of the highest quality and service and we take our responsibilities to our customers extremely seriously. ""We have taken actions to put things right for these customers and all necessary works for both residents have now been completed as agreed. These works are in line with, and in some parts exceed, building regulations."" ""All our homes are subject to strict quality checks throughout construction, examined by the NHBC at key stages and are not handed over until a full quality inspection has taken place."" As well as a developer's guarantee for the first two years, warranties are provided on new build homes. The National House-Building Council protects 80% of them from years three to ten in a property, and they say the quality of new homes continues to improve. ""While we cannot be on site at all times, these visual, spot-check inspections are designed to target critical elements of the build process and allow us to highlight potential defects to the builder,"" says the NHBC. ""As most problems that arise in the first two years will be dealt with by the builder without reference to NHBC, we do not collect data on snagging; however, one barometer would be complaints received by NHBC, and these have not increased. ""In addition, new warranty claims continue to fall, with this trend being a clear sign that the quality of new homes covered by NHBC continues to improve."" A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson says the government wants to see more good quality homes:  ""We know more needs to be done to protect consumers, and our New Homes Ombudsman will protect the rights of homebuyers and hold developers to account.""

"If there is an art to sugaring the pill, then Netflix and the production team at Silverback Films have perfected it with their 8x1-hour natural history TV series, Our Planet. The world might be going to hell in a handcart as wildlife populations plummet, rain forests are decimated, and for the first time in human history we are told the ""stability of nature can no longer be taken for granted"". But somehow it doesn't seem so awful or imminent when one of the greatest broadcasters who has ever lived is giving you the bad news. Having the warm, intelligent, measured voice of Sir David Attenborough repeatedly stating that man's reckless approach to managing Earth's delicate resources is putting it, and therefore our, very existence in grave danger, is a bit like Dr Doug Ross giving you a terminal diagnosis in ER: you don't really hear him because it's GEORGE CLOONEY. And, so it is with Our Planet. Sir David is emphatic and uncompromising in his assessment of the state of the natural world. We have ruined it, basically. Our rapaciousness aligned to industrial-scale destruction and over-population has put us on the brink of an ecological disaster from which there will be no return. ""What we do in the next 20 years will determine the future for all life on Earth"", he warns. Albatross parent feeding its chick on Bird Island, South Georgia, where numbers have declined by 40% It is a stark and important message but it never really lands in the way it is intended. It comes across more as ""Oh, and by the way"", as opposed to ""We're all doomed"". And that is because, when all is said and done, this is a classic Attenborough-narrated series full of his inherent optimism and love of the natural world in all its resilient, adaptable, magnificent glory. To be shown orangutans' habitat mercilessly eroded by the commercial exploitation of palm oil plants is awful, but soon forgotten when you watch mother teach son how to fillet a dead tree for ants. It is a narrative paradox that runs through Our Planet. However dire Sir David's warnings, they are always overshadowed by his enthusiasm to show us one more piece of amazing never-seen-before footage filmed deep inside the animal kingdom. This orangutan uses a stick tool to winkle out ants from a tree hole, and is part of a long-term study into these apes in Sumatra This is what he is best at, and when this series is at its best. The highly experienced production team who have Blue Planet and Frozen Planet among their credits, have delivered some stunning, unforgettable sequences, such as the mating ritual of a twerking Red-capped manakin bird, or, better still, those of a male western parotia. Western parotia bird of paradise; here the female looks down from her perch at the displaying male Cameraman Doug Anderson waits by a Callipterus shell pile, and starts the camera recording by pulling on a piece of string attached to the trigger in Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania From tip-toeing Flamingos to ancient worms with inbuilt glue-guns, Our Planet gives us some of the most dazzling images you are ever likely to view on TV. When necessary, they are embellished with Attenborough's commentary, which is never obtrusive and always written with brevity and wit. He doesn't do pomposity; his style is more down to planet Earth. If there is an everyday allusion needed to make the exotic images we are seeing feel more relatable, he generally has one to hand. Cormorants ""carpet bomb"" a shoal of fish, courting birds dance around each other as if on Strictly, and a bat has gone ""into business"" with a plant in a mutually beneficial enterprise. Cormorants and boobies plunge dive into shoals of anchovies in Punta San Juan, Peru An eyebrow or two was raised when Netflix announced it had signed Attenborough to narrate the series. After all, he is one of the BBC's most treasured talents with global recognition and an almost unique ability to reach audiences of all ages and types. David Attenborough with sea lions on South Georgia Island in 2005, for the BBC's The Living Planet: The Frozen World Hence the streaming giant's interest in him, of course. Frankly, by and large, you wouldn't know the difference. It is like a car manufacturer re-badging a model for another market: same product, different idents. I do wonder, though, if the experienced exec producers at BBC would have sharpened up the first episode a little. Its job is to be a scene-setter for the more editorially focused programmes that follow, but it feels slightly tentative and tends to jump about like a young Philippine eagle preparing to embark on its first flight. The Philippine eagle is one of the largest birds of prey in the world, but there are thought to be only 400 pairs remaining It is also possible there was another, perhaps more effective way, to make the very serious points about what the programme-makers think needs to be done to save our world from disaster. I know David Attenborough is not one to finger-wag, but maybe there was scope to make a single, no-holds-barred wake-up call episode with every last grain of sugar removed from the bitter pill. But these are moot points about a world-class television series made available in its entirety to the world on Friday. It has been created by masters of their craft with an exceptional narrator (though it's instructive to note that Attenborough doesn't entirely traverse all cultural borders - the Spanish version is voiced by Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek narrates for Latin America). It is the voice of a man who knows he won't be around forever but hopes passionately that Our Planet will.

"The chancellor is meeting EU finance ministers in Bucharest Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he is ""optimistic"" Brexit discussions between the government and Labour can reach ""some form of agreement"". Mr Hammond said there were ""no red lines"" in the meetings. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""waiting to see the red lines move"" and had not ""noticed any great change in the government's position"". Three days of talks ended on Friday without agreement and Labour said no more talks were planned this weekend. Downing Street responded by saying it was prepared to pursue alterations to the deal and ready to hold further discussions with Labour over the weekend. The talks have been taking place to try to find a proposal to put to MPs which could break the Brexit deadlock in the Commons before an emergency EU summit on Wednesday. Speaking ahead of an EU finance ministers' meeting in Bucharest, Mr Hammond told reporters: ""We are expecting to exchange some more text with the Labour Party today, so this is an ongoing process."" Reality Check: What's in the Brexit political declaration? Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit explained in flowcharts Mr Hammond said: ""We should complete the process in Parliament... Some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions to us. Of course, we have to be prepared to discuss them. ""Our approach to these discussions with Labour is we have no red lines. We will go into these talks with an open mind and discuss everything with them in a constructive fashion."" Jeremy Corbyn said the government's position had not changed Speaking while campaigning for next month's local elections in Plymouth, Mr Corbyn suggested votes in Parliament were now the most likely way of providing a breakthrough on Brexit, saying his key priority was ""to avoid crashing out of the EU with no deal"". Mr Corbyn told the BBC: ""We have a party position on the future relationship with Europe... and we will responsibly discharge those duties, but we are determined to make sure there is no crashing out."" The prime minister has been unable to get Parliamentary backing for the withdrawal agreement she secured with the EU in November last year, which sets out the terms of the UK's departure. Labour has said it wants fundamental changes to a document drawn up at the same time, known as the political declaration. It sets out ambitions for the future relationship between the UK and EU after Brexit - including on trade, regulations, security and fishing rights - but does not legally commit either party. Shadow home secretary Ms Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Labour had engaged in the talks ""in good faith"" and shadow Brexit minister Sir Keir Starmer had written to the government to say he wants them to continue. She said there was concern that the government has made ""no movement"" on altering the political declaration and ""that is key"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott highlighted Labour's concerns over the political declaration A Downing Street spokesman said after Friday's talks that ""serious proposals"" were made and it was ""prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says there was a sense that the government has ""only offered clarifications on what might be possible from the existing documents, rather than adjusting any of their actual proposals"". She added that both sides agreed the talks are not yet over, but there were no firm commitments for when further discussions might take place. The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by the House of Commons. Prime Minister Theresa May has written to European Council President Donald Tusk torequest an extension to the Brexit process until 30 Junebut says if MPs agree a deal, the UK should be able to leave before European parliamentary elections are held on 23 May. She says the UK would prepare to field candidates in May's European Parliament elections if MPs failed to back a deal. But education minister Nadhim Zahawi told the Today programme it would be ""a suicide note of the Conservative Party if we had to fight the European elections"". He added the elections would pose an ""existential threat"" to both the Conservatives and Labour if they ""haven't been able to deliver Brexit"". Mr Zahawi suggested that if an agreement could not be found from the talks with Labour, MPs should be asked to find a compromise on a deal through a preferential voting system. Any extension to the UK's departure would have to be unanimously approved by EU leaders. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button A senior EU source told BBC Europe editor Katya Adler thatDonald Tusk would propose a 12-month ""flexible"" extension, with the option of the UK leaving sooner once Parliament had ratified a deal. French Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin said such a delay would require the UK to put forward a proposal with ""clear and credible political backing"". ""In the absence of such a plan, we would have to acknowledge that the UK chose to leave the EU in a disorderly manner,"" she added. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE it was unlikely that a UK request for a delay would be vetoedby any EU member nations as it could cause economic hardship in the bloc and ""they wouldn't be forgiven for it"".

"Isaak Hayik, 73, is the oldest player to take part in a professional football match An Israeli footballer has entered the record books after becoming the world's oldest player to take part in a professional game at the age of 73. Isaak Hayik set the record by playing as a goalkeeper for Israeli team Ironi Or Yehuda on Friday afternoon. Despite his advanced years, Hayik said he was ""ready for another game"" after playing for the full 90 minutes. He received the Guinness World Records prize at a ceremony after the match, just days ahead of his 74th birthday. World's oldest pro football player 'King Kazu' Japanese, 51, striker gets new deal Ironi Or Yehuda play in Liga Bet South A, in the fourth tier of the Israeli league. Although his team were beaten 5-1 by Maccabi Ramat Gan, Iraqi-born Hayik is said to have made a series of impressive saves during the game. ""This is not only a source of pride for me but also to Israeli sports in general,"" Hayik told Reuters news agency. One of his sons, 36-year-old Moshe Hayik, described his father's achievement as ""unbelievable"". He joked that he ""used to get tired before he did"" when they played together.

"Bulgaria's Sunny Beach is the cheapest European resort for UK travellers, an analysis of 20 seaside haunts suggests. Prices at the Black Sea resort are a third lower than at its closest competitor, Portugal's Algarve,Post Office Travel Money said,external. The analysis took into account the cost of nine tourist staples, including lunch and evening meals, drinks, sun cream and insect repellent. Portugal's Algarve was next cheapest, followed by Marmaris in Turkey. Sorrento in Italy was the most expensive of the featured destinations, with prices three times more expensive than in Sunny Beach. Brexit and holidays: What do I need to know? UK drivers in EU told to swap licence At the Bulgarian resort, where prices have dropped 10.7% in the past year, holidaymakers could find a two-course lunch for two people for Â£8.42, pay just Â£1.17 for a glass of wine in a bar and Â£2.34 for a premium brand bottle of suncream. The Post Office said that while sterling was stronger against the euro than a year ago, competitive pricing in restaurants, bars and shops meant prices had dropped in more than two-thirds of the destinations it analysed. ""The price falls could be an indication that tourist businesses in European resorts are keen to attract UK visitors and will keep costs low to do so,"" said its head, Nick Boden. ""There are significant variations between the prices we found in resorts this year so it will really pay dividends to do some holiday homework before booking to avoid busting the budget.

"The government has not proposed any changes to the PM's Brexit deal during cross-party talks, says shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. Meetings have been taking place between Tory and Labour politicians to find a proposal to put to the Commons before an emergency EU summit next week. But Sir Keir said the government was not ""countenancing any change"" on the wording of the existing plan. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We have made serious proposals."" The government was ""prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration"", a plan for the future relationship with the EU, to ""deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides"", the spokesman said. Sir Keir said the government's approach was ""disappointing"", and it would not consider any changes to the ""actual wording"" of the political declaration. ""Compromise requires change,"" he said. ""We want the talks to continue and we've written in those terms to the government, but we do need change if we're going to compromise."" Brexit: A really simple guide EU's Tusk 'suggests flexible Brexit delay' Sturgeon: Brexit delay not long enough Brexit explained in flowcharts The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by MPs. Theresa May has written to European Council President Donald Tusk torequest an extension to 30 June. But she says if the Commons agrees a deal in time, the UK should be able to leave before European parliamentary elections on 23 May. By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent Both sides say they are serious about these talks, but there is little to show for that so far. Perhaps that's no surprise. After more than two years of negotiations with the EU and months of wrangling in parliament, the idea that the government could sit down with Labour and thrash out a deal that keeps both sides happy in a few days seems optimistic at best. There appears to be disagreement over what the talks can achieve; changes to the political declaration on the UK's future relationship with the EU, or an additional document to what has already been agreed? If a deal is done, it may or may not fly. Plenty of Tory MPs are uneasy about working with Labour and the closer ties to the EU it may lead to. Many Labour MPs want a further referendum regardless of what is agreed - something Jeremy Corbyn has been luke warm on so far. At this stage a deal looks doubtful. But this is Brexit and stranger things have happened. Prisons minister Rory Stewart told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that there were ""tensions"" but there was ""quite a lot of life"" left in the talks with Labour. ""In truth the positions of the two parties are very, very close and where there's goodwill it should be possible to get this done and get it done relatively quickly,"" he said. He insisted that ""of course we are prepared to compromise"" on the political declaration. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""The sense is that the government has only offered clarifications on what might be possible from the existing documents, rather than adjusting any of their actual proposals in the two documents."" She added that both sides agree the talks are not yet over, but there are no firm commitments for when further discussions might take place. In case no agreement has been reached by 23 May, the prime minister has said the UK would prepare to field candidates in European parliamentary elections. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler has been told by a senior EU source that European Council President Donald Tusk will propose a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to Brexit, with the option of cutting it short if the UK Parliament ratifies a deal. But French President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Friday that it was ""premature"" to consider another delay.

"The panel discussion was moved from Bolton to Dulwich ""due to ongoing Brexit votes"", the BBC said The BBC has been accused of bias after it moved live filming of Question Time from Bolton to London. The programme said Thursday's show was broadcast from Dulwich to allow politicians attending Brexit debates at Westminster to take part. Some social media users said moving filming from Bolton, where 58% voted to leave the EU, ensured a pro-EU audience in London, which voted to remain. The BBC said it was looking for a new date to return to Bolton. The weekly BBC One debate, which allows audience members to question a panel of politicians, journalists and public figures, had been due to air from Bolton's Albert Halls. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile Wigan Labour MP Lisa Nandy and Rachel Reeves, the MP for Leeds West, have written to the BBC director general Tony Hall to complain about the decision, arguing it reflects a capital-centric outlook in the corporation's output and deprived non-Londoners of a voice at a crucial moment in the Brexit debate. Ms Nandy said: ""The decision to move last night's Question Time from Bolton to London has been met with real anger in the north. Too often people in our constituencies are cut out of the national debate."" The MPs have also asked the BBC to provide a breakdown of how many episodes of Question Time are filmed at state schools and how many take place at private schools, in addition to statistics on the number of programmes broadcast from London.

The panel of guests on Thursday included Tottenham MP David Lammy and Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright, the MP for Kenilworth and Southam in Warwickshire, who were joined by journalists and an MEP. The BBC rejected suggestions moving the show was related to the way Bolton voted in the referendum. A spokesman said: ""The decision was taken at the start of the week when it was extremely unclear when and if crucial Brexit votes would be taking place. ""If there had been voting on Thursday, politicians would not have been able to get to Bolton."" What links Question Time to Robert de Niro?
