"The British-flagged Stena Impero is still being detained by Iran Iran has seized another foreign tanker in the Gulf, state media reports claim. Iranian forces seized the Iraqi ship for ""smuggling fuel for some Arab countries"" and detained seven sailors, according to the reports. Iraq's oil ministry has said it has no connection to the seized vessel and that it is working to gather information about it. The incident comes amid heightened tensions after the US tightened sanctions on Iran's oil sector. The sanctions were reimposed after Washington's unilateral withdrawal from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. If confirmed, the Iraqi tanker would be the third foreign vessel to have been seized by Iran in recent weeks. On 13 July, the Iranian coastguard detained the Panama-flagged MT Riah. The Revolutionary Guards' Sepah News site said at the time that the ship was seized during naval patrols aimed at ""discovering and confronting organised smuggling"". Iran and the crisis in the Gulf explained Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? Also last month,Iran seized the British-flagged tanker the Stena Imperoin the Strait of Hormuz, saying it had collided with a fishing vessel. Fars news agency reported that the operation to seize the ship was carried out last Wednesday near the Gulf island of Farsi. The vessel was carrying about 700,000 litres (154,000 gallons) of fuel at the time, according to a Revolutionary Guard Corps commander quoted in state media. The tanker was reported to have been taken to Bushehr Port in south-western Iran and its fuel handed over to the authorities. Iranian reports say the tanker was Iraqi but the nationalities of the seven crew have not been disclosed. In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, Iraq's oil ministry said it had no connection with the ship. ""The ministry does not export diesel to the international market,"" it said, adding that authorities were seeking more information about who the vessel belonged to. Two Iraqi port officials told Reuters news agency that initial information suggested that the ""small ship"" belonged to a private shipping company owned by an Iraqi trader. BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says that though the cargo is relatively small, the seizure will inevitably raise tensions further in the region. Tensions have been high in the Gulf since the US tightened oil sanctions against Iran. The US has blamed Iran for two separate attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June - an allegation Tehran has denied. Iran also shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in disputed circumstances. This video can not be played In a previous seizure, Iran took control of a Panama-registered vessel on 13 July UK warships have meanwhile been shadowing British oil tankersin the area since Iran threatened to seize one in response to the impounding of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar. They were, however, unable to prevent the seizure of the Stena Impero. The UK saidthe tanker impounded off Gibraltar was suspected of breaching EU sanctions against Syria. Iran denied it was heading there. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained 'Fuel-smuggling' tanker seized by Iran Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war?

"This video can not be played Smith & Wade hit centuries as England struggle on day four Men's Ashes: First Specsavers Test, Edgbaston (day four of five) Australia 284(Smith 144, Broad 5-86)& 487-7 dec(Smith 142, Wade 110) England 374(Burns 133)& 13-0 England target: 398 Scorecard Yet another Ashes century from Australia's Steve Smith, his second of the match, left England facing a huge battle to save the first Test at Edgbaston. In his first Test since returning from a ban for his part in the ball-tampering scandal, the former captain added 142 to his first-innings 144. With Matthew Wade moving into Smith's slipstream for 110 of his own, Australia took their overnight 124-3 to 487-7 and declared to set England 398 to win. Chasing such a total is out of the question, but the hosts' survival hopes were boosted by openers Rory Burns and Jason Roy coming through seven overs to close on 13-0. England will have to bat out the final day if they are to avoid losing an Edgbaston Test for the first time in 11 years. They must do so on a surface that will offer plenty of assistance to off-spinner Nathan Lyon, who opened the bowling and immediately proved a much greater threat than England's Moeen Ali. As Moeen was unable to tie up an end and the part-time spinners were expensive, pace bowlers Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes pounded away on a surface giving them little. They again did so without their leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson because of a calf injury, while Chris Woakes bowled only seven overs. TMS podcast: Smith stars again as England battle to save Test 'Smith bats like an evil spell cast upon his opponents' This video can not be played 'At last he's made a mistake' - Smith falls for 142 While it is fair to highlight the fact Smith has not faced one ball from Anderson in the match, given the context of his return and the circumstances in which he arrived at the crease in both innings, he has returned one of the all-time great Test batting displays. In the first innings he came out at 17-2, the second 27-2, only to grind England into the dirt with his concentration, judgement, maddening fidgeting and ability to seemingly place the ball wherever he pleases. Not only that, but his continuing occupation of the crease - this was his sixth ton in seven Ashes Tests - left an Edgbaston previously keen to taunt him silent. Both England's players and their supporters are sick of the sight of him and there are still four matches remaining in this series. He resumed on 46 and extended his stand with Travis Head to 130 before adding 126 with Wade. The trademark nudges to the leg side continued, but were joined by handsome drives through the covers. One miscued drive, on 51, was the closest England got to removing him before a missed throw from the deep would have seen him short of his ground on 133. At one point, wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow resorted to trying to stump him by rolling the ball at the stumps when stood back to Broad. It was a complete shock when Smith finally played a wild drive at Woakes and was caught behind. As he departed, there were some boos, but almost all of Edgbaston stood to acclaim the brilliance it had witnessed. This video can not be played 'England breakthrough, finally!' - Stokes dismisses Head Head moved from 21 to 51 without alarm, but when he played a loose slash at Stokes, Australia's lead stood at 115 and England had hope. It was snatched away by Wade, a wicketkeeper playing his first Test in almost two years as a specialist batsman after some stellar form in domestic cricket. The left-hander drove through the covers, clipped off his toes and swept to up the urgency of the Australia scoring. He overturned being given lbw off Broad on 69 - another error by umpire Joel Wilson - and completed his third Test century, his first for more than six years, with a reverse sweep off Joe Root's off-spin. Wade and captain Tim Paine, who made 34, fell in the space of nine deliveries, but by that time Australia were past 400. James Pattinson's plunder of 47 not out from 48 balls, including four sixes, was the final torment of England's dispiriting day in the field. This video can not be played 'That almost went into orbit!' Watch Moeen's moon-ball Even if it was poor judgement by England to pick Anderson barely a month after he tore his right calf, it is still true that they have been disadvantaged by his absence, a problem compounded by Woakes' lack of overs on Sunday. Given the lifeless conditions for Broad and Stokes, England desperately needed Moeen - Test cricket's leading wicket-taker in the past year - to provide a threat. Not only was he unable to do so, but he leaked runs at almost 4.5 an over and sent down only one maiden in 29. It meant Root had to use himself and leg-spinner Joe Denly, who were just as expensive. Bar a circular field for Smith at the beginning of the day, England were bereft of ideas - Wade in particular benefited from a pressure-free start as the fielders retreated. As flat as England were by the end of the Australia innings, it is to the credit of Burns and Roy that they came through some nervy moments against Lyon. The negotiation of those 42 deliveries gradually brought Edgbaston to life and, by the end, the Hollies Stand was louder than it had been at any other point of the day. Steve Smith on BBC Test Match Special:""It's extremely special. I've never scored a hundred in both innings in any form of cricket in my life. To do it my first game back, in an Ashes Test, knowing how important the first Test is, I'm pleased. ""We're in a great position now. Hopefully we can make use of that tomorrow. There's quite a bit of spin out there. You'd think a day-five wicket will wear even more."" England batting coach Graeme Thorpe on TMS:""You have to give him (Smith) a great deal of credit. He's a world-class player. ""He's got the hunger back. He hasn't lost any of his skill and desire to score runs. He's been a thorn to us in this game."" ""The pitch is taking turn. Nathan Lyon will be important - Australia will want him to bowl well. He's under pressure as well - he's probably got 200 deliveries through the day. ""We've got to play positively - you've still got to have positive intent. You have to show plenty of character and plenty of skill too."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS:""Australia have a chance of winning this Test because of one batsman who got his team into a position of huge strength. ""The pitch is going to be fine. There will be the odd bit of movement and pressure does strange things to players, but England should have enough, in terms of quality and strength, to see out 90 overs, if they play Nathan Lyon well."" Steve Smith is now level with Steve Waugh on 10 Ashes centuries. Only Don Bradman (19) and Jack Hobbs (12) have more Smith's past six Ashes innings read 239, 76, 102*, 83, 144 and 142. He is only the second player after Mike Hussey to score six consecutive Ashes fifties Smith moved up to 18th in the all-time Ashes run-scorers list after 24 Tests. No other player in this series is in the top 50 Since making his first Ashes century at The Oval in 2013, Smith averages 78.12 in 17 Tests against England England and Wales Cricket Board Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Is Potter the right fit for West Ham?

"Ambulance staff dealt with the casualty at the scene A teenager was still being questioned after a six-year-old boy was thrown five floors from the 10th floor of the Tate Modern art gallery in London. The boy, who landed on the fifth floor roof, is in a stable but critical condition following the fall on Sunday. A witness said they heard a ""loud bang"", before seeing a woman scream: ""Where's my son, where's my son?"" A 17-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of attempted murder remains in police custody. The Met Police said the six-year-old was thrown from a viewing platform. The emergency services arrived in force at Tate Modern after the boy's fall ""We treated a person at the scene and took them to hospital as a priority,"" a London Ambulance Service (LAS) spokesman said. The boy was taken to hospital by air ambulance after he fell at about 14:45 BST. A police spokesman said there was ""nothing to suggest [the suspect] is known to the victim"". The teenager had remained on the platform after the boy fell, police said. Visitors were initially locked inside the gallery at Bankside on the South Bank. Admin worker Nancy Barnfield, 47, of Rochdale, was at the 10th floor viewing gallery with a friend and their children when her friend heard a ""loud bang"". Ms Barnfield said she turned around and saw a woman screaming: ""Where's my son, where's my son?"" Members of the public quickly gathered around a man who was nearby, she said. Ms Barnfield said: ""We did not notice the mum before, we noticed her after because she was hysterical by then."" She said the person who was restrained by members of the public before the police arrived ""just stood there and was quite calm"". Olga Malchevska, who was also on the 10th floor, said she heard a scream and then headed to the exit with her child. ""Some people started panicking. We got to the packed lift. People there were saying that one boy threw another one from the balcony. We were all shocked."" A London Air Ambulance helicopter takes off from outside the Tate Modern Stuart Haggas said he saw emergency crews moving along the roof between the gallery's Turbine Hall and its recent extension. ""They were carrying a stretcher with someone on it, plus a second stretcher was waiting by the door,"" he said. BBC correspondent Jonny Dymond, who was also there, said visitors were ""funnelled towards the main Turbine Hall and the exits were all closed"". ""There were quite a lot of families with children, and security guards told us we couldn't leave,"" he said. ""There were at least two fire engines, 10 police cars and an incident control unit. Parts of the exterior of the building were taped off."" The Tate Modern opened in the disused power station on the River Thames in 2000. It was the UK's most popular tourist attraction in 2018 with 5.9 million visitors, according to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions. Were you in the area when this happened?

"Laughing gas canisters littered the beach, and balloons which can kill marine life when swallowed Brighton beach was littered with laughing gas canisters and balloons by Pride revellers, say volunteers cleaning up after the event. Up to 1,000 people have been clearing large amounts of bottles, cans, glass and disposable barbecues. But they said they had never seen so many nitrous oxide canisters in one place. By 10:00 BST more than 150 bags of rubbish had already been collected, organisers Ocean's 8 said. More than 150 bags of rubbish were collected in two hours, but there is still a lot to do Environmental activist and blogger Clare Osborn, of Clare Talks Rubbish, is one of Ocean's 8 and said: ""We sound like the fun police, but people really need to find more sustainable ways to have fun. ""Every one of these canisters comes with a balloon, and they are so incredibly dangerous and deadly to wildlife, which can mistake the bits of balloon for food."" The gas - nitrous oxide - is the second most commonly used recreational drug in England and Wales after cannabis. But the Royal College of Nursing said many people remained ignorant of the risks, which can include breathing difficulties, dangerously-increased heart rate, burns, and death. 'Don't be complacent over laughing gas risks' 'Festival balloons' litter 'appalling' Microplastics threat to ocean giants Three time slots have been created throughout the day for people to go to the beach and help collect the rubbish. Core volunteers then sort it into what can be recycled with TerraCycle, and the remaining waste which is being collected by Brighton and Hove City Council's Cityclean service. Around a quarter of a million people flock to Brighton for the Pride weekend A team of core volunteers are on site all day, helping to sort the collected waste Amy Gibson, another member of Ocean's 8 who organises regular Pier 2 Pier silent disco beach clean, said she has never seen so much rubbish on the beach. ""You couldn't even see the beach in places. ""Normally we find around 20 bags' worth of rubbish after a weekend or an event, but we've collected 10 times that amount in the first two hours of today's clean. ""It's Pride so we expected the glitter, the feather boas and the parts of people's costumes, but I can't believe how many noz canisters there are."" Volunteers collected bags full of used laughing gas canisters Legislation introduced in 2016 made it illegal to sell the gas for psychoactive purposes. But enforcing the legislation has proved difficult because nitrous oxide is used in food products like whipped cream, and medicine. Brighton Pride does not officially hold any events on the beach, but it said it recognised the impact tourism had, so it had sponsored the clean-up effort. A Pride reveller gets cleaning About a quarter of a million people visit Brighton for the city's annual Pride weekend. Kylie Minogue headlined the music event, supported by surprise guest Emeli Sande, and more than100 floats took part in the parade. The event comes during the 50th anniversary year of a riot which started in a gay bar in New York, sparked by police brutality. Allow Twitter content?

"Six days after the Christchurch mosque attack, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a ban on ""military-style"" semi-automatic rifles, prompting questions in the US. Following a series of mass shootings in the US in recent years, there has been little in the way of sweeping gun-control reforms. On the federal level, at least, the interest and attention in new legislation has led to almost no action in decades, despite numerous polls showing widespread public support for measures like strengthened background checks and banning certain types of high-capacity gun magazines and military-style assault rifles. The Trump administration has issued a regulatory ban on bump-stock modifications that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns, and there have been some tweaks to the background check database for gun-store purchases. Last March, Donald Trump entertained the notion of more ambitious, ""comprehensive"" legislation, telling senators pro-gun lobbyists had little power over him. But there's been no such talk from the president since. Part of the reason New Zealand is ability to move quickly, of course, is that it's a parliamentary democracy, ensuring that the government is controlled entirely by one party or a politically compatible coalition. That's not the only explanation for why the US has charted a different course, however. Here are five big obstacles that stand in the way of the kind of the US taking the kind of quick, major changes to firearm policy being advanced in New Zealand. A woman shows off a model gun and holster at an NRA fashion show The National Rifle Association is one of the most influential interest groups in US politics - not just because of the money it spends on lobbying politicians, but also because of the engagement of its five million members. It opposes most proposals to strengthen firearm regulations and is behind efforts at both the federal and state levels to roll back many existing restrictions on gun ownership. In 2016 theNRA spent,external$4m on lobbying and direct contributions to politicians as well as more than $50m on political advocacy, including an estimated $30m to help elect Donald Trump president. Its overall annual budget is roughly $250m, allocated to educational programmes, gun facilities, membership events, sponsorships, legal advocacy and related efforts. This video can not be played A guide to the weapons available in the US and the rate at which they fire More than just the numbers, however, the NRA has developed a reputation in Washington as a political force that can make or break even the strongest politicians. It grades politicians on their votes and directs its resources and those of its membership - both financial and organisational - to supporting its fiercest advocates and defeating staunch opponents. As one former Republican congressmantold the New York Times,externalin 2013: ""That was the one group where I said, 'As long as I'm in office, I'm not bucking the NRA.'"" Last March the president said he wasn't ""afraid"" of the NRA - but that was a rhetorical flourish that has not resurfaced. Could it change?Gun-control groups, backed by wealthy benefactors like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have become more organised in recent years, attempting to match the NRA's political might. They actually outspent the NRA in the 2018 mid-terms, during which some prominent pro-gun-control Democrats won close elections. The NRA's revenues dropped $56m in 2017, driven largely by a decline in membership dues. It still brought in $378.1m that year, however, ensuring that it will be the biggest single player in the firearm debate. Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more? Las Vegas shootings: Is the gunman a terrorist? Obama: Guns laws were the biggest frustration of my presidency For the first time in eight years, Democrats have control of the House of Representatives - and their success in the 2018 mid-term congressional elections was fuelled largely by victories in suburban swing districts. In Atlanta, for instance, a gun-control activist won one of the closest races of the election, unseating an incumbent Republican. This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Despite these advances for the party, the House electoral playing field is still tilted toward Republicans, who tend to be for gun rights. Due to the way the lines of House congressional districts are drawn, many by Republican-controlled state legislatures, there are more seats that tilt to the right than the left. While 2018 was a Democratic wave election, political gravity may eventually reassert itself, giving control of the chamber back to conservatives. Demographics also play a part in the pro-gun sentiment in the House, as there are more rural districts with higher levels of gun ownership than there are urban ones. Racking up big pro-gun-control majorities in urban areas does little to change the political realities in the House. House members sit on the floor ""to demand action on common sense gun legislation"" For the moment, however, the initiative is with Democrats, and 2019 marked a significant step forward for gun-control proponents in Congress. One of their first actions was to pass a bill in the House requiring comprehensive background checks of private gun sales, including those that take place at gun shows. Previously the requirement to run the name of gun purchasers in a federal database was limited only to registered gun dealers. Prior to 2019, attempts to pass new federal laws regulating firearms had been over before they ever really begin, stymied by House Republicans. In June 2016 a group of Democratic politicians staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to protest over the Republican House leadership's decision not to hold a vote on two gun-control bills. Could it change?The House of Representatives was once one of the biggest obstacles to federal gun-control legislation. It no longer is - for now. With every House seat up for election every two years, and an American electorate that has proven fickle, the door could slam shut again with little advanced notice. Now that gun-control bills have hopes in the House of Representatives, the Senate - where the rural-urban divide plays itself out on the state level - becomes the biggest obstacle to legislative success. States dominated by big-city voters, such as New York, Massachusetts or California, are outnumbered by rural and Southern states with pro-gun sentiments. The rules of the Senate can also thwart efforts to enact more stringent firearm regulation, thanks to the ""filibuster"" - a procedural hurdle that means most major pieces of legislation need the backing of 60 out of 100 senators to pass, rather than a simple 51-vote majority. In 2013, following the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting, it appeared that efforts to strengthen gun-purchase background checks had significant bipartisan support in the Senate. After a concerted lobbying effort by the NRA, however, the bill received only 56 votes in favour, four short of the mark necessary to break the filibuster. This video can not be played Barack Obamaâs mass shooting speeches No gun-control measure has come close to passage since then. At least for the moment, there appears little chance the Senate will take up the House-passed universal background check bill, despite indications that a majority of senators would vote in favour of it. Could it change?Mr Trump has been a vocal proponent of doing away with the Senate filibuster, as he views it as an obstacle to enacting his legislative agenda. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls have made similar calls. A majority of senators are on the record against changing the rules, however. Protesters in front of the Supreme Court in 2008 With Congress deadlocked on new gun legislation, left-leaning US states have taken a greater role in implementing gun-control measures. After the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, 21 states passed new gun laws, including imposing assault weapons bans in Connecticut, Maryland and New York. Some of the laws have run up against another barrier, however - the US judicial system. In recent years the Supreme Court has twice ruled that the right to own personal weapons such as handguns is enshrined in the constitution. This video can not be played How countries around the world introduced restrictions following mass shootings The Second Amendment says that ""a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed"". Gun-control activists point to the introductory clause as evidence that the amendment was meant primarily to create a ""well regulated"" militia. In 2008, however, a sharply divided court held that the Second Amendment provides a broad right to firearm ownership that prohibits stringent registration requirement for personal weapons. Since then, lower courts have considered challenges to state-imposed assault weapon bans, registration requirements and open-carry prohibitions. Could it change?Trump-appointed Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have a record of viewing Second Amendment rights broadly. The president is filling out the ranks of the lower courts with pro-gun-rights judges. If anything, the judiciary is moving to the right on this issue. In the autumn, the Supreme Court will consider a challenge to a New York City law restricting how handgun owners can transport their firearms. Gun-control advocates fear the high court is poised to strike another blow against state and local regulations. How Trump turned against gun control What gunfire tells us about weapons used in Las Vegas Perhaps the single biggest obstacle to new gun-control laws at the national level is that opponents tend to hold fiercely to their beliefs, while support for new regulation tends to ebb and flow around each new instance of violence. The NRA's strategy, and that of pro-gun politicians, is to wait out the storm - to delay legislative efforts until attention turns elsewhere and the outcry fades. Pro-gun politicians offer their thoughts and prayers, observe moments of silence and order flags flown half-staff. Then, in the quiet, legislative efforts are deferred and ultimately derailed. The mass student-led protests following the Parkland school shooting focused white-hot attention on the issue for a time, but the marches have died down and the changes to gun laws, at least on the federal level, have been minimal. Shortly after the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters ""there's a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country"". Mr Trump  said ""we will be talking about gun laws as time goes by"". As time goes by. As that song from the film Casablanca says, it's still the same old story. Could it change?According to one poll during the 2016 presidential campaign, guns were an important issue for both Democrats and Republicans. That could be a reflection of that year's mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub or the first indication of a new trend.

Police in Dayton at the scene From the BBC's Lauren Turner in El Paso: Texas
senator John Cornyn visited the site at the back of the Walmart that has come
to serve as a makeshift memorial on Sunday lunchtime. He
said: âTo see somebody try to come from another place to try to start a war
between our cultures is simply unacceptable. âWeâre
not going to let him get away with it.â He described El Paso as âa peaceful, wonderful example of our Texan cultureâ and said that it was âheartbreakingâ that someone would want to divide the communities in this way. Mr Cornyn added that the death penalty would be âappropriateâ in this case. Texas Senator John Cornyn visits the scene of the attack in El Paso It's one of the most divisive issues in American society, once again brought to the fore because of a deadly mass shooting. So what is the basis for the right to bear arms? And what key events have helped shape the debate? Read the full piece Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's become a familiar refrain after every mass shooting in the US. Will this time be different? Among gun control activists, there is a certain amount of resignation whenever a new incident splashes across the headlines. If public sentiment did not force action after the 2012 Newtown shooting, when 26 people - including 20 young children - were killed in a Connecticut school, then nothing will ever change. If the double tragedy of El Paso and Dayton ends up being different, however, here are a few possible explanations.  Having said all that, there are plenty of reasons why the usual political obstacles might mean this tragedy follows the familiar pattern. Read Anthony's full blog  Mexico will take legal action to protect its citizens in the
United States, the countryâs foreign minister has said. In a video statement, Marcelo Ebrard condemned the El Paso
shooting as an âact of barbarityâ. The shooting, in which three Mexicans were among 20 killed,
is being treated as a âdomestic terrorism caseâ, investigators said. Mr Edrard said the Mexican government will take âforceful
legal actionsâ to keep its citizens safe in the US, without explaining specifics. The first legal actions, he said, would be announced on
Sunday afternoon. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

by investigators. Earlier today, El Paso's district attorney said the suspect,
21-year-old Patrick Crusius, has been charged with capital murder. Prosecutors said they are considering bringing hate crime,
firearm and domestic terrorism charges against him. Mr Crusius, of Allen, Texas, could face the death penalty for
his alleged crimes. A mugshot of El Paso shooting suspect Patrick Crusius From the BBC's Lauren Turner in El Paso:  âYesterday
I was in shock. Today, my heart is hurting.â Gilda
Baeza Ortega is looking out at the Walmart in disbelief from across the car
park. âThere
are 19 bodies still in there,â she says, barely comprehending the fact. âI feel
like Iâm connected to those people, and their families.â She
had been on the way to the store yesterday morning then decided to go for
breakfast with her parents instead. But
itâs not just that that makes her feel so close to whatâs happened. âItâs
the fact he was targeting us. Iâm a Mexican American and very proud of that. To
me that is the biggest wound,â she says. People
have been coming here all day to lay flowers, a cross, even a Rubikâs cube, in
tribute. Some people are also asking police when they can retrieve their cars from Walmartâs car park, where vehicles with Mexican number plates sit alongside those with American plates. One officer told me it could be eight hours from now. Itâs a popular place for people to come shopping from Mexico and it means many now canât make the return journey, their passports being locked in their vehicles. Willa Melendez says with El Paso being so close to the Mexican border, âit doesnât feel like weâre two countries - we go back and forthâ. She adds âweâre a city of diversity - so this hurtsâ. Everyone talks of what a friendly place it is, how everyone knows each other. A taxi driver talks of the âsix degrees of separationâ here. She's dreading the list of names coming out, worried she knows one of the victims. Everyone talks of how safe El Paso is too. They canât quite believe that this has been visited on them - on what should have been just another ordinary Saturday morning at the supermarket. Allow Twitter content?

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Back in 2012, the National Rifle Association was near the
height of its power and influence in US politics. Through decades of
campaigning, the group - which represents millions of gun owners as well as gun
manufacturers - had turned gun rights for many Americans into a
red-white-and-blue bedecked symbol of God and country. Many Democrats viewed firearm regulation as ballot-box
poison, blaming the issue for, among other defeats, Al Goreâs narrow
presidential loss in 2000. A candidate with a negative rating from the NRA
practically ensured a well-funded opponent and grass-roots opposition in many
parts of the US. Recently, however, the NRA has fallen on hard times. The
organisationâs revenue dropped by $56m in 2017, due to lower membership dues
and contributions. Itâs been beset by an internal power struggle that has spilled
into the civil courts and targeted by criminal corruption probes in New York
and Washington, DC. Even the NRAâs sheen of electoral invulnerability has begun
to dull. In the 2018 mid-term elections it was outspent by gun-control groups
aided by contributions from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Several
prominent gun-control advocates, such as Lucy McBath in Georgia, won in
battleground districts. This is not the same NRA that was able to aggressively push
back against background-check legislation even in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. It still has plenty of political muscle, of course, but cracks in the
foundation are visible. Jordan Anchondo A young mother-of-three was killed in yesterdayâs mass shooting in
Texas while apparently shielding her baby son, her sister has said. Jordan Anchondo, 24, was one of the 20 people who were shot
dead at a Walmart in El Paso. Her sister Leta Jamrowski, 19, said Ms Anchondo was shopping
for back-to-school supplies when the gunman, named as Patrick Crusius, opened
fire. As the shooting rampage unfolded, she fell on her
two-month-old son in an apparent attempt to save his life, Ms Jamrowski said. She told the Associated Press that her sister appears to
have given âher lifeâ for her son, who survived the shooting with broken bones. Ms Anchondo's son was receiving treatment at the University Medical Center of El Paso. In a detailed analysis on bellingcat.com,external, Robert Evans, a journalist who studies radicalism on the internet, notes that the original 8chan thread was 
deleted almost immediately by site moderators. But he says he found comments celebrating the high body count and comparing it to the attacks on two mosques in New Zealand. He concludes: The El Paso shooterâs manifesto and 
8chan post show his radicalization and turn towards white supremacism, 
the Christchurch shooterâs manifesto, and the video of his massacre, 
likely acting as major influences in his eventual attack. The most 
important takeaways from the El Paso shooting are twofold:  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

tragic shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, and we share in the pain
and suffering of all those who were injured in these two senseless attacks. We condemn these hateful and cowardly acts. Through our grief,

On Saturday, people wereallowed briefly into their homes to collect pets and essentials, but were warned they would be doing so at their own risk. One resident per household was escorted by police back into their homes for 15 minutes. Police said officers had been forced to find some people who had gone back to their homes Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said the risk during those trips ""was extraordinarily high"" and they had caused problems. ""The vast majority of those who have been allowed back in to Whaley Bridge have been fantastic,"" she said. ""However, there have been a very small minority of people who have returned to their homes and have not presented back at the road block at which they entered. ""These people are putting the lives of officers at risk as further checks have to now be completed to ensure those residents are out of the area safely."" Twenty-four large pumps are now lowering the water level by 10 cm an hour Some 1,500 people in Whaley Bridge had sought shelter elsewhere after part of the reservoir's spillway broke away on Thursday. Father Jamie Mcleod, who lives in the town, said he had hardly slept for three days, taking supplies to the emergency workers. He was here at the start of the crisis when he went to check the dam after days of heavy rain. ""When I was over there it started to crack,"" he said. ""When it got worse I went over to the council and raised the alarm and said, 'We have to evacuate the village'. ""We then went back to the reservoir and, of course, the police then came and procedures were put in place. ""At the time I really thought the village was going to go. ""Then it really struck me there is a school at the bottom of the dam and last week that playground was full."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Emergency responders are planning and preparing for a ""potential incident"" but were not yet evacuating that area. How safe are Britain's dams? Grab-and-go for danger zone residents Whaley Bridge dam emergency in pictures Earlier on Sunday, Derbyshire Deputy Chief Fire Officer Gavin Tomlinson said teams at Whaley Bridge had made good progress. ""We now know we have taken around 35% of the contents of reservoir out now and we are aiming to get it down about 25% where we think it is at a safe level,"" he said. The reservoir has sloping sides and as the water level drops the pumps have to be moved closer to the water's edge, he said. An RAF Chinook helicopter has placed 525 one-tonne bags to strengthen the dam wall and regulate water flow. Daniel Greenhalgh, from the Canal and River Trust, which owns the reservoir and dam, warned: ""We are not out of the woods yet. ""The last estimate was that residents could be out of their homes for seven days yet."" Emergency services and volunteers have been working around the clock Police, the Environment Agency, and the Canal and River Trust have all said there is a ""real risk"" the 188-year-old dam could collapse and flood the town. The trust has defended the maintenance and safety of the structure, which was built in 1831. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played 'A short timeline of violence' Nine people have been killed and at least 27 injured in a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio - the second in the US in 24 hours. Police confirmed they killed the gunman at the scene within a minute of him opening fire. The shooting began at 01:07 local time (05:07 GMT) in the Oregon district of the city centre. The local mayor said the gunman wore body armour and came carrying extra ammunition. The suspect used a .223-calibre assault rifle with high-capacity magazines. Nan Whaley told reporters she was ""amazed"" by the quick response of the officers which she said prevented further deaths, but also stressed it would be a ""very, very difficult time"" for families of victims. ""As a mayor, this is a day that we all dread happening,"" she said. ""What's very sad is I've got messages from mayors across the country - it's sad that we've all gone through it."" The incident came only hours after a mass shooting in El Paso, Texaswhich left at least 20 people dead. The Gun Violence Archive, which categorises mass shootings as four or more people shot or killed, says there have been 251 so far this year. Footage posted on social media showed people running as dozens of gunshots echoed through the streets. It is thought the shooting took place outside Ned Peppers Bar on E 5th Street. The bar later posted on social media its staff were safe. Police said all the fatalities happened outside in the street. This video can not be played Dayton shooting witness: ""As you came outside, you saw the bodies"" Jae Williams told the BBC he was at a nearby rap performance when they were told to evacuate. ""I was very shocked,"" he said. ""We all evacuated quickly and safely. We were told to avoid the Oregon district."" ""I got to my car, I could see cops, multiple ambulances."" Another eyewitness told Reuters they had been in a nearby nightclub, Newcom's, when the shooting happened. ""The screams, the cruisers, the chaos... the security guards and themselves were running around and telling people to get out and just how everybody was acting, you knew something was wrong,"" she said. ""And then when you came outside, as soon as you hit the front street, you've seen the bodies, you knew this was different. You knew it was something that you never thought of experiencing, never experienced, wouldn't want anyone to experience."" Assistant Police Chief Matt Carper told reporters that officers managed to take down the gunman. ""Our people are very well trained for a situation like this,"" he said, adding it was ""very fortunate that the officers were in close proximity"". Nearby hospitals had received 27 people and discharged 15 by 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT). Law enforcement sources told CBS News the gunman was 24-year-old Connor Betts from Bellbrook, Ohio. Police were searching his house on Sunday, the news network said. Connor Betts Officially, however, few details have been released and there is no indication yet of any motive. Police said they had identified the attacker, but declined to identify him at a news conference. Mayor Whaley said he was wearing body armour and was carrying extra magazines for his weapon. ""We don't know the thoughts of the shooter,"" she said. Officer Carper, who stood beside Mayor Whaley, said it was ""very early in the investigative stages"" and could not confirm there was only one gunman involved, but said so far that looked likely. FBI agents are also assisting police with the investigation. At a series of news conferences, Mayor Whaley asked people to think of those people ""who went downtown on a Saturday night and thought they'd be safe"". She said that the Oregon district was ""one of the safest places in the whole region"". ""Frankly, we're at a situation now in our country that these are so random,"" she said. She also said the city had gone through a ""a really tough year"", drawing a comparison to a series of 14 tornadoes that hit Dayton in March. ""What really goes through my mind is one seems completely preventable,"" she said. ""I just question when is enough, enough."" She earlier tweeted that she was ""heartbroken"" after the shooting, and thanked first responders. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The Royal Hospital for Sick Children was scheduled to open in July The new Â£150m hospital for children in Edinburgh may have to be ""ripped down"" amid safety concerns, a senior trade union official has warned. Tom Waterson said drainage at the building is a more pressing matter than the ventilation issues which saw thepostponementof its official opening. He also claimed NHS Lothian had paid millions of pounds in a settlement to help resolve some of the problems. The health board said reviews into the delay are already under way. As well as focusing on ventilation they will also look at drainage and water systems as a priority. The development comes afterBBC Scotland revealedNHS Lothian is paying millions of pounds to a private consortium for a hospital it cannot use. The new hospital has faced a number of delays Mr Waterson said: ""I've been speaking to senior staff within NHS Lothian over the last two or three weeks and more and more have been coming to speak to me. ""They are telling us that they have concerns primarily over drainage at the site. People are unable to confirm whether the drainage that has been put in, is in fact fit for purpose. ""We need to find out what's happening before everyone moves in.  We can't wait to find out later on and just keep our fingers crossed."" Mr Waterson said the problems date back 18 to 36 months when senior staff were ""alerted to shortcomings in the drainage"". But despite that the contractors continued to press ahead with construction. He added: ""There is a school of thought that they might have to rip it down. ""How do you fix drainage in a building when it's ""x"" number of feet beneath the building?  I'm not an engineer, but it's not going to be easy. ""I'm extremely worried."" The father-of-two said he is also speaking as a parent. The minister said she is ""accountable"" for what happens in the health service He added: ""My daughter had to use the Sick Kids last year and the service was excellent. ""My concern is that we can't use the new building until we know that it's 100% safe. ""The Scottish government had three people on the project board from day one. They would have been fully aware of this issue 36 months ago."" The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People, which will have over 200 beds, was supposed to open in July, but health secretary Jeane Freeman overruled NHS Lothian after last-minute inspections found safety concerns over its ventilation system. The project has been marred by disputes between the local NHS board and IHSL Lothian, the consortium responsible for building the hospital. Although the investigation is expected to be finished this year, no date has been offered by the Government or NHS Lothian for when the hospital will open. Mr Waterson, who is the chair of Unison's Scottish health committee, represents 12,500 members in NHS Lothian, including staff who were expected to switch from the existing facility in Edinburgh. The new hospital will provide care for children and young people A Scottish government spokeswomantold The Herald:,external""The health secretary has made clear that her greatest responsibility is the safety of patients, and for this reason decided to delay the move of patients, staff and services to the new hospital. ""Patients and carers have been contacted directly to confirm appointment arrangements and a dedicated helpline remains in place. ""She recognises that many staff share her frustration following the announcement of the delay."" The spokeswoman confirmed Ms Freeman will meet again with NHS Lothian staff representatives in the coming weeks. Prof Alex McMahon, nurse director at NHS Lothian, said: ""There are a number of independent reviews and investigations underway to verify and provide assurance that all aspects of the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People, the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services meet the appropriate standards before it becomes operational. ""The decision to delay the move followed the identification of a problem with ventilation in critical care. Given the pause in occupation, the commissioned reviews will focus on ventilation and will also look at drainage and water systems as a priority. ""An Oversight Board, made up of Scottish government, NHS Lothian, National Services Scotland and Scottish Futures Trust, has been established in order to provide co-ordinated advice on the readiness of the hospital to open and on the migration of services to the new facility. ""The reviews and subsequent reports will be provided to the cabinet secretary for health and NHS Lothian.""

"Laughing gas canisters littered the beach, and balloons which can kill marine life when swallowed Brighton beach was littered with laughing gas canisters and balloons by Pride revellers, say volunteers cleaning up after the event. Up to 1,000 people have been clearing large amounts of bottles, cans, glass and disposable barbecues. But they said they had never seen so many nitrous oxide canisters in one place. By 10:00 BST more than 150 bags of rubbish had already been collected, organisers Ocean's 8 said. More than 150 bags of rubbish were collected in two hours, but there is still a lot to do Environmental activist and blogger Clare Osborn, of Clare Talks Rubbish, is one of Ocean's 8 and said: ""We sound like the fun police, but people really need to find more sustainable ways to have fun. ""Every one of these canisters comes with a balloon, and they are so incredibly dangerous and deadly to wildlife, which can mistake the bits of balloon for food."" The gas - nitrous oxide - is the second most commonly used recreational drug in England and Wales after cannabis. But the Royal College of Nursing said many people remained ignorant of the risks, which can include breathing difficulties, dangerously-increased heart rate, burns, and death. 'Don't be complacent over laughing gas risks' 'Festival balloons' litter 'appalling' Microplastics threat to ocean giants Three time slots have been created throughout the day for people to go to the beach and help collect the rubbish. Core volunteers then sort it into what can be recycled with TerraCycle, and the remaining waste which is being collected by Brighton and Hove City Council's Cityclean service. Around a quarter of a million people flock to Brighton for the Pride weekend A team of core volunteers are on site all day, helping to sort the collected waste Amy Gibson, another member of Ocean's 8 who organises regular Pier 2 Pier silent disco beach clean, said she has never seen so much rubbish on the beach. ""You couldn't even see the beach in places. ""Normally we find around 20 bags' worth of rubbish after a weekend or an event, but we've collected 10 times that amount in the first two hours of today's clean. ""It's Pride so we expected the glitter, the feather boas and the parts of people's costumes, but I can't believe how many noz canisters there are."" Volunteers collected bags full of used laughing gas canisters Legislation introduced in 2016 made it illegal to sell the gas for psychoactive purposes. But enforcing the legislation has proved difficult because nitrous oxide is used in food products like whipped cream, and medicine. Brighton Pride does not officially hold any events on the beach, but it said it recognised the impact tourism had, so it had sponsored the clean-up effort. A Pride reveller gets cleaning About a quarter of a million people visit Brighton for the city's annual Pride weekend. Kylie Minogue headlined the music event, supported by surprise guest Emeli Sande, and more than100 floats took part in the parade. The event comes during the 50th anniversary year of a riot which started in a gay bar in New York, sparked by police brutality. Allow Twitter content?

On Saturday, people wereallowed briefly into their homes to collect pets and essentials, but were warned they would be doing so at their own risk. One resident per household was escorted by police back into their homes for 15 minutes. Police said officers had been forced to find some people who had gone back to their homes Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said the risk during those trips ""was extraordinarily high"" and they had caused problems. ""The vast majority of those who have been allowed back in to Whaley Bridge have been fantastic,"" she said. ""However, there have been a very small minority of people who have returned to their homes and have not presented back at the road block at which they entered. ""These people are putting the lives of officers at risk as further checks have to now be completed to ensure those residents are out of the area safely."" Twenty-four large pumps are now lowering the water level by 10 cm an hour Some 1,500 people in Whaley Bridge had sought shelter elsewhere after part of the reservoir's spillway broke away on Thursday. Father Jamie Mcleod, who lives in the town, said he had hardly slept for three days, taking supplies to the emergency workers. He was here at the start of the crisis when he went to check the dam after days of heavy rain. ""When I was over there it started to crack,"" he said. ""When it got worse I went over to the council and raised the alarm and said, 'We have to evacuate the village'. ""We then went back to the reservoir and, of course, the police then came and procedures were put in place. ""At the time I really thought the village was going to go. ""Then it really struck me there is a school at the bottom of the dam and last week that playground was full."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Grab-and-go for danger zone residents Whaley Bridge dam emergency in pictures Earlier on Sunday, Derbyshire Deputy Chief Fire Officer Gavin Tomlinson said teams at Whaley Bridge had made good progress. ""We now know we have taken around 35% of the contents of reservoir out now and we are aiming to get it down about 25% where we think it is at a safe level,"" he said. The reservoir has sloping sides and as the water level drops the pumps have to be moved closer to the water's edge, he said. An RAF Chinook helicopter has placed 525 one-tonne bags to strengthen the dam wall and regulate water flow. Daniel Greenhalgh, from the Canal and River Trust, which owns the reservoir and dam, warned: ""We are not out of the woods yet. ""The last estimate was that residents could be out of their homes for seven days yet."" Emergency services and volunteers have been working around the clock Police, the Environment Agency, and the Canal and River Trust have all said there is a ""real risk"" the 188-year-old dam could collapse and flood the town. The trust has defended the maintenance and safety of the structure, which was built in 1831. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a one-off cash boost of Â£1.8bn for NHS hospitals in England. Of this, almost Â£1bn will be available immediately to go towards new equipment and upgrades to 20 hospitals. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Johnson said he was ""determined to deliver"" the promises of the Brexit referendum campaign and increase NHS spending. But Labour said it fell ""significantly short"" of the amount needed by the NHS and would not reverse years of cuts. The money is coming from the Treasury and is not a re-allocation of funds from the Department of Health. It is on top of an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023 announced by former prime minister Theresa May last year. Around Â£850m - spread over five years - will go towards funding the 20 hospital upgrades that Mr Johnson promised in his first speech as PM outside Downing Street. The remaining money is expected to help clear a backlog of existing upgrade work and infrastructure projects. He will formally announce the funding on Monday, when he is expected to identify the hospitals which will get money to upgrade wards and repair buildings. Theresa May unveils Â£20bn boost for NHS Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? But the health think tank the Nuffield Trust said the latest funding, which is less than 1% of NHS England's annual budget, would ""only be a fraction of what it would cost to really upgrade 20 hospitals"". Nigel Edwards, the Nuffield Trust's chief executive, added that it it was a ""down payment on the staggering Â£6bn needed to clear the backlog"" of NHS maintenance. However, he said it was encouraging to see money put towards capital funding - used for equipment and repairs - ""which will help stop hospitals deteriorating even further"". In October, NHS Digital figures showed thatNHS trusts had a backlog of around Â£6bn,externalof repairs or replacements that needed carrying out. The NHS in England can hardly do anything other than welcome new money from the Treasury to invest in hospital buildings and launch new construction projects. But the Â£1bn this year to clear the backlog should be set against a total of Â£6bn which hospital leaders and think tanks believe is the total of work outstanding, including repairs and refurbishment of dilapidated facilities. On top of that is Â£850m for 20 hospitals to carry out major upgrades, but spread over five years. The latest announcement covers capital spending as opposed to day-to-day running costs. After raids on these capital budgets to prop up NHS frontline services in recent years, health service staff will feel there is some way to go to make up the lost ground - and only a small step forward has been taken.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson praised the ""astonishing achievements"" of the NHS, but highlighted the staffing pressures, along with the delays and cancellations facing patients. ""Which is why I am so determined to deliver now on the promises of that 2016 referendum campaign: not just to honour the will of the people, but to increase the cash available for this amazing national institution,"" he said. In the run-up to the Brexit referendum, a campaign bus used by Vote Leave claimed the UK sent Â£350m a week to the European Union and suggested the money could instead be spent on the NHS. However,analysis by the BBC found that claim to be misleading. In his column on Sunday, Mr Johnson wrote: ""It is thanks to this country's strong economic performance that we are now able to announce Â£1.8bn more for the NHS to buy vital new kit and confirm new upgrades for 20 hospitals across the country."" He said the government was also starting work on plans to ""tackle the injustice"" of social care - a problem ""that has been shirked for decades"". The PM added that Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chancellor Sajid Javid had already met the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, as they wanted to ensure the cash ""gets through to the right places"". Writing in the Sun on Sunday,external, Mr Hancock said the money would boost hospitals across the country - from Cornwall to Newcastle - by providing new intensive care wards, children's units and mental health facilities. Saying that the upgrades ""are just the start"", he added that the government wanted to take a more ""strategic"" approach to capital spending, and move away from ""piecemeal and uncoordinated"" decisions. There are also expected to be extra funding settlements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as part ofthe Barnett formula- which is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive when funding is increased in areas such as health and education in England. AroundÂ£115bn was spent on the NHS England budget,externallast year. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The best and the rest - what we've learned from the NHS Tracker GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years Responding to the funding announcement, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the Â£1.8bn pledged fell ""significantly short of what's needed to provide quality, safe care to patients after years of Tory cuts"". He added: ""Tory ministers have repeatedly cut capital investment budgets in recent years. These smash-and-grab raids have meant over Â£4bn slashed and seen the NHS repair bill spiral to Â£6bn, putting patient safety seriously at risk."" He told Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme the investment promised by Mr Johnson might not actually take place, claiming only Â£100m of Â£2.5bn of health spending announcements over the past two years had been delivered. Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Baroness Jolly said Mr Johnson's pledge would ""not be worth the paper it's written on"" if and when a no-deal Brexit took place. Cancer Research UK said the investment would go ""some way to address the immense strain"" the NHS is under but said the staffing shortage should take priority. Policy director Emma Greenwood added: ""Upgrades to hospitals are welcome but the NHS is experiencing a staffing crisis. And it's impossible to diagnose more cancers at an early stage without the right staff."" Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn?

"Laughing gas canisters littered the beach, and balloons which can kill marine life when swallowed Brighton beach was littered with laughing gas canisters and balloons by Pride revellers, say volunteers cleaning up after the event. Up to 1,000 people have been clearing large amounts of bottles, cans, glass and disposable barbecues. But they said they had never seen so many nitrous oxide canisters in one place. By 10:00 BST more than 150 bags of rubbish had already been collected, organisers Ocean's 8 said. More than 150 bags of rubbish were collected in two hours, but there is still a lot to do Environmental activist and blogger Clare Osborn, of Clare Talks Rubbish, is one of Ocean's 8 and said: ""We sound like the fun police, but people really need to find more sustainable ways to have fun. ""Every one of these canisters comes with a balloon, and they are so incredibly dangerous and deadly to wildlife, which can mistake the bits of balloon for food."" The gas - nitrous oxide - is the second most commonly used recreational drug in England and Wales after cannabis. But the Royal College of Nursing said many people remained ignorant of the risks, which can include breathing difficulties, dangerously-increased heart rate, burns, and death. 'Don't be complacent over laughing gas risks' 'Festival balloons' litter 'appalling' Microplastics threat to ocean giants Three time slots have been created throughout the day for people to go to the beach and help collect the rubbish. Core volunteers then sort it into what can be recycled with TerraCycle, and the remaining waste which is being collected by Brighton and Hove City Council's Cityclean service. Around a quarter of a million people flock to Brighton for the Pride weekend A team of core volunteers are on site all day, helping to sort the collected waste Amy Gibson, another member of Ocean's 8 who organises regular Pier 2 Pier silent disco beach clean, said she has never seen so much rubbish on the beach. ""You couldn't even see the beach in places. ""Normally we find around 20 bags' worth of rubbish after a weekend or an event, but we've collected 10 times that amount in the first two hours of today's clean. ""It's Pride so we expected the glitter, the feather boas and the parts of people's costumes, but I can't believe how many noz canisters there are."" Volunteers collected bags full of used laughing gas canisters Legislation introduced in 2016 made it illegal to sell the gas for psychoactive purposes. But enforcing the legislation has proved difficult because nitrous oxide is used in food products like whipped cream, and medicine. Brighton Pride does not officially hold any events on the beach, but it said it recognised the impact tourism had, so it had sponsored the clean-up effort. A Pride reveller gets cleaning About a quarter of a million people visit Brighton for the city's annual Pride weekend. Kylie Minogue headlined the music event, supported by surprise guest Emeli Sande, and more than100 floats took part in the parade. The event comes during the 50th anniversary year of a riot which started in a gay bar in New York, sparked by police brutality. Allow Twitter content?

"Two mass shootings in less than 24 hours have shaken the US Twenty people were killed in a supermarket in El Paso, Texas Police treating it as domestic terrorism after finding anti-immigrant 'manifesto' In Dayton, Ohio, nine people are dead and suspect is 24-year-old male Democratic candidates for the 2020 election calling for more gun control Some are also blaming President Trump's immigration rhetoric but White House says that is ridiculous Tom Geoghegan, Ben Bevington and Joshua Nevett The live page is ending now. To sum up:  You can follow further developments atbbc.com/news Dayton police are holding a press conference where they released surveillance footage from the scene of the mass shooting. In one of the videos, Connor Betts is seen trying to get into a building moments after he opened fire on the street. Police officers return fire within 30 seconds and the suspect is hit and falls to the ground. People are also seen running for cover as panic ensued on the busy street.  Police in Dayton at the scene From the BBC's Lauren Turner in El Paso: Texas
senator John Cornyn visited the site at the back of the Walmart that has come
to serve as a makeshift memorial on Sunday lunchtime. He
said: âTo see somebody try to come from another place to try to start a war
between our cultures is simply unacceptable. âWeâre
not going to let him get away with it.â He described El Paso as âa peaceful, wonderful example of our Texan cultureâ and said that it was âheartbreakingâ that someone would want to divide the communities in this way. Mr Cornyn added that the death penalty would be âappropriateâ in this case. Texas Senator John Cornyn visits the scene of the attack in El Paso It's one of the most divisive issues in American society, once again brought to the fore because of a deadly mass shooting. So what is the basis for the right to bear arms? And what key events have helped shape the debate? Read the full piece Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's become a familiar refrain after every mass shooting in the US. Will this time be different? Among gun control activists, there is a certain amount of resignation whenever a new incident splashes across the headlines. If public sentiment did not force action after the 2012 Newtown shooting, when 26 people - including 20 young children - were killed in a Connecticut school, then nothing will ever change. If the double tragedy of El Paso and Dayton ends up being different, however, here are a few possible explanations.  Having said all that, there are plenty of reasons why the usual political obstacles might mean this tragedy follows the familiar pattern. Read Anthony's full blog  Mexico will take legal action to protect its citizens in the
United States, the countryâs foreign minister has said. In a video statement, Marcelo Ebrard condemned the El Paso
shooting as an âact of barbarityâ. The shooting, in which three Mexicans were among 20 killed,
is being treated as a âdomestic terrorism caseâ, investigators said. Mr Edrard said the Mexican government will take âforceful
legal actionsâ to keep its citizens safe in the US, without explaining specifics. The first legal actions, he said, would be announced on
Sunday afternoon. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

A vigil at the Levitt Pavilion, Dayton People queue to donate blood in El Paso Mass at St Patrick Cathedral in El Paso Mourners in Dayton A makeshift memorial near the Walmart in El Paso A mugshot of the El Paso shooting suspect has been released
by investigators. Earlier today, El Paso's district attorney said the suspect,
21-year-old Patrick Crusius, has been charged with capital murder. Prosecutors said they are considering bringing hate crime,
firearm and domestic terrorism charges against him. Mr Crusius, of Allen, Texas, could face the death penalty for
his alleged crimes. A mugshot of El Paso shooting suspect Patrick Crusius From the BBC's Lauren Turner in El Paso:  âYesterday
I was in shock. Today, my heart is hurting.â Gilda
Baeza Ortega is looking out at the Walmart in disbelief from across the car
park. âThere
are 19 bodies still in there,â she says, barely comprehending the fact. âI feel
like Iâm connected to those people, and their families.â She
had been on the way to the store yesterday morning then decided to go for
breakfast with her parents instead. But
itâs not just that that makes her feel so close to whatâs happened. âItâs
the fact he was targeting us. Iâm a Mexican American and very proud of that. To
me that is the biggest wound,â she says. People
have been coming here all day to lay flowers, a cross, even a Rubikâs cube, in
tribute. Some people are also asking police when they can retrieve their cars from Walmartâs car park, where vehicles with Mexican number plates sit alongside those with American plates. One officer told me it could be eight hours from now. Itâs a popular place for people to come shopping from Mexico and it means many now canât make the return journey, their passports being locked in their vehicles. Willa Melendez says with El Paso being so close to the Mexican border, âit doesnât feel like weâre two countries - we go back and forthâ. She adds âweâre a city of diversity - so this hurtsâ. Everyone talks of what a friendly place it is, how everyone knows each other. A taxi driver talks of the âsix degrees of separationâ here. She's dreading the list of names coming out, worried she knows one of the victims. Everyone talks of how safe El Paso is too. They canât quite believe that this has been visited on them - on what should have been just another ordinary Saturday morning at the supermarket. Allow Twitter content?

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Back in 2012, the National Rifle Association was near the
height of its power and influence in US politics. Through decades of
campaigning, the group - which represents millions of gun owners as well as gun
manufacturers - had turned gun rights for many Americans into a
red-white-and-blue bedecked symbol of God and country. Many Democrats viewed firearm regulation as ballot-box
poison, blaming the issue for, among other defeats, Al Goreâs narrow
presidential loss in 2000. A candidate with a negative rating from the NRA
practically ensured a well-funded opponent and grass-roots opposition in many
parts of the US. Recently, however, the NRA has fallen on hard times. The
organisationâs revenue dropped by $56m in 2017, due to lower membership dues
and contributions. Itâs been beset by an internal power struggle that has spilled
into the civil courts and targeted by criminal corruption probes in New York
and Washington, DC. Even the NRAâs sheen of electoral invulnerability has begun
to dull. In the 2018 mid-term elections it was outspent by gun-control groups
aided by contributions from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Several
prominent gun-control advocates, such as Lucy McBath in Georgia, won in
battleground districts. This is not the same NRA that was able to aggressively push
back against background-check legislation even in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. It still has plenty of political muscle, of course, but cracks in the
foundation are visible. Jordan Anchondo A young mother-of-three was killed in yesterdayâs mass shooting in
Texas while apparently shielding her baby son, her sister has said. Jordan Anchondo, 24, was one of the 20 people who were shot
dead at a Walmart in El Paso. Her sister Leta Jamrowski, 19, said Ms Anchondo was shopping
for back-to-school supplies when the gunman, named as Patrick Crusius, opened
fire. As the shooting rampage unfolded, she fell on her
two-month-old son in an apparent attempt to save his life, Ms Jamrowski said. She told the Associated Press that her sister appears to
have given âher lifeâ for her son, who survived the shooting with broken bones. Ms Anchondo's son was receiving treatment at the University Medical Center of El Paso. In a detailed analysis on bellingcat.com,external, Robert Evans, a journalist who studies radicalism on the internet, notes that the original 8chan thread was 
deleted almost immediately by site moderators. But he says he found comments celebrating the high body count and comparing it to the attacks on two mosques in New Zealand. He concludes: The El Paso shooterâs manifesto and 
8chan post show his radicalization and turn towards white supremacism, 
the Christchurch shooterâs manifesto, and the video of his massacre, 
likely acting as major influences in his eventual attack. The most 
important takeaways from the El Paso shooting are twofold:  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News ""The El Paso shooting fits a growing and disturbing trend of far right violence internationally. Like the attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, the suspected attacker fits a particular profile - an individual who may have acted alone but who inhabited an international online subculture of extremism, one in which others incite and encourage violent acts. ""A manifesto - which authorities have linked to the attacker - was posted online and was characteristic in its claims about population replacement (in New Zealand it was Muslims, in El Paso, Hispanics). And again, as in Christchurch, just before he acted the individual allegedly posted his intentions on the online free speech forum 8Chan. The pressure may grow now to act against such platforms and also for the authorities to take this growing threat more seriously, especially in the US."" Police in Ohio confirm that the sister of Connor Betts, the 24-year-old local man identified as the suspected gunman, is among the nine people killed. A new statement from President Trump says: ""Our nation mourns with those whose loved ones were murdered in the
tragic shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, and we share in the pain
and suffering of all those who were injured in these two senseless attacks. We condemn these hateful and cowardly acts. Through our grief,
America stands united with the people of El Paso and Dayton.  May God be
with the victims of these two horrific crimes and bring aid and comfort to
their families and friends. ""As a mark of solemn respect for the victims of the terrible acts of
violence... I hereby order that the flag of the

Governor Greg Abbott described it as ""one of the most deadly days in the history of Texas"". Police are investigating whether the attack, which happened a few miles from the US-Mexico border, was a hate crime. A 21-year-old man is in custody. Police said the suspect lived in Allen, Dallas, about 650 miles (1,046km) east of El Paso. He has been named by US media as Patrick Crusius. CCTV images said to be of the gunman and broadcast on US media show a man in a dark T-shirt wearing ear protectors and brandishing a rifle. CCTV images said to be of the gunman have emerged The Texas shooting  is believed to be the eighth deadliest in modern US history. It came less than 24 hours before another mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, and less than a week aftera teenage gunman killed three people at a California food festival. The police and FBI are investigating whether an anonymous white nationalist ""manifesto"", shared on an online forum, was written by the gunman. The document claims the attack was targeted at the local Hispanic community. The Walmart, which is near the Cielo Vista Mall, was full of shoppers buying back-to-school supplies at the time of the shooting. US President Donald Trump described the attack as ""an act of cowardice"". ""I know that I stand with everyone in this country to condemn today's hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people,"" he wrote on Twitter.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump spoke to reporters before boarding Air Force One A shooting at a supermarket in the US state of Texas that left 20 dead is being investigated as domestic terrorism, officials say. A 21-year-old white man was arrested at the scene of the attack in the city of El Paso, near the US-Mexico border. He is believed to have posted an online document calling the attack a response to ""the Hispanic invasion of Texas"". Police on Sunday said he had been charged with capital murder,  meaning he could face the death penalty. US President Donald Trump has said ""perhaps more has to be done"" to prevent mass shootings following the El Paso attack andanother in Ohio 13 hours later in which nine people, including the gunman's sister, were killed. ""Hate has no place in our country, and we are going to take care of it,"" he told reporters on Sunday. ""This has been going on for years, for years and years in our country and we have to get it stopped."" The president went on to link both attacks to a ""mental illness problem"". ""If you look at both of these cases, this is mental illness. These are people who are very, very seriously mentally ill,"" he said. But critics argue that the roots of the two massacres lie in the president's language about immigrants and Mexicans in particular, and his opposition to gun control. The El Paso gunman opened fire on a crowded Walmart on Saturday with an assault-style rifle and surrendered after being confronted by police officers outside the store. Twenty-six people were injured in the shooting. This video can not be played Police were filmed responding to the shootings ""We're treating this as a domestic terrorist case,"" John Bash, the US Attorney for the Western District of Texas, told a news conference on Sunday. He said the attack appeared ""to be designed to intimidate a civilian population, to say the least"". The suspect has been named by US media as Patrick Crusius, a resident of Allen, in the Dallas area, about 650 miles (1,046km) east of El Paso. It is not yet clear how long before the attack he had gone to the city. US stunned by two mass shootings in 24 hours Will anything change this time? He is believed to be the author of a text posted on 8chan, an online message board frequently used by the far right, which describes a ""cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion"" in alluding to Hispanic people in the US. The four-page document, reportedly posted some 20 minutes before police received the first emergency call from the Walmart, also expresses support for the gunman who killed 51 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. He has been co-operating with investigators, according to police, and has reportedly told them he acted alone. The shooting, believed to be the eighth deadliest in modern US history, took place in a city where most of the population of 680,000 is of Hispanic descent. The victims have not yet been named but Mexico's President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said six Mexican nationals were among the dead and seven others were injured. Security camera images said to be of the attacker show an armed man in a dark T-shirt wearing eye glasses and what appear to be ear protectors. Footage of the gunman was filmed by security cameras Reports of an active shooter were received at 10:39 local time (16:39 GMT), and law enforcement officers were on the scene within six minutes, police said. The Walmart, near the Cielo Vista Mall, was full of shoppers buying back-to-school supplies at the time of the shooting, and witnesses described scenes of chaos as customers fled for their lives. #ElPasoStrong trends as city pulls together America's gun culture in 10 charts ""People were panicking and running, saying that there was a shooter,"" Kianna Long told Reuters news agency. ""They were running close to the floor, people were dropping on the floor."" Ms Long said she and her husband ran through a stock room before taking cover with other customers. By Lauren Turner, BBC News, El Paso ""Yesterday I was in shock. Today, my heart is hurting."" Gilda Baeza Ortega is looking at the Walmart building in disbelief from across a car park. She had been on the way to the store, but then decided to go for breakfast with her parents instead. But it is not just that that makes her feel so close to what has happened. ""It's the fact he was targeting us. I'm a Mexican-American and very proud of that. To me that is the biggest wound."" People have been coming here all day to lay flowers, a cross, even a Rubik's cube, in tribute. Some are also asking police when they can retrieve their cars from Walmart's car park. It is a popular place for people to come shopping from Mexico, and many now cannot make the return journey as their passports are locked in their vehicles. Everyone talks of what a friendly place El Paso is, how everyone knows each other. A taxi driver mentions the ""six degrees of separation"" here. She is dreading the list of names coming out, worried she knows one of the victims. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso native, told CNN that Mr Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric had stoked divisions: ""He's an open avowed racist and is encouraging more racism in this country."" Also on CNN, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential hopeful, said:  ""Donald Trump is responsible for this. He is responsible because he is stoking fears and hatred and bigotry."" But acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney rejected the Democrats' allegations and attributed the attacks to ""sick"" individuals, saying on ABC: ""There's no benefit here in trying to make this a political issue, this is a social issue and we need to address it as that."" This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse Mr Trump, who has made curbing illegal immigration one of the key points of his presidency, has previously made derogatory comments about Mexican migrants and has called large groups of migrants trying to reach the US an ""invasion"". In recent weeks, Mr Trump has been accused of racism after his attacks on members of Congress who are members of racial or ethnic minorities. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said his government planned to seek legal measures to protect Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the US. Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Mr Ebrard said the attorney general was considering litigation claiming that terrorism was committed against Mexicans in the shooting. Such an action could lead to the extradition of the gunman, he said. ""For Mexico, this individual is a terrorist,"" he told reporters. By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The El Paso shooting fits a growing and disturbing trend of far-right violence internationally. Like the attack in Christchurch, the suspected attacker fits a particular profile - an individual who may have acted alone but who inhabited an international online subculture of extremism, one in which others incite and encourage violent acts. A document which authorities have linked to the attacker was posted online and was characteristic in its claims about population replacement (in New Zealand it was Muslims, in El Paso, Hispanics). And again, as in Christchurch, just before he acted the individual allegedly posted his intentions on the online forum 8chan. The pressure may grow now to act against such platforms and also for the authorities to take this growing threat more seriously, especially in the US. Did you witness what happened?

"Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay has called for the EU to find common ground with the UK EU leaders must give their chief negotiator the mandate to revise the UK's withdrawal agreement, otherwise a no-deal Brexit is ""coming down the tracks"", the Brexit secretary has said. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,,externalStephen Barclay said ""political realities"" had changed after May's European elections. New MEPs were elected in 61% of seats, he said, marking a ""fundamental shift"". He called on EU leaders to allow Michel Barnier to negotiate in a way that finds ""common ground"" with the UK. Brussels has consistently insisted that the withdrawal agreement - one of two main elements of Theresa May's Brexit deal, which was resoundingly rejected by MPs - cannot be renegotiated. Varadkar criticises 'heightened Brexit rhetoric' EU officials reject Johnson's Brexit policy Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Mr Barclay said Mr Barnier had told him in their discussion last week that he is bound by the instructions given to him by the European Commission and leaders of member states. But the change in the EU Parliament means there is a need for the EU to alter its approach, Mr Barclay said. ""Mr Barnier needs to urge EU leaders to consider this if they too want an agreement, to enable him to negotiate in a way that finds common ground with the UK. Otherwise, no deal is coming down the tracks,"" he said. By contrast, Boris Johnson's appointment as prime minister strengthened the UK's mandate to leave on 31 October, he said. Michel Barnier has said demands to eliminate the backstop are ""unacceptable"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ramped up his rhetoric over his desire to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, as part of his ""do or die"" commitment. He hasclashed with EU leadersover his demands to remove the Irish backstop - which prevents a hard border if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal - from the withdrawal agreement. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told Mr Johnson this week ""the backstop was necessary as a consequence of decisions taken in the UK"". But Mr Barclay said the backstop could mean people in Northern Ireland having EU rules ""foisted on them"" indefinitely to preserve the open border. He rejected the UK staying in the customs union and the single market as a solution, saying the border issue should be resolved in future talks on the long-term trading agreement with the EU. ""There is simply no chance of any deal being passed that includes the anti-democratic backstop. This is the reality that the EU has to face,"" he said. Speaking last month, Mr Barnier said demands to eliminate the backstop were ""unacceptable"" and Mr Johnson's approach to Brexit was ""rather combative"".

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a one-off cash boost of Â£1.8bn for NHS hospitals in England. Of this, almost Â£1bn will be available immediately to go towards new equipment and upgrades to 20 hospitals. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Johnson said he was ""determined to deliver"" the promises of the Brexit referendum campaign and increase NHS spending. But Labour said it fell ""significantly short"" of the amount needed by the NHS and would not reverse years of cuts. The money is coming from the Treasury and is not a re-allocation of funds from the Department of Health. It is on top of an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023 announced by former prime minister Theresa May last year. Around Â£850m - spread over five years - will go towards funding the 20 hospital upgrades that Mr Johnson promised in his first speech as PM outside Downing Street. The remaining money is expected to help clear a backlog of existing upgrade work and infrastructure projects. He will formally announce the funding on Monday, when he is expected to identify the hospitals which will get money to upgrade wards and repair buildings. Theresa May unveils Â£20bn boost for NHS Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? But the health think tank the Nuffield Trust said the latest funding, which is less than 1% of NHS England's annual budget, would ""only be a fraction of what it would cost to really upgrade 20 hospitals"". Nigel Edwards, the Nuffield Trust's chief executive, added that it it was a ""down payment on the staggering Â£6bn needed to clear the backlog"" of NHS maintenance. However, he said it was encouraging to see money put towards capital funding - used for equipment and repairs - ""which will help stop hospitals deteriorating even further"". In October, NHS Digital figures showed thatNHS trusts had a backlog of around Â£6bn,externalof repairs or replacements that needed carrying out. The NHS in England can hardly do anything other than welcome new money from the Treasury to invest in hospital buildings and launch new construction projects. But the Â£1bn this year to clear the backlog should be set against a total of Â£6bn which hospital leaders and think tanks believe is the total of work outstanding, including repairs and refurbishment of dilapidated facilities. On top of that is Â£850m for 20 hospitals to carry out major upgrades, but spread over five years. The latest announcement covers capital spending as opposed to day-to-day running costs. After raids on these capital budgets to prop up NHS frontline services in recent years, health service staff will feel there is some way to go to make up the lost ground - and only a small step forward has been taken.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson praised the ""astonishing achievements"" of the NHS, but highlighted the staffing pressures, along with the delays and cancellations facing patients. ""Which is why I am so determined to deliver now on the promises of that 2016 referendum campaign: not just to honour the will of the people, but to increase the cash available for this amazing national institution,"" he said. In the run-up to the Brexit referendum, a campaign bus used by Vote Leave claimed the UK sent Â£350m a week to the European Union and suggested the money could instead be spent on the NHS. However,analysis by the BBC found that claim to be misleading. In his column on Sunday, Mr Johnson wrote: ""It is thanks to this country's strong economic performance that we are now able to announce Â£1.8bn more for the NHS to buy vital new kit and confirm new upgrades for 20 hospitals across the country."" He said the government was also starting work on plans to ""tackle the injustice"" of social care - a problem ""that has been shirked for decades"". The PM added that Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chancellor Sajid Javid had already met the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, as they wanted to ensure the cash ""gets through to the right places"". Writing in the Sun on Sunday,external, Mr Hancock said the money would boost hospitals across the country - from Cornwall to Newcastle - by providing new intensive care wards, children's units and mental health facilities. Saying that the upgrades ""are just the start"", he added that the government wanted to take a more ""strategic"" approach to capital spending, and move away from ""piecemeal and uncoordinated"" decisions. There are also expected to be extra funding settlements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as part ofthe Barnett formula- which is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive when funding is increased in areas such as health and education in England. AroundÂ£115bn was spent on the NHS England budget,externallast year. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The best and the rest - what we've learned from the NHS Tracker GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years Responding to the funding announcement, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the Â£1.8bn pledged fell ""significantly short of what's needed to provide quality, safe care to patients after years of Tory cuts"". He added: ""Tory ministers have repeatedly cut capital investment budgets in recent years. These smash-and-grab raids have meant over Â£4bn slashed and seen the NHS repair bill spiral to Â£6bn, putting patient safety seriously at risk."" He told Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme the investment promised by Mr Johnson might not actually take place, claiming only Â£100m of Â£2.5bn of health spending announcements over the past two years had been delivered. Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Baroness Jolly said Mr Johnson's pledge would ""not be worth the paper it's written on"" if and when a no-deal Brexit took place.

"Scottish salmon are exported worldwide A Â£5.6m funding boost for Scotland's ""vital"" marine economy will help firms create jobs, according to Rural Minister Mairi Gougeon. Sea fisheries and processing businesses will share Â£4.2m in the latest round of cash from the EU's European and Maritime Fisheries Fund. The Scottish government confirmed it will contribute the remaining Â£1.4m. Among the beneficiaries are Seafood Scotland, which will receive Â£1.3m to help maximise key export markets. Meanwhile, JK Thomson in Musselburgh will get Â£1.35m to help pay for the construction of a new processing factory. With the UK's exit from the EU looming, Ms Gougeon called on Prime Minister Johnson's government to commit the necessary cash to allow the funding scheme to continue after Brexit. Fish farming is a key part of Scotland's marine economy She said: ""The marine economy plays a vital role in supporting coastal communities and is critical to our ambitions to double the value of our food and drink industry. ""From grants which will help open up existing and new export markets to the funding of new and improved factory facilities, this Â£5.6m investment will support the marine economy supply chain, boosting growth and creating local jobs."" Ms Gougeon also had a message for Westminster. She added: ""With this round fully committing all allocated funding to the Scottish processing sector, I call on the UK government to meet its pledge, to provide the required additional funding to allow future rounds to proceed so that businesses can continue to grow and deliver sustainable economic growth for the seafood sector. ""This funding should be transferred to the Scottish Government for disbursement in Scotland, in line with the devolved settlement.""

"This video can not be played Water is being pumped away from the reservoir and sandbags are still being dropped Round-the-clock work is continuing to fix a damaged dam at risk of bursting and flooding a Derbyshire town. Teams are pumping water from Toddbrook Reservoir near Whaley Bridge, after part of a dam ruptured. More than 1,000 homes have been evacuated since the breach on Thursday and there is concern nearby Marple, Stockport, is also at risk of flooding. Police warned Whaley Bridge residents officers would stop allowing them back to their homes because of the risk. Derbyshire Deputy Chief Fire Officer Gavin Tomlinson said crews were focused on reducing reservoir levels Ameeting for residents will be held laterto explain the current situation with the operation. A ""handful"" of people who have refused to leave their homes have been advised ""personally and in no uncertain terms"" of the risks they are taking, a Derbyshire Police spokesman said. He emphasised the exclusion area was being treated like the cordon at a crime scene and anyone putting themselves in danger would be ""dealt with accordingly"". Allow Twitter content?

On Saturday, people wereallowed briefly into their homes to collect pets and essentials, but were warned they would be doing so at their own risk. One resident per household was escorted by police back into their homes for 15 minutes. Police said officers had been forced to find some people who had gone back to their homes Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said the risk during those trips ""was extraordinarily high"" and they had caused problems. ""The vast majority of those who have been allowed back in to Whaley Bridge have been fantastic,"" she said. ""However, there have been a very small minority of people who have returned to their homes and have not presented back at the road block at which they entered. ""These people are putting the lives of officers at risk as further checks have to now be completed to ensure those residents are out of the area safely."" Twenty-four large pumps are now lowering the water level by 10 cm an hour Some 1,500 people in Whaley Bridge had sought shelter elsewhere after part of the reservoir's spillway broke away on Thursday. Father Jamie Mcleod, who lives in the town, said he had hardly slept for three days, taking supplies to the emergency workers. He was here at the start of the crisis when he went to check the dam after days of heavy rain. ""When I was over there it started to crack,"" he said. ""When it got worse I went over to the council and raised the alarm and said, 'We have to evacuate the village'. ""We then went back to the reservoir and, of course, the police then came and procedures were put in place. ""At the time I really thought the village was going to go. ""Then it really struck me there is a school at the bottom of the dam and last week that playground was full."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Grab-and-go for danger zone residents Whaley Bridge dam emergency in pictures Earlier on Sunday, Derbyshire Deputy Chief Fire Officer Gavin Tomlinson said teams at Whaley Bridge had made good progress. ""We now know we have taken around 35% of the contents of reservoir out now and we are aiming to get it down about 25% where we think it is at a safe level,"" he said. The reservoir has sloping sides and as the water level drops the pumps have to be moved closer to the water's edge, he said. An RAF Chinook helicopter has placed 525 one-tonne bags to strengthen the dam wall and regulate water flow. Daniel Greenhalgh, from the Canal and River Trust, which owns the reservoir and dam, warned: ""We are not out of the woods yet. ""The last estimate was that residents could be out of their homes for seven days yet."" Emergency services and volunteers have been working around the clock Police, the Environment Agency, and the Canal and River Trust have all said there is a ""real risk"" the 188-year-old dam could collapse and flood the town. The trust has defended the maintenance and safety of the structure, which was built in 1831. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a one-off cash boost of Â£1.8bn for NHS hospitals in England. Of this, almost Â£1bn will be available immediately to go towards new equipment and upgrades to 20 hospitals. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Johnson said he was ""determined to deliver"" the promises of the Brexit referendum campaign and increase NHS spending. But Labour said it fell ""significantly short"" of the amount needed by the NHS and would not reverse years of cuts. The money is coming from the Treasury and is not a re-allocation of funds from the Department of Health. It is on top of an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023 announced by former prime minister Theresa May last year. Around Â£850m - spread over five years - will go towards funding the 20 hospital upgrades that Mr Johnson promised in his first speech as PM outside Downing Street. The remaining money is expected to help clear a backlog of existing upgrade work and infrastructure projects. He will formally announce the funding on Monday, when he is expected to identify the hospitals which will get money to upgrade wards and repair buildings. Theresa May unveils Â£20bn boost for NHS Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? But the health think tank the Nuffield Trust said the latest funding, which is less than 1% of NHS England's annual budget, would ""only be a fraction of what it would cost to really upgrade 20 hospitals"". Nigel Edwards, the Nuffield Trust's chief executive, added that it it was a ""down payment on the staggering Â£6bn needed to clear the backlog"" of NHS maintenance. However, he said it was encouraging to see money put towards capital funding - used for equipment and repairs - ""which will help stop hospitals deteriorating even further"". In October, NHS Digital figures showed thatNHS trusts had a backlog of around Â£6bn,externalof repairs or replacements that needed carrying out. The NHS in England can hardly do anything other than welcome new money from the Treasury to invest in hospital buildings and launch new construction projects. But the Â£1bn this year to clear the backlog should be set against a total of Â£6bn which hospital leaders and think tanks believe is the total of work outstanding, including repairs and refurbishment of dilapidated facilities. On top of that is Â£850m for 20 hospitals to carry out major upgrades, but spread over five years. The latest announcement covers capital spending as opposed to day-to-day running costs. After raids on these capital budgets to prop up NHS frontline services in recent years, health service staff will feel there is some way to go to make up the lost ground - and only a small step forward has been taken.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson praised the ""astonishing achievements"" of the NHS, but highlighted the staffing pressures, along with the delays and cancellations facing patients. ""Which is why I am so determined to deliver now on the promises of that 2016 referendum campaign: not just to honour the will of the people, but to increase the cash available for this amazing national institution,"" he said. In the run-up to the Brexit referendum, a campaign bus used by Vote Leave claimed the UK sent Â£350m a week to the European Union and suggested the money could instead be spent on the NHS. However,analysis by the BBC found that claim to be misleading. In his column on Sunday, Mr Johnson wrote: ""It is thanks to this country's strong economic performance that we are now able to announce Â£1.8bn more for the NHS to buy vital new kit and confirm new upgrades for 20 hospitals across the country."" He said the government was also starting work on plans to ""tackle the injustice"" of social care - a problem ""that has been shirked for decades"". The PM added that Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chancellor Sajid Javid had already met the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, as they wanted to ensure the cash ""gets through to the right places"". Writing in the Sun on Sunday,external, Mr Hancock said the money would boost hospitals across the country - from Cornwall to Newcastle - by providing new intensive care wards, children's units and mental health facilities. Saying that the upgrades ""are just the start"", he added that the government wanted to take a more ""strategic"" approach to capital spending, and move away from ""piecemeal and uncoordinated"" decisions. There are also expected to be extra funding settlements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as part ofthe Barnett formula- which is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive when funding is increased in areas such as health and education in England. AroundÂ£115bn was spent on the NHS England budget,externallast year. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The best and the rest - what we've learned from the NHS Tracker GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years Responding to the funding announcement, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the Â£1.8bn pledged fell ""significantly short of what's needed to provide quality, safe care to patients after years of Tory cuts"". He added: ""Tory ministers have repeatedly cut capital investment budgets in recent years. These smash-and-grab raids have meant over Â£4bn slashed and seen the NHS repair bill spiral to Â£6bn, putting patient safety seriously at risk."" He told Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme the investment promised by Mr Johnson might not actually take place, claiming only Â£100m of Â£2.5bn of health spending announcements over the past two years had been delivered. Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Baroness Jolly said Mr Johnson's pledge would ""not be worth the paper it's written on"" if and when a no-deal Brexit took place. Cancer Research UK said the investment would go ""some way to address the immense strain"" the NHS is under but said the staffing shortage should take priority. Policy director Emma Greenwood added: ""Upgrades to hospitals are welcome but the NHS is experiencing a staffing crisis. And it's impossible to diagnose more cancers at an early stage without the right staff."" Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn?

"Saeed Malekpour's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment An Iranian-born Canadian resident has escaped from Iran after being imprisoned there for 11 years and returned to Canada. Saeed Malekpour was sentenced to life in prison over a programme he created for uploading photos to the web that Iranian authorities said was used on Persian-language pornographic websites. His sister posted a video online showing his return to Canada on Friday. He fled while on short-term release from prison. Mr Malekpour's imprisonment was one of several prominent cases involving Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency. Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Iran travel warning for dual nationals In comments shared by the Iranian judiciary's official news agency Mizan Online, spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said Mr Malekpour was on a ""three-day prison leave"" and ""barred from leaving the country"". ""Apparently he has used illegal ways to leave the country,"" Mr Esmaili added. Payam Akhavan, an international law professor who has been involved in the case, told Canadian media: ""He was temporarily released from prison in Iran following pressure from United Nations human rights bodies, and he was to report to the prison authorities again. ""But instead he left the country and came to Canada through a third country."" Mr Malekpour's sister posted a video of him arriving in Canada on social media. ""The nightmare is finally over. He is back home and reunited with his sister. Thank you Canada for your leadership,"" she wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She did not provide details of the circumstances surrounding his return. The web programmer was arrested in October 2008 while visiting his father, who was in poor health, in Iran. He argued that the programme he created was open source and that it was used by other websites without his knowledge. He was initially sentenced to death for ""spreading corruption on earth"". This was later commuted to life imprisonment, reportedly after he ""repented"". During his imprisonment, Mr Malekpour was physically and psychologically tortured and spent more than a year in solitary confinement, according to Amnesty International.

"This video can not be played 'A short timeline of violence' Nine people have been killed and at least 27 injured in a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio - the second in the US in 24 hours. Police confirmed they killed the gunman at the scene within a minute of him opening fire. The shooting began at 01:07 local time (05:07 GMT) in the Oregon district of the city centre. The local mayor said the gunman wore body armour and came carrying extra ammunition. The suspect used a .223-calibre assault rifle with high-capacity magazines. Nan Whaley told reporters she was ""amazed"" by the quick response of the officers which she said prevented further deaths, but also stressed it would be a ""very, very difficult time"" for families of victims. ""As a mayor, this is a day that we all dread happening,"" she said. ""What's very sad is I've got messages from mayors across the country - it's sad that we've all gone through it."" The incident came only hours after a mass shooting in El Paso, Texaswhich left at least 20 people dead. The Gun Violence Archive, which categorises mass shootings as four or more people shot or killed, says there have been 251 so far this year. Footage posted on social media showed people running as dozens of gunshots echoed through the streets. It is thought the shooting took place outside Ned Peppers Bar on E 5th Street. The bar later posted on social media its staff were safe. Police said all the fatalities happened outside in the street. This video can not be played Dayton shooting witness: ""As you came outside, you saw the bodies"" Jae Williams told the BBC he was at a nearby rap performance when they were told to evacuate. ""I was very shocked,"" he said. ""We all evacuated quickly and safely. We were told to avoid the Oregon district."" ""I got to my car, I could see cops, multiple ambulances."" Another eyewitness told Reuters they had been in a nearby nightclub, Newcom's, when the shooting happened. ""The screams, the cruisers, the chaos... the security guards and themselves were running around and telling people to get out and just how everybody was acting, you knew something was wrong,"" she said. ""And then when you came outside, as soon as you hit the front street, you've seen the bodies, you knew this was different. You knew it was something that you never thought of experiencing, never experienced, wouldn't want anyone to experience."" Assistant Police Chief Matt Carper told reporters that officers managed to take down the gunman. ""Our people are very well trained for a situation like this,"" he said, adding it was ""very fortunate that the officers were in close proximity"". Nearby hospitals had received 27 people and discharged 15 by 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT). Law enforcement sources told CBS News the gunman was 24-year-old Connor Betts from Bellbrook, Ohio. Police were searching his house on Sunday, the news network said. Connor Betts Officially, however, few details have been released and there is no indication yet of any motive. Police said they had identified the attacker, but declined to identify him at a news conference. Mayor Whaley said he was wearing body armour and was carrying extra magazines for his weapon. ""We don't know the thoughts of the shooter,"" she said. Officer Carper, who stood beside Mayor Whaley, said it was ""very early in the investigative stages"" and could not confirm there was only one gunman involved, but said so far that looked likely. FBI agents are also assisting police with the investigation. At a series of news conferences, Mayor Whaley asked people to think of those people ""who went downtown on a Saturday night and thought they'd be safe"". She said that the Oregon district was ""one of the safest places in the whole region"". ""Frankly, we're at a situation now in our country that these are so random,"" she said. She also said the city had gone through a ""a really tough year"", drawing a comparison to a series of 14 tornadoes that hit Dayton in March. ""What really goes through my mind is one seems completely preventable,"" she said. ""I just question when is enough, enough."" She earlier tweeted that she was ""heartbroken"" after the shooting, and thanked first responders. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At a series of news conferences, Mayor Whaley asked people to think of those people ""who went downtown on a Saturday night and thought they'd be safe"". She said that the Oregon district was ""one of the safest places in the whole region"". ""Frankly, we're at a situation now in our country that these are so random,"" she said. She also said the city had gone through a ""a really tough year"", drawing a comparison to a series of 14 tornadoes that hit Dayton in March. ""What really goes through my mind is one seems completely preventable,"" she said. ""I just question when is enough, enough."" She earlier tweeted that she was ""heartbroken"" after the shooting, and thanked first responders. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Heloise Letissier: ""Since I started, it's been non-negotiable: I'm going to be brutally honest."" There aren't many pop shows like the one Christine + The Queens is putting on at festivals around Europe this summer. Sparse and theatrical, it sees the French singer tangle and tussle with her dance troupe, as she brings to life songs of non-conformity and sexual awakening. Amidst the spartan lighting and plumes of smoke, the muscular, gender-fluid performers occasionally resemble a Caravaggio painting - which, it transpires, is the whole point. ""I wanted to work the show like a painting,"" says Chris. ""The fireworks create smoke, so it's almost like painting by explosion."" ""When I first suggested it, my tech guys wanted to kill me, but maybe it's the fireworks that will kill me in the end,"" she adds, laughing. ""That would be a fantastic gig: She died! She combusted into spontaneous fire!"" Christine and the Queens: Why I'm pansexual How pop divas dominated Glastonbury's last day She's joking, of course, but Chris's shows generate enough heat to power a small village. At one point, a dancer even starts smoking - not with a cigarette pressed to their lips, but with literal smoke billowing from beneath their clothes. There are moments of intense sadness, too. On What's Her Face, a song about how Letissier still carries the loneliness of the school playground everywhere she goes, she removes her shirt and turns her back to the audience, isolated and vulnerable amongst a crowd of adoring fans. But the star emerges liberated and unapologetic, comfortable in her skin, shrugging off expectations. ""This is a safe space, free of all judgement,"" she announced as sheheadlined Glastonbury's Other Stagein June. ""Because if there's no judgment, then anything can happen"". BBC News caught up with the singer, whose real name is Heloise Letissier, before the show to discuss her ""brutally honest"" lyrics, and why she ""stopped apologising"" for making music on her own terms.

A song like Don't Matter tackles subjects like anorexia and self-loathing that are atypical for pop music. What led you down that path? Since I started to write my first song, it's been non-negotiable: I'm going to be brutally honest. Christine and the Queens was born out of a crazy desire to finally accept everything and own everything about myself including the dark thoughts, including sadness, including the impossibility of fitting in. And I wouldn't shy away from thatâ¦ which creates a weird balance. And honestly, you know, Christine and the Queens was also borne out of something that happened between me and drag queens [she wasnursed out of depression by a troupe of drag artists,externalafter a catastrophic break-up in her early 20s]. Christine is a drag character - it's really generous and fun and entertaining, but it's borne out of wounds. Drag queens always have stories of their sadness - but they turn it into something that can be shared, and I think that's something that can be really powerful. You've been called a spokesperson for the LGBT community. Is that a label you're comfortable with? I think it's healthier not to see yourself as a spokesperson for anything. As an artist, I do believe in visibility, in speaking out. I believe in that very much. But it's good not to think of yourself as a role model, because it can become so solemn; and a bit pretentious also. And restrictive, I guess? I think so. It's the end of that brutal honesty we were talking about. The singer, who identifies as pansexual, deliberately blurs masculine and feminine traits Glastonbury made great strides towards gender equality this year, but you're the only female headliner on the two main stages. What can be done to get women further up the bill? I recently did Primavera and that festival was 50/50. It was really an important moment when the line-up came out and we realised. It seems like the more we move forward, the easier it becomes to look back and see how we were lacking equality before. It's not natural yet. It's not reflex yet. We have to talk about it, think of it, be careful of it; and I think we're getting towards the right direction. The pop landscape now is filled with different representations of femininity, which I appreciate. You have Solange, you have Billie Eilish, you have BeyoncÃ©. Many different ways to be a woman in the industry, and I think that's really cool. You've named three female headliners right there. Absolutely. BeyoncÃ© headlined Glastonbury already, didn't she? Yes, and Billie Eilish is playing just before you today. She represents something more rough around the edges, less polite. It's a form of femininity I actually do like. The next step, would be to get more women in technical jobs - like female sound engineers, female producers. Chris's self-titled second album was partly inspired by Janet Jackson's soul-searching Velvet Rope You've actually self-produced both your albums. Is that simply because the music is so personal? It's just natural. When I write a song, I always start with the production - building a beat, an aesthetic. I don't have a demo with some piano chords and a melody, it's a fully-shaped song already. So then I just have to finish the production as it is. Actually, at one point, because I was made to feel self-conscious about it, I was like, ""OK, I'm going to try producing with other people,"" but it wasn't working. I kept losing the essence of the track because it was already produced with a clear vision. At some point I decided to stop apologising for that. I like producing. I like to think about sounds and textures. Talk me through the making of 5 Dollars. How did you achieve such a unique sound? I had an obsession with Bruce Springsteen when I was writing the second album. I was like, ""Oh, he knows how to write such tender, catchy melodies"" and when I wrote 5 Dollars, I was searching for that type of melody that could be uplifting and sad at the same time. And then for the production, I was actually thinking a lot about Arthur Russell - whose music is really sparse and fragile, but also really fierce. So it was like Bruce Springsteen and Arthur Russell. No biggie. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

You've been sampling Janet Jackson's Nasty during your show. Was that Minneapolis sound a big influence, too? I actually watched her Glastonbury set on BBC iPlayer while I was drinking my coffee this morning! But you're right, on my second record, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's production on Control and The Velvet Rope - were very inspiring for me. I don't think a lot of people realise how trailblazing The Velvet Rope was - Janet was talking about gender fluidity and LGBT rights, long before it became an accepted part of pop music. That album is a masterpiece. Like you say, it's about gender fluidity but also depression, empowerment. You get to meet a whole woman in every facet she has, and it's not an easy listen because it doesn't give an easy answer. At one point she's empowered and at another she's getting abused by a partner - but it's the same woman, trying to make a path in life. It's a hugely feminist album and the production is amazing, so I was really inspired by that. I wanted to make an album that could be complex, also. I didn't want to give any easy answers about who I was, because I don't have any. And that's the key, isn't it? No-one is the same person from one day to the next. No. Exactly. And I mean, I like cheesy pop. I like pop that's just [sings] ""Be the best person you can be!"" But I want to use the pop vessel to tell stories that could be deeply relatable. Sometimes those stories aren't clear or easy - but life's like that.

"This video can not be played Water is being pumped away from the reservoir and sandbags are still being dropped Round-the-clock work is continuing to fix a damaged dam at risk of bursting and flooding a Derbyshire town. Teams are pumping water from Toddbrook Reservoir near Whaley Bridge, after part of a dam ruptured. More than 1,000 homes have been evacuated since the breach on Thursday and there is concern nearby Marple, Stockport, is also at risk of flooding. Police warned Whaley Bridge residents officers would stop allowing them back to their homes because of the risk. Derbyshire Deputy Chief Fire Officer Gavin Tomlinson said crews were focused on reducing reservoir levels Ameeting for residents will be held laterto explain the current situation with the operation. A ""handful"" of people who have refused to leave their homes have been advised ""personally and in no uncertain terms"" of the risks they are taking, a Derbyshire Police spokesman said. He emphasised the exclusion area was being treated like the cordon at a crime scene and anyone putting themselves in danger would be ""dealt with accordingly"". Allow Twitter content?

On Saturday, people wereallowed briefly into their homes to collect pets and essentials, but were warned they would be doing so at their own risk. One resident per household was escorted by police back into their homes for 15 minutes. Police said officers had been forced to find some people who had gone back to their homes Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said the risk during those trips ""was extraordinarily high"" and they had caused problems. ""The vast majority of those who have been allowed back in to Whaley Bridge have been fantastic,"" she said. ""However, there have been a very small minority of people who have returned to their homes and have not presented back at the road block at which they entered. ""These people are putting the lives of officers at risk as further checks have to now be completed to ensure those residents are out of the area safely."" Twenty-four large pumps are now lowering the water level by 10 cm an hour Some 1,500 people in Whaley Bridge had sought shelter elsewhere after part of the reservoir's spillway broke away on Thursday. Father Jamie Mcleod, who lives in the town, said he had hardly slept for three days, taking supplies to the emergency workers. He was here at the start of the crisis when he went to check the dam after days of heavy rain. ""When I was over there it started to crack,"" he said. ""When it got worse I went over to the council and raised the alarm and said, 'We have to evacuate the village'. ""We then went back to the reservoir and, of course, the police then came and procedures were put in place. ""At the time I really thought the village was going to go. ""Then it really struck me there is a school at the bottom of the dam and last week that playground was full."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Twenty-four pumps are working and more than a third of the reservoir's water had been removed since Thursday, lowering the level by three metres (9ft) officials said. But forecasters say 30-40mm (1.2-1.6in) of rain may fall in two hours, later on Sunday. Police said the ""risk of adverse weather"" was to blame for the most recent evacuations.

Emergency responders are planning and preparing for a ""potential incident"" but were not yet evacuating that area. How safe are Britain's dams? Grab-and-go for danger zone residents Whaley Bridge dam emergency in pictures Earlier on Sunday, Derbyshire Deputy Chief Fire Officer Gavin Tomlinson said teams at Whaley Bridge had made good progress. ""We now know we have taken around 35% of the contents of reservoir out now and we are aiming to get it down about 25% where we think it is at a safe level,"" he said. The reservoir has sloping sides and as the water level drops the pumps have to be moved closer to the water's edge, he said. An RAF Chinook helicopter has placed 525 one-tonne bags to strengthen the dam wall and regulate water flow. Daniel Greenhalgh, from the Canal and River Trust, which owns the reservoir and dam, warned: ""We are not out of the woods yet. ""The last estimate was that residents could be out of their homes for seven days yet."" Emergency services and volunteers have been working around the clock Police, the Environment Agency, and the Canal and River Trust have all said there is a ""real risk"" the 188-year-old dam could collapse and flood the town. The trust has defended the maintenance and safety of the structure, which was built in 1831. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay has called for the EU to find common ground with the UK EU leaders must give their chief negotiator the mandate to revise the UK's withdrawal agreement, otherwise a no-deal Brexit is ""coming down the tracks"", the Brexit secretary has said. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,,externalStephen Barclay said ""political realities"" had changed after May's European elections. New MEPs were elected in 61% of seats, he said, marking a ""fundamental shift"". He called on EU leaders to allow Michel Barnier to negotiate in a way that finds ""common ground"" with the UK. Brussels has consistently insisted that the withdrawal agreement - one of two main elements of Theresa May's Brexit deal, which was resoundingly rejected by MPs - cannot be renegotiated. Varadkar criticises 'heightened Brexit rhetoric' EU officials reject Johnson's Brexit policy Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Mr Barclay said Mr Barnier had told him in their discussion last week that he is bound by the instructions given to him by the European Commission and leaders of member states. But the change in the EU Parliament means there is a need for the EU to alter its approach, Mr Barclay said. ""Mr Barnier needs to urge EU leaders to consider this if they too want an agreement, to enable him to negotiate in a way that finds common ground with the UK. Otherwise, no deal is coming down the tracks,"" he said. By contrast, Boris Johnson's appointment as prime minister strengthened the UK's mandate to leave on 31 October, he said. Michel Barnier has said demands to eliminate the backstop are ""unacceptable"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ramped up his rhetoric over his desire to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, as part of his ""do or die"" commitment. He hasclashed with EU leadersover his demands to remove the Irish backstop - which prevents a hard border if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal - from the withdrawal agreement. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told Mr Johnson this week ""the backstop was necessary as a consequence of decisions taken in the UK"". But Mr Barclay said the backstop could mean people in Northern Ireland having EU rules ""foisted on them"" indefinitely to preserve the open border. He rejected the UK staying in the customs union and the single market as a solution, saying the border issue should be resolved in future talks on the long-term trading agreement with the EU. ""There is simply no chance of any deal being passed that includes the anti-democratic backstop. This is the reality that the EU has to face,"" he said. Speaking last month, Mr Barnier said demands to eliminate the backstop were ""unacceptable"" and Mr Johnson's approach to Brexit was ""rather combative"".

I kept losing the essence of the track because it was already produced with a clear vision. At some point I decided to stop apologising for that. I like producing. I like to think about sounds and textures. Talk me through the making of 5 Dollars. How did you achieve such a unique sound? I had an obsession with Bruce Springsteen when I was writing the second album. I was like, ""Oh, he knows how to write such tender, catchy melodies"" and when I wrote 5 Dollars, I was searching for that type of melody that could be uplifting and sad at the same time. And then for the production, I was actually thinking a lot about Arthur Russell - whose music is really sparse and fragile, but also really fierce. So it was like Bruce Springsteen and Arthur Russell. No biggie. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

You've been sampling Janet Jackson's Nasty during your show. Was that Minneapolis sound a big influence, too? I actually watched her Glastonbury set on BBC iPlayer while I was drinking my coffee this morning! But you're right, on my second record, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's production on Control and The Velvet Rope - were very inspiring for me. I don't think a lot of people realise how trailblazing The Velvet Rope was - Janet was talking about gender fluidity and LGBT rights, long before it became an accepted part of pop music. That album is a masterpiece. Like you say, it's about gender fluidity but also depression, empowerment. You get to meet a whole woman in every facet she has, and it's not an easy listen because it doesn't give an easy answer. At one point she's empowered and at another she's getting abused by a partner - but it's the same woman, trying to make a path in life. It's a hugely feminist album and the production is amazing, so I was really inspired by that. I wanted to make an album that could be complex, also. I didn't want to give any easy answers about who I was, because I don't have any. And that's the key, isn't it? No-one is the same person from one day to the next. No. Exactly. And I mean, I like cheesy pop. I like pop that's just [sings] ""Be the best person you can be!"" But I want to use the pop vessel to tell stories that could be deeply relatable. Sometimes those stories aren't clear or easy - but life's like that.

"Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay has called for the EU to find common ground with the UK EU leaders must give their chief negotiator the mandate to revise the UK's withdrawal agreement, otherwise a no-deal Brexit is ""coming down the tracks"", the Brexit secretary has said. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,,externalStephen Barclay said ""political realities"" had changed after May's European elections. New MEPs were elected in 61% of seats, he said, marking a ""fundamental shift"". He called on EU leaders to allow Michel Barnier to negotiate in a way that finds ""common ground"" with the UK. Brussels has consistently insisted that the withdrawal agreement - one of two main elements of Theresa May's Brexit deal, which was resoundingly rejected by MPs - cannot be renegotiated. Varadkar criticises 'heightened Brexit rhetoric' EU officials reject Johnson's Brexit policy Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Mr Barclay said Mr Barnier had told him in their discussion last week that he is bound by the instructions given to him by the European Commission and leaders of member states. But the change in the EU Parliament means there is a need for the EU to alter its approach, Mr Barclay said. ""Mr Barnier needs to urge EU leaders to consider this if they too want an agreement, to enable him to negotiate in a way that finds common ground with the UK. Otherwise, no deal is coming down the tracks,"" he said. By contrast, Boris Johnson's appointment as prime minister strengthened the UK's mandate to leave on 31 October, he said. Michel Barnier has said demands to eliminate the backstop are ""unacceptable"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ramped up his rhetoric over his desire to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, as part of his ""do or die"" commitment. He hasclashed with EU leadersover his demands to remove the Irish backstop - which prevents a hard border if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal - from the withdrawal agreement. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told Mr Johnson this week ""the backstop was necessary as a consequence of decisions taken in the UK"". But Mr Barclay said the backstop could mean people in Northern Ireland having EU rules ""foisted on them"" indefinitely to preserve the open border. He rejected the UK staying in the customs union and the single market as a solution, saying the border issue should be resolved in future talks on the long-term trading agreement with the EU. ""There is simply no chance of any deal being passed that includes the anti-democratic backstop. This is the reality that the EU has to face,"" he said. Speaking last month, Mr Barnier said demands to eliminate the backstop were ""unacceptable"" and Mr Johnson's approach to Brexit was ""rather combative"".
