"Caroline Rice couldn't afford the ink to print off her child's maths homework There are few benefits from lockdown, but one often touted is that people are managing to save a little money: lower transport costs, fewer shop-bought office lunches, cheaper childcare costs and no foreign holidays. Single mum Caroline Rice gives a wry smile when asked if she's managed to squirrel away extra cash over the past few months during pandemic restrictions. ""My spending is up,"" she says. ""The heating costs are higher because it's very cold. I'm having to shop locally because of lockdown, where the prices are slightly higher. The nearest Asda is 12 miles away."" The small savings on little luxuries that many people are making - fewer coffees or restaurant meals - were never an option for her in the first place. Her meagre finances meant the registered child minder, who lives in rural County Fermanagh, was already living week-to-week. Now it seems like day-to-day, she says. ""There's a mental stress, fatigue, in having to check the bank balance every day to see how much I'm down,"" she says. ""My child and I haven't bought any clothes in almost a year."" She's having to home-school her child. Many people wouldn't think twice about printing off their child's maths homework project. Caroline had to write it out by hand because they could not afford the ink. And she is not alone. A new report on the finances of low-income families during the pandemic says they are twice as likely to have increased their spending. It says extra costs for food, energy and remote learning equipment have piled financial pressure on the poor. The study - Pandemic Pressures - was a collaboration between the Resolution Foundation and the Nuffield Foundation-funded Covid Realities research project at the University of York. Dr Ruth Patrick, a social policy lecturer at the University of York, says talk of saving money during the pandemic is ""worlds away"" from the experiences of many low-income parents and carers. ""Parents have found their spending increases, as some of the usual strategies they use to get by on a low income - shopping around for the best deal, going to families and friends for a meal when the cupboards are empty - have become suddenly impossible,"" she said. For Shirley Widdop, an increase in food costs has been one of the biggest issues. The disabled single parent, who lives in Keighley, now has to shield for health reasons. That means using online deliveries a lot. She says: ""There's a minimum basket size [with online orders]. You often have to bulk buy in case there's a problem getting delivery slots."" Shirley Widdop has not saved on life's little luxuries - because she could not afford them in the first place When not shielding, Shirley would seek out food in her supermarket's reduced-price section. ""There used to be just a couple of people. Now there are crowds,"" she says. ""Not everyone has easy access to the internet. And not everyone has a functioning bus service."" The report notes that the pandemic has been marked by a huge reduction in overall spending, with entertainment and social activities restricted by lockdown. Higher-income households have been the main beneficiaries of this ""enforced saving"", as they spend 40% more of their income on recreation and leisure activities than the poorest fifth of households. The report says that in contrast to this overall picture, the pandemic has in many cases made it more expensive to live on a low income with children. More than one in three (36%) low-income households with children have increased their spending during the pandemic so far, compared with about one in six (18%) who have reduced their spending. Among high-income households without children, 13% have increased their spending, compared with 40% who have reduced it. Use of food banks has increased significantly during the pandemic The report highlights three main reasons for these extra pressures: Parents with children at home 24 hours a day have seen higher food and energy bills, while the need to entertain them during the lockdowns has brought additional costs Home-schooling has meant extra costs, such as acquiring laptops, paying for internet access and obtaining additional study materials Families' food costs have risen because of fewer in-store promotions, while shielding has meant using more expensive home delivery options or using more expensive local shops closer to home. It should also be noted, the report says, that these extra spending pressures are squeezing living standards that had stagnated even before the pandemic. To ease the burden, the report says the government should be seeking to maintain the Â£20-a-week rise in Universal Credit (UC) into next year. Otherwise, six million households face having their incomes cut by more than Â£1,000. Mike Brewer, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The pandemic has forced society as a whole to spend less and save more. But these broad spending patterns don't hold true for everyone. ""The extra cost of feeding, schooling and entertaining children 24/7 means that, for many families, lockdowns have made life more expensive to live on a low income."" However, a government spokesperson said measures had been put in place to ""ensure that nobody is left behind"", including extra welfare payments, job protection safeguards, the Â£170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme, and equipment for home-schooling. ""We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond,"" the spokesperson said. Sometimes the overall economic figures can not capture the actual on-the-ground financial reality. The pandemic lockdowns have led to a ""K-shaped"" recovery. Across the entire economy, staying at home has meant less capacity to spend on going out and a surge in savings. But the economic picture is both up and down at the same time, depending on which household. The average picture is composed of wealthier people saving a huge amount and poorer families more squeezed than ever. This report shows how children staying at home have increased food and energy bills. The cost of buying food has increased with fewer store promotions and a requirement to use more expensive local shops. The furlough scheme has kept people paid, but not necessarily on full pay. So the chancellor hopes that the vaccine rollout could unleash pent up demand in the form of huge levels of savings from the already well-off. And yet at the same time, will continue to face pressure over extending support - for example, the Â£20-a-week increase to universal credit.

"Rules governing the import of personal goods from the UK to the EU changed after Brexit formally came into effect A Dutch TV network has filmed border officials confiscating ham sandwiches and other foods from drivers arriving in the Netherlands from the UK, under post-Brexit rules. The officials were shown explaining import regulations imposed since the UK formalised its separation from the EU. Under EU rules, travellers from outside the bloc are banned from bringing in meat and dairy products. The rules appeared to bemuse one driver. ""Since Brexit, you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff,"" a Dutch border official told the driver infootage broadcast by TV network NPO 1,external. In one scene, a border official asked the driver whether several of his tin-foil wrapped sandwiches had meat in them. When the driver said they did, the border official said: ""Okay, so we take them all."" Surprised, the driver then asked the officials if he could keep the bread, to which one replied: ""No, everything will be confiscated - welcome to the Brexit, sir. I'm sorry."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK officially finished its formal separation from the EU on 31 December, 2020. From 23:00 GMT on that date, the UK stopped following EU rules, with new arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation coming into force. A trade deal with the EU was agreed on 24 December, and a week later, UK lawmakers voted in favour of the agreement. The UK's departure means big changes for business - with the UK and EU forming two separate markets - the end of free movement, and new regulations, including those governing the import of personal goods. Boris Johnson hails free trade deal with EU What are the key points of the Brexit deal? Are the borders ready? The UK government has issued guidance,externalto commercial drivers travelling to the EU, warning them to ""be aware of additional restrictions to personal imports"". ""You cannot bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (e.g. a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU,"" the guidance says. ""There are exceptions to this rule for certain quantities of powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods, or special processed pet feed."" On its website, the European Commission says,externalthe ban is necessary because such goods ""continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the Union"". ""It is known, for example, that dangerous pathogens that cause animal diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease and classical swine fever can reside in meat, milk or their products,"" the Commission says. Separately, the Dutch customs agency shared a picture of foodstuffs it had confiscated from motorists in the ferry terminal the Hook of Holland. ""Since 1 January, you can't just bring more food from the UK,"" the agency said. ""So prepare yourself if you travel to the Netherlands from the UK and spread the word. This is how we prevent food waste and together ensure that the controls are speeded up."" The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam described the confiscation of ham sandwiches and other foodstuffs at the EU's borders with the UK as ""a standard implication of [the] Brexit deal"".

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. Read more: Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman heralded as 'a hero' A majority of voters say Trump should resign, according toa new opinion poll from Quinnipiac University,external, with 56% respondents saying that they hold Trump responsible for the riot on Capitol Hill. The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list. Bonnie Watson Coleman is a Democrat congresswoman for New Jersey US Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman
says she has tested positive for Covid-19 â and believes she caught it while
sheltering from rioters in the Capitol building last Wednesday. âI received a positive test
result for Covid-19, and am home resting at this time. While I am experiencing
mild, cold-like symptoms, I remain in good spirits and will continue to work on
behalf of my constituents,âshe said,external. The Capitolâs physician Dr Brian
Moynihan warned on Sunday that âmany members of the House community were in
protective isolation in the large room â some for several hours,"" and said âindividuals
may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infectionâ. An internal FBI bulletin is warning state and local law enforcement that they should prepare for violence by right-wing extremists on Sunday, according to US media who've seen the document. The FBI memo - reportedly issued a week before last week's attack on the US Capitol - identifies credible threats to the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols, from 16 January to 20 January. A violent far-right group known as the Boogaloo is behind these organising efforts, according to the document. It states the Boogaloo movement believes ""an impending insurgency against the government is forthcoming, and some believe they should accelerate the timeline with armed, anti-government actions leading to a civil war"". Members of the movement are calling for the âstormingâ of state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday - and on the day itself. Who are the Boogaloo Bois? The FBI is currently reviewing over 40,000 digital media tips received from the public in recent days, after it appealed for help identifying rioters who joined the Capitol unrest. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Khairi Saadallah admitted three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder A killer who stabbed three men to death in a Reading park has been handed a whole-life jail term. Khairi Saadallah murdered James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and 39-year-old Joe Ritchie-Bennett, in June last year in Forbury Gardens. London's Old Bailey previously heard the 26-year-old ""executed"" the men as an ""act of religious jihad"". Passing sentence Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said it was a ""ruthless and brutal"" terror attack. Saadallah, who admitted the murders, had also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of three other men who were also in the park. The judge said the victims ""had no chance to react, let alone defend themselves"". (L-R) David Wails, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and James Furlong were pronounced dead at the scene He said he was sure the attack ""involved a substantial degree of premeditation or planning"" and was carried out ""for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause"". BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson, who was in court, said the families of James Furlong and David Wails were present, while Joseph Ritchie-Bennett's loved ones watched via a link from America. Saadallah showed no emotion as Mr Justice Sweeney went through his sentencing remarks. On the afternoon of 20 June, the park was busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England. Andrew Cafe, who witnessed the stabbings, said he saw Saadallah wielding the ""biggest kitchen knife"" and charging towards him shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". Pharmaceutical manager Mr Ritchie-Bennett and teacher Mr Furlong died from single stab wounds to their necks, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed once in the back. Despite treatment from paramedics and doctors, all three friends, who were members of the LGBT community, died at the scene. This video can not be played Witness Andrew Cafe visited Forbury Gardens for the first time since the attack Three other people - Nishit Nisudan, Patrick Edwards and Stephen Young - were also injured, before Saadallah threw away the knife and fled the scene, pursued by police. Following his arrest, Saadallah initially said he wanted to plead guilty to the ""jihad that I done"", but the prosecution claimed he later feigned mental illness in police interviews. At a previous hearing, the court heard he had developed an emotionally unstable and anti-social personality disorder, with his behaviour worsened by alcohol and cannabis misuse. But the judge said it was ""clear that the defendant did not, and does not, have any major mental illness"". Reading attack: 'We did all we could to save them' Reading killer left jail two weeks before attack Reading stabbings: Who were the victims? An examination of Saadallah's phone revealed an interest in extremist material, including images of the flag of Islamic State andJihadi John, the court previously heard. While at HMP Bullingdon in 2017, he was seen to associate with radical preacher Omar Brookes, who has connections with banned terrorist organisation Al-Muhajiroun. The court heard Saadallah, who arrived in Britain from Libya in 2012, had previously been involved with militias who had been part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, and was pictured handling weapons, including firearms. Since seeking asylum in Britain, he had been repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences, including theft and assault, between 2013 and 2020. This video can not be played CCTV cameras captured Khairi Saadallah before and after the stabbing He briefly came to the attention of MI5 in 2019, but the information provided did not meet the threshold of investigation. Saadallah had been released from prison on 5 June, days before the attack, the court heard. On 17 June, he researched the location for his attack online and carried out reconnaissance in the park. The following day his probation officer alerted his mental health team over comments he made about magic. A day later, Saadallah contacted the crisis team himself, but when they visited he did not answer. Following concerns from his brother, police visited the killer the same day, but he told officers he was ""alright"" while he stood near a knife he bought from a supermarket. Andrew Wails said losing his brother had been devastating After the sentencing, James Furlong's father, Gary, said: ""The secretary of state needs to tell us why this guy wasn't put into some form of detention centre before they could deport him. ""He was not safe to be released back on the streets."" Referring to the fact that Saadallah had been visited by police the night before the attack, Mr Furlong said: ""Given the volume of crimes he's committed and the information that they had on him, for an assessment to be done the night before to say that he's not a danger to the public - it is beyond me."" He described Mr Furlong, originally from Liverpool, as ""a lovely man, loved by his family, idolised by his mother"". David Wails' brother Andrew said: ""For us as a family it's been devastating to lose our much loved son, brother and uncle."" In a statement, the Bennett family described Mr Ritchie-Bennett as a ""devoted and loving husband"" and ""a man who cared strongly about family"". The park had been busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, described Saadallah as ""a committed jihadist"". She said: ""He has caused unspeakable hurt and distress to the families of the three men who were brutally murdered as they were relaxing and enjoying socialising with friends on a Saturday evening. ""I'm sure there will also be lasting effects on those who were injured in the attack, who were fortunate not to have been even more seriously harmed."" Reading Borough Council leader Jason Brock described the attacks as ""horrific"" and ""senseless"" and said a permanent memorial to the victims was planned.

"This video can not be played Health Minister Vaughan Gething aims to offer all adults a jab by the autumn. All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid will be offered a vaccine by spring, under new Welsh Government plans. A vaccine strategy unveiled by Health Minister Vaughan Gething aims to offer all adults a jab by the autumn. It comes after criticism that therollout of the vaccine has been slower than in other parts of the UK. The latest figures show 86,039 doses had been administered by 22:00 GMT on Sunday. A total of 327,000 doses - 280,000 of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 47,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - have now been delivered to the Welsh NHS. The figures mean 2.7% of Wales population has so far been vaccinated - compared to just over 4% in Northern Ireland, about 3.5% in England and 3% in Scotland. Q&A: When will I get the Covid-19 vaccines? Wales has given 70,000 of 275,000 vaccine doses UK at 'perilous moment' in Covid pandemic, says PM Across the UK nearly 400,000 second doses have been administered, including 374,613 in England, 79 in Wales, 13,949 in Northern Ireland and, as of January 3, 36 in Scotland. Mr Gething admitted the rest of the UK had ""gone slightly faster than we have"", but said the latest vaccinations figures showed a ""significant acceleration"" in the rollout. The Welsh Conservatives accused the government of a ""stuttering start"", while Plaid Cymru said the plan was ""late in the day"". Everyone over 70, all care home residents and staff, and front-line NHS and social care workers will be offered a jab by mid-February, under similar timescales to other UK nations. This 82-year-old woman was one of 100 to receive her vaccine at a special clinic in Swansea on Saturday The Welsh Government's vaccination plans aim to cover 2.5 million people by September, with vaccines supplied by the UK government. Mr Gething said: ""Delivering this vaccination programme to the people in Wales is a huge task but an enormous amount of work is going on to make it a success. ""We are making good progress with thousands more people being vaccinated every day."" The plan sets out a series of ""milestones"" for the vaccine rollout in Wales - all depending on the supply of vaccines approved for use. At a press conference, Mr Gething said the government aimed to vaccinate: all Welsh Ambulance Service staff by 18 January all those living and working in care homes by the end of January the rest of the top four priority groups - front-line health and social care staff, everyone over 70 and people who are extremely clinically vulnerable - by mid-February everyone over 50 and those at greater risk because they have a underlying health condition by the spring all ""eligible adults"" by the autumn Mr Gething said 700,000 people would be vaccinated by mid-February. According to the plan, the number of GPs' surgeries delivering vaccines will be increased from around 100 to more than 250 by the end of January. The number of mass vaccination centres will increase in the next couple of weeks to 35, according to Welsh Government's plan. One of those is Margam Orangery, in Neath Port Talbot, where about 500 people will be vaccinated each day. At the press conference, Mr Gething defendedthe UK-wide decision to increase the gapbetween giving the two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and said it would ""avoid more deaths"". ""Each of the vaccines provide a high level of protection against harm from coronavirus. That's really good news for all of us,"" he added. Wales 'ready to vaccinate at a higher rate' Wales last in UK nations as 50,000 vaccinated Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh Government should have a vaccinations minister who ""gets up in the morning thinking about vaccinations and goes to bed thinking about vaccinations"". He said such a move would help the government recover from a ""stuttering start"" to the vaccines programme. Mr Davies said the government needed ""focus and direction to drive this forward"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the strategy but said it was ""late in the day"". Mr Price said many people, including his own parents, wanted clarity: ""My parents, who are in their 80s, have been told their surgery won't have the ability to vaccinate them for another three weeks, yet the GP surgery next door is starting this week."" Larger supplies of the Oxford jab will be needed to speed up vaccinations Daniel Davies, BBC Wales political correspondent The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is crucial to ensuring everyone aged over 70 can have at least one jab by Valentine's Day. Health boards plan to use reserves of the Pfizer vaccine, but they alone will not reach the Welsh Government's first milestone. To speed things up, bigger supplies of the Oxford vaccine are needed. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine however, the stock is not held by the Welsh Government. Instead, it is delivered directly to the frontline - including GPs and community pharmacies - by Public Health England. Around 24,000 Oxford doses arrived in Wales last week; 26,000 are due this week; and another 80 to 100,000 are expected to arrive in four batches next week. If the mid-February milestone is reached, attention then turns to the over-50s and younger people whose health puts them at greater risk. They can expect a dose by the Spring, but discussions are continuing between the four UK nations to nail down a more specific date. Dr Helen Alefounder is a GP in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county and part of a team that administered 400 vaccines at care comes last week after receiving the vaccine herself on Wednesday. ""Between us and the surgery next door that we're working with we've got just shy of 20,000 patients to vaccinate,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""It's an absolutely huge task, it's really scary, but we are really keen and committed to get it done because everybody is sick of lockdown and let's be honest, everybody wants life to return to as normal as possible and the only way we're going to do that is to mass vaccinate people."" A mass-vaccination centre has been set up at Margam Orangery near Port Talbot Other GPsurgeries have posted on social media,externalthat they have not received as many doses of the vaccine as promised. Vaccination numbers will now be published daily and the number of mass vaccination centres will rise from 22 to 35. The vaccination plan also suggests pharmacies could be used to deploy the vaccine. Dr Gill Richardson, the senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccination programme in Wales, said GPs were ""raring to go"" to get the vaccine distributed. She said the model for Wales' vaccination programme was focused around the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, which was approved in late December and ""much larger quantities"" were expected. She also said: ""I know it's very difficult if you haven't had a letter and you're feeling anxious but you are going to be approached and when you're approached we'd like it to be as soon as possible and as convenient as possible to you."" Michael Sullivan, 93, from Radyr, Cardiff, is one of those who is yet to receive his letter. He said: ""I hear of all these other people having their second jabs and nobody's even thought of contacting me to say I'm going to have one in the first place. It's a bit depressing. It makes me think somebody's not doing what they should be doing. ""It gets stressful more easily, that's another thing one has to bare in mind - it's going to save my life."" Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. Elen Jones, the Wales director of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said community pharmacists were ""willing and skilled to help deliver the vaccination programme, as they do with flu every year"". She added pharmacists could help deliver the vaccine ""at a more local level"". Welsh ministers have been under intense pressure since it became clear that Wales was lagging behind every other home nation in the initial weeks of vaccine rollout. It's still not clear why that should be the case - the logistical challenges of rollout and the change in advice over the time period between first and second doses apply across the UK, not just to Wales. The health minister says that there has already been ""a significant step-up in delivery"". The test of that will be whether the system in Wales can meet the delivery goals set out in the vaccination strategy - which (as for the other home nations) also rely on a regular and sufficient supply of vaccine.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says exemption from quarantine travel requirements for elite sport are to be reviewed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged football clubs not to ""abuse"" the privileges they are afforded while the rest of Scotland is in lockdown. Players and staff from Celtic FC are having to self-isolate after one tested positive for Covid-19 on return from a mid-season training camp in Dubai. Ms Sturgeon said she had doubts about whether the trip was really necessary. And she said ""everyone, including football, should be erring on the side of caution"" amid a rise in infections. Scottish football below Championship levelis to be suspended for three weeksin light of the current lockdown, with Scottish Cup and lower league ties to be rescheduled. Depleted Celtic draw with Hibernian How Celtic's Dubai trip unravelled Top flight football in Scotland is continuing while most Scots are subject to a ""stay at home"" order due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Celtic's home fixture against Hibernian went ahead on Monday evening, despite the club having lost 13 players and three staff to Covid-19 issues. Defender Christopher Jullien tested positive for the virus on return from the club's training camp in Dubai, with others including the club's manager Neil Lennon being forced to isolate as close contacts. Ms Sturgeon said she was ""disappointed and frustrated"" that her daily coronavirus briefing was again being ""dominated by football"". Celtic trained in Scotland on Saturday after returning from Dubai She said she had doubts about whether Celtic's trip ""was really essential"" and whether rules were strictly adhered to, saying it was for the footballing authorities to decide if further action was necessary. The first minister issued a warning to clubs that they must stick to the rules set out for them while the rest of the populace is subject to tight restrictions. She said: ""Football and elite sport more generally enjoys a number of privileges right now that the rest of us don't have. These privileges include the right to go to overseas training camps and be exempt from quarantine on return. ""It is really vital, obviously for public health reasons but also I think out of respect for the rest of the population living under really heavy restrictions, that these privileges are not abused."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross is an assistant referee in the game. He said that at a time when people are staying at home football games were something many looked forward to. Mr Ross said: ""We don't want to see the whole of Scottish football affected by the actions of one club."" He also called for financial support to be made available to clubs in the Scottish lower leagues and Scottish Cup who had had their games suspended for three weeks. Celtic manager Neil Lennon is among those who are self-isolating Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was currently in ""the most perilous and serious position since the start of the pandemic"", with a record number of people in hospital with Covid-19. She said everyone should be doing their utmost not to add to pressure on the health services by following the rules. She said: ""This whole episode should underline how serious the situation we are in now is. Everyone including football should be erring on the side of caution. ""I know fans of other clubs feel very strongly that the whole of football should not pay the price for the actions of any one club, and I agree with that. ""But of course a situation like this does make it essential for us to review the rules - including those around travel exemptions - and that's what we will be doing. As we do, I do hope that Celtic themselves will reflect seriously on all of this."" Ms Sturgeon cited photographs which emerged of players socialising in Dubai, but Celtic's assistant manager John Kennedy saidthese created a ""false picture""and that there had been ""minor slip-ups"" at worst. The club had previously claimed the government had given permission for the trip to go ahead, but Ms Sturgeon said it had only provided guidance to the footballing authorities on the rules. She said: ""It's not our role to give approval or not to what a football club is doing."" A statement posted on the Celtic website said that ""the reality is that a case could well have occurred had the team remained in Scotland"". It added: ""Celtic has done everything it can to ensure we have in place the very best procedures and protocols. From the outset of the pandemic, Celtic has worked closely with the Scottish government and Scottish football and we will continue to do so."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Pupils across Scotland have been experiencing problems accessing Microsoft Teams as the majority move to home learning. A number of schools, pupils and parents have reported the technology running slowly or not at all. It is one of the main platforms being used for remote learning with schools shut to most pupils until at least the beginning of February. Microsoft Teams tweeted that the issue was being investigated. A Microsoft spokesperson said: ""Our engineers are working to resolve difficulties accessing Microsoft Teams that some customers are experiencing."" When pressed on whether demand as a result of home schooling was causing the issue, Microsoft declined to comment. Fears over pupils missing out on online learning Pupils face disparities in remote learning First Minister Nicola Sturgeon highlighted the problem during her daily coronavirus briefing. ""This is not an issue that is unique to Scotland or indeed unique to schools, but I understand Microsoft is currently working to address it,"" she said. ""More generally I don't underestimate how difficult this is both for young people learning away from friendsâ¦ and for parents to juggle home schooling with working."" Ms Sturgeon was also asked about problems which were being experienced by users of digital learning platform Glow. She replied: ""It is not an issue with Glow. It is affecting Glow, but the core issue is not with Glowâ¦  the issue is with Microsoft Teams."" Two schools in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, said the problem was a ""national issue"" although Renfrew High School urged pupils experiencing difficulties not to panic. Clyde Valley High School tweeted: ""Our online learning provision begins today for all of our pupils. Due to the very high demand for Microsoft Teams across Scotland, there may be issues initially getting logged on or accessing some files. ""This is a national issue on the site and may take a little time to rectify."" Coltness High School said: ""Unfortunately it appears Microsoft Teams is struggling to cope with the traffic this morning. ""This is across Scotland and not isolated to Coltness. Pupils and staff are having difficulty loading files. We have reported the issue and hopefully this will be resolved soon."" Edinburgh City Council have texted all parents saying: ""There is a city-wide problem with Microsoft Teams this morning. Please be patient as the council is working to resolve it.""

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service.

The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list. Bonnie Watson Coleman is a Democrat congresswoman for New Jersey US Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman
says she has tested positive for Covid-19 â and believes she caught it while
sheltering from rioters in the Capitol building last Wednesday. âI received a positive test
result for Covid-19, and am home resting at this time. While I am experiencing
mild, cold-like symptoms, I remain in good spirits and will continue to work on
behalf of my constituents,âshe said,external. The Capitolâs physician Dr Brian
Moynihan warned on Sunday that âmany members of the House community were in
protective isolation in the large room â some for several hours,"" and said âindividuals
may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infectionâ. An internal FBI bulletin is warning state and local law enforcement that they should prepare for violence by right-wing extremists on Sunday, according to US media who've seen the document. The FBI memo - reportedly issued a week before last week's attack on the US Capitol - identifies credible threats to the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols, from 16 January to 20 January. A violent far-right group known as the Boogaloo is behind these organising efforts, according to the document. It states the Boogaloo movement believes ""an impending insurgency against the government is forthcoming, and some believe they should accelerate the timeline with armed, anti-government actions leading to a civil war"". Members of the movement are calling for the âstormingâ of state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday - and on the day itself. Who are the Boogaloo Bois? The FBI is currently reviewing over 40,000 digital media tips received from the public in recent days, after it appealed for help identifying rioters who joined the Capitol unrest. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Parler has hit back after Amazon pulled support for its so-called ""free speech"" social network. Parler is suing the tech giant,accusing it of breaking anti-trust laws by removing it,external. Parler had been reliant on the tech giant's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing service to provide its alternative to Twitter. The platform was popular among supporters of Donald Trump, although the president is not a user. Amazon took the action after finding dozens of posts on the service that it said encouraged violence. In response, the platform has asked a federal judge to order Amazon to reinstate it. ""AWS's decision to effectively terminate Parler's account is apparently motivated by political animus,"" the complaint reads. ""It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter."" Amazon has issued a statement in response. ""There is no merit to these claims,"" it said. ""AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler's right to determine for itself what content it will allow. However, it is clear that there is significant content on Parler that encourages and incites violence against others, and that Parler is unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which is a violation of our terms of service. ""We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening."" Examples Amazon had provided included posts calling for the killing of Democrats, Muslims, Black Lives Matter leaders, and mainstream media journalists. Google and Apple had already removed Parler from their app stores towards the end of last week saying it had failed to comply with their content-moderation requirements. However, it had still been accessible via the web - although visitors had complained of being unable to create new accounts over the weekend, without which it was not possible to view its content. Parler has been online since 2018, and may return if it can find an alternative host. However, chief executive John Matzetold Fox News on Sunday that,external""every vendor from text message services to email providers to our lawyers all ditched us too"". ""We're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we're having a lot of trouble because every vendor we talk to says they won't work with us because if Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, they won't,"" he added. AWS's move is the latest in a series of actions affecting social media following the rioting on Capitol Hill last week. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ Facebook and Twitter have also banned President Trump's accounts on their platforms,citing concerns that he might incite further violence. Parler's users included the Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who had led an effort in the Senate to delay certifying Joe Biden's electoral college victory. He had about five million followers on the platform - more than his tally on Twitter. Parler's app now shows an error message and its website is offline ""Why should a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires have a monopoly on political speech?""he tweeted over the weekend,external. Parler's downfall appears to have benefited Gab - another ""free speech"" social network that is popular with far-right commentators. Ithas claimed to have,external""gained more users in the past two days than we did in our first two years of existing"". Parler has long been a home for what you might call untouchables, people who had been excluded from mainstream services for offences such as blatant racism or incitement to violence. During a brief excursion onto the site over the weekend, I observed plenty of examples of such behaviour, with users exhibiting vile anti-Semitism, displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika and uttering incoherent threats against those they perceive to be enemies of America. But as Amazon's deadline approached something like panic took hold, with users desperately urging their followers to join them on other platforms. Most seemed to accept that Parler was doomed, while vowing to continue their fight elsewhere. ""Well this is the end,"" wrote one user, who proclaimed his support for the American Nazi Party.

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. Read more: Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman heralded as 'a hero' A majority of voters say Trump should resign, according toa new opinion poll from Quinnipiac University,external, with 56% respondents saying that they hold Trump responsible for the riot on Capitol Hill. The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.

the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working

"Boris Johnson - pictured here in 2013 - has long been a fan of cycling Boris Johnson has been criticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Street to go cycling during lockdown. The Evening Standard,externalreported the prime minister had been spotted in the Olympic Park in East London on Sunday. Government advice allows people to exercise outside, but says you should not travel outside your local area. A No 10 spokesman would not confirm if Mr Johnson had been driven to the park or cycled there, but said the PM had complied with Covid-19 guidelines. Labour's Andy Slaughter said: ""Once again it is do as I say, not as I do, from the prime minister."" The Hammersmith MP added: ""London has some of the highest infection rates in the country. Boris Johnson should be leading by example."" In response to the criticism, a Downing Street source told the BBC: ""The PM has exercised within the Covid rules and any suggestion to the contrary is wrong."" Women on exercise trip 'surrounded by police' 'Concern' over Covid rule breakers in supermarkets What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? A woman told the PA news agency she had seen the prime minister in the park: ""He was leisurely cycling with another guy with a beanie hat and chatting, while around four security guys, possibly more, cycled behind them. ""Considering the current situation with Covid I was shocked to see him cycling around looking so care-free. ""Also, considering he's advising everyone to stay at home and not leave their area, shouldn't he stay in Westminster and not travel to other boroughs?"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at Monday's Downing Street press conference whether travelling seven miles for a cycle ride was within the rules. Mr Hancock said: ""It is OK, if you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""It is OK to go for a long walk or a cycle ride or to exercise, but stay local."" The issue of travelling for exercise was highlighted at the weekend after two women said they were surrounded by police and fine Â£200 after driving five miles from home to take a walk. Derbyshire Police have nowdropped the fine and apologised to the women, but the incident led to a debate over the guidance. Government advice for England says you can leave your home to exercise, but adds: ""This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area."" The guidance adds: ""Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live."" In Scotland, the advice is more precise, saying exercise can be taken if it ""starts and finishes at the same place, which can be up to five miles from the boundary of your local authority area"". Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who represents a constituency in the Lake District, has written to the PM calling for clearer guidance on exercise similar to that in Scotland. He wrote: ""On the one hand, our local police force here in Cumbria are reporting that people... have travelled hundreds of miles to take their exercise in the Lake District. ""And on the other hand, I have constituents writing to me, worried whether they will be punished for driving five minutes up the road to go for a walk in their local park."" Mr Farron added: ""We need a solution that clearly deters people from making lengthy trips and potentially spreading the virus, but also that doesn't discourage people from keeping fit and healthy.""

The BBC Click team are also hard at work on some hands-on videos, after getting some of the start-ups taking part in CES to send over their prototypes. We leave you for now with Chris Fox's first look at a pair of tuneable glasses, which he thinks resemble a pair of jam jars on his face. Leo KelionTechnology desk editor  By becoming a digital event, CES presented the opportunity to rethink its keynote speeches. The only thing holding companies back was their imagination and budgets. What we got with Verizon's hour-long event was a series of Zoom-like video calls, typical corporate press videos and abstract backdrop graphics behind the telecoms firm's chief executive Hans Vestberg. What I was hoping for was that it would present new compelling uses for 5G - the theme of the event. Instead the examples presented - streamed VR graphics, augmented reality objects based on museum scans - could just as well have been delivered by wi-fi with a decent broadband connection. Yes - a wi-fi connection might not always be available when out, but most of these weren't activities you'd engage in while wandering about. There were cases given that would benefit from 5G - robot dogs for emergency responders and package-delivering drones - but these aren't things that most members of the public need to upgrade their own handsets for at this time. Things weren't helped by the fact the event culminated in an awkward, obviously pre-scripted conversation between Mr Vestberg and members of the band Black Pumas about how 5G will let music-lovers watch performances via their phones with the ability to pick between camera angles ""to focus on their favourite band members"". The Black Pumas followed the script on stage, before giving a more entertaining performance of their music To be fair, with so many people stuck indoors, this is a tough time to sell the public on the need for faster mobile data. And there were fans of the presentation on social media. But after a long day, this felt like a pretty underwhelming way to end what had been an entertaining start to CES 2021. Allow Twitter content?

Samsung's Galaxy Chromebook 2 was announced ahead of the show Robots and televisions aside, the CES tech show is also known for new laptops and other PC (personal computer) tech announcements. Many of the these, including prices, will be announced in the coming days - but we already know there are new models from LG, HP and Samsung, among many others. It's a good time to be in the business. Analyst firm Canalys has just reported that shipments within the global PC market shot up 25% in 2020. That might not be surprising, with so many people buying extra work machines - but there was a big shortage of PC parts earlier this year, making the growth even more notable. Canalys says the numbers mark the sector's biggest annual growth since 2010, and it was ""singlehandedly driven by notebooks and mobile workstations"". ""It is going to be extremely difficult to write off the PC as some of us did a few years ago. PCs are here to stay,â analyst Rushabh Doshi said. There was one exception: desktop shipments fell by 20% - perhaps because business customers stopped buying new PCs for offices. Nvidia, atitan,externalin the graphics card and artificial intelligence world, has a gaming event scheduled for Tuesday evening, where industry watchers expect its latest mobile graphics cards to be shown off. The desktop versions of those cards have been in tight supply since they launched last year. Leo KelionTechnology desk editor  Sony's slick CES presentation didn't unveil many new products. But it delivered a fascinating look behind the scenes at two cutting-edge ways the firm is creating video content. The first involved the use of a giant screen which is matched with movement-sensors on a camera to create a fake backdrop that shifts in turn with the lens. A similar technique was pioneered by Industrial Light & Magic and used in the Star Wars spin-off series The Mandalorian, but this opens the door to other filmmakers. The screens involved use Sony's Crystal LED technology, which the firm first unveiled at CES in 2012, but has been unable to bring low down enough in price to take mainstream. In effect, this is its version of micro-LED tech, using millions of tiny light emitting diodes (LEDs) to match the number of pixels. The result is much greater brightness and contrast than a normal LCD or OLED display would be capable of. The background footage moves in time with the camera to aid the illusion Until now, the firm has marketed the tech at building owners wanting the ultimate video walls. But this has the potential to help film and advert-makers place actors within environments they can see, rather than relying on greenscreen effects. The second innovation was the creation of an ""immersive reality"" performance, which uses body sensors to create a highly-detailed animated version of an artist. Madison Beer recorded her performance in a motion-capture suit It was demoed by the singer-songwriter Madison Beer. Motion capture has been used for years to add special effects to characters in movies and to place real-world actors into video games. But the aim here is to create a lifelike representation of a performer on stage at a concert. The footage shown didn't quite escape the ""uncanny valley"" - there's still some way to go before we can't tell the difference between a real person and even a highly detailed avatar. But it's easy to imagine that the tech being more impressive when viewed in virtual reality, where users can move about and choose their view.  The computer-generated image looks less real the closer you get to the performer Until now, VR apps of concerts have either offered a pick of different static camera locations or involved much lower-resolution characters. With Covid meaning it's impossible for artists to tour, this second-best experience could be very timely when it's offered to PlayStation VR headsets and other devices soon. Sony has formally unveiled Airpeak, its own drone. The product was first teased back in November. Now, the company has shown it in flight, chasing a speeding car. It revealed that it will be compatible with Sony's Alpha camera series. But we've get to get a price, specs or other release details. Other drones can use Sony cameras with the right fittings - but Sony's pairing may indicate it is marketing to owners of its existing cameras, which are popular with photographers and video creators. Sony's bid for the drone market comes at an opportune time. The dominant force in the industry, DJI, has found itself subject to US sanctions. DJI was added to a US trade blacklist along with other Chinese firms in December. Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The fact CES is virtual this year means attendees cannot put the toilet to the test For the second time in about two hours there's news of a fresh development in toilet tech. Japanese firm Totohas announced a lavatory,externalthat checks each user's health every time they make use of it. The company says the device uses a range of sensors to scan each person's body and its ""key outputs"" to provide a status update. In case there's any doubt, the press release makes clear this is a polite reference to poo. ""A wealth of wellness data can be collected from faecal matter,"" it says. In addition, readings are taken from users' skin, where it comes into contact with the seat. An accompanying app promises to help owners track their mental and physical status and recommend lifestyle changes. Toto envisages giving people meal recommendations based on analysis of their waste Although it remains a concept for the time being, the firm says it intends to start offering an internet-connected version of the appliance ""in the next several years"". It may sound amusing, but there's potentially huge benefits in finding a way to track people's health without making them put on a smartwatch or other wearable. The question is whether such devices could make their way into the workplace. Some companies already make staff carry out urine tests for illegal drugs, and the Covid-19 pandemic has encouraged the use ofproximity sensorsin the office to ensure employees stay far enough apart. Governments have also analysed wastewater todetect signs of local coronavirus outbreaks,external, albeit by taking samples from city sewage rather than toilets. And it's not inconceivable that in the future we could be asked to use smart toilets to check for signs of infection - or to help reduce companies' health insurance bills. CES press day has a couple of big name events left to go. At 22:00GMT Sony will unveil its latest line of televisions and possibly new camera tech. Last year it also had a car - will there be further surprises this time round? And then closing off the day at 23:30, US mobile network Verizon - which owns Yahoo among other subsidiaries - will host the first of the tech expo's keynote addresses. Chief executive Hans Vestberg is promising to focus his speech on 5G - hopefully he'll have some new uses for the tech beyond faster downloads. Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Michael Bay delivered one of CES's most memorable moments when he walked off Samsung's stage mid-presentation in 2014 One of the oddities of this year's CES is that all the sessions are starting and finishing on time, and there are no queues involved. For those who have suffered CES press days in the past, they involved long snaking lines of journalists and industry analysts winding their ways along hotel conference hall corridors - and then there's a crush once the doors opened at the next space. Then once an event is over, you have to run off to the next unveiling and do it all again. The downside is the lack of buzz and lost conversations after each presentation when we got to compare notes - Twitter posts don't really cut it. And with things running so smoothly, there are no Hollywood directors having meltdowns after a teleprompter gets stuck,or robots malfunctioning on stage. Marketing chiefs may find that reassuring, but one of the appeals of covering CES is the danger of  prototype tech being put to the test. When you know there won't be any hitches, the temptation is to pay less attention to what's going on. This video can not be played LG's Cloi robot repeatedly malfunctioned on stage in 2018 One of the more unusual gadgets unveiled to coincide with CES is the Chamberlain myQ Pet Portal: a smart, Bluetooth-enabled doggie door with a price tag of $2,999 (Â£2,217). It's much nicer than most human-sized ones. Instead of being a two-way flap that lets wind and uninvited visitors into your home, this device is designed to replace an entire door. The product is a door-within-a-door, which opens when it detects a special collar worn by a four-legged friend. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Or it can be manually controlled by an app when you're away - so you decide when to let Rover outside. And it locks once he's back in. The hefty asking price will make it an instant no for many - but the makers optimistically note in a press release that it's ""less than half of what many pet owners spend annually on a dog-walker"". Tech site The Verge has done an extensive interview with the creators,external, who have won one of CES' innovation awards. CES isn't just about screens and robots. After unveiling a shower head with a built-in smart assistant last year, the US bathroom specialist Kohler is back at CES with another ""smart"" way to wash that costs $16,000 (Â£11,720). The Stillness bath features an ""infinity overflow"" facility, whereby water pours over the side to be reheated and then recirculated back to the tub. It also creates a fog effect as well as pumping out scents and soothing sounds. Plus - of course - it's internet-connected, so you can control all the features via an app. Or if you're worried about getting your smartphone wet, you can shout at Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa to do your bidding. Just be careful about which family members have access to the same account - or you run the risk of someone switching on the cold tap remotely. Kohler also unveiled both a toilet you can flush and a bathroom tap that turns on at the wave of a hand - which might be hygienic, but they also risk making the bathroom feel a bit like going to a public lavatory. You can't buy this mask - LG created the image to show how the technology of a buliker contraption works  The pandemic hasn't just changed how CES is delivered - it's changed what's being pushed by some of the firms. Earlier, we saw Samsung's exercise app for TVs and robot vacuum cleaner - but hygiene in particular has been an odd focus for many. LG, for example, spent the top of its main press conference not on its flagship TVs - but on ""making your life better and cleaner"". It heavily featured its portable air purifiers called Puricare, including a version that can be worn on the face like a mask. The product was announced in August last year, but it still made a top spot on the tech firm's main annual showcase. And then there's the AirPop Active+ Halo, a $150 mask with a smart sensor in it. The sensor - which the company calls a ""halo"", connects to smartphone app to monitor breathing, air quality, and whether the filter needs to be replaced. It's due to be released in North America soon. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

But these companies aren't making a direct claim that their products protect against coronavirus - because evidence about whether or not it does is patchy. Which? magazine took a look at the topic in March 2020,external, as the global outbreak saw sellers advertise air purification as a way to fight the virus. Viruses are extremely small, but a top-quality air filter can in fact capture some of them. But Which? concluded: ""Crucially, though, none of this has been scientifically proven yet, and, in the real world, a lot depends on factors"". TheUS Environmental Protection Agency says pretty much the same thing,external. ""When used properly"", some filters can ""help reduce airborne contaminants including viruses"", it says. But it's only an aid, and ""by itself, air cleaning or filtration is not enough to protect people from exposure to the virus that causes Covid-19.""  This video can not be played BBC Click's Lara Lewington tried on the AO Air face mask at CES 2020 While the new PlayStation and Xbox consoles dominated the gaming news towards the end of 2020, another force is on the rise. Cloud gaming - where titles run on remote computer servers and are streamed via the internet to the player - is (very) slowly catching on. The downside is it requires a fast internet connection, and there can be a little lag. The upside is you don't need powerful hardware at home to play games in their full glory. Google is one of the major players involved, thanks to its Stadia service. And it has just announced a tie-up with LG, which will see Stadia run within the South Korean firm's TVs. LG is the second biggest-selling TV brand after Samsung. Effectively, it means households will be able to play more than 100 titles - including Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin's Creed: Valhalla - by downloading an app to their television instead of needing an additional set-top box or dongle, although they will still need a controller. This isn't the first time something like this has been tried - at one point LG and Samsung were set to build in Gaikai's cloud gaming service into their TVs â until Sony bought it to form the basis of its PlayStation Now service. The move could give Stadia a leg up against rivals such as Amazon's Luna and Nvidia's GeForce Now - assuming further tie-ups aren't announced later at CES. Meanwhile, LG Display - the division of the South Korean firm that makes screens for a number of companies - has shown off some of its latest screen tech, including a display that bends to become curved for gaming and then straightens up again for watching TV.

While we wait for the next big announcements, here's what CES usually looks like. In 2020, before the first lockdown in the US, the BBC's Zoe Kleinman was there to roam the halls and meet some people - with not a socially distanced interview in sight. This video can not be played CES 2020: The biggest surprises from big tech at the show Beyond the big brands at CES Chris FoxTechnology reporter This video can not be played CES 2021: Tuneable spectacles let you adjust your lenses  CES is not just about the tech giants. Every year there are hundreds of start-ups showcasing their gadgets too. On a typical walk through CESâs Eureka Park, you can spot a dozen interesting and intriguing products or prototypes. This year, it's been more of a trawl through a hefty spreadsheet â although it has yielded the usual mix of the odd and ingenious. US start-up Hudway has produced a head-up display that can stick on any car dashboard.   You pop your smartphone underneath and the angled glass reflects the information as though it is overlaid on the road ahead. Into-See has created ornate furniture with a black glass panel that turns semi-transparent, so you can see what is inside. LG showed off a similar feature on one of its fridges last year, which is now a product you can buy - though ultimately it strikes me as something that has niche appeal. One practical idea is a pair of glasses by Voy, which have adjustable lenses to suit a variety of prescriptions. The specs worked well â although they were much, much chunkier than my regular glasses. Going through the spreadsheet, it definitely felt as though there were fewer gems to be discovered than usual. Many exhibitors had not provided any information about their products or even a link to their website â while others did not have their prototypes ready in time for the show. Perhaps with the move online, companies have taken a more relaxed approach towards deadlines. But after the year we have all had, I canât say I blame them. Futuristic fold-up TV and phone maker TCL showed off its own bendable display technology at CES, with a 17in (43.2cm) printed OLED scrolling display. Unlike anything we've seen in the phone or tablet market, the product looked like an old-world written paper scroll. The company says the display is just 0.18mm deep - about twice as thick as general-use office paper. Unfortunately, there was no mention of commercial availability or any prices - making this a concept display only. It was announced by TCL's CSOT division rather than the part of the company that makes smartphones. The firm also showed off smaller rolling display, which it said could be used to expand a phone's display from 6.7in to 7.8in ""at the touch of a button"". Rollable displays could be the next big thing for the smartphone market after the appearance of foldable displays in the past few years. LG's press conference earlier today also teased a device using the tech. But concerns over their durability and price - not to mention the hassle factor of having to open the screen before using an app - may prove obstacles to widespread adoption. Opening the online show earlier, host Justine Ezarik - better known on YouTube as iJustine - talked about how bad the queues for taxis are in Vegas at CES every year. But she still misses them, she said - because of the people she'd met in those line. And Vegas is missing the CES attendees, too. Allow Twitter content?

Usually, getting a hotel in the city at this time of the year is tricky, with hotels heavily booked and rooms costing hundreds of dollars - but now, they can be had for knock-down prices.

Local ABC affiliate KTNV reports that the big Las Vegas resorts on the strip are broadcasting messages of support for the event, hoping it will be back in 2022. Starting tonight, about two dozen major resorts will use their displays to show the message: ""We miss you and can't wait to welcome you back in 2022."" A Tesla-beating touchscreen? Mercedes-Benz has announced what it's calling a ""hyperscreen"", which will replace the entire front dashboard on its cars with a smartscreen. The 141cm-wide (55in) display can be much more flexible than existing solutions, it claims. For example, it has a system where the passenger can watch a movie on the car's screen - with Bluetooth headphone support - while the driver isn't distracted by anything on the centre panel. Another feature, titled ""travel knowledge"", will offer interesting information about nearby landmarks when asked - or identify a restaurant as you pass by if you miss the sign. It is actually made out of three screens, but Mercedes says they have made it to look ""apparently seamlessly merged"". The ""hyperscreen"" will come first to the car maker's upcoming all-electric EQS models, and be rolled out to other vehicles later. Gigantic displays are a theme in the car world - Tesla led the way with its 17in (43cm) tablet dashboards. And in past years at CES, the Chinese start-up Byton has shown off plans to build a modelwith a 48in (121cm) curved display, while Sony unveiled a concept car with an ultra-widepanoramic infotainment screen of its own. The challenge is to ensure all those illuminated pixels don't create a distraction to what's on the road ahead - at least until fully autonomous vehicles come of age.   Giving smartphones a second life Buried among Samsung's other announcements was an idea with what to do with your old phones - transform them into smart home devices. Galaxy Upcycling at Home, due to be released later this year, will let owners turn an old handset into a sound sensor or a light sensor, for example. As examples, the company showed phones being used as a baby monitor and a long-distance remote control to activate lights for pets at home alone. âThis is a vision of a better, more inclusive and sustainable future, and weâre working toward it every day,"" said Sandeep Rana, the firm's sustainability specialist. A lot of the carbon impact of devices is sunk into their manufacturing. Phone owners are already using their devices for longer before replacing them, but this initiative could prolong the life of devices even further. So far, the social media reaction to the initiative has been pretty positive. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It seems like every press release and announcement made after March last year had to remind us that the coronavirus existed (in case you forgot). So far, that trend is strong at CES 2021. So far, we've had: Expect more of this throughout the day. Samsung's press conference announced fridges, TVs, and more - but nothing for one of the firm's biggest sellers - smartphones. That's not an oversight - it's because the handsets are coming later this week. The Samsung Unpacked event is scheduled for 14 January at 15:00 GMT. According to the holding page, it will be about the Galaxy brand of smartphones. The promo image for Thursday's event features an obscured smartphone with what looks like three circles on it - but we'll have to wait until Thursday to learn more. Â© 2025 BBC.

This includes emergency treatment as well as treatment needed for a pre-existing condition. The new GHIC card is free and can be obtained viathe official GHIC website.,external Current European Health Insurance Cards (EHIC) are valid as long as they are in date, and can continue to be used when travelling to the EU. What's replacing the EHIC card? You don't need to apply for a GHIC until your current EHIC expires. People should apply at least two weeks before they plan to travel to ensure their card arrives on time. Health Minister Edward Argar said: ""Our deal with the EU ensures the right for our citizens to access necessary healthcare on their holidays and travels to countries in the EU will continue. ""The GHIC is a key element of the UK's future relationship with the EU and will provide certainty and security for all UK residents.""

"The UK economy will ""get worse before it gets better"" as the country battles the pandemic, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned. The chancellor told MPs the new national restrictions were necessary to control the spread of coronavirus. However, he said they would have a further significant economic impact, ""Even with the significant economic support we've provided, over 800,000 people have lost their job since February,"" he said. ""Sadly, we have not and will not be able to save every job and every business. ""But I am confident that our economic plan is supporting the finances of millions of people and businesses."" The chancellor said ""the road ahead will be tough"", but maintained that the government was ""taking the difficult but right long-term decisions for our country"". He said that fiscal stimulus provided so far amounted to more than Â£280bn, while 1.2 million employers had furloughed almost 10 million employees. At the same time, three million people had benefited from self-employment grants. Mr Sunak said he would ""bear in mind"" calls to extend business rate relief and provide further support for the hospitality sector at the Budget in March. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of being ""out of ideas"" and providing ""nothing new"". She said: ""The purpose of an update is to provide us with new information, not to repeat what we already know."" The chancellor's words reflect the fact that with a widespread lockdown, the first months of 2021 are likely to see a further contraction in the UK economy and probably an official double-dip recession. This reflects the physical shutdown nationwide of hospitality and retail, as well as the effect in the data of school shutdowns too. In addition, consumers and workers are likely to be more cautious as the vaccine starts to be rolled out. So this is a very odd sort of economic tripwire. The challenge in the next weeks and months gets bigger, although not as big as it was last April. But beyond that, there is the hope of something normal. The implication for the chancellor as he prepares a vital early March Budget, however, is further delay to the measures, such as tax rises, to deal with historic levels of pandemic government borrowing.

"Boris Johnson - pictured here in 2013 - has long been a fan of cycling Boris Johnson has been criticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Street to go cycling during lockdown. The Evening Standard,externalreported the prime minister had been spotted in the Olympic Park in East London on Sunday. Government advice allows people to exercise outside, but says you should not travel outside your local area. A No 10 spokesman would not confirm if Mr Johnson had been driven to the park or cycled there, but said the PM had complied with Covid-19 guidelines. Labour's Andy Slaughter said: ""Once again it is do as I say, not as I do, from the prime minister."" The Hammersmith MP added: ""London has some of the highest infection rates in the country. Boris Johnson should be leading by example."" In response to the criticism, a Downing Street source told the BBC: ""The PM has exercised within the Covid rules and any suggestion to the contrary is wrong."" Women on exercise trip 'surrounded by police' 'Concern' over Covid rule breakers in supermarkets What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? A woman told the PA news agency she had seen the prime minister in the park: ""He was leisurely cycling with another guy with a beanie hat and chatting, while around four security guys, possibly more, cycled behind them. ""Considering the current situation with Covid I was shocked to see him cycling around looking so care-free. ""Also, considering he's advising everyone to stay at home and not leave their area, shouldn't he stay in Westminster and not travel to other boroughs?"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at Monday's Downing Street press conference whether travelling seven miles for a cycle ride was within the rules. Mr Hancock said: ""It is OK, if you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""It is OK to go for a long walk or a cycle ride or to exercise, but stay local."" The issue of travelling for exercise was highlighted at the weekend after two women said they were surrounded by police and fine Â£200 after driving five miles from home to take a walk. Derbyshire Police have nowdropped the fine and apologised to the women, but the incident led to a debate over the guidance. Government advice for England says you can leave your home to exercise, but adds: ""This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area."" The guidance adds: ""Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live."" In Scotland, the advice is more precise, saying exercise can be taken if it ""starts and finishes at the same place, which can be up to five miles from the boundary of your local authority area"". Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who represents a constituency in the Lake District, has written to the PM calling for clearer guidance on exercise similar to that in Scotland. He wrote: ""On the one hand, our local police force here in Cumbria are reporting that people... have travelled hundreds of miles to take their exercise in the Lake District. ""And on the other hand, I have constituents writing to me, worried whether they will be punished for driving five minutes up the road to go for a walk in their local park."" Mr Farron added: ""We need a solution that clearly deters people from making lengthy trips and potentially spreading the virus, but also that doesn't discourage people from keeping fit and healthy.""

"The United Arab Emirates is being removed from the UK list of travel corridors amid a spike in Covid cases. That means anyone who arrives from the UAE after 04:00 GMT on Tuesday now needs to self-isolate for 10 days, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. UK officials say Covid cases have risen 52% in the UAE in the last seven days and cite ""a significant acceleration in the number of imported cases"". It comes after Scotland removed the UAE city Dubai from its safe travel list. The Foreign Office has also updated its advice to advise against all but essential travel to the emirates. The recent lockdown restrictions imposed across the UK mean leisure travel is currently banned. But the UAE has been in particular focus in recent weeks after a number of UKreality TV and social media stars posted photographs of themselves holidayingthere before the rules came into place. Who is still allowed to travel? How Celtic's Dubai trip unravelled Why Instagram is still full of influencers 'on holiday' Why is the UK bringing in travel testing? And a Celtic footballer tested positive for Covid-19 after the club took a trip to Dubai for a winter training camp. Celtic were allowed to go as a group under exemptions for elite athletes.

"Parler has hit back after Amazon pulled support for its so-called ""free speech"" social network. Parler is suing the tech giant,accusing it of breaking anti-trust laws by removing it,external. Parler had been reliant on the tech giant's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing service to provide its alternative to Twitter. The platform was popular among supporters of Donald Trump, although the president is not a user. Amazon took the action after finding dozens of posts on the service that it said encouraged violence. In response, the platform has asked a federal judge to order Amazon to reinstate it. ""AWS's decision to effectively terminate Parler's account is apparently motivated by political animus,"" the complaint reads. ""It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter."" Amazon has issued a statement in response. ""There is no merit to these claims,"" it said. ""AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler's right to determine for itself what content it will allow. However, it is clear that there is significant content on Parler that encourages and incites violence against others, and that Parler is unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which is a violation of our terms of service. ""We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening."" Examples Amazon had provided included posts calling for the killing of Democrats, Muslims, Black Lives Matter leaders, and mainstream media journalists. Google and Apple had already removed Parler from their app stores towards the end of last week saying it had failed to comply with their content-moderation requirements. However, it had still been accessible via the web - although visitors had complained of being unable to create new accounts over the weekend, without which it was not possible to view its content. Parler has been online since 2018, and may return if it can find an alternative host. However, chief executive John Matzetold Fox News on Sunday that,external""every vendor from text message services to email providers to our lawyers all ditched us too"". ""We're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we're having a lot of trouble because every vendor we talk to says they won't work with us because if Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, they won't,"" he added. AWS's move is the latest in a series of actions affecting social media following the rioting on Capitol Hill last week. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ Facebook and Twitter have also banned President Trump's accounts on their platforms,citing concerns that he might incite further violence. Parler's users included the Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who had led an effort in the Senate to delay certifying Joe Biden's electoral college victory. He had about five million followers on the platform - more than his tally on Twitter. Parler's app now shows an error message and its website is offline ""Why should a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires have a monopoly on political speech?""he tweeted over the weekend,external. Parler's downfall appears to have benefited Gab - another ""free speech"" social network that is popular with far-right commentators. Ithas claimed to have,external""gained more users in the past two days than we did in our first two years of existing"". Parler has long been a home for what you might call untouchables, people who had been excluded from mainstream services for offences such as blatant racism or incitement to violence. During a brief excursion onto the site over the weekend, I observed plenty of examples of such behaviour, with users exhibiting vile anti-Semitism, displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika and uttering incoherent threats against those they perceive to be enemies of America. But as Amazon's deadline approached something like panic took hold, with users desperately urging their followers to join them on other platforms. Most seemed to accept that Parler was doomed, while vowing to continue their fight elsewhere. ""Well this is the end,"" wrote one user, who proclaimed his support for the American Nazi Party.

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. Read more: Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman heralded as 'a hero' A majority of voters say Trump should resign, according toa new opinion poll from Quinnipiac University,external, with 56% respondents saying that they hold Trump responsible for the riot on Capitol Hill. The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list. Bonnie Watson Coleman is a Democrat congresswoman for New Jersey US Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman
says she has tested positive for Covid-19 â and believes she caught it while
sheltering from rioters in the Capitol building last Wednesday. âI received a positive test
result for Covid-19, and am home resting at this time. While I am experiencing
mild, cold-like symptoms, I remain in good spirits and will continue to work on
behalf of my constituents,âshe said,external. The Capitolâs physician Dr Brian
Moynihan warned on Sunday that âmany members of the House community were in
protective isolation in the large room â some for several hours,"" and said âindividuals
may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infectionâ. An internal FBI bulletin is warning state and local law enforcement that they should prepare for violence by right-wing extremists on Sunday, according to US media who've seen the document. The FBI memo - reportedly issued a week before last week's attack on the US Capitol - identifies credible threats to the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols, from 16 January to 20 January. A violent far-right group known as the Boogaloo is behind these organising efforts, according to the document. It states the Boogaloo movement believes ""an impending insurgency against the government is forthcoming, and some believe they should accelerate the timeline with armed, anti-government actions leading to a civil war"". Members of the movement are calling for the âstormingâ of state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday - and on the day itself. Who are the Boogaloo Bois? The FBI is currently reviewing over 40,000 digital media tips received from the public in recent days, after it appealed for help identifying rioters who joined the Capitol unrest. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Pupils across Scotland have been experiencing problems accessing Microsoft Teams as the majority move to home learning. A number of schools, pupils and parents have reported the technology running slowly or not at all. It is one of the main platforms being used for remote learning with schools shut to most pupils until at least the beginning of February. Microsoft Teams tweeted that the issue was being investigated. A Microsoft spokesperson said: ""Our engineers are working to resolve difficulties accessing Microsoft Teams that some customers are experiencing."" When pressed on whether demand as a result of home schooling was causing the issue, Microsoft declined to comment. Fears over pupils missing out on online learning Pupils face disparities in remote learning First Minister Nicola Sturgeon highlighted the problem during her daily coronavirus briefing. ""This is not an issue that is unique to Scotland or indeed unique to schools, but I understand Microsoft is currently working to address it,"" she said. ""More generally I don't underestimate how difficult this is both for young people learning away from friendsâ¦ and for parents to juggle home schooling with working."" Ms Sturgeon was also asked about problems which were being experienced by users of digital learning platform Glow. She replied: ""It is not an issue with Glow. It is affecting Glow, but the core issue is not with Glowâ¦  the issue is with Microsoft Teams."" Two schools in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, said the problem was a ""national issue"" although Renfrew High School urged pupils experiencing difficulties not to panic. Clyde Valley High School tweeted: ""Our online learning provision begins today for all of our pupils. Due to the very high demand for Microsoft Teams across Scotland, there may be issues initially getting logged on or accessing some files. ""This is a national issue on the site and may take a little time to rectify."" Coltness High School said: ""Unfortunately it appears Microsoft Teams is struggling to cope with the traffic this morning. ""This is across Scotland and not isolated to Coltness. Pupils and staff are having difficulty loading files. We have reported the issue and hopefully this will be resolved soon."" Edinburgh City Council have texted all parents saying: ""There is a city-wide problem with Microsoft Teams this morning. Please be patient as the council is working to resolve it.""

It comes as plans for remote learning during the latest lockdown revealbig disparities between Scotland's 32 councils. Not all pupils will be offered live lessons - instead the decision on the best approach has been left to individual schools and teachers. Guidance on remote learning,externalpublished by the Scottish government on Friday recommended a ""a balance of live learning and independent activity"".

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says exemption from quarantine travel requirements for elite sport are to be reviewed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged football clubs not to ""abuse"" the privileges they are afforded while the rest of Scotland is in lockdown. Players and staff from Celtic FC are having to self-isolate after one tested positive for Covid-19 on return from a mid-season training camp in Dubai. Ms Sturgeon said she had doubts about whether the trip was really necessary. And she said ""everyone, including football, should be erring on the side of caution"" amid a rise in infections. Scottish football below Championship levelis to be suspended for three weeksin light of the current lockdown, with Scottish Cup and lower league ties to be rescheduled. Depleted Celtic draw with Hibernian How Celtic's Dubai trip unravelled Top flight football in Scotland is continuing while most Scots are subject to a ""stay at home"" order due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Celtic's home fixture against Hibernian went ahead on Monday evening, despite the club having lost 13 players and three staff to Covid-19 issues. Defender Christopher Jullien tested positive for the virus on return from the club's training camp in Dubai, with others including the club's manager Neil Lennon being forced to isolate as close contacts. Ms Sturgeon said she was ""disappointed and frustrated"" that her daily coronavirus briefing was again being ""dominated by football"". Celtic trained in Scotland on Saturday after returning from Dubai She said she had doubts about whether Celtic's trip ""was really essential"" and whether rules were strictly adhered to, saying it was for the footballing authorities to decide if further action was necessary. The first minister issued a warning to clubs that they must stick to the rules set out for them while the rest of the populace is subject to tight restrictions. She said: ""Football and elite sport more generally enjoys a number of privileges right now that the rest of us don't have. These privileges include the right to go to overseas training camps and be exempt from quarantine on return. ""It is really vital, obviously for public health reasons but also I think out of respect for the rest of the population living under really heavy restrictions, that these privileges are not abused."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross is an assistant referee in the game. He said that at a time when people are staying at home football games were something many looked forward to. Mr Ross said: ""We don't want to see the whole of Scottish football affected by the actions of one club."" He also called for financial support to be made available to clubs in the Scottish lower leagues and Scottish Cup who had had their games suspended for three weeks. Celtic manager Neil Lennon is among those who are self-isolating Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was currently in ""the most perilous and serious position since the start of the pandemic"", with a record number of people in hospital with Covid-19. She said everyone should be doing their utmost not to add to pressure on the health services by following the rules. She said: ""This whole episode should underline how serious the situation we are in now is. Everyone including football should be erring on the side of caution. ""I know fans of other clubs feel very strongly that the whole of football should not pay the price for the actions of any one club, and I agree with that. ""But of course a situation like this does make it essential for us to review the rules - including those around travel exemptions - and that's what we will be doing. As we do, I do hope that Celtic themselves will reflect seriously on all of this."" Ms Sturgeon cited photographs which emerged of players socialising in Dubai, but Celtic's assistant manager John Kennedy saidthese created a ""false picture""and that there had been ""minor slip-ups"" at worst. The club had previously claimed the government had given permission for the trip to go ahead, but Ms Sturgeon said it had only provided guidance to the footballing authorities on the rules. She said: ""It's not our role to give approval or not to what a football club is doing."" A statement posted on the Celtic website said that ""the reality is that a case could well have occurred had the team remained in Scotland"". It added: ""Celtic has done everything it can to ensure we have in place the very best procedures and protocols. From the outset of the pandemic, Celtic has worked closely with the Scottish government and Scottish football and we will continue to do so."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Luke Evans plays police officer Steve Wilkins who reopened and solved the two double murders Hollywood actor Luke Evans says telling the true story of the murder of four people was a ""huge responsibility"". Evans, who was brought up in Aberbargoed, Caerphilly county, returned to Wales to star in ITV drama The Pembrokeshire Murders. He plays Dyfed-Powys Police officer Steve Wilkins who in 2006 reopened two unsolved double murders from the 1980s. ""I just wanted to tell it right and show justice for the victims, which is the most important part,"" Evans said. ""This is a very serious, sad story where four people lost their lives and their families have struggled and suffered greatly because of it,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""So you do feel a huge sense of responsibility."" Evans began his career in London's West End The Pembrokeshire Murders has been adapted from a book about the case written by Mr Wilkins and ITV journalist Jonathan Hill. In 1985 brother and sister Richard and Helen Thomas were shot at their remote mansion near Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, before the property was set alight. Then in 1989, Peter and Gwenda Dixon were shot dead at close range on the Pembrokeshire coastal path near Little Haven. The drama also stars Newport actress Alexandria Riley as Det Insp Ella Richards But it was only years later that microscopic DNA and fibres linked the murders to John Cooper, who was already in prison for a string of burglaries. In 2011he was jailed for life. WATCH: Actor Luke Evans on Train Robbery drama Luke Evans meets fans and hints at new part in Wales Prince Charles greeted by actor Luke Evans on south Wales tour The Dracula Untold star said he had not been aware of the notorious case: ""I knew almost nothing about these murders, to the point where when I read what was a treatment two or three years agoâ¦ I couldn't believe what I was reading. ""So I did my own research into it and realised that the story was completely true - it hadn't been embellished, none of this was fiction and it sort of blew my mind."" Keith Allen plays the killer John Cooper He said being able to speak to Mr Wilkins while filming was invaluable: ""Me and Steve had a dialogue almost every week for a few hours. ""We had a lot of conversations before we started shooting where I would speak to him and ask him, not just about the case - obviously that that was very important - but about things like how was it standing in front of John Cooper, having to interview John Cooper, having to deal with his family. ""You see both sides of the effect of these terrible crimes, you see what the aftermath of what it does to people and how they suffer and you meet Cooper's family as well. ""Steve has his own family and that also is played into the storyline very powerfully."" Evans said the only other time he has worked in Wales was when filming Visit Wales commercials: ""Being Welsh and not getting to work in Wales very often - that certainly was an attraction for me,"" he said. ""I've done them [the commercials] for a few years - one of them was about the coastal walks of Wales and our beautiful coastline... and then right in this beautiful place I was there back there, portraying a character and trying to find the killer of somebody who murdered people on this coastal path."" But he said he enjoyed playing a Welsh character: ""To go right back to my roots with my accent and that was a really, really exciting to do. The series, made by World Productions, the makers of Line of Duty and Bodyguard, finished filming just before Wales' first coronavirus lockdown. ""When we started The Pembrokeshire Murders it was January so we didn't hear anything really, and then just before we finished there was rumblings of this virus,"" he said. ""We were very lucky in a way, we wrapped basically on the Friday then on the Monday everything closed. ""So it was a big sigh of relief when we got to the final wrap of that day and it was very special."" The three-part series also stars Keith Allen, Owen Teale, Alexandria Riley, Caroline Berry, Oliver Ryan and David Fynn.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The bubbles policy will stay"". The UK is at the ""worst point"" of the pandemic, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned, but said the actions of the public ""could make a difference"". At a No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock pleaded with people to follow the government's Covid rules until the vaccine could provide a ""way out"" of the pandemic. The government earlierpublished its plan to immunise,externaltens of millions of people by spring. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first Covid vaccine shot. And a total of 2.6 million doses have been given out across the country, with some people having received both doses. Mr Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus was putting the NHS under ""significant pressure"", adding it was ""imperative"" that people limit their social contacts. ""The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules,"" he said. ""I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference."" The health secretary said he could ""rule out"" tightening restrictions by removing support and childcare bubbles, however. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Laura Kuenssberg: What next for Covid rules? Inside a mass vaccination centre PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home His comments follow similar warnings from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said that the next few weekswill be ""the worst"" of the pandemicfor the NHS. According to the latest figures, there have been another 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, and another 46,169 cases reported. There are also more than 32,000 people in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Matt Hancock has previously said he's learned to rule nothing out when it comes to dealing with the pandemic. But today he took the unusual step of doing just that. Support bubbles and childcare bubbles, hugely valued by so many, will stay. Senior Whitehall sources have previously told me bubbles were ""untouchable"" but for a minister to say as much, so explicitly and on the record, means there's now very little wriggle room for the government to change its mind. Ministers will know that scrapping bubbles, for those that rely on them, could have proved deeply unpopular. But this certainty is a rarity. Whilst the current emphasis is on compliance, the idea of toughening up controls in other areas is not being ruled out. The vaccine delivery plan says it is expected to take until spring to give a first dose to all 32 million people in the UK's priority groups, including everyone over 55 and those who are clinically vulnerable. Under the plan, the government has pledged to carry out at least two million vaccinations in England per week by the end of January, which it says will be made possible by rolling out jabs at 206 hospital sites, 50 vaccination centres and around 1,200 local vaccination sites. It also reiterates the government's aim of offering vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. According to Mr Hancock, two fifths of over-80s have now received their first dose, and almost a quarter of care home residents have received theirs. Also at the briefing, NHS England's national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the NHS was aiming to vaccinate the rest of thetop nine priority groupsby April, with a final push to offer all adults over 18 a jab by the autumn. He stressed it would take until February before there were ""early signs"" that vaccination was leading to a drop in hospitalisations. The country has still not seen the full impact of the Christmas loosening of lockdown restrictions, Prof Powis added, although he noted there are now 13,000 more Covid patients in hospital than there were on Christmas Day. Speaking in Bristol earlier, Mr Johnson warned the vaccination programme was in a ""race against time"" because of pressure on the NHS. He said it was ""a very perilous moment because everyone can sense the vaccine is coming in - my worry is that will breed false complacency"". When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Morrisons to ban shoppers who refuse to wear masks The newly-published vaccination plan also says ministers are aiming to offer jabs at more than 2,700 sites across the UK. And it says that daily vaccination figures for England will be published from now on - showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses. Earlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a ""strong case"" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising ""teachers and other key workers"" for vaccination after the ""first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated"". A quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added. In the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations. News that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped. Hitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week. With more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply. There is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February. However, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution. Challenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track. Asseven mass vaccination centresopened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use,although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. Vaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations. All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring,under new plans. And Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nationwill be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at homecan now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measuresare in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said: ""I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"".

This now refers to anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day.

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. Read more: Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman heralded as 'a hero' A majority of voters say Trump should resign, according toa new opinion poll from Quinnipiac University,external, with 56% respondents saying that they hold Trump responsible for the riot on Capitol Hill. The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list. Bonnie Watson Coleman is a Democrat congresswoman for New Jersey US Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman
says she has tested positive for Covid-19 â and believes she caught it while
sheltering from rioters in the Capitol building last Wednesday. âI received a positive test
result for Covid-19, and am home resting at this time. While I am experiencing
mild, cold-like symptoms, I remain in good spirits and will continue to work on
behalf of my constituents,âshe said,external. The Capitolâs physician Dr Brian
Moynihan warned on Sunday that âmany members of the House community were in
protective isolation in the large room â some for several hours,"" and said âindividuals
may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infectionâ. An internal FBI bulletin is warning state and local law enforcement that they should prepare for violence by right-wing extremists on Sunday, according to US media who've seen the document. The FBI memo - reportedly issued a week before last week's attack on the US Capitol - identifies credible threats to the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols, from 16 January to 20 January. A violent far-right group known as the Boogaloo is behind these organising efforts, according to the document. It states the Boogaloo movement believes ""an impending insurgency against the government is forthcoming, and some believe they should accelerate the timeline with armed, anti-government actions leading to a civil war"". Members of the movement are calling for the âstormingâ of state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday - and on the day itself. Who are the Boogaloo Bois? The FBI is currently reviewing over 40,000 digital media tips received from the public in recent days, after it appealed for help identifying rioters who joined the Capitol unrest. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Khairi Saadallah admitted three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder A killer who stabbed three men to death in a Reading park has been handed a whole-life jail term. Khairi Saadallah murdered James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and 39-year-old Joe Ritchie-Bennett, in June last year in Forbury Gardens. London's Old Bailey previously heard the 26-year-old ""executed"" the men as an ""act of religious jihad"". Passing sentence Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said it was a ""ruthless and brutal"" terror attack. Saadallah, who admitted the murders, had also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of three other men who were also in the park. The judge said the victims ""had no chance to react, let alone defend themselves"". (L-R) David Wails, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and James Furlong were pronounced dead at the scene He said he was sure the attack ""involved a substantial degree of premeditation or planning"" and was carried out ""for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause"". BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson, who was in court, said the families of James Furlong and David Wails were present, while Joseph Ritchie-Bennett's loved ones watched via a link from America. Saadallah showed no emotion as Mr Justice Sweeney went through his sentencing remarks. On the afternoon of 20 June, the park was busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England. Andrew Cafe, who witnessed the stabbings, said he saw Saadallah wielding the ""biggest kitchen knife"" and charging towards him shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". Pharmaceutical manager Mr Ritchie-Bennett and teacher Mr Furlong died from single stab wounds to their necks, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed once in the back. Despite treatment from paramedics and doctors, all three friends, who were members of the LGBT community, died at the scene. This video can not be played Witness Andrew Cafe visited Forbury Gardens for the first time since the attack Three other people - Nishit Nisudan, Patrick Edwards and Stephen Young - were also injured, before Saadallah threw away the knife and fled the scene, pursued by police. Following his arrest, Saadallah initially said he wanted to plead guilty to the ""jihad that I done"", but the prosecution claimed he later feigned mental illness in police interviews. At a previous hearing, the court heard he had developed an emotionally unstable and anti-social personality disorder, with his behaviour worsened by alcohol and cannabis misuse. But the judge said it was ""clear that the defendant did not, and does not, have any major mental illness"". Reading attack: 'We did all we could to save them' Reading killer left jail two weeks before attack Reading stabbings: Who were the victims? An examination of Saadallah's phone revealed an interest in extremist material, including images of the flag of Islamic State andJihadi John, the court previously heard. While at HMP Bullingdon in 2017, he was seen to associate with radical preacher Omar Brookes, who has connections with banned terrorist organisation Al-Muhajiroun. The court heard Saadallah, who arrived in Britain from Libya in 2012, had previously been involved with militias who had been part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, and was pictured handling weapons, including firearms. Since seeking asylum in Britain, he had been repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences, including theft and assault, between 2013 and 2020. This video can not be played CCTV cameras captured Khairi Saadallah before and after the stabbing He briefly came to the attention of MI5 in 2019, but the information provided did not meet the threshold of investigation. Saadallah had been released from prison on 5 June, days before the attack, the court heard. On 17 June, he researched the location for his attack online and carried out reconnaissance in the park. The following day his probation officer alerted his mental health team over comments he made about magic. A day later, Saadallah contacted the crisis team himself, but when they visited he did not answer. Following concerns from his brother, police visited the killer the same day, but he told officers he was ""alright"" while he stood near a knife he bought from a supermarket. Andrew Wails said losing his brother had been devastating After the sentencing, James Furlong's father, Gary, said: ""The secretary of state needs to tell us why this guy wasn't put into some form of detention centre before they could deport him. ""He was not safe to be released back on the streets."" Referring to the fact that Saadallah had been visited by police the night before the attack, Mr Furlong said: ""Given the volume of crimes he's committed and the information that they had on him, for an assessment to be done the night before to say that he's not a danger to the public - it is beyond me."" He described Mr Furlong, originally from Liverpool, as ""a lovely man, loved by his family, idolised by his mother"". David Wails' brother Andrew said: ""For us as a family it's been devastating to lose our much loved son, brother and uncle."" In a statement, the Bennett family described Mr Ritchie-Bennett as a ""devoted and loving husband"" and ""a man who cared strongly about family"". The park had been busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, described Saadallah as ""a committed jihadist"". She said: ""He has caused unspeakable hurt and distress to the families of the three men who were brutally murdered as they were relaxing and enjoying socialising with friends on a Saturday evening. ""I'm sure there will also be lasting effects on those who were injured in the attack, who were fortunate not to have been even more seriously harmed.""

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The bubbles policy will stay"". The UK is at the ""worst point"" of the pandemic, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned, but said the actions of the public ""could make a difference"". At a No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock pleaded with people to follow the government's Covid rules until the vaccine could provide a ""way out"" of the pandemic. The government earlierpublished its plan to immunise,externaltens of millions of people by spring. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first Covid vaccine shot. And a total of 2.6 million doses have been given out across the country, with some people having received both doses. Mr Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus was putting the NHS under ""significant pressure"", adding it was ""imperative"" that people limit their social contacts. ""The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules,"" he said. ""I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference."" The health secretary said he could ""rule out"" tightening restrictions by removing support and childcare bubbles, however. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Laura Kuenssberg: What next for Covid rules? Inside a mass vaccination centre PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home His comments follow similar warnings from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said that the next few weekswill be ""the worst"" of the pandemicfor the NHS. According to the latest figures, there have been another 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, and another 46,169 cases reported. There are also more than 32,000 people in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Matt Hancock has previously said he's learned to rule nothing out when it comes to dealing with the pandemic. But today he took the unusual step of doing just that. Support bubbles and childcare bubbles, hugely valued by so many, will stay. Senior Whitehall sources have previously told me bubbles were ""untouchable"" but for a minister to say as much, so explicitly and on the record, means there's now very little wriggle room for the government to change its mind. Ministers will know that scrapping bubbles, for those that rely on them, could have proved deeply unpopular. But this certainty is a rarity. Whilst the current emphasis is on compliance, the idea of toughening up controls in other areas is not being ruled out. The vaccine delivery plan says it is expected to take until spring to give a first dose to all 32 million people in the UK's priority groups, including everyone over 55 and those who are clinically vulnerable. Under the plan, the government has pledged to carry out at least two million vaccinations in England per week by the end of January, which it says will be made possible by rolling out jabs at 206 hospital sites, 50 vaccination centres and around 1,200 local vaccination sites. It also reiterates the government's aim of offering vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. According to Mr Hancock, two fifths of over-80s have now received their first dose, and almost a quarter of care home residents have received theirs. Also at the briefing, NHS England's national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the NHS was aiming to vaccinate the rest of thetop nine priority groupsby April, with a final push to offer all adults over 18 a jab by the autumn. He stressed it would take until February before there were ""early signs"" that vaccination was leading to a drop in hospitalisations. The country has still not seen the full impact of the Christmas loosening of lockdown restrictions, Prof Powis added, although he noted there are now 13,000 more Covid patients in hospital than there were on Christmas Day. Speaking in Bristol earlier, Mr Johnson warned the vaccination programme was in a ""race against time"" because of pressure on the NHS. He said it was ""a very perilous moment because everyone can sense the vaccine is coming in - my worry is that will breed false complacency"". When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Morrisons to ban shoppers who refuse to wear masks The newly-published vaccination plan also says ministers are aiming to offer jabs at more than 2,700 sites across the UK. And it says that daily vaccination figures for England will be published from now on - showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses. Earlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a ""strong case"" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising ""teachers and other key workers"" for vaccination after the ""first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated"". A quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added. In the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations. News that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped. Hitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week. With more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply. There is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February. However, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution. Challenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track. Asseven mass vaccination centresopened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use,although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. Vaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations. All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring,under new plans. And Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nationwill be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at homecan now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measuresare in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said: ""I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Meanwhile, the United Arab Emiratesis being removed from the UK list of travel corridorsamid a spike in Covid cases. And England's Test and Trace scheme has revised one of its definitions of a ""close contact"" - the people who need to be reached if they have been near to someone who has tested positive for Covid. This now refers to anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day. Previously the definition was just a single period of at least 15 minutes.

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. Read more: Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman heralded as 'a hero' A majority of voters say Trump should resign, according toa new opinion poll from Quinnipiac University,external, with 56% respondents saying that they hold Trump responsible for the riot on Capitol Hill. The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list. Bonnie Watson Coleman is a Democrat congresswoman for New Jersey US Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman
says she has tested positive for Covid-19 â and believes she caught it while
sheltering from rioters in the Capitol building last Wednesday. âI received a positive test
result for Covid-19, and am home resting at this time. While I am experiencing
mild, cold-like symptoms, I remain in good spirits and will continue to work on
behalf of my constituents,âshe said,external. The Capitolâs physician Dr Brian
Moynihan warned on Sunday that âmany members of the House community were in
protective isolation in the large room â some for several hours,"" and said âindividuals
may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infectionâ. An internal FBI bulletin is warning state and local law enforcement that they should prepare for violence by right-wing extremists on Sunday, according to US media who've seen the document. The FBI memo - reportedly issued a week before last week's attack on the US Capitol - identifies credible threats to the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols, from 16 January to 20 January. A violent far-right group known as the Boogaloo is behind these organising efforts, according to the document. It states the Boogaloo movement believes ""an impending insurgency against the government is forthcoming, and some believe they should accelerate the timeline with armed, anti-government actions leading to a civil war"". Members of the movement are calling for the âstormingâ of state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday - and on the day itself. Who are the Boogaloo Bois? The FBI is currently reviewing over 40,000 digital media tips received from the public in recent days, after it appealed for help identifying rioters who joined the Capitol unrest. Â© 2025 BBC.

The BBC Click team are also hard at work on some hands-on videos, after getting some of the start-ups taking part in CES to send over their prototypes. We leave you for now with Chris Fox's first look at a pair of tuneable glasses, which he thinks resemble a pair of jam jars on his face. Leo KelionTechnology desk editor  By becoming a digital event, CES presented the opportunity to rethink its keynote speeches. The only thing holding companies back was their imagination and budgets. What we got with Verizon's hour-long event was a series of Zoom-like video calls, typical corporate press videos and abstract backdrop graphics behind the telecoms firm's chief executive Hans Vestberg. What I was hoping for was that it would present new compelling uses for 5G - the theme of the event. Instead the examples presented - streamed VR graphics, augmented reality objects based on museum scans - could just as well have been delivered by wi-fi with a decent broadband connection. Yes - a wi-fi connection might not always be available when out, but most of these weren't activities you'd engage in while wandering about. There were cases given that would benefit from 5G - robot dogs for emergency responders and package-delivering drones - but these aren't things that most members of the public need to upgrade their own handsets for at this time. Things weren't helped by the fact the event culminated in an awkward, obviously pre-scripted conversation between Mr Vestberg and members of the band Black Pumas about how 5G will let music-lovers watch performances via their phones with the ability to pick between camera angles ""to focus on their favourite band members"". The Black Pumas followed the script on stage, before giving a more entertaining performance of their music To be fair, with so many people stuck indoors, this is a tough time to sell the public on the need for faster mobile data. And there were fans of the presentation on social media. But after a long day, this felt like a pretty underwhelming way to end what had been an entertaining start to CES 2021. Allow Twitter content?

It's a good time to be in the business. Analyst firm Canalys has just reported that shipments within the global PC market shot up 25% in 2020. That might not be surprising, with so many people buying extra work machines - but there was a big shortage of PC parts earlier this year, making the growth even more notable. Canalys says the numbers mark the sector's biggest annual growth since 2010, and it was ""singlehandedly driven by notebooks and mobile workstations"". ""It is going to be extremely difficult to write off the PC as some of us did a few years ago. PCs are here to stay,â analyst Rushabh Doshi said. There was one exception: desktop shipments fell by 20% - perhaps because business customers stopped buying new PCs for offices. Nvidia, atitan,externalin the graphics card and artificial intelligence world, has a gaming event scheduled for Tuesday evening, where industry watchers expect its latest mobile graphics cards to be shown off. The desktop versions of those cards have been in tight supply since they launched last year. Leo KelionTechnology desk editor  Sony's slick CES presentation didn't unveil many new products. But it delivered a fascinating look behind the scenes at two cutting-edge ways the firm is creating video content. The first involved the use of a giant screen which is matched with movement-sensors on a camera to create a fake backdrop that shifts in turn with the lens. A similar technique was pioneered by Industrial Light & Magic and used in the Star Wars spin-off series The Mandalorian, but this opens the door to other filmmakers. The screens involved use Sony's Crystal LED technology, which the firm first unveiled at CES in 2012, but has been unable to bring low down enough in price to take mainstream. In effect, this is its version of micro-LED tech, using millions of tiny light emitting diodes (LEDs) to match the number of pixels. The result is much greater brightness and contrast than a normal LCD or OLED display would be capable of. The background footage moves in time with the camera to aid the illusion Until now, the firm has marketed the tech at building owners wanting the ultimate video walls. But this has the potential to help film and advert-makers place actors within environments they can see, rather than relying on greenscreen effects. The second innovation was the creation of an ""immersive reality"" performance, which uses body sensors to create a highly-detailed animated version of an artist. Madison Beer recorded her performance in a motion-capture suit It was demoed by the singer-songwriter Madison Beer. Motion capture has been used for years to add special effects to characters in movies and to place real-world actors into video games. But the aim here is to create a lifelike representation of a performer on stage at a concert. The footage shown didn't quite escape the ""uncanny valley"" - there's still some way to go before we can't tell the difference between a real person and even a highly detailed avatar. But it's easy to imagine that the tech being more impressive when viewed in virtual reality, where users can move about and choose their view.  The computer-generated image looks less real the closer you get to the performer Until now, VR apps of concerts have either offered a pick of different static camera locations or involved much lower-resolution characters. With Covid meaning it's impossible for artists to tour, this second-best experience could be very timely when it's offered to PlayStation VR headsets and other devices soon. Sony has formally unveiled Airpeak, its own drone. The product was first teased back in November. Now, the company has shown it in flight, chasing a speeding car. It revealed that it will be compatible with Sony's Alpha camera series. But we've get to get a price, specs or other release details. Other drones can use Sony cameras with the right fittings - but Sony's pairing may indicate it is marketing to owners of its existing cameras, which are popular with photographers and video creators. Sony's bid for the drone market comes at an opportune time. The dominant force in the industry, DJI, has found itself subject to US sanctions. DJI was added to a US trade blacklist along with other Chinese firms in December. Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The fact CES is virtual this year means attendees cannot put the toilet to the test For the second time in about two hours there's news of a fresh development in toilet tech. Japanese firm Totohas announced a lavatory,externalthat checks each user's health every time they make use of it. The company says the device uses a range of sensors to scan each person's body and its ""key outputs"" to provide a status update. In case there's any doubt, the press release makes clear this is a polite reference to poo. ""A wealth of wellness data can be collected from faecal matter,"" it says. In addition, readings are taken from users' skin, where it comes into contact with the seat. An accompanying app promises to help owners track their mental and physical status and recommend lifestyle changes. Toto envisages giving people meal recommendations based on analysis of their waste Although it remains a concept for the time being, the firm says it intends to start offering an internet-connected version of the appliance ""in the next several years"". It may sound amusing, but there's potentially huge benefits in finding a way to track people's health without making them put on a smartwatch or other wearable. The question is whether such devices could make their way into the workplace. Some companies already make staff carry out urine tests for illegal drugs, and the Covid-19 pandemic has encouraged the use ofproximity sensorsin the office to ensure employees stay far enough apart. Governments have also analysed wastewater todetect signs of local coronavirus outbreaks,external, albeit by taking samples from city sewage rather than toilets. And it's not inconceivable that in the future we could be asked to use smart toilets to check for signs of infection - or to help reduce companies' health insurance bills. CES press day has a couple of big name events left to go. At 22:00GMT Sony will unveil its latest line of televisions and possibly new camera tech. Last year it also had a car - will there be further surprises this time round? And then closing off the day at 23:30, US mobile network Verizon - which owns Yahoo among other subsidiaries - will host the first of the tech expo's keynote addresses. Chief executive Hans Vestberg is promising to focus his speech on 5G - hopefully he'll have some new uses for the tech beyond faster downloads. Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Michael Bay delivered one of CES's most memorable moments when he walked off Samsung's stage mid-presentation in 2014 One of the oddities of this year's CES is that all the sessions are starting and finishing on time, and there are no queues involved. For those who have suffered CES press days in the past, they involved long snaking lines of journalists and industry analysts winding their ways along hotel conference hall corridors - and then there's a crush once the doors opened at the next space. Then once an event is over, you have to run off to the next unveiling and do it all again. The downside is the lack of buzz and lost conversations after each presentation when we got to compare notes - Twitter posts don't really cut it. And with things running so smoothly, there are no Hollywood directors having meltdowns after a teleprompter gets stuck,or robots malfunctioning on stage. Marketing chiefs may find that reassuring, but one of the appeals of covering CES is the danger of  prototype tech being put to the test. When you know there won't be any hitches, the temptation is to pay less attention to what's going on. This video can not be played LG's Cloi robot repeatedly malfunctioned on stage in 2018 One of the more unusual gadgets unveiled to coincide with CES is the Chamberlain myQ Pet Portal: a smart, Bluetooth-enabled doggie door with a price tag of $2,999 (Â£2,217). It's much nicer than most human-sized ones. Instead of being a two-way flap that lets wind and uninvited visitors into your home, this device is designed to replace an entire door. The product is a door-within-a-door, which opens when it detects a special collar worn by a four-legged friend. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Or it can be manually controlled by an app when you're away - so you decide when to let Rover outside. And it locks once he's back in. The hefty asking price will make it an instant no for many - but the makers optimistically note in a press release that it's ""less than half of what many pet owners spend annually on a dog-walker"". Tech site The Verge has done an extensive interview with the creators,external, who have won one of CES' innovation awards. CES isn't just about screens and robots. After unveiling a shower head with a built-in smart assistant last year, the US bathroom specialist Kohler is back at CES with another ""smart"" way to wash that costs $16,000 (Â£11,720). The Stillness bath features an ""infinity overflow"" facility, whereby water pours over the side to be reheated and then recirculated back to the tub. It also creates a fog effect as well as pumping out scents and soothing sounds. Plus - of course - it's internet-connected, so you can control all the features via an app. Or if you're worried about getting your smartphone wet, you can shout at Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa to do your bidding. Just be careful about which family members have access to the same account - or you run the risk of someone switching on the cold tap remotely. Kohler also unveiled both a toilet you can flush and a bathroom tap that turns on at the wave of a hand - which might be hygienic, but they also risk making the bathroom feel a bit like going to a public lavatory. You can't buy this mask - LG created the image to show how the technology of a buliker contraption works  The pandemic hasn't just changed how CES is delivered - it's changed what's being pushed by some of the firms. Earlier, we saw Samsung's exercise app for TVs and robot vacuum cleaner - but hygiene in particular has been an odd focus for many. LG, for example, spent the top of its main press conference not on its flagship TVs - but on ""making your life better and cleaner"". It heavily featured its portable air purifiers called Puricare, including a version that can be worn on the face like a mask. The product was announced in August last year, but it still made a top spot on the tech firm's main annual showcase. And then there's the AirPop Active+ Halo, a $150 mask with a smart sensor in it. The sensor - which the company calls a ""halo"", connects to smartphone app to monitor breathing, air quality, and whether the filter needs to be replaced. It's due to be released in North America soon. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

But these companies aren't making a direct claim that their products protect against coronavirus - because evidence about whether or not it does is patchy. Which? magazine took a look at the topic in March 2020,external, as the global outbreak saw sellers advertise air purification as a way to fight the virus. Viruses are extremely small, but a top-quality air filter can in fact capture some of them. But Which? concluded: ""Crucially, though, none of this has been scientifically proven yet, and, in the real world, a lot depends on factors"". TheUS Environmental Protection Agency says pretty much the same thing,external. ""When used properly"", some filters can ""help reduce airborne contaminants including viruses"", it says. But it's only an aid, and ""by itself, air cleaning or filtration is not enough to protect people from exposure to the virus that causes Covid-19.""  This video can not be played BBC Click's Lara Lewington tried on the AO Air face mask at CES 2020 While the new PlayStation and Xbox consoles dominated the gaming news towards the end of 2020, another force is on the rise. Cloud gaming - where titles run on remote computer servers and are streamed via the internet to the player - is (very) slowly catching on. The downside is it requires a fast internet connection, and there can be a little lag. The upside is you don't need powerful hardware at home to play games in their full glory. Google is one of the major players involved, thanks to its Stadia service. And it has just announced a tie-up with LG, which will see Stadia run within the South Korean firm's TVs. LG is the second biggest-selling TV brand after Samsung. Effectively, it means households will be able to play more than 100 titles - including Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin's Creed: Valhalla - by downloading an app to their television instead of needing an additional set-top box or dongle, although they will still need a controller. This isn't the first time something like this has been tried - at one point LG and Samsung were set to build in Gaikai's cloud gaming service into their TVs â until Sony bought it to form the basis of its PlayStation Now service. The move could give Stadia a leg up against rivals such as Amazon's Luna and Nvidia's GeForce Now - assuming further tie-ups aren't announced later at CES. Meanwhile, LG Display - the division of the South Korean firm that makes screens for a number of companies - has shown off some of its latest screen tech, including a display that bends to become curved for gaming and then straightens up again for watching TV.

While we wait for the next big announcements, here's what CES usually looks like. In 2020, before the first lockdown in the US, the BBC's Zoe Kleinman was there to roam the halls and meet some people - with not a socially distanced interview in sight. This video can not be played CES 2020: The biggest surprises from big tech at the show Beyond the big brands at CES Chris FoxTechnology reporter This video can not be played CES 2021: Tuneable spectacles let you adjust your lenses  CES is not just about the tech giants. Every year there are hundreds of start-ups showcasing their gadgets too. On a typical walk through CESâs Eureka Park, you can spot a dozen interesting and intriguing products or prototypes. This year, it's been more of a trawl through a hefty spreadsheet â although it has yielded the usual mix of the odd and ingenious. US start-up Hudway has produced a head-up display that can stick on any car dashboard.   You pop your smartphone underneath and the angled glass reflects the information as though it is overlaid on the road ahead. Into-See has created ornate furniture with a black glass panel that turns semi-transparent, so you can see what is inside. LG showed off a similar feature on one of its fridges last year, which is now a product you can buy - though ultimately it strikes me as something that has niche appeal. One practical idea is a pair of glasses by Voy, which have adjustable lenses to suit a variety of prescriptions. The specs worked well â although they were much, much chunkier than my regular glasses. Going through the spreadsheet, it definitely felt as though there were fewer gems to be discovered than usual. Many exhibitors had not provided any information about their products or even a link to their website â while others did not have their prototypes ready in time for the show. Perhaps with the move online, companies have taken a more relaxed approach towards deadlines. But after the year we have all had, I canât say I blame them. Futuristic fold-up TV and phone maker TCL showed off its own bendable display technology at CES, with a 17in (43.2cm) printed OLED scrolling display. Unlike anything we've seen in the phone or tablet market, the product looked like an old-world written paper scroll. The company says the display is just 0.18mm deep - about twice as thick as general-use office paper. Unfortunately, there was no mention of commercial availability or any prices - making this a concept display only. It was announced by TCL's CSOT division rather than the part of the company that makes smartphones. The firm also showed off smaller rolling display, which it said could be used to expand a phone's display from 6.7in to 7.8in ""at the touch of a button"". Rollable displays could be the next big thing for the smartphone market after the appearance of foldable displays in the past few years. LG's press conference earlier today also teased a device using the tech. But concerns over their durability and price - not to mention the hassle factor of having to open the screen before using an app - may prove obstacles to widespread adoption. Opening the online show earlier, host Justine Ezarik - better known on YouTube as iJustine - talked about how bad the queues for taxis are in Vegas at CES every year. But she still misses them, she said - because of the people she'd met in those line. And Vegas is missing the CES attendees, too. Allow Twitter content?

Usually, getting a hotel in the city at this time of the year is tricky, with hotels heavily booked and rooms costing hundreds of dollars - but now, they can be had for knock-down prices.

Local ABC affiliate KTNV reports that the big Las Vegas resorts on the strip are broadcasting messages of support for the event, hoping it will be back in 2022. Starting tonight, about two dozen major resorts will use their displays to show the message: ""We miss you and can't wait to welcome you back in 2022."" A Tesla-beating touchscreen? Mercedes-Benz has announced what it's calling a ""hyperscreen"", which will replace the entire front dashboard on its cars with a smartscreen. The 141cm-wide (55in) display can be much more flexible than existing solutions, it claims. For example, it has a system where the passenger can watch a movie on the car's screen - with Bluetooth headphone support - while the driver isn't distracted by anything on the centre panel. Another feature, titled ""travel knowledge"", will offer interesting information about nearby landmarks when asked - or identify a restaurant as you pass by if you miss the sign. It is actually made out of three screens, but Mercedes says they have made it to look ""apparently seamlessly merged"". The ""hyperscreen"" will come first to the car maker's upcoming all-electric EQS models, and be rolled out to other vehicles later. Gigantic displays are a theme in the car world - Tesla led the way with its 17in (43cm) tablet dashboards. And in past years at CES, the Chinese start-up Byton has shown off plans to build a modelwith a 48in (121cm) curved display, while Sony unveiled a concept car with an ultra-widepanoramic infotainment screen of its own. The challenge is to ensure all those illuminated pixels don't create a distraction to what's on the road ahead - at least until fully autonomous vehicles come of age.   Giving smartphones a second life Buried among Samsung's other announcements was an idea with what to do with your old phones - transform them into smart home devices. Galaxy Upcycling at Home, due to be released later this year, will let owners turn an old handset into a sound sensor or a light sensor, for example. As examples, the company showed phones being used as a baby monitor and a long-distance remote control to activate lights for pets at home alone. âThis is a vision of a better, more inclusive and sustainable future, and weâre working toward it every day,"" said Sandeep Rana, the firm's sustainability specialist. A lot of the carbon impact of devices is sunk into their manufacturing. Phone owners are already using their devices for longer before replacing them, but this initiative could prolong the life of devices even further. So far, the social media reaction to the initiative has been pretty positive. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It seems like every press release and announcement made after March last year had to remind us that the coronavirus existed (in case you forgot). So far, that trend is strong at CES 2021. So far, we've had: Expect more of this throughout the day. Samsung's press conference announced fridges, TVs, and more - but nothing for one of the firm's biggest sellers - smartphones. That's not an oversight - it's because the handsets are coming later this week. The Samsung Unpacked event is scheduled for 14 January at 15:00 GMT. According to the holding page, it will be about the Galaxy brand of smartphones. The promo image for Thursday's event features an obscured smartphone with what looks like three circles on it - but we'll have to wait until Thursday to learn more. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The bubbles policy will stay"". The UK is at the ""worst point"" of the pandemic, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned, but said the actions of the public ""could make a difference"". At a No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock pleaded with people to follow the government's Covid rules until the vaccine could provide a ""way out"" of the pandemic. The government earlierpublished its plan to immunise,externaltens of millions of people by spring. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first Covid vaccine shot. And a total of 2.6 million doses have been given out across the country, with some people having received both doses. Mr Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus was putting the NHS under ""significant pressure"", adding it was ""imperative"" that people limit their social contacts. ""The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules,"" he said. ""I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference."" The health secretary said he could ""rule out"" tightening restrictions by removing support and childcare bubbles, however. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Laura Kuenssberg: What next for Covid rules? Inside a mass vaccination centre PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home His comments follow similar warnings from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said that the next few weekswill be ""the worst"" of the pandemicfor the NHS. According to the latest figures, there have been another 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, and another 46,169 cases reported. There are also more than 32,000 people in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Matt Hancock has previously said he's learned to rule nothing out when it comes to dealing with the pandemic. But today he took the unusual step of doing just that. Support bubbles and childcare bubbles, hugely valued by so many, will stay. Senior Whitehall sources have previously told me bubbles were ""untouchable"" but for a minister to say as much, so explicitly and on the record, means there's now very little wriggle room for the government to change its mind. Ministers will know that scrapping bubbles, for those that rely on them, could have proved deeply unpopular. But this certainty is a rarity. Whilst the current emphasis is on compliance, the idea of toughening up controls in other areas is not being ruled out. The vaccine delivery plan says it is expected to take until spring to give a first dose to all 32 million people in the UK's priority groups, including everyone over 55 and those who are clinically vulnerable. Under the plan, the government has pledged to carry out at least two million vaccinations in England per week by the end of January, which it says will be made possible by rolling out jabs at 206 hospital sites, 50 vaccination centres and around 1,200 local vaccination sites. It also reiterates the government's aim of offering vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. According to Mr Hancock, two fifths of over-80s have now received their first dose, and almost a quarter of care home residents have received theirs. Also at the briefing, NHS England's national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the NHS was aiming to vaccinate the rest of thetop nine priority groupsby April, with a final push to offer all adults over 18 a jab by the autumn. He stressed it would take until February before there were ""early signs"" that vaccination was leading to a drop in hospitalisations. The country has still not seen the full impact of the Christmas loosening of lockdown restrictions, Prof Powis added, although he noted there are now 13,000 more Covid patients in hospital than there were on Christmas Day. Speaking in Bristol earlier, Mr Johnson warned the vaccination programme was in a ""race against time"" because of pressure on the NHS. He said it was ""a very perilous moment because everyone can sense the vaccine is coming in - my worry is that will breed false complacency"". When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Morrisons to ban shoppers who refuse to wear masks The newly-published vaccination plan also says ministers are aiming to offer jabs at more than 2,700 sites across the UK. And it says that daily vaccination figures for England will be published from now on - showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses. Earlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a ""strong case"" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising ""teachers and other key workers"" for vaccination after the ""first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated"". A quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added. In the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations. News that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped. Hitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week. With more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply. There is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February. However, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution. Challenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track. Asseven mass vaccination centresopened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use,although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. Vaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations. All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring,under new plans. And Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nationwill be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at homecan now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measuresare in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said: ""I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"".

This now refers to anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day. Previously the definition was just a single period of at least 15 minutes.

"Morrisons will bar customers who refuse to wear face coverings from its shops amid rising coronavirus infections. From Monday, shoppers who refuse to wear face masks offered by staff will not be allowed inside, unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's also said it would challenge those not wearing a mask or who were shopping in groups. The announcements come amid concerns that social distancing measures are not being adhered to in supermarkets. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is ""concerned"" shops are not enforcing rules strictly enough. ""Ultimately, the most important thing to do now is to make sure that actually enforcement - and of course the compliance with the rules - when people are going into supermarkets are being adhered to,"" Mr Zahawi told Sky News. ""We need to make sure people actually wear masks and follow the one-way system,"" he said. What are the lockdown rules across the UK? Supermarket staff: We're lucky if people wear masks Stricter Covid supermarket rules being considered in Wales What are the social distancing rules? Should I wear a face covering in the supermarket? Morrisons said it had ""introduced and consistently maintained thorough and robust safety measures in all our stores"" since the start of the pandemic. But it said: ""From today we are further strengthening our policy on masks."" Security guards at the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain will be enforcing the new rules. Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: ""Those who are offered a face covering and decline to wear one won't be allowed to shop at Morrisons unless they are medically exempt. ""Our store colleagues are working hard to feed you and your family, please be kind."" Following Morrisons' announcement, Sainsbury's said that it was also putting trained security guards at the front of its stores to challenge shoppers who did not comply. Chief executive Simon Roberts said: ""I've spent a lot of time in our stores reviewing the latest situation over the last few days and on behalf of all my colleagues, I am asking our customers to help us keep everyone safe. ""The vast majority of customers are shopping safely, but I have also seen some customers trying to shop without a mask and shopping in larger family groups. ""Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone. Everyone's care and consideration matters now more than ever."" Earlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi stopped short of saying that supermarket staff should be responsible for enforcing rules on face masks. Enforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, not retailers.Wearing face masks in supermarkets and shops is compulsory across the UK. In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines.

Hint: it's not any of these three options However, retail industry body the British Retail Consortium said that, workers have faced an increase in incidents of violence and abuse when trying to encourage shoppers to put them on. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: ""Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond. ""Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers."" Under current lockdown restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people must only leave home for essential reasons, such as buying food or medicine. In a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, supermarkets introduced social distancing measures during the UK's first nationwide lockdown last March. They included limits on the numbers of customers in the shops at any one time, protective plastic screens at tills and ""marshals"" to ensure shoppers were maintaining a two-metre distance. But amid rising numbers of infections, some have expressed concerns about a ""lack of visible protections"" implemented by supermarkets in recent weeks. The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturdaythat he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown as people were worried the strict enforcement of rules did not ""appear to be there this time"". ""Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,"" he said. Supermarket Waitrose said that it was taking a ""cautious approach"" to the virus, with marshals checking that customers are wearing face coverings on the door, hand sanitiser stations at its entrances and written communications to shoppers reminding them to maintain their distance. Tesco said it was limiting the number of customers in store and was also reminding customers to wear masks. ""We have clear signage explaining this, and we have packs of face coverings available for purchase near the front of our stores for any customers who have forgotten them."" Meanwhile, Asda announced last week,externalthat it would extend its marshals' hours to 08:00 to 20:00 and increase how often baskets and trollies are cleaned. Shop workers' union Usdaw has also called for firms to apply more stringent measures again. The union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said that it had received reports that ""too many customers are not following necessary safety measures like social distancing, wearing a face covering and only shopping for essential items"". ""It is going to take some time to roll out the vaccine and we cannot afford to be complacent in the meantime, particularly with a new strain sweeping the nation,"" Mr Lillis said. The trade union also suggested that ""'one-in one-out"" policies and proper queuing systems should be reintroduced in supermarkets. It added that these systems should be managed by trained security staff where necessary.

"Khairi Saadallah admitted three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder A killer who stabbed three men to death in a Reading park has been handed a whole-life jail term. Khairi Saadallah murdered James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and 39-year-old Joe Ritchie-Bennett, in June last year in Forbury Gardens. London's Old Bailey previously heard the 26-year-old ""executed"" the men as an ""act of religious jihad"". Passing sentence Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said it was a ""ruthless and brutal"" terror attack. Saadallah, who admitted the murders, had also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of three other men who were also in the park. The judge said the victims ""had no chance to react, let alone defend themselves"". (L-R) David Wails, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and James Furlong were pronounced dead at the scene He said he was sure the attack ""involved a substantial degree of premeditation or planning"" and was carried out ""for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause"". BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson, who was in court, said the families of James Furlong and David Wails were present, while Joseph Ritchie-Bennett's loved ones watched via a link from America. Saadallah showed no emotion as Mr Justice Sweeney went through his sentencing remarks. On the afternoon of 20 June, the park was busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England. Andrew Cafe, who witnessed the stabbings, said he saw Saadallah wielding the ""biggest kitchen knife"" and charging towards him shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". Pharmaceutical manager Mr Ritchie-Bennett and teacher Mr Furlong died from single stab wounds to their necks, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed once in the back. Despite treatment from paramedics and doctors, all three friends, who were members of the LGBT community, died at the scene. This video can not be played Witness Andrew Cafe visited Forbury Gardens for the first time since the attack Three other people - Nishit Nisudan, Patrick Edwards and Stephen Young - were also injured, before Saadallah threw away the knife and fled the scene, pursued by police. Following his arrest, Saadallah initially said he wanted to plead guilty to the ""jihad that I done"", but the prosecution claimed he later feigned mental illness in police interviews. At a previous hearing, the court heard he had developed an emotionally unstable and anti-social personality disorder, with his behaviour worsened by alcohol and cannabis misuse. But the judge said it was ""clear that the defendant did not, and does not, have any major mental illness"". Reading attack: 'We did all we could to save them' Reading killer left jail two weeks before attack Reading stabbings: Who were the victims? An examination of Saadallah's phone revealed an interest in extremist material, including images of the flag of Islamic State andJihadi John, the court previously heard. While at HMP Bullingdon in 2017, he was seen to associate with radical preacher Omar Brookes, who has connections with banned terrorist organisation Al-Muhajiroun. The court heard Saadallah, who arrived in Britain from Libya in 2012, had previously been involved with militias who had been part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, and was pictured handling weapons, including firearms. Since seeking asylum in Britain, he had been repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences, including theft and assault, between 2013 and 2020. This video can not be played CCTV cameras captured Khairi Saadallah before and after the stabbing He briefly came to the attention of MI5 in 2019, but the information provided did not meet the threshold of investigation. Saadallah had been released from prison on 5 June, days before the attack, the court heard. On 17 June, he researched the location for his attack online and carried out reconnaissance in the park. The following day his probation officer alerted his mental health team over comments he made about magic. A day later, Saadallah contacted the crisis team himself, but when they visited he did not answer. Following concerns from his brother, police visited the killer the same day, but he told officers he was ""alright"" while he stood near a knife he bought from a supermarket. Andrew Wails said losing his brother had been devastating After the sentencing, James Furlong's father, Gary, said: ""The secretary of state needs to tell us why this guy wasn't put into some form of detention centre before they could deport him. ""He was not safe to be released back on the streets."" Referring to the fact that Saadallah had been visited by police the night before the attack, Mr Furlong said: ""Given the volume of crimes he's committed and the information that they had on him, for an assessment to be done the night before to say that he's not a danger to the public - it is beyond me."" He described Mr Furlong, originally from Liverpool, as ""a lovely man, loved by his family, idolised by his mother"". David Wails' brother Andrew said: ""For us as a family it's been devastating to lose our much loved son, brother and uncle."" In a statement, the Bennett family described Mr Ritchie-Bennett as a ""devoted and loving husband"" and ""a man who cared strongly about family"". The park had been busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, described Saadallah as ""a committed jihadist"". She said: ""He has caused unspeakable hurt and distress to the families of the three men who were brutally murdered as they were relaxing and enjoying socialising with friends on a Saturday evening. ""I'm sure there will also be lasting effects on those who were injured in the attack, who were fortunate not to have been even more seriously harmed.""

"Brunch beckons - but Samantha won't be invited A Sex and the City revival is heading to the small screen, more than 20 years after the hit series made its debut. The original HBO show followed the lives of four New York women negotiating work and relationships in the late 90s and early 2000s. But only three of the fab four are returning for the new TV series - Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. Kim Cattrall, who played the popular character Samantha, will not feature. The US network did not say why Cattrall wasn't cast in the revival, titled And Just Like That - a nod to one of the show's original catchphrases. However, Cattrall has had a strained relationship with the show in recent years, and in particular with her former co-star Parker. The new series will consist of 10 half-hour episodes. Production will begin in late spring. The trailer for the HBO Max show gives nothing away; It features numerous shots of New York, but none of the characters is seen on screen. Allow Twitter content?

""I grew up with these characters, and I can't wait to see how their story has evolved in this new chapter, with the honesty, poignancy, humour and the beloved city that has always defined them,"" Sarah Aubrey, head of original content at HBO Max, said in a statement. The original Sex and the City series, created by Darren Star, was based on Candace Bushnell's 1997 book of the same name. It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004. The show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010. A prequel series titled The Carrie Diaries, starring Anna Sophia Robb, aired on The CW in 2013/14. Star also created Netflix showEmily in Paris, and many have drawninevitable comparisons,externalbetween that show and SATC. When it first burst on to our TV screens, Sex and the City was seen as revolutionary - four women talking openly about their love and sex lives, not to mention the sex scenes themselves. The first series of SATC began filming in 1998 Cosmopolitans and rabbit vibrators were trending before trending was a thing. While it was praised by many for its liberating female-led content, it also attracted criticism from some quarters who felt Carrie's ongoing pursuit of Mr Big (Christopher Noth) was not exactly an advert for female independence. It was also accused oftrivialising issues,externalsuch as sexual harassment and for itslack of diversity,external, a criticism levelled at many older showsincluding Friends. Our 20-year affair with Sex and the City Kim Cattrall suggests SATC replacements Sex and the City reaches climax,external Fashion was a hugely influential part of the series - the tutu worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in the opening credits, teamed with a fur coat and heels, was described as""an ensemble rich in cultural resonance"".,external And Manolo Blahnik could never have dreamed of attracting so much publicity for his designer footwear. It was a ratings smash, with the hotly anticipated finale in 2004drawing an audience of 10.6 million viewers in the US.,external In the UK, the final episode waswatched by 4.1m on Channel 4,external. The series was predictably most popular in the 18-34 age group. Many SATC fans will be disappointed that larger-than-life favourite Samantha Jones - played by Kim Cattrall - will not be returning for the sequel series. Samantha was Sex and the City's most outlandish character and arguably, the star of the show. While Miranda was juggling a career and motherhood, Charlotte was focused on marriage and motherhood and Carrie poured her neuroses into her New York Star column, Samantha was the character perhaps harder to relate to but someone we all wanted to be (at least a little). She was fiercely independent and while caring for her friends, she always put her own needs before men. But news Cattrall won't reprise the role in And Just Like That comes as no surprise after years of feud rumours which were later confirmed by the British-born Canadian actress. In 2017,Cattrall told Piers Morganshe had ""never been friends"" with her co-stars. She said there was a ""toxic relationship"" and ruled out appearing in a third Sex and the City movie, denying that her decision was down to pay or ""diva"" demands. Cattrall commented that former co-star Parker ""could have been nicer"" about the situation. A different actress could play Samantha in the future, she suggested. ""I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it and another actress should play it,"" she said. ""Maybe they could make it an African-American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones, or bring in another character."" She latercriticised Parker for being ""cruel""after she sent condolences following the death of Cattrall's brother. In an interview withPeople magazine,externalshortly afterwards, SJP acknowledged Cattrall ""said things that were really hurtful about me"". Parker said: ""So there was no fight; it was completely fabricated, because I actually never responded."" On Monday,Parker replied on Instagram,externalto someone posting that SJP ""didn't tag Samantha Jones"" into her post announcing the new series. ""I don't dislike her. I've never said that. Never would. Samantha isn't part of this story. But she will always be part of us. No matter where we are or what we do. x."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Marks & Spencer has announced that it has bought the Jaeger fashion brand, which fell into administration last November. M&S is taking on the brand, but not Jaeger's scores of shops and concessions. It is now in the process of finalising a deal to buy its products and ""supporting marketing assets"". M&S announced in May 2020 that it planned to stock other complementary brands to boost sales. Since then, it has started to sell products online from the Early Learning Centre, as well as from two designers, Nobody's Child and Ghost London. Richard Price, managing director of M&S Clothing & Home, said: ""We have set out our plans to sell complementary third party brands as part of our Never the Same Again programme to accelerate our transformation and turbocharge online growth. ""In line with this, we have bought the Jaeger brand and are in the final stages of agreeing the purchase of product and supporting marketing assets from the administrators of Jaeger Retail Limited. We expect to fully complete later this month."" In a call with journalists last week, chief executive Steve Rowe said M&S wanted to partner with other brands, largely for its online business, but stressed: ""We have no intention of turning into a department store."" Jaeger had 244 staff and some 63 stores and concessions. In addition, 13 stores closed after administrators were appointed, with the loss of more than 120 posts across stores, head office and distribution. It is unclear if any jobs will be saved. There has been no update from the administrators, FRP. Jaeger was founded in 1884, the same year as Marks & Spencer, which started out as a stall in an open market in Leeds known as Marks' Penny Bazaar. Last week, M&S unveiled quarterly figures showing thatits clothing division had seen sales fall nearly a quarter, although sales of sales of sleepwear had soared. The retailer sold 20% more women's pyjamas during the 13 weeks to 26 December. However, UK revenues for the quarter were Â£2.52bn, 8.2% lower than last year.

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. Read more: Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman heralded as 'a hero' A majority of voters say Trump should resign, according toa new opinion poll from Quinnipiac University,external, with 56% respondents saying that they hold Trump responsible for the riot on Capitol Hill. The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list. Bonnie Watson Coleman is a Democrat congresswoman for New Jersey US Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman
says she has tested positive for Covid-19 â and believes she caught it while
sheltering from rioters in the Capitol building last Wednesday. âI received a positive test
result for Covid-19, and am home resting at this time. While I am experiencing
mild, cold-like symptoms, I remain in good spirits and will continue to work on
behalf of my constituents,âshe said,external. The Capitolâs physician Dr Brian
Moynihan warned on Sunday that âmany members of the House community were in
protective isolation in the large room â some for several hours,"" and said âindividuals
may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infectionâ. An internal FBI bulletin is warning state and local law enforcement that they should prepare for violence by right-wing extremists on Sunday, according to US media who've seen the document. The FBI memo - reportedly issued a week before last week's attack on the US Capitol - identifies credible threats to the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols, from 16 January to 20 January. A violent far-right group known as the Boogaloo is behind these organising efforts, according to the document. It states the Boogaloo movement believes ""an impending insurgency against the government is forthcoming, and some believe they should accelerate the timeline with armed, anti-government actions leading to a civil war"". Members of the movement are calling for the âstormingâ of state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday - and on the day itself. Who are the Boogaloo Bois? The FBI is currently reviewing over 40,000 digital media tips received from the public in recent days, after it appealed for help identifying rioters who joined the Capitol unrest. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Domestic abuse victim - 'He threw me against the wall and strangled me' Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said he hopes to make non-fatal strangulation a specific offence after a call by domestic abuse campaigners. Too many violent offenders' sentences are not tough enough, he said. And he added that strangulation can be a precursor to even more serious crimes against women. Campaigners argue that perpetrators are often only charged with common assault, which carries a maximum of six months in prison. Because non-fatal strangulation may not leave any marks on the victim, prosecutors do not bring more serious charges, they say. Calls for a new non-fatal strangulation offence Change in strangling law 'would save lives' Mr Buckland said:Â ""There are too many violent offenders not getting sentences proportionate to the seriousness of their crimes because in many cases, prosecutors don't have adequate charging options where the victim has been strangled. ""The vast majority of these crimes are committed against women and they are often a precursor to even more serious violence."" The justice secretary hopes the new offence can be included in the Police and Sentencing Bill, although discussions are at an early stage. Campaigners had called for a new offence to be part of the Domestic Abuse Bill. The Conservative peer Baroness Newlove was planning to table an amendment to this bill as it goes through the House of Lords. She won cross-party support during a debate in the Lords last week. But the Ministry of Justice believes that as non-fatal strangulation can be used in situations other than domestic abuse, the legislation should have a broader context. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said strangulation was often a precursor to even more serious attacks on women Welcoming the move, Nogah Ofer, a lawyer with the Centre for Women's Justice, which has been at the forefront of the campaign for a new offence said: ""It is time that as a society we stopped normalising and ignoring strangulation. ""We look forward to police, prosecutors and medical professionals working together to address this with the seriousness it deserves, and hope that survivors of domestic abuse will have greater confidence to seek justice."" Campaigner Rachel Williams, who suffered strangulation during an abusive relationship,tweeted that it was ""a great victory"",external. She was shot and severely injured by her violent partner in 2011, who then killed himself. Last week, the government said that non-fatal strangulation was already covered by existing legislation from common assault to attempted murder. It is now looking at how a new offence was introduced in New Zealand. Parts of Australia and the US have also brought in similar measures. During the Lords debate, crossbench peer Lord Anderson of Ipswich, a QC and former Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, warned that ""hurried law can be bad law"". He asked whether a more generic offence of aggravated assault or recklessly endangering life might cover these circumstances and questioned how strangulation and suffocation would be defined in the law.

ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list. Bonnie Watson Coleman is a Democrat congresswoman for New Jersey US Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman

Moynihan warned on Sunday that âmany members of the House community were in
protective isolation in the large room â some for several hours,"" and said âindividuals

An internal FBI bulletin is warning state and local law enforcement that they should prepare for violence by right-wing extremists on Sunday, according to US media who've seen the document. The FBI memo - reportedly issued a week before last week's attack on the US Capitol - identifies credible threats to the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols, from 16 January to 20 January. A violent far-right group known as the Boogaloo is behind these organising efforts, according to the document. It states the Boogaloo movement believes ""an impending insurgency against the government is forthcoming, and some believe they should accelerate the timeline with armed, anti-government actions leading to a civil war"". Members of the movement are calling for the âstormingâ of state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday - and on the day itself.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Domestic abuse victim - 'He threw me against the wall and strangled me' Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said he hopes to make non-fatal strangulation a specific offence after a call by domestic abuse campaigners. Too many violent offenders' sentences are not tough enough, he said. And he added that strangulation can be a precursor to even more serious crimes against women. Campaigners argue that perpetrators are often only charged with common assault, which carries a maximum of six months in prison.

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. Read more: Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman heralded as 'a hero' A majority of voters say Trump should resign, according toa new opinion poll from Quinnipiac University,external, with 56% respondents saying that they hold Trump responsible for the riot on Capitol Hill. The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team.

says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January.

Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list.

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results.

"Caroline Rice couldn't afford the ink to print off her child's maths homework There are few benefits from lockdown, but one often touted is that people are managing to save a little money: lower transport costs, fewer shop-bought office lunches, cheaper childcare costs and no foreign holidays. Single mum Caroline Rice gives a wry smile when asked if she's managed to squirrel away extra cash over the past few months during pandemic restrictions. ""My spending is up,"" she says. ""The heating costs are higher because it's very cold. I'm having to shop locally because of lockdown, where the prices are slightly higher. The nearest Asda is 12 miles away."" The small savings on little luxuries that many people are making - fewer coffees or restaurant meals - were never an option for her in the first place. Her meagre finances meant the registered child minder, who lives in rural County Fermanagh, was already living week-to-week. Now it seems like day-to-day, she says. ""There's a mental stress, fatigue, in having to check the bank balance every day to see how much I'm down,"" she says. ""My child and I haven't bought any clothes in almost a year."" She's having to home-school her child. Many people wouldn't think twice about printing off their child's maths homework project. Caroline had to write it out by hand because they could not afford the ink. And she is not alone. A new report on the finances of low-income families during the pandemic says they are twice as likely to have increased their spending. It says extra costs for food, energy and remote learning equipment have piled financial pressure on the poor. The study - Pandemic Pressures - was a collaboration between the Resolution Foundation and the Nuffield Foundation-funded Covid Realities research project at the University of York. Dr Ruth Patrick, a social policy lecturer at the University of York, says talk of saving money during the pandemic is ""worlds away"" from the experiences of many low-income parents and carers. ""Parents have found their spending increases, as some of the usual strategies they use to get by on a low income - shopping around for the best deal, going to families and friends for a meal when the cupboards are empty - have become suddenly impossible,"" she said. For Shirley Widdop, an increase in food costs has been one of the biggest issues. The disabled single parent, who lives in Keighley, now has to shield for health reasons. That means using online deliveries a lot. She says: ""There's a minimum basket size [with online orders]. You often have to bulk buy in case there's a problem getting delivery slots."" Shirley Widdop has not saved on life's little luxuries - because she could not afford them in the first place When not shielding, Shirley would seek out food in her supermarket's reduced-price section. ""There used to be just a couple of people. Now there are crowds,"" she says. ""Not everyone has easy access to the internet. And not everyone has a functioning bus service."" The report notes that the pandemic has been marked by a huge reduction in overall spending, with entertainment and social activities restricted by lockdown. Higher-income households have been the main beneficiaries of this ""enforced saving"", as they spend 40% more of their income on recreation and leisure activities than the poorest fifth of households. The report says that in contrast to this overall picture, the pandemic has in many cases made it more expensive to live on a low income with children. More than one in three (36%) low-income households with children have increased their spending during the pandemic so far, compared with about one in six (18%) who have reduced their spending. Among high-income households without children, 13% have increased their spending, compared with 40% who have reduced it. Use of food banks has increased significantly during the pandemic The report highlights three main reasons for these extra pressures: Parents with children at home 24 hours a day have seen higher food and energy bills, while the need to entertain them during the lockdowns has brought additional costs Home-schooling has meant extra costs, such as acquiring laptops, paying for internet access and obtaining additional study materials Families' food costs have risen because of fewer in-store promotions, while shielding has meant using more expensive home delivery options or using more expensive local shops closer to home. It should also be noted, the report says, that these extra spending pressures are squeezing living standards that had stagnated even before the pandemic. To ease the burden, the report says the government should be seeking to maintain the Â£20-a-week rise in Universal Credit (UC) into next year. Otherwise, six million households face having their incomes cut by more than Â£1,000. Mike Brewer, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The pandemic has forced society as a whole to spend less and save more. But these broad spending patterns don't hold true for everyone. ""The extra cost of feeding, schooling and entertaining children 24/7 means that, for many families, lockdowns have made life more expensive to live on a low income."" However, a government spokesperson said measures had been put in place to ""ensure that nobody is left behind"", including extra welfare payments, job protection safeguards, the Â£170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme, and equipment for home-schooling. ""We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond,"" the spokesperson said. Sometimes the overall economic figures can not capture the actual on-the-ground financial reality. The pandemic lockdowns have led to a ""K-shaped"" recovery. Across the entire economy, staying at home has meant less capacity to spend on going out and a surge in savings. But the economic picture is both up and down at the same time, depending on which household. The average picture is composed of wealthier people saving a huge amount and poorer families more squeezed than ever. This report shows how children staying at home have increased food and energy bills. The cost of buying food has increased with fewer store promotions and a requirement to use more expensive local shops. The furlough scheme has kept people paid, but not necessarily on full pay. So the chancellor hopes that the vaccine rollout could unleash pent up demand in the form of huge levels of savings from the already well-off. And yet at the same time, will continue to face pressure over extending support - for example, the Â£20-a-week increase to universal credit.

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. Read more: Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman heralded as 'a hero' A majority of voters say Trump should resign, according toa new opinion poll from Quinnipiac University,external, with 56% respondents saying that they hold Trump responsible for the riot on Capitol Hill. The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list. Bonnie Watson Coleman is a Democrat congresswoman for New Jersey US Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman
says she has tested positive for Covid-19 â and believes she caught it while
sheltering from rioters in the Capitol building last Wednesday. âI received a positive test
result for Covid-19, and am home resting at this time. While I am experiencing
mild, cold-like symptoms, I remain in good spirits and will continue to work on
behalf of my constituents,âshe said,external. The Capitolâs physician Dr Brian
Moynihan warned on Sunday that âmany members of the House community were in
protective isolation in the large room â some for several hours,"" and said âindividuals
may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infectionâ. An internal FBI bulletin is warning state and local law enforcement that they should prepare for violence by right-wing extremists on Sunday, according to US media who've seen the document. The FBI memo - reportedly issued a week before last week's attack on the US Capitol - identifies credible threats to the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols, from 16 January to 20 January. A violent far-right group known as the Boogaloo is behind these organising efforts, according to the document. It states the Boogaloo movement believes ""an impending insurgency against the government is forthcoming, and some believe they should accelerate the timeline with armed, anti-government actions leading to a civil war"". Members of the movement are calling for the âstormingâ of state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday - and on the day itself. Who are the Boogaloo Bois? The FBI is currently reviewing over 40,000 digital media tips received from the public in recent days, after it appealed for help identifying rioters who joined the Capitol unrest. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Morrisons will bar customers who refuse to wear face coverings from its shops amid rising coronavirus infections. From Monday, shoppers who refuse to wear face masks offered by staff will not be allowed inside, unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's also said it would challenge those not wearing a mask or who were shopping in groups. The announcements come amid concerns that social distancing measures are not being adhered to in supermarkets. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is ""concerned"" shops are not enforcing rules strictly enough. ""Ultimately, the most important thing to do now is to make sure that actually enforcement - and of course the compliance with the rules - when people are going into supermarkets are being adhered to,"" Mr Zahawi told Sky News. ""We need to make sure people actually wear masks and follow the one-way system,"" he said. What are the lockdown rules across the UK? Supermarket staff: We're lucky if people wear masks Stricter Covid supermarket rules being considered in Wales What are the social distancing rules? Should I wear a face covering in the supermarket? Morrisons said it had ""introduced and consistently maintained thorough and robust safety measures in all our stores"" since the start of the pandemic. But it said: ""From today we are further strengthening our policy on masks."" Security guards at the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain will be enforcing the new rules. Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: ""Those who are offered a face covering and decline to wear one won't be allowed to shop at Morrisons unless they are medically exempt. ""Our store colleagues are working hard to feed you and your family, please be kind."" Following Morrisons' announcement, Sainsbury's said that it was also putting trained security guards at the front of its stores to challenge shoppers who did not comply. Chief executive Simon Roberts said: ""I've spent a lot of time in our stores reviewing the latest situation over the last few days and on behalf of all my colleagues, I am asking our customers to help us keep everyone safe. ""The vast majority of customers are shopping safely, but I have also seen some customers trying to shop without a mask and shopping in larger family groups. ""Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone. Everyone's care and consideration matters now more than ever."" Earlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi stopped short of saying that supermarket staff should be responsible for enforcing rules on face masks. Enforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, not retailers.Wearing face masks in supermarkets and shops is compulsory across the UK. In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines. This video can not be played How to wear your mask. Hint: it's not any of these three options However, retail industry body the British Retail Consortium said that, workers have faced an increase in incidents of violence and abuse when trying to encourage shoppers to put them on. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: ""Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond. ""Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers."" Under current lockdown restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people must only leave home for essential reasons, such as buying food or medicine. In a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, supermarkets introduced social distancing measures during the UK's first nationwide lockdown last March. They included limits on the numbers of customers in the shops at any one time, protective plastic screens at tills and ""marshals"" to ensure shoppers were maintaining a two-metre distance. But amid rising numbers of infections, some have expressed concerns about a ""lack of visible protections"" implemented by supermarkets in recent weeks. The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturdaythat he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown as people were worried the strict enforcement of rules did not ""appear to be there this time"". ""Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,"" he said. Supermarket Waitrose said that it was taking a ""cautious approach"" to the virus, with marshals checking that customers are wearing face coverings on the door, hand sanitiser stations at its entrances and written communications to shoppers reminding them to maintain their distance. Tesco said it was limiting the number of customers in store and was also reminding customers to wear masks. ""We have clear signage explaining this, and we have packs of face coverings available for purchase near the front of our stores for any customers who have forgotten them."" Meanwhile, Asda announced last week,externalthat it would extend its marshals' hours to 08:00 to 20:00 and increase how often baskets and trollies are cleaned. Shop workers' union Usdaw has also called for firms to apply more stringent measures again. The union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said that it had received reports that ""too many customers are not following necessary safety measures like social distancing, wearing a face covering and only shopping for essential items"". ""It is going to take some time to roll out the vaccine and we cannot afford to be complacent in the meantime, particularly with a new strain sweeping the nation,"" Mr Lillis said. The trade union also suggested that ""'one-in one-out"" policies and proper queuing systems should be reintroduced in supermarkets. It added that these systems should be managed by trained security staff where necessary.

"Southend Hospital's oxygen supply has ""reached a critical situation"" A hospital's oxygen supply has ""reached a critical situation"" due to rising numbers of Covid-19 infections. A document shared with the BBC showed Southend Hospital has had to reduce the amount it uses to treat patients. It said the target range for oxygen levels that should be in patients' blood had been cut from 92% to a baseline of 88-92%. Hospital managing director, Yvonne Blucher, said it was ""working to manage"" the situation. ""We are experiencing high demand for oxygen because of rising numbers of inpatients with Covid-19 and we are working to manage this,"" she said. ""The public can play their part by staying home and, where they cannot, following the 'hands, face, space' advice to cut the spread of the virus."" 'One in 18 have Covid-19' in parts of Essex Covid-19 and 'the end of normal learning' Husband from couple with Down's syndrome dies In the document, from the Mid and South Essex Hospitals Foundation Trust, which has been shared with frontline NHS staff, the oxygen supply was said to have ""reached a critical situation"". It said it was ""imperative we use oxygen efficiently and safely"" and states patients who are being fed oxygen and have an oxygen saturation of above 92% ""should have their oxygen weaned within the target range"", which is now 88-92%. This means very gradually reducing the saturation level. It added that ""maintaining saturations within this target range is safe and no patient will come to harm as a result"". GPs in Essex have told the BBC that the threshold for sending a patient to hospital for supplemental oxygen is if their oxygen saturation is at 92%. A level of 96-100% is deemed normal. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts in England, said there was ""huge pressure"" on hospital oxygen stocks because giving patients extra oxygen was a ""key part"" of coronavirus treatment. He said there were a number of hospitals where this happened in the first phase of coronavirus and over the past few weeks ""similar things have happened"" elsewhere. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts in England, said there was ""huge pressure on oxygen systems"" ""This is the kind of problem that chief executives and trust leadership teams are having to solve day in, day out,"" he said. ""If you [a hospital] push your oxygen to an absolutely critical level, then the thing that you can't do is have the oxygen system break down... so effectively you will have to dial it down, in which case you will probably have to transfer patients to the nearest neighbouring hospital for a short period of time. ""I cannot tell you how much work has been done over the summer and autumn to ensure that people [hospital trusts] have been prepared for this... they knew they would come under pressure if there were to be further waves, as has now proved to be the case."" Essex has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 per 100,000 people in the country, with seven of the 14 council areas in the county in the top 20most infected areas of England. The Mid and South Essex Hospitals Foundation Trust said it was ""imperative we use oxygen efficiently and safely"" By Michelle Roberts, health editor, BBC News Online News of oxygen issues is understandably worrying, but not unexpected. Tanks may be full, but flow is a problem. Many people who are sick with Covid will need extra oxygen to help them breathe. As Covid admissions increase, it can put huge demand on a hospital's piped oxygen supply system to provide this high flow. Hospital bosses have been planning for such scenarios for months, learning from experiences during the first wave of Covid when some trusts ran into difficulties. Many wards have made improvements to their pipework in preparation for a very busy winter, but there is still a limit to what hospitals can provide. When stretched to the maximum, other steps are needed, such transferring patients elsewhere or limiting how much oxygen is pumped to each patient. Southend Hospital has taken this latter measure. Although not ideal, it is not unsafe. Patients will be closely monitored and the trust hopes the situation will improve if new Covid admissions start to go down as people follow the stay at home lockdown rules.

"Medical director Steve Stanaway says numbers of Covid patients are rising at the hospital Hospital staff in Wrexham are under immense pressure after a ""rapid increase"" in seriously ill coronavirus patients, a medical director has warned. Wrexham now has the highest rate of Covid-19 in Wales, with851.7 cases per 100,000 of the population. This is more than double the Welsh average. Steve Stanaway, medical director at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, pleaded with people to abide by rules. ""The worry from a staff's point of view is how much more stretching can we take, how many more staff can we deploy?"" he said. The hospital - which is part of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board - was the latest to suspend routine surgery as it tries to deal with rising numbers of Covid patients. ""That's created more feelings of stress and anxiety, not least to the people who were hoping to get their surgery this week,"" Mr Stanaway said. The health board has postponed the majority of surgeries planned for the next two weeks at Wrexham, although some patients will be offered appointments in Bangor instead. Emergency surgery, upper gastro-intestinal surgery, endoscopy procedures and caesarean sections will continue at the Wrexham hospital. Prof Arpan Guha, acting executive medical director, said: ""There are many patients expecting to undergo an operation in Wrexham over the coming weeks and we recognise how anxious and worried they will already be about having surgery during the current surge of the pandemic. ""We are sorry for any further distress or inconvenience this decision may cause and would like to reassure those affected that we are doing all we can to prioritise patients in the most urgent need of care."" The spike in cases in communities in north-east Waleshas been blamed on the newer ""faster-spreading"" variant. While case rates in many communities have fallen slightly in recent weeks, in Wrexham numbers are continuing to rise. The area now has the highest rate in Wales, followed by Flintshire with 754.6 per 100,000 of the population. Bus services in the area have been affected after28 drivers of Arriva Buses Wales tested positive for Covid-19. Meanwhile, Gwynedd, has the lowest case rate in the whole of Wales, with 110. The average case rate for Wales stands at 435.9, according to the most recent Public Health Wales figures. There have been calls for mass testing - as seen in parts of the south Wales Valleys - in the area as case rates continue to rise, but Wrexham council has said it has no plans to offer this to the wider community. When will I get the vaccine and what does it mean? What are the rules for pubs and restaurants across the UK? Mr Stanaway said the critical care unit and respiratory unit at the Wrexham hospital was now under huge pressure with the number of new patients needing this level of care ""rapidly increasing"" in recent weeks. ""The numbers are really quite alarming"", he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfaston Monday. ""It's a huge amount of disease burden within a community."" Mr Stanaway said there were 125 inpatients being treated with Covid on Sunday night, which he estimatedwas an increase of 117% since Christmas. He said 14 of them where in critical care, with some on ventilators, while 16 where being treated in the hospital's high care respiratory unit - a 45% increase in just four days. ""There are now so many in that unit they've had to expand it to a completely different part of the hospital,"" he said. ""If you look at the graphs of the cases they are going up exponentially, they are terrifying to look at, and I think people are very aware that this is what is happening out in the community around them,"" he said. Mr Stanaway said staff were working tirelessly and under huge amounts of pressure to keep caring for the sickest patients, but it was unclear how much more demand the hospital could take. ""Our current predictions for admissions coming through the door in January are currently sitting at about 350, if you compare that to April, the height of the pandemic, we had 286 people,"" he said. ""It's a lot more, we've already had 112 people in the first nine days of January. And the numbers are going up and up."" He pleaded with people to abide by the rules. ""This virus is hurting, and has hurt, a lot of people within Wrexham and Flintshire,"" he said. ""I can't say it strongly enough... we will get through this, but you just have to play by the rules."" Latest figures show 149 staff were isolating and, with high nursing vacancy rates, staff were under huge pressure and were working tirelessly. ""Of all the years I've worked in the NHS... the resilience, dedication and professionalism our staff are showing is absolutely unbelievable,"" he said. ""But you have to bear in mind that people are tired, people are stressed, and it does put a strain,"" he said. ""We absolutely want to see you if you are unwell, but if you can wait or seek care somewhere else... please do that to give us that little bit of headspace.""

"The NHS says ""this sort of misinformation undermines the hard work of everyone working long hours"" Multiple videos posted online claim to show empty hospitals in the UK as evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has been exaggerated. It has provoked a strong reaction from healthcare officials, who have encouraged the public to heed government advice as coronavirus infections surge - putting pressure on the NHS. Responding to a question about hospital beds being empty, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""When people say that, that is a lie."" They're mostly filmed by individuals walking through quiet hospital corridors and are being posted in Facebook groups and on the Twitter feeds of coronavirus sceptics and anti-lockdown activists. There have been videos taken of dozens of locations and some have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. The number of Covid patients has increased significantly in recent weeks and there areserious concerns about the NHS's ability to copewith the surge. However, because of the way healthcare trusts have reorganised hospitals, often separating Covid patients from others, and cancelling non-urgent care to free up capacity, some parts of hospital buildings will currently look empty.  That doesn't mean hospitals aren't busy. How busy are hospitals in England? Woman fined over 'empty hospitals' Facebook posts We've examined videos from two different locations and sought responses to them from the hospitals. This video can not be played Croydon University Hospital doctor: Covid 'not fake news' A video posted on social media purports to show an empty Croydon University Hospital, with a commentary claiming that the government is exaggerating the scale of the pandemic. The video, posted in three parts, has been viewed thousands of times and shared across multiple anonymous social media accounts. It has prompted other users to make comments below the post that their local hospitals are empty too. Croydon University Hospital is a large centre treating patients on a 24-hour basis. In a statement in response to the video posts, the hospital trust said: ""Contrary to videos circulating online claiming to show our hospital is empty, our services remain extremely busy."" The video starts with the camera entering the main reception room through signs saying ""NO ENTRY"". 'Most dangerous time' of the pandemic, says Whitty The main reception area has a closed coffee shop and the person filming says: ""I've never seen this place so empty."" Responding to the footage, a spokesperson for Croydon Health Services told us: ""We have a one-way system in the main entrance to help with social distancing when entering or leaving the hospital. The video shows this person arriving via the exit. ""The video was also filmed overnight, when the coffee shops would be closed and when we would expect to see our corridors less busy,"" they added. The video shows empty corridors. But there's a good reason the corridors are empty. ""We provide this care in our wards and in other clinical areas - not corridors or waiting rooms,"" said the hospital spokesperson. The man then walks around the outside of the A&E waiting room. ""Urgent treatment - empty. Look at this place,"" says the individual, filming the outside of a waiting room which looks fairly full of people sitting socially distanced. ""Regarding the A&E waiting area, the video shows only the entrance to the department,"" said the hospital. ""Patients brought in by ambulance, or those in a serious condition or requiring admission to hospital, are unlikely to be waiting in this area. ""Perpetuating myths and rumours only undermines their [NHS staff] hard work. It also risks the spread of misinformation, which could lead people to risk their own health and the health of their loved ones,"" said the hospital official. Another set of videos, posted on Twitter but without commentary, shows an individual walking down apparently empty corridors of the Princess Royal Hospital in Bromley on - it's claimed - New Year's Day. The NHS says the footage ""misrepresents what is really happening"". Four clips have been uploaded of someone passing down a corridor with a sign for the critical care unit, with a twitter thread referring to ""spare beds"" and the ""closed bereavement unit"" along with the hashtag ""film your hospital"". The videos have been watched tens of thousands of times, but reveal very little about how this particular hospital is dealing with the pandemic. In response, the King's College NHS Trust say the parts of the hospital dealing with the pandemic are extremely busy: ""This corridor is not representative of what is happening in wards across the hospital, which have seen a more than ten-fold increase in Covid admissions in the space of a month."" The bereavement suite, briefly shown in one of the videos, is apparently closed. But according to the Princess Royal University hospital website, it shuts at 4pm and on bank holidays. In a further clip, the person filming the video appears to enter an urgent care centre and on Twitter questions whether it is ""overrun"". The room looks relatively full of people. This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? One particular Facebook group in the UK dedicated to sharing pictures and videos of empty hospitals, had more than 13,000 members. This group was taken down by Facebook on 8 January. Another similar group subsequently set up was taken down by Facebook on 11 January. The administrators of the original group appear to be linked to another Facebook page promoting a baseless conspiracy about the global Covid pandemic,known as the 'Great Reset' theory. In March last year, several viral videos purported to show empty hospitals across the United States, with the hashtag 'film your hospital' being tweeted by thousands of accounts. This sparked a trend that has been repeated in other countries. These videos in the UK are the latest example of people taking direct action to spread misinformation about the pandemic. The year 2020 ended with a group of people standing outside St Thomas' Hospital in London shouting that the pandemic is a ""hoax"". One doctor witnessed the gathering and posted on Twitter that he was ""disgusted but mostly heartbroken."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for families to be put ""at the heart of our recovery"" from the coronavirus pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has urged the government to ""protect family incomes"" as it deals with the economic effects of coronavirus. In his first speech of the year, he demanded teachers, the armed forces and care workers are left out of the public sector pay freeze. Sir Keir also called for tougher restrictions to be considered for tackling coronavirus. No 10 said the government had ""shown it is prepared to act"". PM acted 'decisively' on England lockdown - Sunak Drop 'absurd' 5% council tax increase - Starmer Millions 'face Â£1,000 benefit cut' Sunak faces backlash over public sector pay freeze With coronavirus restrictions and lockdowns shutting thousands of businesses, the economy was 7.9% smaller in October last year than it had been six months earlier. And the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budgetary Responsibility, predicts that unemployment will rise to 2.6 million by the middle of this year. In his speech, Sir Keir attacked the government for ""having been found wanting at every turn"", accusing Boris Johnson of being ""indecisive"" and acting ""too slow"" over further lockdowns and support for business and families. He said: ""The British people will forgive many things. They know the pandemic is difficult. ""But they also know serial incompetence when they see it - and they know when a prime minister simply isn't up to the job."" But the PM's official spokeswoman rejected the criticism, saying: ""This government has shown it is prepared to act. When given evidence in the morning it has taken action that evening."" Asked by the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether the government should tighten restrictions, such as closing nurseries, Sir Keir said there ""probably is more that we could do [and we] may have to get tougher"". But he did not outline what measures he would recommend, instead saying it was ""time to hear from the scientists what else can be done - and that probably should be done in the next few hours"". The Labour leader said ministers must ""protect family incomes and support businesses"" from the economic effects of previous restrictions and the current lockdown. He added policies must ""make a real difference to millions of people across the country"" and ""put families at the heart of our recovery"". Sir Keir argued theÂ£20-a-week rise given to Universal Credit claimantslast April must continue beyond this April's cut-off point. Council tax increases in England of up to 5% this April must not happen, he said, while calling forthe ban on evictions and repossessions to be extended. The government's pay freeze for at least 1.3 million public sector workers - which does not apply to NHS frontline staff and those earning below Â£24,000 a year - must not go ahead, said Sir Keir. ""I know this isn't everything that's needed,"" he added, ""and after so much suffering we can't go back the status quo. ""We cannot return to an economy where over half our care workers earn less than the living wage, where childcare is among the most expensive in Europe, where our social care system is a national disgrace and where over four million children grow up in poverty."" An opposition leader has no policy leavers to pull. They have to rely on words to persuade the public they are worthy of power. With the next general election an eternity away, Sir Keir Starmer knows the question of competence matters far more to voters than ideology right now. The Labour leader was unsparing in his criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic - accusing the prime minster of serial incompetence, dithering and delay. Sir Keir said the government could reverse planned changes to council tax and universal credit to ease the financial pressure on families. But pressed on how lockdown might be different today if he was in No 10, the Labour leader mirrored the government's messaging. He said there was ""probably"" more that could be done around nurseries and estate agent viewings, but Sir Keir's mantra was listen to the scientists. It's what ministers say endlessly too. Sir Keir argued that, just as a Labour government ""built the welfare state from the rubble"" of World War Two, a future one can ""secure our economy, protect our NHS and rebuild our country so that Britain is the best country to grow up in and the best country to grow old in"". But Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling accused Sir Keir of ""calling for actions the Conservatives are already taking in government"". ""We have delivered an unprecedented Â£280bn package of support to protect jobs, livelihoods and public services through this pandemic,"" she added, including the furlough scheme, the temporary increase to Universal Credit and extra funding for councils. ""The Conservatives will continue to put families and communities at the heart of every decision we take as we deliver on our promises to the British people,"" Ms Milling said. In his Spending Review in November, Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned that the ""economic emergency"" caused by the pandemic had only begun. He promised to take ""extraordinary measures to protect people's jobs and incomes"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Brunch beckons - but Samantha won't be invited A Sex and the City revival is heading to the small screen, more than 20 years after the hit series made its debut. The original HBO show followed the lives of four New York women negotiating work and relationships in the late 90s and early 2000s. But only three of the fab four are returning for the new TV series - Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. Kim Cattrall, who played the popular character Samantha, will not feature. The US network did not say why Cattrall wasn't cast in the revival, titled And Just Like That - a nod to one of the show's original catchphrases. However, Cattrall has had a strained relationship with the show in recent years, and in particular with her former co-star Parker. The new series will consist of 10 half-hour episodes. Production will begin in late spring. The trailer for the HBO Max show gives nothing away; It features numerous shots of New York, but none of the characters is seen on screen. Allow Twitter content?

""I grew up with these characters, and I can't wait to see how their story has evolved in this new chapter, with the honesty, poignancy, humour and the beloved city that has always defined them,"" Sarah Aubrey, head of original content at HBO Max, said in a statement. The original Sex and the City series, created by Darren Star, was based on Candace Bushnell's 1997 book of the same name. It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004. The show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010. A prequel series titled The Carrie Diaries, starring Anna Sophia Robb, aired on The CW in 2013/14. Star also created Netflix showEmily in Paris, and many have drawninevitable comparisons,externalbetween that show and SATC. When it first burst on to our TV screens, Sex and the City was seen as revolutionary - four women talking openly about their love and sex lives, not to mention the sex scenes themselves. The first series of SATC began filming in 1998 Cosmopolitans and rabbit vibrators were trending before trending was a thing. While it was praised by many for its liberating female-led content, it also attracted criticism from some quarters who felt Carrie's ongoing pursuit of Mr Big (Christopher Noth) was not exactly an advert for female independence. It was also accused oftrivialising issues,externalsuch as sexual harassment and for itslack of diversity,external, a criticism levelled at many older showsincluding Friends. Our 20-year affair with Sex and the City Kim Cattrall suggests SATC replacements Sex and the City reaches climax,external Fashion was a hugely influential part of the series - the tutu worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in the opening credits, teamed with a fur coat and heels, was described as""an ensemble rich in cultural resonance"".,external And Manolo Blahnik could never have dreamed of attracting so much publicity for his designer footwear. It was a ratings smash, with the hotly anticipated finale in 2004drawing an audience of 10.6 million viewers in the US.,external In the UK, the final episode waswatched by 4.1m on Channel 4,external. The series was predictably most popular in the 18-34 age group. Many SATC fans will be disappointed that larger-than-life favourite Samantha Jones - played by Kim Cattrall - will not be returning for the sequel series. Samantha was Sex and the City's most outlandish character and arguably, the star of the show. While Miranda was juggling a career and motherhood, Charlotte was focused on marriage and motherhood and Carrie poured her neuroses into her New York Star column, Samantha was the character perhaps harder to relate to but someone we all wanted to be (at least a little). She was fiercely independent and while caring for her friends, she always put her own needs before men. But news Cattrall won't reprise the role in And Just Like That comes as no surprise after years of feud rumours which were later confirmed by the British-born Canadian actress. In 2017,Cattrall told Piers Morganshe had ""never been friends"" with her co-stars. She said there was a ""toxic relationship"" and ruled out appearing in a third Sex and the City movie, denying that her decision was down to pay or ""diva"" demands. Cattrall commented that former co-star Parker ""could have been nicer"" about the situation. A different actress could play Samantha in the future, she suggested. ""I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it and another actress should play it,"" she said. ""Maybe they could make it an African-American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones, or bring in another character."" She latercriticised Parker for being ""cruel""after she sent condolences following the death of Cattrall's brother. In an interview withPeople magazine,externalshortly afterwards, SJP acknowledged Cattrall ""said things that were really hurtful about me"". Parker said: ""So there was no fight; it was completely fabricated, because I actually never responded."" On Monday,Parker replied on Instagram,externalto someone posting that SJP ""didn't tag Samantha Jones"" into her post announcing the new series. ""I don't dislike her. I've never said that. Never would. Samantha isn't part of this story. But she will always be part of us. No matter where we are or what we do. x."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

The Devon-based company told BBC News the stickers were programmed with ""scalar energy"", which the scientists' equipment would be unable to detect. Energydots markets a range of stickers, including the SmartDot, the SleepDot and even the PetDot. BBC News bought five SmartDots - a special offer for Â£55 - and sent them to the university's 6th Generation Innovation Centre. Researchers tested 4G mobile phones and wi-fi access points with and without the stickers applied to them. Amazon is investigating the Energydots products And a spokesman for the lab said: ""We could not find any evidence that these products had any effect on frequency or power when used as instructed."" An Energydots spokeswoman told BBC News: ""We state clearly that our products harmonise the fields. ""And the way to test this is to assess via biological testing."" Last November, the company published a press release saying it was extremely proud to announce a partnership with the NHS that would see ""brand-new patient engagement units"" installed in Torbay and Royal College of London hospitals. At the time, an Energydots spokeswoman told BBC News adverts for its products would appear in the two hospitals, though she clarified the London hospital was in fact University College Hospital. But a Torbay Hospital spokesman then told BBC News it knew nothing of this partnership. And within hours, the press release had disappeared from the company's website. Energydots later said there had been a misunderstanding with the agency that had promised to organise the adverts. Its stickers are among a wide range of products on Amazon from companies offering electric-and-magnetic-field (EMF) protection. Energydots also suggests placing its SmartDot stickers on wi-fi routers These include protective clothing, canopies to be placed over beds and even devices that block radiation from wi-fi routers - making them effectively useless. An Amazon spokesman told BBC News it: was investigating the Energydots products required sellers to provide accurate information on products pages removed listings making misleading claims or raising safety concerns Campaigners claiming radiation from mobile phones and other devices poses a health risk have stepped up protests as 5G networks are rolled out. Energydots also makes it claims helps tackle wireless radiation But most scientists say even the higher part of the electromagnetic spectrum that may be used by 5G should not harm humans. International guidelines limit radio-wave exposure. And within those limits, there are no known consequences for health, the World Health Organization says.

"Lisa Montgomery - the only female inmate on federal death row in the US - has been executed for murder in the state of Indiana. Her lawyers had argued she was a mentally ill victim of abuse who deserved mercy. Her victim's community said otherwise. This story was first published on 11 January - before Lisa Montgomery's execution on 13 January. For Diane Mattingly, there is one moment from her childhood for which she feels both enormous gratitude and guilt. She credits this moment for her ""fairly normal"" life - a house on eight peaceful acres, a loving relationship with her children, nearly two decades at a job working for the state of Kentucky. At the same time, she blames it for the fate of her younger half-sister, Lisa Montgomery. Montgomery was sentenced for the murder of a 23-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant. In December 2004, Montgomery, who was 36 at the time, strangled Bobbie Jo Stinnett before cutting the baby out of her womb and kidnapping it. Stinnett bled to death. Mattingly and Montgomery lived together until Mattingly was eight and her half-sister was four. It was a terrifying household, she says, where physical, psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of Judy Shaughnessy, Montgomery's mother, and her boyfriends was routine. The girls' biological father left the home, and after a while, Mattingly was whisked away to foster care. Montgomery was left behind with her mother. Lisa Montgomery and her half-sister Diane Mattingly as children It would be 34 years before the half-sisters would see each other again. And that would be from across a courtroom, where lawyers for the US government were trying to persuade a jury to sentence Montgomery to death. ""One sister got taken out and got put into a loving home and was nurtured and had time to heal,"" says Mattingly. ""The other sister stayed in that situation, and it got worse and worse and worse. And then at the end, she was broken."" In late December, Montgomery's legal team submitted a petition to President Donald Trump that makes the case that after a lifetime of abuse - which they characterise as torture - she is too mentally ill to be executed and deserves mercy. However, in the tiny town of Skidmore, Missouri, where the crime was committed, there is little sympathy for that argument. Many there believe the final moments of Bobbie Jo Stinnett were so horrific, the death sentence is warranted. Lisa Montgomery and Bobbie Jo Stinnett got to know each other online through a shared love of dogs. They had corresponded for weeks on an online forum for rat terrier breeders and enthusiasts called ""Ratter Chatter"". Montgomery told Stinnett that she was also expecting, and the pair shared pregnancy stories. In December 2004, Montgomery drove 281.5 km (175 miles) from her home in Kansas to Skidmore, where she had an appointment to look at some puppies owned by Stinnett. But it wasn't Montgomery that Stinnett was expecting, it was a woman who went by the name of Darlene Fischer. But Fischer was a name that Montgomery had been using when she separately began messaging Stinnett from a different email address inquiring about buying one of her puppies. When Stinnett answered the door, Montgomery overpowered the pregnant woman, strangled her with a piece of rope, and cut the baby out of her womb. Bobbie Jo Stinnett Investigators quickly realised that ""Darlene Fischer"" did not exist, and tracked Montgomery down the next day using her emails and computer IP address. They found her cradling a new-born girl she claimed to have given birth to the previous day. Her story quickly fell apart and she confessed to the killing. Since 2008, Montgomery has been held in a federal prison in Texas for female inmates with special medical and psychological needs, where she has been receiving psychiatric care. Since receiving her execution date, she's been placed on suicide watch in an isolated cell. Montgomery is scheduled to be put to death by a lethal injection of pentobarbital at Terre Haute prison in Indiana. It is the only federal prison with an active death chamber. Terre Haute Prison, Indiana Montgomery's lawyers argue that because of a combination of years of horrific abuse, and a raft of psychological issues, she should never have been given the death penalty. They believe that at the time of the crime, Montgomery was psychotic and out of touch with reality. They have been joined by a chorus of supportive voices from the legal field, including 41 former and current prosecutors, as well as human rights entities like the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. However, calls for Trump to be merciful are hardly unanimous. According to Gallup, while support for the death penalty in the US is at its lowest level in more than 50 years, 55% of Americans still believe it is an appropriate punishment for murder. And nowhere is that support more palpably felt in this case than in Skidmore. ""Bobbie deserves to be here today. Bobbie's family deserves her,"" says Meagan Morrow, a high school classmate of Stinnett's. ""And Lisa deserves to pay."" Information and support If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. Lisa Montgomery's current legal team has conducted some 450 interviews with family members, friends, case workers, doctors and social workers. Stitched together, they form a tapestry of family dysfunction, abuse, neglect, professional negligence, substance abuse and untreated mental illness. ""The whole story is tragic,"" says Kelley Henry, one of Montgomery's federal defence lawyers. ""But one of the things that the president can do is say - to women who have been trafficked, and who have been sexually abused - 'Your abuse matters'."" For Montgomery, her lawyers argue, it began before she was born. According to an interview with her father, Montgomery's mother Judy Shaughnessy drank heavily throughout her pregnancy, and their daughter was born with foetal alcohol syndrome. Multiple medical experts have given statements agreeing with that diagnosis. Judy Shaughnessy, Lisa Montgomery's mother When Mattingly and Montgomery were young, Shaughnessy beat them and doled out cruel forms of punishment, like taping Montgomery's mouth shut, or pushing Mattingly out into the snow, naked. After their biological father left the home, Mattingly says they were left alone with Shaughnessy's boyfriends, at least one of whom started raping Mattingly. ""Judy was manipulative and - I hate to use this word, but - evil. She enjoyed torturing the people around her,"" says Mattingly. ""She got joy out of it."" After Mattingly was removed from the home by social services, Montgomery fell prey to her mother's new husband, who according to statements from his other children, was a violent alcoholic who began sexually abusing Montgomery when she was a pre-teen. The family moved from place to place dozens of times, but it was in a trailer in Sperry, Oklahoma, where her lawyers say the abuse turned into something more akin to torture. According to interviews with her half-siblings and others who spent time with the family, Montgomery's stepfather built a shed onto the trailer where he, and eventually his friends, raped and beat her. Her mother also began trafficking her, allowing handymen like electricians and plumbers to sexually abuse Montgomery in exchange for work on the house. Watch on BBC iPlayer Execution: Lisa Montgomery's story As a teenager, Montgomery confided in a cousin, telling him the men would tie her up, beat her and even urinate on her afterwards. But the cousin, a sheriff's deputy, confessed to Montgomery's current legal team that he did nothing. In fact, he drove her back home and dropped her off in the hands of her abusers. Lawyer Kelley Henry says one of the things that disturbs her most is that adults in positions of authority were told about what was going on but did nothing. When Shaughnessy eventually split from her second husband, she and Montgomery testified in divorce proceedings about the sexual assaults. The judge in the case scolded Shaughnessy for not reporting the abuse - but did not report the abuse himself. ""There were so many opportunities where people could have intervened and prevented this,"" says Henry. Kelley Henry Montgomery's cousin told her legal team that he lived with ""regret for not speaking up about what happened to Lisa"". When she was 18, Montgomery married her stepbrother. The couple had four children in five years, but the relationship was not the escape from violence that Montgomery might have hoped it would be. At one point, one of Montgomery's brothers found a home movie that showed Montgomery's husband raping and beating her. ""It was violent and like a scene out of a horror movie,"" he said in a statement. ""I felt sick watching the video. I didn't know what to do or how to talk to my sister about it."" Friends and family began noticing Montgomery's tendency to slip into ""a world of her own"". Her children were disturbed by it. Henry says this was an early sign of her mental illnesses, which include bipolar disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorder and traumatic brain injury. Montgomery eventually divorced her first husband and married Kevin Montgomery. Around this time, she repeatedly claimed to be pregnant again, although she had undergone sterilisation after her fourth baby was born. One theory her lawyers put forward regarding the chain of events that led to the murder, is that Montgomery feared her ex-husband would expose her lies about being pregnant and use it against her as he sought custody of their children. ""There was so much pressure on her at that point,"" says Henry. She describes Montgomery's ex-husband as cruel and harassing. ""She was completely detached from reality."" Her lawyers say that as she lost touch with reality, she fantasised about being pregnant. Henry says Montgomery's original legal defence after she was arrested and charged with murder was woefully inadequate, and presented few of the details about her abuse, trauma and mental illness. Her lawyers at the time also presented an alternative theory of the crime, which was that Montgomery's brother had actually committed the murder, even though he had an alibi. That was ultimately dropped in favour of an insanity defence, but Henry believes the damage to Montgomery's credibility was already done. After five hours of deliberation, the jury found Montgomery guilty. They recommended a sentence of death. Diane Mattingly Diane Mattingly has been speaking publicly for the first time in the hope it can make a difference. ""I would say, 'President Trump, I want you to look at the life that Lisa had led, I want to look at all the people that have failed her, I want you to look at the rape, the torture, the mental abuse, the physical abuse that this woman had endured,'"" she says. ""I'm asking him to have compassion on her as a person that has been failed over and over and over again. And to not fail her."" The tiny farming town of Skidmore sits in the far northwest corner of Missouri. A generation ago, it was the kind of place where you could ""get your hair cut, see a show, buy rabbit feed and eat dinner"" - but those days are long gone. Today there is a single restaurant and few of the streets are paved. The population hovers around just 250, and everyone knew Bobbie Jo Stinnett and her family. Friends recall her as a good student with a love of horses and dogs. She liked going down to the Nodaway River to swim, and playing Nintendo games at slumber parties. She was quiet and kind, they say. At the time of her murder, she was newly married and pregnant with her first child. Although the alumni have scattered somewhat, in recent years, the Nodaway-Holt R-VII High School graduating class of 2000 - which had only 22 members - has a tradition to mark the anniversary of the death of their classmate Bobbie Jo Stinnett. They hold a collection and try to do something nice for Stinnett's mother. ""Last year, we got flowers, and gave her a $100-plus gift card and then paid her water bill,"" says Jena Baumli. The murder 16 years ago is never far from the minds of the town's residents. Bobbie Jo Stinnett For one thing, the wider world won't let them forget. It has been the subject of two books, multiple true crime television shows, documentaries and countless podcast episodes. And though there's been much recent debate over the fairness of Montgomery's sentence in courthouses and in the opinion pages of newspapers like the New York Times, a similar debate does not exist here. ""I think that in a lot of the opinion pieces that are being posted, in a lot of things that people are sharing, Bobbie Jo and her daughter, and her mother and her husband and other friends and family, are kind of being forgotten,"" says Tiffany Kirkland, another member of the class of 2000. ""She always wanted to be a mom,"" says Baumli. ""She was really the first one to have a decent marriage, you know, and I guess looking at Bobbie Jo was like, what your dreams were when you were younger."" Because of Stinnett's easy-going reputation, Morrow remembers instantly dismissing the initial reports of her murder. ""I was like, 'Oh, she was not.' You know, like, that doesn't happen to Bobbie,"" Morrow says. But what happened at the modest clapboard house where Stinnett lived with her husband still haunts some of those involved in the investigation. Nodaway County Sheriff Randy Strong says that the scene that he and his four colleagues found that day was so bloody, they are still traumatised by it. It makes him even angrier that it was Stinnett's mother who discovered her that way. ""The people that are defending [Montgomery], I wish I could take them back in time, and put them in that room,"" he says. ""And then go, 'Look at this body'. And then go, 'Stand there and listen to the 911 call of [Stinnett's mother]. This is the stuff of nightmares."" Randy Strong, Nodaway County Sheriff Many of the residents of Skidmore cite the details of the crime, and the amount of planning that went into it, as evidence that Montgomery was a calculating killer. She had catfished Stinnett online under a fake name. She had bought supplies, including a home birth kit, and searched online for how to perform a caesarean section. Sheriff Strong insists that the crime was meticulously planned and that the woman he arrested continued to lie until backed into a corner. Dr Katherine Porterfield, a clinical psychologist who evaluated Montgomery and spent about 18 hours with her, says that psychosis does not always look the way people expect it to. ""Being psychotic, it does not mean you are not intelligent, nor that you cannot act in a planful way,"" she says. ""We've seen crime for years and years in our country in which people enact terrible violence coming out of a psychotic set of beliefs or thought process. Lisa Montgomery is no different. She enacted this in the grip of a very broken mind."" The baby was returned to her father, after being recovered from Montgomery. Bobbie Jo Stinnett's home lies empty today Bobbie Jo's mother and husband have have not spoken publicly in many years. But Strong says this is the first year he's heard directly from Stinnett's husband. He thanked the sheriff for recovering his daughter and allowing him to be the parent that his wife couldn't be. ""I cried,"" says Strong. ""The whole community over there's traumatised by this."" School friend Baumli says she's read the descriptions of Montgomery's abuse, but it mostly just makes her angry. She says it's not as if all the other people of Skidmore lead idyllic lives free from abuse, poverty and other destructive tragedies. She gives herself as an example - when Stinnett was murdered, Baumli was in rehab for a drug addiction. She missed the funeral because of it. ""Let's say I didn't stay clean very long,"" she says. ""I'm sick of hearing about Lisa Montgomery and what she went through. And it's never about what my friend went through,"" she adds. ""I get these images in my head of [Bobbie Jo's mother] finding her daughter that way."" Three federal inmates - Orlando Hall, Alfred Bourgeois and Brandon Bernard - have been put to death since the 3 November presidential election. Several high-profile figures had appealed for clemencyin Brandon's casebut Mr Trump did not heed those calls. President-elect Joe Biden has already pledged to end death penalty proceedings, although he hasn't said when. Until July 2020, there had been no federal executions for 17 years. At state level, the number of sentences and executions continuesa historic decline,external. Only 18 death sentences were handed down in 2020 and the number of executions carried out hit a 30-year low. More recently, the states that have been carrying out executions, such as Texas and Tennessee, have halted and delayed executions because of the pandemic. However, the executions ordered by President Trump are continuing. If they all go ahead, the federal government will have executed more people than any administration in nearly 100 years. Protest against federal executions of death row inmates - outside the US Justice Department, Washington DC, December 2020 Two other inmates are scheduled to die at Terre Haute prison before Mr Trump's presidency ends. Recently, there has been a virus outbreak on death row at the institution, and previous executions have been linked to outbreaks among the execution team and prison staff. ""They made this a priority at the risk of the health and lives of corrections officials, of the prisoners on death row, and the communities that all of those Bureau of Prisons officials who flew in from across the country were returning to,"" says Ngozi Ndulue, senior director of research and special projects at the Death Penalty Information Center. ""This was a very coordinated and determined plan to ensure that as many people could be executed on federal death row as possible before the end of this administration term."" Montgomery's lawyers want her sentence commuted to a life sentence, which would allow her to remain under psychiatric care in prison for the rest of her days. Mattingly says looking back to the moment life changed for her as an eight-year-old, she feels guilty that when the social workers came for her, she didn't tell them what was going on in that house. ""If I had, would they have taken Lisa out of the home also?"" she says. ""There's so many people that failed her throughout her whole life. And I am just asking for somebody - once - not to fail her."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

Henry says Montgomery's original legal defence after she was arrested and charged with murder was woefully inadequate, and presented few of the details about her abuse, trauma and mental illness. Her lawyers at the time also presented an alternative theory of the crime, which was that Montgomery's brother had actually committed the murder, even though he had an alibi. That was ultimately dropped in favour of an insanity defence, but Henry believes the damage to Montgomery's credibility was already done. After five hours of deliberation, the jury found Montgomery guilty. They recommended a sentence of death. Diane Mattingly Diane Mattingly has been speaking publicly for the first time in the hope it can make a difference. ""I would say, 'President Trump, I want you to look at the life that Lisa had led, I want to look at all the people that have failed her, I want you to look at the rape, the torture, the mental abuse, the physical abuse that this woman had endured,'"" she says. ""I'm asking him to have compassion on her as a person that has been failed over and over and over again. And to not fail her."" The tiny farming town of Skidmore sits in the far northwest corner of Missouri. A generation ago, it was the kind of place where you could ""get your hair cut, see a show, buy rabbit feed and eat dinner"" - but those days are long gone. Today there is a single restaurant and few of the streets are paved. The population hovers around just 250, and everyone knew Bobbie Jo Stinnett and her family. Friends recall her as a good student with a love of horses and dogs. She liked going down to the Nodaway River to swim, and playing Nintendo games at slumber parties. She was quiet and kind, they say. At the time of her murder, she was newly married and pregnant with her first child. Although the alumni have scattered somewhat, in recent years, the Nodaway-Holt R-VII High School graduating class of 2000 - which had only 22 members - has a tradition to mark the anniversary of the death of their classmate Bobbie Jo Stinnett. They hold a collection and try to do something nice for Stinnett's mother. ""Last year, we got flowers, and gave her a $100-plus gift card and then paid her water bill,"" says Jena Baumli. The murder 16 years ago is never far from the minds of the town's residents. Bobbie Jo Stinnett For one thing, the wider world won't let them forget. It has been the subject of two books, multiple true crime television shows, documentaries and countless podcast episodes. And though there's been much recent debate over the fairness of Montgomery's sentence in courthouses and in the opinion pages of newspapers like the New York Times, a similar debate does not exist here. ""I think that in a lot of the opinion pieces that are being posted, in a lot of things that people are sharing, Bobbie Jo and her daughter, and her mother and her husband and other friends and family, are kind of being forgotten,"" says Tiffany Kirkland, another member of the class of 2000. ""She always wanted to be a mom,"" says Baumli. ""She was really the first one to have a decent marriage, you know, and I guess looking at Bobbie Jo was like, what your dreams were when you were younger."" Because of Stinnett's easy-going reputation, Morrow remembers instantly dismissing the initial reports of her murder. ""I was like, 'Oh, she was not.' You know, like, that doesn't happen to Bobbie,"" Morrow says. But what happened at the modest clapboard house where Stinnett lived with her husband still haunts some of those involved in the investigation. Nodaway County Sheriff Randy Strong says that the scene that he and his four colleagues found that day was so bloody, they are still traumatised by it. It makes him even angrier that it was Stinnett's mother who discovered her that way. ""The people that are defending [Montgomery], I wish I could take them back in time, and put them in that room,"" he says. ""And then go, 'Look at this body'. And then go, 'Stand there and listen to the 911 call of [Stinnett's mother]. This is the stuff of nightmares."" Randy Strong, Nodaway County Sheriff Many of the residents of Skidmore cite the details of the crime, and the amount of planning that went into it, as evidence that Montgomery was a calculating killer. She had catfished Stinnett online under a fake name. She had bought supplies, including a home birth kit, and searched online for how to perform a caesarean section. Sheriff Strong insists that the crime was meticulously planned and that the woman he arrested continued to lie until backed into a corner. Dr Katherine Porterfield, a clinical psychologist who evaluated Montgomery and spent about 18 hours with her, says that psychosis does not always look the way people expect it to. ""Being psychotic, it does not mean you are not intelligent, nor that you cannot act in a planful way,"" she says. ""We've seen crime for years and years in our country in which people enact terrible violence coming out of a psychotic set of beliefs or thought process. Lisa Montgomery is no different. She enacted this in the grip of a very broken mind."" The baby was returned to her father, after being recovered from Montgomery. Bobbie Jo Stinnett's home lies empty today Bobbie Jo's mother and husband have have not spoken publicly in many years. But Strong says this is the first year he's heard directly from Stinnett's husband. He thanked the sheriff for recovering his daughter and allowing him to be the parent that his wife couldn't be. ""I cried,"" says Strong. ""The whole community over there's traumatised by this."" School friend Baumli says she's read the descriptions of Montgomery's abuse, but it mostly just makes her angry. She says it's not as if all the other people of Skidmore lead idyllic lives free from abuse, poverty and other destructive tragedies. She gives herself as an example - when Stinnett was murdered, Baumli was in rehab for a drug addiction. She missed the funeral because of it. ""Let's say I didn't stay clean very long,"" she says. ""I'm sick of hearing about Lisa Montgomery and what she went through. And it's never about what my friend went through,"" she adds. ""I get these images in my head of [Bobbie Jo's mother] finding her daughter that way."" Three federal inmates - Orlando Hall, Alfred Bourgeois and Brandon Bernard - have been put to death since the 3 November presidential election. Several high-profile figures had appealed for clemencyin Brandon's casebut Mr Trump did not heed those calls. President-elect Joe Biden has already pledged to end death penalty proceedings, although he hasn't said when. Until July 2020, there had been no federal executions for 17 years. At state level, the number of sentences and executions continuesa historic decline,external. Only 18 death sentences were handed down in 2020 and the number of executions carried out hit a 30-year low. More recently, the states that have been carrying out executions, such as Texas and Tennessee, have halted and delayed executions because of the pandemic. However, the executions ordered by President Trump are continuing. If they all go ahead, the federal government will have executed more people than any administration in nearly 100 years. Protest against federal executions of death row inmates - outside the US Justice Department, Washington DC, December 2020 Two other inmates are scheduled to die at Terre Haute prison before Mr Trump's presidency ends. Recently, there has been a virus outbreak on death row at the institution, and previous executions have been linked to outbreaks among the execution team and prison staff. ""They made this a priority at the risk of the health and lives of corrections officials, of the prisoners on death row, and the communities that all of those Bureau of Prisons officials who flew in from across the country were returning to,"" says Ngozi Ndulue, senior director of research and special projects at the Death Penalty Information Center. ""This was a very coordinated and determined plan to ensure that as many people could be executed on federal death row as possible before the end of this administration term."" Montgomery's lawyers want her sentence commuted to a life sentence, which would allow her to remain under psychiatric care in prison for the rest of her days. Mattingly says looking back to the moment life changed for her as an eight-year-old, she feels guilty that when the social workers came for her, she didn't tell them what was going on in that house. ""If I had, would they have taken Lisa out of the home also?"" she says. ""There's so many people that failed her throughout her whole life. And I am just asking for somebody - once - not to fail her."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for families to be put ""at the heart of our recovery"" from the coronavirus pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has urged the government to ""protect family incomes"" as it deals with the economic effects of coronavirus. In his first speech of the year, he demanded teachers, the armed forces and care workers are left out of the public sector pay freeze. Sir Keir also called for tougher restrictions to be considered for tackling coronavirus. No 10 said the government had ""shown it is prepared to act"". PM acted 'decisively' on England lockdown - Sunak Drop 'absurd' 5% council tax increase - Starmer Millions 'face Â£1,000 benefit cut' Sunak faces backlash over public sector pay freeze With coronavirus restrictions and lockdowns shutting thousands of businesses, the economy was 7.9% smaller in October last year than it had been six months earlier. And the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budgetary Responsibility, predicts that unemployment will rise to 2.6 million by the middle of this year. In his speech, Sir Keir attacked the government for ""having been found wanting at every turn"", accusing Boris Johnson of being ""indecisive"" and acting ""too slow"" over further lockdowns and support for business and families. He said: ""The British people will forgive many things. They know the pandemic is difficult. ""But they also know serial incompetence when they see it - and they know when a prime minister simply isn't up to the job."" But the PM's official spokeswoman rejected the criticism, saying: ""This government has shown it is prepared to act. When given evidence in the morning it has taken action that evening."" Asked by the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether the government should tighten restrictions, such as closing nurseries, Sir Keir said there ""probably is more that we could do [and we] may have to get tougher"". But he did not outline what measures he would recommend, instead saying it was ""time to hear from the scientists what else can be done - and that probably should be done in the next few hours"". The Labour leader said ministers must ""protect family incomes and support businesses"" from the economic effects of previous restrictions and the current lockdown. He added policies must ""make a real difference to millions of people across the country"" and ""put families at the heart of our recovery"". Sir Keir argued theÂ£20-a-week rise given to Universal Credit claimantslast April must continue beyond this April's cut-off point. Council tax increases in England of up to 5% this April must not happen, he said, while calling forthe ban on evictions and repossessions to be extended. The government's pay freeze for at least 1.3 million public sector workers - which does not apply to NHS frontline staff and those earning below Â£24,000 a year - must not go ahead, said Sir Keir. ""I know this isn't everything that's needed,"" he added, ""and after so much suffering we can't go back the status quo. ""We cannot return to an economy where over half our care workers earn less than the living wage, where childcare is among the most expensive in Europe, where our social care system is a national disgrace and where over four million children grow up in poverty."" An opposition leader has no policy leavers to pull. They have to rely on words to persuade the public they are worthy of power. With the next general election an eternity away, Sir Keir Starmer knows the question of competence matters far more to voters than ideology right now. The Labour leader was unsparing in his criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic - accusing the prime minster of serial incompetence, dithering and delay. Sir Keir said the government could reverse planned changes to council tax and universal credit to ease the financial pressure on families. But pressed on how lockdown might be different today if he was in No 10, the Labour leader mirrored the government's messaging. He said there was ""probably"" more that could be done around nurseries and estate agent viewings, but Sir Keir's mantra was listen to the scientists. It's what ministers say endlessly too. Sir Keir argued that, just as a Labour government ""built the welfare state from the rubble"" of World War Two, a future one can ""secure our economy, protect our NHS and rebuild our country so that Britain is the best country to grow up in and the best country to grow old in"". But Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling accused Sir Keir of ""calling for actions the Conservatives are already taking in government"". ""We have delivered an unprecedented Â£280bn package of support to protect jobs, livelihoods and public services through this pandemic,"" she added, including the furlough scheme, the temporary increase to Universal Credit and extra funding for councils. ""The Conservatives will continue to put families and communities at the heart of every decision we take as we deliver on our promises to the British people,"" Ms Milling said. In his Spending Review in November, Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned that the ""economic emergency"" caused by the pandemic had only begun. He promised to take ""extraordinary measures to protect people's jobs and incomes"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Khairi Saadallah admitted three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder A killer who stabbed three men to death in a Reading park has been handed a whole-life jail term. Khairi Saadallah murdered James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and 39-year-old Joe Ritchie-Bennett, in June last year in Forbury Gardens. London's Old Bailey previously heard the 26-year-old ""executed"" the men as an ""act of religious jihad"". Passing sentence Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said it was a ""ruthless and brutal"" terror attack. Saadallah, who admitted the murders, had also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of three other men who were also in the park. The judge said the victims ""had no chance to react, let alone defend themselves"". (L-R) David Wails, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and James Furlong were pronounced dead at the scene He said he was sure the attack ""involved a substantial degree of premeditation or planning"" and was carried out ""for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause"". BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson, who was in court, said the families of James Furlong and David Wails were present, while Joseph Ritchie-Bennett's loved ones watched via a link from America. Saadallah showed no emotion as Mr Justice Sweeney went through his sentencing remarks. On the afternoon of 20 June, the park was busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England. Andrew Cafe, who witnessed the stabbings, said he saw Saadallah wielding the ""biggest kitchen knife"" and charging towards him shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". Pharmaceutical manager Mr Ritchie-Bennett and teacher Mr Furlong died from single stab wounds to their necks, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed once in the back. Despite treatment from paramedics and doctors, all three friends, who were members of the LGBT community, died at the scene. This video can not be played Witness Andrew Cafe visited Forbury Gardens for the first time since the attack Three other people - Nishit Nisudan, Patrick Edwards and Stephen Young - were also injured, before Saadallah threw away the knife and fled the scene, pursued by police. Following his arrest, Saadallah initially said he wanted to plead guilty to the ""jihad that I done"", but the prosecution claimed he later feigned mental illness in police interviews. At a previous hearing, the court heard he had developed an emotionally unstable and anti-social personality disorder, with his behaviour worsened by alcohol and cannabis misuse. But the judge said it was ""clear that the defendant did not, and does not, have any major mental illness"". Reading attack: 'We did all we could to save them' Reading killer left jail two weeks before attack Reading stabbings: Who were the victims? An examination of Saadallah's phone revealed an interest in extremist material, including images of the flag of Islamic State andJihadi John, the court previously heard. While at HMP Bullingdon in 2017, he was seen to associate with radical preacher Omar Brookes, who has connections with banned terrorist organisation Al-Muhajiroun. The court heard Saadallah, who arrived in Britain from Libya in 2012, had previously been involved with militias who had been part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, and was pictured handling weapons, including firearms. Since seeking asylum in Britain, he had been repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences, including theft and assault, between 2013 and 2020. This video can not be played CCTV cameras captured Khairi Saadallah before and after the stabbing He briefly came to the attention of MI5 in 2019, but the information provided did not meet the threshold of investigation. Saadallah had been released from prison on 5 June, days before the attack, the court heard. On 17 June, he researched the location for his attack online and carried out reconnaissance in the park. The following day his probation officer alerted his mental health team over comments he made about magic. A day later, Saadallah contacted the crisis team himself, but when they visited he did not answer. Following concerns from his brother, police visited the killer the same day, but he told officers he was ""alright"" while he stood near a knife he bought from a supermarket. Andrew Wails said losing his brother had been devastating After the sentencing, James Furlong's father, Gary, said: ""The secretary of state needs to tell us why this guy wasn't put into some form of detention centre before they could deport him. ""He was not safe to be released back on the streets."" Referring to the fact that Saadallah had been visited by police the night before the attack, Mr Furlong said: ""Given the volume of crimes he's committed and the information that they had on him, for an assessment to be done the night before to say that he's not a danger to the public - it is beyond me."" He described Mr Furlong, originally from Liverpool, as ""a lovely man, loved by his family, idolised by his mother"". David Wails' brother Andrew said: ""For us as a family it's been devastating to lose our much loved son, brother and uncle."" In a statement, the Bennett family described Mr Ritchie-Bennett as a ""devoted and loving husband"" and ""a man who cared strongly about family"". The park had been busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, described Saadallah as ""a committed jihadist"". She said: ""He has caused unspeakable hurt and distress to the families of the three men who were brutally murdered as they were relaxing and enjoying socialising with friends on a Saturday evening. ""I'm sure there will also be lasting effects on those who were injured in the attack, who were fortunate not to have been even more seriously harmed.""

"This video can not be played Professor Whitty: ""We need to really double down â this is everybodyâs problem"" The UK will go through the ""most dangerous time"" of the pandemic in the weeks before vaccine rollout has an impact, England's chief medical officer has warned. Prof Chris Whitty urged people to minimise all unnecessary contact with others. The next few weeks will be ""the worst"" of the pandemic for the NHS, he said. Thousands more people are due to receive a vaccine this week after seven mass centres opened across England. NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. The government is aiming to offer vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. How does a vaccine get approved How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? NHS Covid-19 jab letters 'confusing over 80s' Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the government's vaccine delivery plan at a news conference later. He said the proposals would be the ""keystone of our exit out of the pandemic"". Outlining the vaccine rollout in Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that ministers aim to give all over-80s the first doseof the vaccine over the next four weeks. The Welsh Government plans to offer a vaccine toall over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk by spring. In Northern Ireland, which isrolling out vaccines for care workers, health trusts have seenthe busiest 48 hours since the start of the pandemic. Mr Hancock said on Sunday about two million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far. Over the weekend, the UKpassed the milestone of 80,000 deaths with coronavirussince the start of the pandemic. Currently, around one in 50 people across the UK is infected and Prof Whitty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There's a very high chance that if you meet someone unnecessarily they will have Covid."" In a separate interview with BBC One's Breakfast, he said: ""This is everybody's problem. Any single unnecessary contact you have with someone is a potential link in a chain of transmission that will lead to a vulnerable person."" He said there were over 30,000 people [in English hospitals alone] with Covid-19 - compared to about 18,000 [in England] at the peak last April. He added that ""anybody who is not shocked"" by the number of people in hospital ""has not understood this at all"". ""This is an appalling situation,"" he said. In Essex,Southend Hospital has had to reduce the amount of oxygen used to treat patients after supply ""reached a critical situation"", according to a document shared with the BBC. In Surrey, a temporary mortuary has been opened as hospital mortuaries have reached capacity. Almost 200 bodies are being stored at the emergency site, which is a former military hospital, and other local authorities have told the BBC they expect to open similar facilities soon. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England national medical director, said ""this is much bigger than the first wave back in April"". ""I don't think anyone in the NHS has known anything like this, this is a once-in-a-century pandemic,"" he said. Prof Rupert Pearse, an intensive care doctor, told BBC Breakfast that in a ""normal"" winter it would be ""unlikely"" that more than three of four flu patients would need intensive care at any one time, but his unit is now running 130 intensive care beds because of the effects of Covid. ""To compare this to a normal winter flu epidemic is out of all proportion, it's orders of magnitude larger,"" he said. This video can not be played The emergency body storage facility in a Surrey woodland Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measuresare in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ministers held two meetings on Sunday to discuss how to enforce the current lockdown measures more strictly and whether even tighter restrictions may be needed. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said no decisions on further restrictions were taken as there was a desire within government to wait until reliable data on existing measures becomes available in 10 days. However, he added there had been a discussion on better enforcement of existing regulations, including at shops and workplaces. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said ""we need to see the evidence behind nurseries"" remaining open. Asked whether tighter restrictions were needed, he said: ""I do think it's time to  hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"". There is a lot of debate about whether the lockdown restrictions need to be tightened. There are certainly some anomalies. For example, we are told to only leave the home for essential purposes, but coffee shops remain open for takeaways and retail shops for click-and-collect in England and Wales. However, even if those elements are tightened up, there is a limit to what the government can do. It is why, in his round of media interviews on Monday, Prof Whitty repeatedly talked about individual decision-making. The mixing of different households continues. Some of it is allowed under the support bubble exemptions, but undoubtedly some of it is taking place outside of this. It is, after all, virtually impossible to police what goes on in people's homes. It is why messaging is so important - and so ministers and officials are stressing the pressure the NHS is under. A further tightening of the restrictions could also help make the point. But there is also a recognition this is hard. People are fatigued. A further crackdown could also erode goodwill. The vaccination programme is described as the biggest in NHS history. The seven mass testing sites, which NHS England said were chosen to give a geographical spread, are: Millennium Point, Birmingham Ashton Gate, Bristol ExCel Centre, London Manchester Tennis and Football Centre Centre for Life, Newcastle Robertson House, Stevenage Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey The new centres will each be capable of delivering thousands of vaccinations each week and will be followed by ""dozens more"" large-scale sites, NHS England said. There will be about 1,200 vaccination sites when more GP-led and hospital services open later this week, along with the first pharmacy-led pilot sites, it added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Some vulnerable peoplehave questioned why they have been asked to travel to centres miles away from their homesduring a pandemic, but the NHS has said people would not miss out on their vaccination if they wait for an appointment at a centre closer to home in the coming weeks. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said nobody should be asked to travel more than 10 miles to get a vaccine once more centres open. Asked on Today why the centres were not open 24 hours a day, he said it was ""more convenient"" for older people to attend during the day. ""If we need to go to 24-hour work we will absolutely go to 24 hours a day to make sure we vaccinate as quickly as we can,"" he said. But he cautioned: ""We are limited by the amount of vaccine that is coming through the system."" Pharmaceutical firm Boots said its first vaccination site was due to open later this week to offer the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to the people most vulnerable. It said sites in Huddersfield and Gloucester were planned to open in the coming weeks. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use,although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.

"The past 48 hours have been the busiest for health trusts since the start of the pandemic, withappeals to off-duty staff to help ease the pressure. Some trusts were close to declaring a major incident, which was averted after staff responded to Sunday's call. NI's six trusts warned that by the third week of January,hospitals could be dealing with double the number of Covid patients. Health trusts have also said more cancer operations could be cancelled. TheBelfast Health Trust has already cancelled urgent cancer surgeries. On Monday, a further 16 Covid-related deathswere announced by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, 15 of them occurring in the last 24 hours.,external Seven hundred and fifty-nine new cases of the virus were also reported. The Western Health Trust is appealing to families to bring their loved ones home as soon as they are ready for discharge, and care for them there - even if a package is not yet in place. Meanwhile, a divert of patients from the Southern Health Trust to the Western Health Trust has been lifted. Three patients were diverted from the Southern Health Trust to the Western Health Trust overnight on Sunday. The number of Covid-19 patients being treated by the Southern Health Trust is now 230, up from 215 on Sunday night. Emergency Department (ED) patients in the trust are experiencing very long waits, with departments expected to be busy again on Monday evening. In total91,954 people in Northern Ireland had received at least one coronavirus jabas of Monday night. First Minister Arlene Foster said on Monday afternoon that the latest modelling showed NI's R-number is sitting at about 1.1-1.2. This is a drop from an estimated 1.8 earlier in January. Mrs Foster said things were ""moving in the right direction"" with a reduction in the number of positive cases, but warned everyone needed to ""ready themselves"" for strain on the health service in the next few weeks. She added that the executive had ""few options left"", if further restrictions were deemed necessary to tackle the transmission of the virus. The first minister suggested the executive could look at whether curfews should be imposed again. The executive will meet on Tuesday and Thursday this week for updates from health officials on the coronavirus situation.

New lockdownrestrictions came into force in NI on Friday, forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons. Speaking to Good Morning Ulster, Western Health Trust chief executive Dr Anne Kilgallen predicted two out of every four patients being treated in hospitals in the west will have coronavirus by the third week of January. She said currently one in four people in Northern Ireland hospitals has Covid-19. Dr Kilgallen said the surge over the weekend was ""an indication of why"" they had to suspend red-flag cancer surgeries. She added: ""We will work our hardest to ensure that we do respond to need. This is one of the reasons why, some trusts and I think this week more of us will do so, we made the extremely difficult decision to postpone cancer surgery."" She asked families to bring their relatives home as soon as they are ""medically fit"" for discharge. ""We realise that this is a big ask of families, but we do need people's help. We cannot keep people in hospital awaiting care packages, or indeed awaiting their preference in terms of a care home."" It is understood at the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen, five senior doctors, several radiographers, pharmacists and nurses came into work on Sunday. This freed up 20 to 30 beds, allowing the Western Health Trust to take on patients from the Southern Health Trust. Southern Health Trust: 215 Covid patients Western Health Trust: 90 Covid patients All weekend, parts of Northern Ireland's health system were under severe pressure but, at times, it seemed the Southern Trust's hospitals were on the brink of falling over.Â Appeals were made for additional staff in the Western and Southern Health Trusts while a joint statement by the chief executives of the six health trusts says staff were doing all they could to deal with the situation. Daisy Hill and Craigavon were especially busy, with appeals made for available staff to come to work. South West Acute Hospital put out a similar appeal as it prepared to accept ambulance diverts and patients from other areas.Â Often an appeal for staff is the first indication that a hospital is about to declare a major incident, but when asked by the BBC if that was the case the Southern Health TrustÂ said calls for additional staff to come to work had helped avoid a crisis. There have been numerous warnings that January would see an alarming increase in Covid cases, deaths and pressure - sadly, officials aren't being proved wrong. Health trusts warn Covid inpatients 'could double' Nightingale Hospital nurses to come from across NI Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was experiencing the ""worst case scenario"" predicted at the start of the pandemic. ""We are at the extreme of the pandemic right now, this is the worst situation that we have been in from the very onset."" She added that the peak for Covid-19 cases had ""probably been reached"" but the peak pressure on the health service was yet to come. At the weekend, Belfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack appealed to staff to ""voluntarily postpone any planned booked annual leave in the coming weeks"". However, Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursing NI, said it is an ""understatement"" to say that staff are feeling tired and overworked and any attempt to force them to cancel annual leave would be ""inhumane"". Patricia McKeown of trade union Unison, which represents many nurses, said staff were ""tired, they're stressed they're getting infected, they're getting sick, some of them, tragically, haven't made it. ""And yet, incredibly, they responded in the way they did over the weekend. ""But right now they're being asked to give even more, respond again in an even bigger and more intense way, because this coming week is going to be very, very serious."" Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it is estimated that on average about ""one in 60"" people currently have Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. He said the rising number of cases is a ""payback"" for the relaxation of restrictions in December. ""We've been running at about 500 people at any one time in our hospitals with Covid,"" he told The Nolan Show. ""I think it's very likely the numbers will be in excess of a thousand and that will put extreme pressure on an already hard pressed staff.

"Stickers supposed to protect users against mobile-phone radiation have no effect, scientists have found. Energydots says they ""counteract the harmful energy emitted by wireless and electronic equipment"" to aid sleep, cure headaches and give a clearer mind. But University of Surrey tests for BBC News found no evidence of any effect. The Devon-based company told BBC News the stickers were programmed with ""scalar energy"", which the scientists' equipment would be unable to detect. Energydots markets a range of stickers, including the SmartDot, the SleepDot and even the PetDot. BBC News bought five SmartDots - a special offer for Â£55 - and sent them to the university's 6th Generation Innovation Centre. Researchers tested 4G mobile phones and wi-fi access points with and without the stickers applied to them. Amazon is investigating the Energydots products And a spokesman for the lab said: ""We could not find any evidence that these products had any effect on frequency or power when used as instructed."" An Energydots spokeswoman told BBC News: ""We state clearly that our products harmonise the fields. ""And the way to test this is to assess via biological testing."" Last November, the company published a press release saying it was extremely proud to announce a partnership with the NHS that would see ""brand-new patient engagement units"" installed in Torbay and Royal College of London hospitals. At the time, an Energydots spokeswoman told BBC News adverts for its products would appear in the two hospitals, though she clarified the London hospital was in fact University College Hospital. But a Torbay Hospital spokesman then told BBC News it knew nothing of this partnership. And within hours, the press release had disappeared from the company's website. Energydots later said there had been a misunderstanding with the agency that had promised to organise the adverts. Its stickers are among a wide range of products on Amazon from companies offering electric-and-magnetic-field (EMF) protection. Energydots also suggests placing its SmartDot stickers on wi-fi routers These include protective clothing, canopies to be placed over beds and even devices that block radiation from wi-fi routers - making them effectively useless. An Amazon spokesman told BBC News it: was investigating the Energydots products required sellers to provide accurate information on products pages removed listings making misleading claims or raising safety concerns Campaigners claiming radiation from mobile phones and other devices poses a health risk have stepped up protests as 5G networks are rolled out. Energydots also makes it claims helps tackle wireless radiation But most scientists say even the higher part of the electromagnetic spectrum that may be used by 5G should not harm humans. International guidelines limit radio-wave exposure. And within those limits, there are no known consequences for health, the World Health Organization says.

"This video can not be played Indonesian divers search crash wreckage The Indonesian navy has released footage of divers searching through the wreckage of a passenger plane which crashed into the sea at the weekend as the hunt for its black boxes resumes. Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 left Jakarta with 62 people on board, but vanished from the radar on its way to Borneo island on Saturday. Search teams have found aircraft parts and human remains and believe they know where the black boxes are located. The first victim has been identified. Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant on the plane, was identified by his fingerprints, officials said late on Monday. 'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among air crash missing Indonesia crashed plane's 'black boxes' located Air disasters timeline One official stressed the urgency of the search mission calling it a ""24-hour"" operation. ""It's going to be an around-the-clock operation,"" Rasman MS, head of the search and rescue agency's crash operations told reporters. ""There will be no breaks. The sooner we can find the victims, the better."" According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel are currently involved in the search operation along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Divers have been recovering body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing from waters about 23 metres (75ft) deep. The search resumed on Monday morning There appears to be no hope of finding any survivors. Navy chief of staff Yudo Margono said the search team had pinpointed the location of the black box cockpit voice and flight data recorders and a remote-controlled vehicle was being used to scan the sea bed. ""There is so much debris down there and we have only lifted a few pieces. Hopefully, as we take out more [the recorders] can be found,"" he told reporters. The fact the debris does not appear to have spread far suggests the plane may have been intact before it hit the water, an investigator with Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) told news agency Reuters. ""It possibly ruptured when it hit waters because if it had exploded mid-air, the debris would be distributed more widely,"" said Nurcahyo Utomo. Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. A turbine from one of its engines is also among the debris that has been recovered. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact with the plane was recorded, with the call sign SJY182, according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in West Kalimantan province in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. The plane is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. According to registration details, the plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Indonesian Navy personnel carry debris believed to be from the Sriwijaya Air SJ-182 plane Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations. The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. Mechanical v human: Why do planes crash? Plane crash fatalities fell more than 50% in 2019 Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul.

"The UK's Covid vaccine campaign has shifted its focus to boosters - an attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Almost seven in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK have had a booster, while nine in 10 have had a single jab and more than eight in 10 have had a second dose. But despite more than 38 million boosters, or third doses, being given so far, more people are being urged to come forward and jabs are being rolled out to all five to 11-year-olds. The vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two full doses while all five to 11-year-olds are now being offered two low-dose jabs, at least 12 weeks apart. Booster jabs are also available to all over-16s, as well as children aged 12-15 in at-risk groups. The JCVI says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still haveabout 90% protection against hospitalisation. The UK has approved five vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen and Novavax; four of which require two doses for maximum protection. Those receiving boosters have so far been receiving one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 92% of over-12s.  More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far. Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands. The aim of the vaccination programme is toprotect as many people as possible from serious illness,externalthrough developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more thannine in 10 adults,externalin the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine. However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population. Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? Is Covid at risk of becoming a disease of the poor? Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme. Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%. Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far. Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%. When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%. There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by theOpenSAFELY group,external- a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data. In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light. The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"A 78-year-old French woman received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in France A global race is on to vaccinate people against Covid-19 - and with infections soaring in Europe many have complained that the roll-out is too slow in the EU. Member states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021. BBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch. Whatâs happening to the EU vaccine scheme? The country shocked to be Europe's stragglers In an election year, the vaccine has become a political battleground, writesJenny Hill, in Berlin. The fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation. A recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground. Vaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than477,000first doses had been administered. But some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses. Much of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order. Germany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. Mr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand. Germany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer. The Czech prime minister has hit out at apparent delays in distributing the vaccine, writesRob Cameron, in Prague. The Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager. But the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. ""We believed when we contributed â¬12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,"" he told a newspaper this week. The country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to19,918people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. It has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature. However, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer. A sluggish start is being blamed on bureaucracy and vaccine scepticism, writesHugh Schofield, in Paris. France's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to45,500- still so small as to be statistically meaningless. So why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used. The primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. Each recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives. Another problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers. After President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings. Politically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a ""state scandal"", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free. France's vaccine drive has challenging start National pride accelerated Russia's rollout, but one man is conspicuously absent from the list of people vaccinated, writesSarah Rainsford, in Moscow. Russia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity. Sputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded. A poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week thatmore than a million peoplehad been vaccinated. Russia began rolling out its Sputnik V vaccine in December But one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown. Russia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped. As infection rates grow in a country praised by many for its no-lockdown approach, a successful vaccine programme is crucial writesMaddy Savage, in Stockholm. Almost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is stillno official tallyof how many others have received the vaccination. The Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains ""feasible"". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. Alongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February. Swedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine. A successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. Meanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands. A new government in Belgium seems unified on the vaccine rollout - for now at least, writesNick Beake, in Brussels. It seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further700elderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial. The mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be ""seamless and fast"", tweeting: ""If that does not work, shoot me."" The first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December You may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed. After getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its ""careful"" approach. And there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. In a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least. Regional variances and political rows have marked the beginning of Spain's vaccination programme writesGuy Hedgecoe, in Madrid. Spain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with277,976people vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. Each of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. Government data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. Although vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination. However, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro SÃ¡nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. The arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by ""political affiliations or parliamentary needs"", a claim the central government has rejected.

Thanks for joining us today. Here are some of the main stories from the day: Today's figure of 46,169 new positive Covid tests is the first time the number has been under 50,000 since 28 December. However, numbers are usually lower after the weekend due to a lag in reporting. Martin PatienceBBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut Empty shelves at a supermarket in Lebanon ahead of a 24-hour curfew which starts on Thursday Lebanon is set to enforce a
24-hour curfew from
this Thursday as it battles to contain the coronavirus. The
authorities say that without drastic action the countryâs fragile health system
will be overwhelmed. The curfew will initially last for eleven days but could
well be extended. Customers will be barred from shopping in
supermarkets and instead will need to rely on deliveries. The countryâs only
airport will remain open but the number of passengers is set to be dramatically
reduced. Compared with other countries, Lebanon had - until now - coped
relatively well with the coronavirus. But despite a rise in
infections, the government relaxed restrictions ahead of Christmas and New
Year, hoping to bolster the countryâs crumbling economy. Health officials say
that relaxation has led to a dramatic spike in the number of cases, which could
sky-rocket in the coming days. More than fifteen hundred Lebanese have died
from the virus in the past year. The World Health Organization has warned herd immunity won't be achieved this year, despite Covid vaccines being rolled out in countries across the world. ""We are not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021,"" the WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a briefing. She stressed that people needed to continue measures such as social distancing, hand washing and wearing face coverings. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened:  The health secretary was questioned about the prime minister beingspotted exercising seven miles from Downing Street. Sun reporter Kate Ferguson asked Matt Hancock for specific details about what people were allowed to do under the rules. She referred to a case where two women in Derbyshire were threatened with a fine after driving five miles to a park to meet each other for a walk. Ferguson then asked whether it was ""all right to go ahead and exercise seven miles away from your home"" - an apparent reference to reports the prime minister had been seen cycling in the Olympic Park in east London. Matt Hancock said: ""If you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles away from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""You should not go from one side of the country to another potentially taking the virus with you. ""So it is OK to go for a long walk, cycle ride or exercise. But stay local."" Asked about the story earlier and whether Boris Johnson was driven to the Olympic park, a spokesperson for the PM did not provide any details but said he had complied with Covid guidelines. A further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have been reported in the UK, bringing the total to 81,960. There have been another 46,169 positive cases reported, bringing the total cases to 3,118,518. This video can not be played Hancock: 'The bubbles policy will stay' Dan Bloom of the Mirror asks the health secretary if he can guarantee that support bubbles and childcare bubbles will remain - as many people rely on them. Matt Hancock says yes, he can ""rule out"" removing them, adding: ""I know how important they are to people. They're an important part of the system we have to support people."" But he stresses that they are there for ""individual specific people"" and that you have to stick to the same bubble, once you are in one. Hancock says he wants to be ""absolutely crystal clear"" about the fact they will stay. And Prof Powis is asked if there have been any incidences of people catching Covid on their way to, or back, from vaccine centres. He replies that all of those set up, whether large-scale centres or GP-led hubs, have infection prevention measures in place to minimise the risk of catching the virus. There is appropriate social distancing so people stay apart and the risk of transmission is as low as possible, adds Prof Powis.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The big question â and it is one that Elaine from Glasgow
asked â is whether mid-February will mark the start of the lifting of lockdown
and the return to normality. It should, but the process is likely to be slow. Firstly, it takes several weeks after the first dose for
an immune response to start to kick in. Second, the over-60s, who are at quite significant risk,
are not part of this initial stage and so will remain vulnerable to the virus. And finally, while trials showed the two vaccines that are
being used in the UK are very effective at preventing infection and certainly
at stopping serious illness, it is still uncertain what impact they will have
on transmission. It is possible people who are vaccinated can still pass
on the virus. We hope it will disrupt this to some extent â and maybe
even stop it. This will be a crucial factor in how quickly the UK and
the rest of the world can get on top of the pandemic. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Is a walk with a friend
and a takeaway coffee allowed? In answer to that simple
question, the health secretary says ""yes"" but goes on to stress that
the rules permit exercise with one other person. The emphasis should be
on exercising, not socialising, he says, and if too many people broke that
rule the government would have to ""have a look at it."" The rules, as ever, are
open to some interpretation and Mr Hancock clearly hopes his appeal for people
to not ""push the boundaries"" will work. But MPs and others are calling
for more clarity here, with some people travelling long distances to exercise
and others being punished for going for a walk relatively close to home. Laura Bundock from Sky News asks if it was complacent for the prime minister to allow mixing indoors over Christmas - and if we are paying the price now. Matt Hancock says what we're seeing is that ""the new variant of the virus is incredibly transmissible"" and is ""highly contagious"". The fact it spreads so easily means we have an ""incredibly difficult few weeks ahead of us"". It is imperative everybody follows the rules - and doesn't see them as a limit to be stretched. ""I know that's difficult but it's so important for everybody,"" he says. Prof Powis says when the NHS is under pressure, it's not just Covid patients affected but anyone requiring medical assistance. He says it's important ""we all pull together"" to ensure the NHS can treat us all and keep us safe. The health secretary stresses the importance of the public following the restrictions of the current lockdown. Asked by Emily Morgan of ITV whether it was time to make the rules stricter amid reports of people not sticking to them at the weekend, Matt Hancock says: ""We keep these things under review and we have demonstrated that we're willing to tighten the rules if they need to be tightened. ""But the thing that really matters right here, right now is that everybody follows the rules as they are today. ""And everybody can play their part in doing that."" He adds he applauds the action supermarket Morrisons has takenin enforcing the wearing of masksby its customers unless they have a medical reason. ""I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this,"" he says. The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the target of 12.5m doses of the vaccine for the most vulnerable, in the next five weeks, is ""doable"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock replies: ""Yes, we're on track to meet that target."" He says the target is ""ambitious"" but ""achievable"" and he is ""confident we're going to do it"". Since Thursday when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was rolled out, there was an increase in 210,000 vaccinations a day, on average. The mass vaccination sites means the speed of the rollout will increase further, he adds. He says of the target: ""It's not going to be easy but we're going to get there."" Prof Powis adds everyone is confident the NHS can ""stand up to this challenge"" and deliver it, and that ""it's in all our interests to speed through those high priority groups"".  Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Another warning, this
time from Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. There is
""significant and sustained pressure"" on hospitals, he says, and they
are ""yet to see"" the impact of the loosening of restrictions at
Christmas reflected in admissions. To summarise, things are
bad and about to get worse. He says the vaccine programme cannot be seen as a ""free pass"" and only if people complied with the
lockdown laws will the situation be manageable. NHS England national medical director Prof Stephen Powis says the country should be ""in no doubt"" that the battle against Covid is ""tougher than it has ever been"". There are 13,000 more patients in hospital since Christmas Day, he says, adding there are ""stubbornly high"" levels of infections and deaths. Hospitals are seeing ""significant and sustained pressure"" from the rising number of patients. And we are still to see the full impact of the loosening of restrictions at Christmas, Prof Powis adds. It is, he says, an ""extremely serious moment for the country"". And the vaccine ""cannot be seen as a free pass"" to ignore the guidance in place, like social distancing and staying inside. ""We have to keep focus and resilience as a country,"" he says.  The health secretary refers to a statement given earlier by the head of the NHS in which he talked about the UK being in a ""sprint"" from now to February, as those in the priority groups get their vaccinations. ""It will then kick off another sprint up to April as we get the rest of the vulnerable groups protected,"" Hancock says. ""And then, finally, a marathon to the autumn as we deliver vaccination to everybody else."" But he says the current pressures on the NHS mean the UK is in an ""extremely serious moment."" Hancock adds the vaccine is ""good news"" but ""cannot be seen by any of us as a free pass to ignore the national guidance"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The rules may not be
getting any stronger but the language certainly is. Matt Hancock repeated
the warning that this was the ""worst point"" of the pandemic so far. He made clear the onus
is on individuals, whose actions could ""make a difference"". Increasingly urgent
appeals to follow the rules reflect deep concern in government that the message
isn't getting through. The health secretary says he wants the UK to get back to normal as fast as possible. ""I want us to have that Great British summer. And my team and I are working hard to deliver this as fast as possible."" Matt Hancock goes on to outline the government's vaccine delivery plan - saying it is the biggest vaccination programme in British history. He adds: ""We have significantly accelerated the care home vaccination rollout. ""Almost a quarter of older care home residents have now received their first dose of the vaccine and we are committed to reach every care home resident this month."" Matt Hancock starts with an update of the number of daily cases. The health secretary says the new variant is highly contagious - with 46,169 cases recorded in the UK in the last day. There were 32,294 people in hospital - up 22% on this time last week, he adds. Hancock says the vaccine rollout is proceeding at pace and is the ""way out"" of the pandemic He says 2.6m doses of the vaccine have been given - to 2.3m people - more than all other countries of Europe together, Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The bubbles policy will stay"". The UK is at the ""worst point"" of the pandemic, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned, but said the actions of the public ""could make a difference"". At a No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock pleaded with people to follow the government's Covid rules until the vaccine could provide a ""way out"" of the pandemic. The government earlierpublished its plan to immunise,externaltens of millions of people by spring. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first Covid vaccine shot. And a total of 2.6 million doses have been given out across the country, with some people having received both doses. Mr Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus was putting the NHS under ""significant pressure"", adding it was ""imperative"" that people limit their social contacts. ""The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules,"" he said. ""I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference."" The health secretary said he could ""rule out"" tightening restrictions by removing support and childcare bubbles, however. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Laura Kuenssberg: What next for Covid rules? Inside a mass vaccination centre PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home His comments follow similar warnings from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said that the next few weekswill be ""the worst"" of the pandemicfor the NHS. According to the latest figures, there have been another 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, and another 46,169 cases reported. There are also more than 32,000 people in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Matt Hancock has previously said he's learned to rule nothing out when it comes to dealing with the pandemic. But today he took the unusual step of doing just that. Support bubbles and childcare bubbles, hugely valued by so many, will stay. Senior Whitehall sources have previously told me bubbles were ""untouchable"" but for a minister to say as much, so explicitly and on the record, means there's now very little wriggle room for the government to change its mind. Ministers will know that scrapping bubbles, for those that rely on them, could have proved deeply unpopular. But this certainty is a rarity. Whilst the current emphasis is on compliance, the idea of toughening up controls in other areas is not being ruled out. The vaccine delivery plan says it is expected to take until spring to give a first dose to all 32 million people in the UK's priority groups, including everyone over 55 and those who are clinically vulnerable. Under the plan, the government has pledged to carry out at least two million vaccinations in England per week by the end of January, which it says will be made possible by rolling out jabs at 206 hospital sites, 50 vaccination centres and around 1,200 local vaccination sites. It also reiterates the government's aim of offering vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. According to Mr Hancock, two fifths of over-80s have now received their first dose, and almost a quarter of care home residents have received theirs. Also at the briefing, NHS England's national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the NHS was aiming to vaccinate the rest of thetop nine priority groupsby April, with a final push to offer all adults over 18 a jab by the autumn. He stressed it would take until February before there were ""early signs"" that vaccination was leading to a drop in hospitalisations. The country has still not seen the full impact of the Christmas loosening of lockdown restrictions, Prof Powis added, although he noted there are now 13,000 more Covid patients in hospital than there were on Christmas Day. Speaking in Bristol earlier, Mr Johnson warned the vaccination programme was in a ""race against time"" because of pressure on the NHS. He said it was ""a very perilous moment because everyone can sense the vaccine is coming in - my worry is that will breed false complacency"". When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Morrisons to ban shoppers who refuse to wear masks The newly-published vaccination plan also says ministers are aiming to offer jabs at more than 2,700 sites across the UK. And it says that daily vaccination figures for England will be published from now on - showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses. Earlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a ""strong case"" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising ""teachers and other key workers"" for vaccination after the ""first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated"". A quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added. In the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations. News that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped. Hitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week. With more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply. There is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February. However, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution. Challenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track. Asseven mass vaccination centresopened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use,although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. Vaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations. All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring,under new plans. And Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nationwill be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at homecan now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measuresare in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said: ""I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"".

And England's Test and Trace scheme has revised one of its definitions of a ""close contact"" - the people who need to be reached if they have been near to someone who has tested positive for Covid. This now refers to anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day. Previously the definition was just a single period of at least 15 minutes.

In his first speech of the year, he said: ""I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"".

"This video can not be played Health Minister Vaughan Gething aims to offer all adults a jab by the autumn. All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid will be offered a vaccine by spring, under new Welsh Government plans. A vaccine strategy unveiled by Health Minister Vaughan Gething aims to offer all adults a jab by the autumn. It comes after criticism that therollout of the vaccine has been slower than in other parts of the UK. The latest figures show 86,039 doses had been administered by 22:00 GMT on Sunday. A total of 327,000 doses - 280,000 of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 47,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - have now been delivered to the Welsh NHS. The figures mean 2.7% of Wales population has so far been vaccinated - compared to just over 4% in Northern Ireland, about 3.5% in England and 3% in Scotland. Q&A: When will I get the Covid-19 vaccines? Wales has given 70,000 of 275,000 vaccine doses UK at 'perilous moment' in Covid pandemic, says PM Across the UK nearly 400,000 second doses have been administered, including 374,613 in England, 79 in Wales, 13,949 in Northern Ireland and, as of January 3, 36 in Scotland. Mr Gething admitted the rest of the UK had ""gone slightly faster than we have"", but said the latest vaccinations figures showed a ""significant acceleration"" in the rollout. The Welsh Conservatives accused the government of a ""stuttering start"", while Plaid Cymru said the plan was ""late in the day"". Everyone over 70, all care home residents and staff, and front-line NHS and social care workers will be offered a jab by mid-February, under similar timescales to other UK nations. This 82-year-old woman was one of 100 to receive her vaccine at a special clinic in Swansea on Saturday The Welsh Government's vaccination plans aim to cover 2.5 million people by September, with vaccines supplied by the UK government. Mr Gething said: ""Delivering this vaccination programme to the people in Wales is a huge task but an enormous amount of work is going on to make it a success. ""We are making good progress with thousands more people being vaccinated every day."" The plan sets out a series of ""milestones"" for the vaccine rollout in Wales - all depending on the supply of vaccines approved for use. At a press conference, Mr Gething said the government aimed to vaccinate: all Welsh Ambulance Service staff by 18 January all those living and working in care homes by the end of January the rest of the top four priority groups - front-line health and social care staff, everyone over 70 and people who are extremely clinically vulnerable - by mid-February everyone over 50 and those at greater risk because they have a underlying health condition by the spring all ""eligible adults"" by the autumn Mr Gething said 700,000 people would be vaccinated by mid-February. According to the plan, the number of GPs' surgeries delivering vaccines will be increased from around 100 to more than 250 by the end of January. The number of mass vaccination centres will increase in the next couple of weeks to 35, according to Welsh Government's plan. One of those is Margam Orangery, in Neath Port Talbot, where about 500 people will be vaccinated each day. At the press conference, Mr Gething defendedthe UK-wide decision to increase the gapbetween giving the two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and said it would ""avoid more deaths"". ""Each of the vaccines provide a high level of protection against harm from coronavirus. That's really good news for all of us,"" he added. Wales 'ready to vaccinate at a higher rate' Wales last in UK nations as 50,000 vaccinated Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh Government should have a vaccinations minister who ""gets up in the morning thinking about vaccinations and goes to bed thinking about vaccinations"". He said such a move would help the government recover from a ""stuttering start"" to the vaccines programme. Mr Davies said the government needed ""focus and direction to drive this forward"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the strategy but said it was ""late in the day"". Mr Price said many people, including his own parents, wanted clarity: ""My parents, who are in their 80s, have been told their surgery won't have the ability to vaccinate them for another three weeks, yet the GP surgery next door is starting this week."" Larger supplies of the Oxford jab will be needed to speed up vaccinations Daniel Davies, BBC Wales political correspondent The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is crucial to ensuring everyone aged over 70 can have at least one jab by Valentine's Day. Health boards plan to use reserves of the Pfizer vaccine, but they alone will not reach the Welsh Government's first milestone. To speed things up, bigger supplies of the Oxford vaccine are needed. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine however, the stock is not held by the Welsh Government. Instead, it is delivered directly to the frontline - including GPs and community pharmacies - by Public Health England. Around 24,000 Oxford doses arrived in Wales last week; 26,000 are due this week; and another 80 to 100,000 are expected to arrive in four batches next week. If the mid-February milestone is reached, attention then turns to the over-50s and younger people whose health puts them at greater risk. They can expect a dose by the Spring, but discussions are continuing between the four UK nations to nail down a more specific date. Dr Helen Alefounder is a GP in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county and part of a team that administered 400 vaccines at care comes last week after receiving the vaccine herself on Wednesday. ""Between us and the surgery next door that we're working with we've got just shy of 20,000 patients to vaccinate,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""It's an absolutely huge task, it's really scary, but we are really keen and committed to get it done because everybody is sick of lockdown and let's be honest, everybody wants life to return to as normal as possible and the only way we're going to do that is to mass vaccinate people."" A mass-vaccination centre has been set up at Margam Orangery near Port Talbot Other GPsurgeries have posted on social media,externalthat they have not received as many doses of the vaccine as promised. Vaccination numbers will now be published daily and the number of mass vaccination centres will rise from 22 to 35. The vaccination plan also suggests pharmacies could be used to deploy the vaccine. Dr Gill Richardson, the senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccination programme in Wales, said GPs were ""raring to go"" to get the vaccine distributed. She said the model for Wales' vaccination programme was focused around the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, which was approved in late December and ""much larger quantities"" were expected. She also said: ""I know it's very difficult if you haven't had a letter and you're feeling anxious but you are going to be approached and when you're approached we'd like it to be as soon as possible and as convenient as possible to you."" Michael Sullivan, 93, from Radyr, Cardiff, is one of those who is yet to receive his letter. He said: ""I hear of all these other people having their second jabs and nobody's even thought of contacting me to say I'm going to have one in the first place. It's a bit depressing. It makes me think somebody's not doing what they should be doing. ""It gets stressful more easily, that's another thing one has to bare in mind - it's going to save my life."" Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. Elen Jones, the Wales director of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said community pharmacists were ""willing and skilled to help deliver the vaccination programme, as they do with flu every year"". She added pharmacists could help deliver the vaccine ""at a more local level"". Welsh ministers have been under intense pressure since it became clear that Wales was lagging behind every other home nation in the initial weeks of vaccine rollout. It's still not clear why that should be the case - the logistical challenges of rollout and the change in advice over the time period between first and second doses apply across the UK, not just to Wales. The health minister says that there has already been ""a significant step-up in delivery"". The test of that will be whether the system in Wales can meet the delivery goals set out in the vaccination strategy - which (as for the other home nations) also rely on a regular and sufficient supply of vaccine.

Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross tells viewers he thinks politics should be put aside and the UK and Scottish governments should work together to get the vaccinations out as quickly as possible. He is reluctant, as an assistant referee, to comment on the Celtic Dubai situation, but he does say that people have to look at the message it sends out. He points out that for many people at home alone at the moment, football is something they look forward to and ""we don't want to see the whole of Scottish football affected by the actions of one club"". He adds that financial support should be made available to clubs in theScottish lower leagues & Scottish Cup who have had their games suspended for three weeks.  Willie Rennie calls for more detail about the vaccination programme to be revealed to increase public confidence. The Scottish Lib Dem leader says the vaccination programme is not moving fast enough and not enough is being done. He says we must be operating to the maximum we can be and a cautious approach must be taken to get on top of the virus. On the Scottish Parliament election in May, he says he thinks people can vote safely but he questions whether politicians can campaign properly. Mr Rennie calls for election plans to be agreed on a cross-party basis and warns that an election could be a distraction for the government, which is why he says he has called for the SNP to pull back from plans for an independence referendum. Prof Bauld is asked about the high case numbers. She says we should feel a bit more optimistic about the case numbers as she sees a slight decline in the last few days and she hopes they go down further. She says the numbers are lagging and the hospital admission numbers reflect the trajectory from Christmas due to the amount of time it takes for people to become unwell. She says hospital numbers are not likely to decline for about another week. On the subject of behavioural fatigue, she says there is not great evidence of that. She believes people are still complying with restrictions and it is the variant which is a cause for worry. She adds that the vaccination programme will not start to make a difference for at least a month.  Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld joins the BBC One programme. She says she finds it ""astonishing"" that the Celtic training trip to Dubai went ahead at all. She says we were in a different position when the trip was agreed in November and other countries, including Germany, have agreed not to have warm-weather training this season due to rising infection rates. She says that at a time when importation of the virus is an issue, ""we need to have very clear policies"". She is happy to hear that close contacts of the positive case at the club are now self isolating.  Two employees at Tesco's Greenock branch in Inverclyde died with Covid Laura Goodwin also asks if shop workers should be given greater priority on the JCVI priority list, followingthe deaths of two members of staff with Covid at a supermarket in Greenock. Dr Gregor Smith says the aim of the programme is to provide protection to those who are most vulnerable. Scotland's chief medical officer says the JCVI priority list is very much determined by age and underlying health conditions. Once the first phase has been completed, there will be discussions about occupational risk like shop workers, many of whom will be on the priority list already, he adds. Laura Goodwin from the BBC says the health secretary has said Scotland has been allocated half a million doses of vaccine for this month. Ms Goodwin asks how many doses are here in Scotland and how can we be certain of supplies in February and March. The first minister says: ""We have enough supplies to do the over 80s over the next four weeks."" Ms Sturgeon says there is good progress with care homes, social care and NHS staff. She says the supply position has been improved due to the changes in advice to dosing schedules, however, uncertainties remain. Last week the first minister said she wanted to get through the whole of the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) priority list with the first dose of the vaccine by the end of May. ""I would be very, very hopeful that we will be able to accelerate that to an earlier point assuming we get the supplies to do that,"" she says.  STV's Raman Bhardwaj comes back with the question: How close are the privileges to being revoked? Ms Sturgeon says she is not talking about revoking elite sport's privileges and does not want to take punitive action. But she is looking at it from a public health perspective. She understands that Celtic have a different view to hers about the training camp but says she disagrees and highlights the importance of travel restrictions. Travel is one of the risk factors in not just spreading the virus here but when we are at the stage of trying to stop new variants entering the country. We are looking at tightening up travel restrictions and I know we will be looking at whether the exemptions from quarantine arrangements for elite sport and perhaps some other sectors will have to be tightened up. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The first question comes from STV and is about Celtic's trip to Dubai and the positive Covid test which has followed, as well as15 staff and players being required to self-isolate. The first minister says it's no surprise to people that she is not the biggest football fan but insists she is not picking on the sport. She says elite sport has privileges but those privileges cannot be abused. She says fans of Celtic can't travel freely, and the club should ask itself if going to a training camp was really necessary. She says teams and clubs have to take responsibility for their conduct right now as everyone does. I really hope Celtic reflect seriously on this. You have got significant numbers of players required to isolate, that will have an impact on their performance. I hope they reflect on it and the football authorities do too. People have few enough pleasures in life at the moment and I don't want to have to stop fans watching their teams. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The next few weeks will be crucial for Scotlandâs NHS. The situation here is not as critical as it is in London and some other parts of the UK, but there is nervousness among the health professionals I speak to. What we are seeing now is the start of an upward trend in hospital admissions with some of those who became infected over the Christmas period now requiring hospital care. There are hotspots. Places like Tayside are treating more Covid patients than ever before, so is Dumfries and Galloway, and Ayrshire and Arran. However, Greater Glasgow and Clyde is still below the levels they saw back in April. Experts are not expecting the peak of this wave until early February and much depends on the behaviour of the new, more transmissible strain. We still donât know how bad it will get.

Celtic trained in Scotland on Saturday after returning from Dubai The first minister says she can't say how ""disappointed and frustrated I am"" to have football likely dominate today's briefing. Celtic confirmedone of their players tested positive for the virusless than 48 hours after the squad returned from a training trip to Dubai on Friday. It is not known if he was on the trip. The first minister says it ""is really vital"" that elite athletes' privileges are not abused. Ms Sturgeon adds that she does have ""doubts about whether Celtic's trip to Dubai was really essential."" She also has doubts about the club's adherence to bubble rules were strict enough. The first minister points out it is for the football authorities to assess whether any further action is necessary. ""Everyone, including football, should be erring on the side of caution,"" she adds. The first minister confirmsDubai has been added to Scotland's travel quarantine listwith anyone coming from the country told to self-isolate for 10 days ""Our basic travel rule is, don't,"" says Ms Sturgeon. No-one should be travelling apart from for essential reasons, she reiterates. Unless your trip is essential it is against the law right now to travel to and from Scotland at all. ""All of us should be staying at home right now as much as possible."" Ms Sturgeon turns to court proceedings, after this mornings news thatthe majority of criminal trials are to be put on holdwhile Scotland is in lockdown. The first minister says this will reduce the overall number of criminal trials by up to 75%. From tomorrow, witnesses should assume they are not due in court unless they are contacted by the Crown Office. The court system will focus on the most serious cases in the coming months. The first minister moves on to talk about vaccination and confirms that as of yesterday, 163,377 people had received their first dose of either the Pfizer or Oxford vaccine. More than 1,100 vaccination sites are now operational across the country. She says this number will increase as pharmacies and vaccination centres come to be used. Ms Sturgeon confirms the aim is for all those over 80 years old to have received the first dose of the vaccine over the next four weeks. All people over 70 and those in the clinically, extremely vulnerable group will be offered the vaccine by the middle of February, she adds. The first minister begins by acknowledging the start of home schooling today and some of the IT issues parents and pupils have been facing. Pupils across Scotland have been experiencingproblems accessing Microsoft Teamsas the majority move to home learning Ms Sturgeon explains these issues are not unique to Scotland, and she understands Microsoft is working to address them. The first minister says she understands how difficult learning at home can be. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us today. Here are some of the main stories from the day: Today's figure of 46,169 new positive Covid tests is the first time the number has been under 50,000 since 28 December. However, numbers are usually lower after the weekend due to a lag in reporting. Martin PatienceBBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut Empty shelves at a supermarket in Lebanon ahead of a 24-hour curfew which starts on Thursday Lebanon is set to enforce a
24-hour curfew from
this Thursday as it battles to contain the coronavirus. The
authorities say that without drastic action the countryâs fragile health system
will be overwhelmed. The curfew will initially last for eleven days but could
well be extended. Customers will be barred from shopping in
supermarkets and instead will need to rely on deliveries. The countryâs only
airport will remain open but the number of passengers is set to be dramatically
reduced. Compared with other countries, Lebanon had - until now - coped
relatively well with the coronavirus. But despite a rise in
infections, the government relaxed restrictions ahead of Christmas and New
Year, hoping to bolster the countryâs crumbling economy. Health officials say
that relaxation has led to a dramatic spike in the number of cases, which could
sky-rocket in the coming days. More than fifteen hundred Lebanese have died
from the virus in the past year. The World Health Organization has warned herd immunity won't be achieved this year, despite Covid vaccines being rolled out in countries across the world. ""We are not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021,"" the WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a briefing. She stressed that people needed to continue measures such as social distancing, hand washing and wearing face coverings. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened:  The health secretary was questioned about the prime minister beingspotted exercising seven miles from Downing Street. Sun reporter Kate Ferguson asked Matt Hancock for specific details about what people were allowed to do under the rules. She referred to a case where two women in Derbyshire were threatened with a fine after driving five miles to a park to meet each other for a walk. Ferguson then asked whether it was ""all right to go ahead and exercise seven miles away from your home"" - an apparent reference to reports the prime minister had been seen cycling in the Olympic Park in east London. Matt Hancock said: ""If you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles away from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""You should not go from one side of the country to another potentially taking the virus with you. ""So it is OK to go for a long walk, cycle ride or exercise. But stay local."" Asked about the story earlier and whether Boris Johnson was driven to the Olympic park, a spokesperson for the PM did not provide any details but said he had complied with Covid guidelines. A further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have been reported in the UK, bringing the total to 81,960. There have been another 46,169 positive cases reported, bringing the total cases to 3,118,518. This video can not be played Hancock: 'The bubbles policy will stay' Dan Bloom of the Mirror asks the health secretary if he can guarantee that support bubbles and childcare bubbles will remain - as many people rely on them. Matt Hancock says yes, he can ""rule out"" removing them, adding: ""I know how important they are to people. They're an important part of the system we have to support people."" But he stresses that they are there for ""individual specific people"" and that you have to stick to the same bubble, once you are in one. Hancock says he wants to be ""absolutely crystal clear"" about the fact they will stay. And Prof Powis is asked if there have been any incidences of people catching Covid on their way to, or back, from vaccine centres. He replies that all of those set up, whether large-scale centres or GP-led hubs, have infection prevention measures in place to minimise the risk of catching the virus. There is appropriate social distancing so people stay apart and the risk of transmission is as low as possible, adds Prof Powis.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The big question â and it is one that Elaine from Glasgow
asked â is whether mid-February will mark the start of the lifting of lockdown
and the return to normality. It should, but the process is likely to be slow. Firstly, it takes several weeks after the first dose for
an immune response to start to kick in. Second, the over-60s, who are at quite significant risk,
are not part of this initial stage and so will remain vulnerable to the virus. And finally, while trials showed the two vaccines that are
being used in the UK are very effective at preventing infection and certainly
at stopping serious illness, it is still uncertain what impact they will have
on transmission. It is possible people who are vaccinated can still pass
on the virus. We hope it will disrupt this to some extent â and maybe
even stop it. This will be a crucial factor in how quickly the UK and
the rest of the world can get on top of the pandemic. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Is a walk with a friend
and a takeaway coffee allowed? In answer to that simple
question, the health secretary says ""yes"" but goes on to stress that
the rules permit exercise with one other person. The emphasis should be
on exercising, not socialising, he says, and if too many people broke that
rule the government would have to ""have a look at it."" The rules, as ever, are
open to some interpretation and Mr Hancock clearly hopes his appeal for people
to not ""push the boundaries"" will work. But MPs and others are calling
for more clarity here, with some people travelling long distances to exercise
and others being punished for going for a walk relatively close to home. Laura Bundock from Sky News asks if it was complacent for the prime minister to allow mixing indoors over Christmas - and if we are paying the price now. Matt Hancock says what we're seeing is that ""the new variant of the virus is incredibly transmissible"" and is ""highly contagious"". The fact it spreads so easily means we have an ""incredibly difficult few weeks ahead of us"". It is imperative everybody follows the rules - and doesn't see them as a limit to be stretched. ""I know that's difficult but it's so important for everybody,"" he says. Prof Powis says when the NHS is under pressure, it's not just Covid patients affected but anyone requiring medical assistance. He says it's important ""we all pull together"" to ensure the NHS can treat us all and keep us safe. The health secretary stresses the importance of the public following the restrictions of the current lockdown. Asked by Emily Morgan of ITV whether it was time to make the rules stricter amid reports of people not sticking to them at the weekend, Matt Hancock says: ""We keep these things under review and we have demonstrated that we're willing to tighten the rules if they need to be tightened. ""But the thing that really matters right here, right now is that everybody follows the rules as they are today. ""And everybody can play their part in doing that."" He adds he applauds the action supermarket Morrisons has takenin enforcing the wearing of masksby its customers unless they have a medical reason. ""I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this,"" he says. The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the target of 12.5m doses of the vaccine for the most vulnerable, in the next five weeks, is ""doable"".

Thanks for joining us today. Here are some of the main stories from the day: Today's figure of 46,169 new positive Covid tests is the first time the number has been under 50,000 since 28 December. However, numbers are usually lower after the weekend due to a lag in reporting. Martin PatienceBBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut Empty shelves at a supermarket in Lebanon ahead of a 24-hour curfew which starts on Thursday Lebanon is set to enforce a
24-hour curfew from
this Thursday as it battles to contain the coronavirus. The
authorities say that without drastic action the countryâs fragile health system
will be overwhelmed. The curfew will initially last for eleven days but could
well be extended. Customers will be barred from shopping in
supermarkets and instead will need to rely on deliveries. The countryâs only
airport will remain open but the number of passengers is set to be dramatically
reduced. Compared with other countries, Lebanon had - until now - coped
relatively well with the coronavirus. But despite a rise in
infections, the government relaxed restrictions ahead of Christmas and New
Year, hoping to bolster the countryâs crumbling economy. Health officials say
that relaxation has led to a dramatic spike in the number of cases, which could
sky-rocket in the coming days. More than fifteen hundred Lebanese have died
from the virus in the past year. The World Health Organization has warned herd immunity won't be achieved this year, despite Covid vaccines being rolled out in countries across the world. ""We are not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021,"" the WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a briefing. She stressed that people needed to continue measures such as social distancing, hand washing and wearing face coverings. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened:  The health secretary was questioned about the prime minister beingspotted exercising seven miles from Downing Street. Sun reporter Kate Ferguson asked Matt Hancock for specific details about what people were allowed to do under the rules. She referred to a case where two women in Derbyshire were threatened with a fine after driving five miles to a park to meet each other for a walk. Ferguson then asked whether it was ""all right to go ahead and exercise seven miles away from your home"" - an apparent reference to reports the prime minister had been seen cycling in the Olympic Park in east London. Matt Hancock said: ""If you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles away from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""You should not go from one side of the country to another potentially taking the virus with you. ""So it is OK to go for a long walk, cycle ride or exercise. But stay local."" Asked about the story earlier and whether Boris Johnson was driven to the Olympic park, a spokesperson for the PM did not provide any details but said he had complied with Covid guidelines. A further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have been reported in the UK, bringing the total to 81,960. There have been another 46,169 positive cases reported, bringing the total cases to 3,118,518. This video can not be played Hancock: 'The bubbles policy will stay' Dan Bloom of the Mirror asks the health secretary if he can guarantee that support bubbles and childcare bubbles will remain - as many people rely on them. Matt Hancock says yes, he can ""rule out"" removing them, adding: ""I know how important they are to people. They're an important part of the system we have to support people."" But he stresses that they are there for ""individual specific people"" and that you have to stick to the same bubble, once you are in one. Hancock says he wants to be ""absolutely crystal clear"" about the fact they will stay. And Prof Powis is asked if there have been any incidences of people catching Covid on their way to, or back, from vaccine centres. He replies that all of those set up, whether large-scale centres or GP-led hubs, have infection prevention measures in place to minimise the risk of catching the virus. There is appropriate social distancing so people stay apart and the risk of transmission is as low as possible, adds Prof Powis.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The big question â and it is one that Elaine from Glasgow
asked â is whether mid-February will mark the start of the lifting of lockdown
and the return to normality. It should, but the process is likely to be slow. Firstly, it takes several weeks after the first dose for
an immune response to start to kick in. Second, the over-60s, who are at quite significant risk,
are not part of this initial stage and so will remain vulnerable to the virus. And finally, while trials showed the two vaccines that are
being used in the UK are very effective at preventing infection and certainly
at stopping serious illness, it is still uncertain what impact they will have
on transmission. It is possible people who are vaccinated can still pass
on the virus. We hope it will disrupt this to some extent â and maybe
even stop it. This will be a crucial factor in how quickly the UK and
the rest of the world can get on top of the pandemic. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Is a walk with a friend
and a takeaway coffee allowed? In answer to that simple
question, the health secretary says ""yes"" but goes on to stress that
the rules permit exercise with one other person. The emphasis should be
on exercising, not socialising, he says, and if too many people broke that
rule the government would have to ""have a look at it."" The rules, as ever, are
open to some interpretation and Mr Hancock clearly hopes his appeal for people
to not ""push the boundaries"" will work. But MPs and others are calling
for more clarity here, with some people travelling long distances to exercise
and others being punished for going for a walk relatively close to home. Laura Bundock from Sky News asks if it was complacent for the prime minister to allow mixing indoors over Christmas - and if we are paying the price now. Matt Hancock says what we're seeing is that ""the new variant of the virus is incredibly transmissible"" and is ""highly contagious"". The fact it spreads so easily means we have an ""incredibly difficult few weeks ahead of us"". It is imperative everybody follows the rules - and doesn't see them as a limit to be stretched. ""I know that's difficult but it's so important for everybody,"" he says. Prof Powis says when the NHS is under pressure, it's not just Covid patients affected but anyone requiring medical assistance. He says it's important ""we all pull together"" to ensure the NHS can treat us all and keep us safe. The health secretary stresses the importance of the public following the restrictions of the current lockdown. Asked by Emily Morgan of ITV whether it was time to make the rules stricter amid reports of people not sticking to them at the weekend, Matt Hancock says: ""We keep these things under review and we have demonstrated that we're willing to tighten the rules if they need to be tightened. ""But the thing that really matters right here, right now is that everybody follows the rules as they are today. ""And everybody can play their part in doing that."" He adds he applauds the action supermarket Morrisons has takenin enforcing the wearing of masksby its customers unless they have a medical reason. ""I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this,"" he says. The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the target of 12.5m doses of the vaccine for the most vulnerable, in the next five weeks, is ""doable"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock replies: ""Yes, we're on track to meet that target."" He says the target is ""ambitious"" but ""achievable"" and he is ""confident we're going to do it"". Since Thursday when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was rolled out, there was an increase in 210,000 vaccinations a day, on average.

"Southend Hospital's oxygen supply has ""reached a critical situation"" A hospital's oxygen supply has ""reached a critical situation"" due to rising numbers of Covid-19 infections. A document shared with the BBC showed Southend Hospital has had to reduce the amount it uses to treat patients. It said the target range for oxygen levels that should be in patients' blood had been cut from 92% to a baseline of 88-92%. Hospital managing director, Yvonne Blucher, said it was ""working to manage"" the situation. ""We are experiencing high demand for oxygen because of rising numbers of inpatients with Covid-19 and we are working to manage this,"" she said. ""The public can play their part by staying home and, where they cannot, following the 'hands, face, space' advice to cut the spread of the virus."" 'One in 18 have Covid-19' in parts of Essex Covid-19 and 'the end of normal learning' Husband from couple with Down's syndrome dies In the document, from the Mid and South Essex Hospitals Foundation Trust, which has been shared with frontline NHS staff, the oxygen supply was said to have ""reached a critical situation"". It said it was ""imperative we use oxygen efficiently and safely"" and states patients who are being fed oxygen and have an oxygen saturation of above 92% ""should have their oxygen weaned within the target range"", which is now 88-92%. This means very gradually reducing the saturation level. It added that ""maintaining saturations within this target range is safe and no patient will come to harm as a result"". GPs in Essex have told the BBC that the threshold for sending a patient to hospital for supplemental oxygen is if their oxygen saturation is at 92%. A level of 96-100% is deemed normal. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts in England, said there was ""huge pressure"" on hospital oxygen stocks because giving patients extra oxygen was a ""key part"" of coronavirus treatment. He said there were a number of hospitals where this happened in the first phase of coronavirus and over the past few weeks ""similar things have happened"" elsewhere. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts in England, said there was ""huge pressure on oxygen systems"" ""This is the kind of problem that chief executives and trust leadership teams are having to solve day in, day out,"" he said. ""If you [a hospital] push your oxygen to an absolutely critical level, then the thing that you can't do is have the oxygen system break down... so effectively you will have to dial it down, in which case you will probably have to transfer patients to the nearest neighbouring hospital for a short period of time. ""I cannot tell you how much work has been done over the summer and autumn to ensure that people [hospital trusts] have been prepared for this... they knew they would come under pressure if there were to be further waves, as has now proved to be the case."" Essex has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 per 100,000 people in the country, with seven of the 14 council areas in the county in the top 20most infected areas of England. The Mid and South Essex Hospitals Foundation Trust said it was ""imperative we use oxygen efficiently and safely"" By Michelle Roberts, health editor, BBC News Online News of oxygen issues is understandably worrying, but not unexpected. Tanks may be full, but flow is a problem. Many people who are sick with Covid will need extra oxygen to help them breathe. As Covid admissions increase, it can put huge demand on a hospital's piped oxygen supply system to provide this high flow. Hospital bosses have been planning for such scenarios for months, learning from experiences during the first wave of Covid when some trusts ran into difficulties. Many wards have made improvements to their pipework in preparation for a very busy winter, but there is still a limit to what hospitals can provide. When stretched to the maximum, other steps are needed, such transferring patients elsewhere or limiting how much oxygen is pumped to each patient. Southend Hospital has taken this latter measure. Although not ideal, it is not unsafe. Patients will be closely monitored and the trust hopes the situation will improve if new Covid admissions start to go down as people follow the stay at home lockdown rules.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says exemption from quarantine travel requirements for elite sport are to be reviewed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged football clubs not to ""abuse"" the privileges they are afforded while the rest of Scotland is in lockdown. Players and staff from Celtic FC are having to self-isolate after one tested positive for Covid-19 on return from a mid-season training camp in Dubai. Ms Sturgeon said she had doubts about whether the trip was really necessary. And she said ""everyone, including football, should be erring on the side of caution"" amid a rise in infections. Scottish football below Championship levelis to be suspended for three weeksin light of the current lockdown, with Scottish Cup and lower league ties to be rescheduled. Depleted Celtic draw with Hibernian How Celtic's Dubai trip unravelled Top flight football in Scotland is continuing while most Scots are subject to a ""stay at home"" order due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Celtic's home fixture against Hibernian went ahead on Monday evening, despite the club having lost 13 players and three staff to Covid-19 issues. Defender Christopher Jullien tested positive for the virus on return from the club's training camp in Dubai, with others including the club's manager Neil Lennon being forced to isolate as close contacts. Ms Sturgeon said she was ""disappointed and frustrated"" that her daily coronavirus briefing was again being ""dominated by football"". Celtic trained in Scotland on Saturday after returning from Dubai She said she had doubts about whether Celtic's trip ""was really essential"" and whether rules were strictly adhered to, saying it was for the footballing authorities to decide if further action was necessary. The first minister issued a warning to clubs that they must stick to the rules set out for them while the rest of the populace is subject to tight restrictions. She said: ""Football and elite sport more generally enjoys a number of privileges right now that the rest of us don't have. These privileges include the right to go to overseas training camps and be exempt from quarantine on return. ""It is really vital, obviously for public health reasons but also I think out of respect for the rest of the population living under really heavy restrictions, that these privileges are not abused."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross is an assistant referee in the game. He said that at a time when people are staying at home football games were something many looked forward to. Mr Ross said: ""We don't want to see the whole of Scottish football affected by the actions of one club."" He also called for financial support to be made available to clubs in the Scottish lower leagues and Scottish Cup who had had their games suspended for three weeks. Celtic manager Neil Lennon is among those who are self-isolating Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was currently in ""the most perilous and serious position since the start of the pandemic"", with a record number of people in hospital with Covid-19. She said everyone should be doing their utmost not to add to pressure on the health services by following the rules. She said: ""This whole episode should underline how serious the situation we are in now is. Everyone including football should be erring on the side of caution. ""I know fans of other clubs feel very strongly that the whole of football should not pay the price for the actions of any one club, and I agree with that. ""But of course a situation like this does make it essential for us to review the rules - including those around travel exemptions - and that's what we will be doing. As we do, I do hope that Celtic themselves will reflect seriously on all of this."" Ms Sturgeon cited photographs which emerged of players socialising in Dubai, but Celtic's assistant manager John Kennedy saidthese created a ""false picture""and that there had been ""minor slip-ups"" at worst. The club had previously claimed the government had given permission for the trip to go ahead, but Ms Sturgeon said it had only provided guidance to the footballing authorities on the rules. She said: ""It's not our role to give approval or not to what a football club is doing."" A statement posted on the Celtic website said that ""the reality is that a case could well have occurred had the team remained in Scotland"". It added: ""Celtic has done everything it can to ensure we have in place the very best procedures and protocols. From the outset of the pandemic, Celtic has worked closely with the Scottish government and Scottish football and we will continue to do so."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Terry Irving, 83, from Dumfries, was given the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on Monday Everyone aged 80 or over in Scotland will be given the Covid vaccine by February, the health secretary has said. Jeane Freeman also said care home staff and residents, as well as front-line health and social care staff would be vaccinated in the next few weeks. As of Sunday, 163,377 Scots had been given a first dose of vaccine. Ms Freeman told BBC Scotland that just under 560,000 people will have been vaccinated by the end of the month. The Oxford vaccine will be available at more than 1,100 locations from Monday. Scotland has been given an initial allocation of more than 500,000 doses to use in January. Where are the latest cases? When will I be vaccinated against the virus? Ms Freeman told BBC Radio's GoodMorning Scotland programme: ""We intend that by the end of this month, the very beginning of February, we will have vaccinated all residents in care homes and staff, all front-line health and social care workers and all those aged 80 or over. ""So that's just under 560,000. We've already vaccinated about 70% of people in care homes and about half of the health and social care workforce."" She said the Scottish government was on course to match the UK government's commitment to offer a vaccine jab to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. The health service will be able to vaccinate people as supplies of the jabs arrive, she said, with over-80s being contacted by their GPs. The government has now started publishing vaccination figures on a daily basis, with 163,377 Scots having been given a first dose as of Sunday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the health authorities in Scotland now had enough supplies to give jabs to all over-80s over the coming four weeks. She said the aim was to get throughthe priority listas quickly as possible. This had been expected to be complete by mid-May, but Ms Sturgeon said she was ""very, very hopeful we will be able to accelerate that to an earlier point"". A total of 1,664 people are in hospital being treated for Covid-19, the highest number since the pandemic began - with Ms Sturgeon saying the country was in a ""dangerous situation"". The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has already been administered in the Tayside, Lothian, Orkney and Highlands health board areas but this week will see it being used at vaccination centres across the whole country. Recent figures suggest a slight fall in the average positivity rates for Covid in many parts of Scotland, but pressures on the NHS have intensified. The number of patients in hospital in with Covid rose to new highs at the weekend, and Sunday saw a sharp increase in the number of patients requiring treatment in intensive care. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there were few signs that the threat was ""abating"" and thata tightening of restrictions could not be ruled out. The majority of Scotland's schools are closed until at least February with pupils now learning from home as the new term begins this week.. Only vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will receive face-to-face teaching. Local authorities said schools were better prepared to roll out digital learning than they were during the first lockdown.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The bubbles policy will stay"". The UK is at the ""worst point"" of the pandemic, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned, but said the actions of the public ""could make a difference"".

And a total of 2.6 million doses have been given out across the country, with some people having received both doses. Mr Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus was putting the NHS under ""significant pressure"", adding it was ""imperative"" that people limit their social contacts. ""The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules,"" he said. ""I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference."" The health secretary said he could ""rule out"" tightening restrictions by removing support and childcare bubbles, however. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Laura Kuenssberg: What next for Covid rules? Inside a mass vaccination centre PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home His comments follow similar warnings from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said that the next few weekswill be ""the worst"" of the pandemicfor the NHS. According to the latest figures, there have been another 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, and another 46,169 cases reported. There are also more than 32,000 people in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Matt Hancock has previously said he's learned to rule nothing out when it comes to dealing with the pandemic. But today he took the unusual step of doing just that. Support bubbles and childcare bubbles, hugely valued by so many, will stay. Senior Whitehall sources have previously told me bubbles were ""untouchable"" but for a minister to say as much, so explicitly and on the record, means there's now very little wriggle room for the government to change its mind. Ministers will know that scrapping bubbles, for those that rely on them, could have proved deeply unpopular. But this certainty is a rarity. Whilst the current emphasis is on compliance, the idea of toughening up controls in other areas is not being ruled out. The vaccine delivery plan says it is expected to take until spring to give a first dose to all 32 million people in the UK's priority groups, including everyone over 55 and those who are clinically vulnerable. Under the plan, the government has pledged to carry out at least two million vaccinations in England per week by the end of January, which it says will be made possible by rolling out jabs at 206 hospital sites, 50 vaccination centres and around 1,200 local vaccination sites. It also reiterates the government's aim of offering vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. According to Mr Hancock, two fifths of over-80s have now received their first dose, and almost a quarter of care home residents have received theirs. Also at the briefing, NHS England's national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the NHS was aiming to vaccinate the rest of thetop nine priority groupsby April, with a final push to offer all adults over 18 a jab by the autumn. He stressed it would take until February before there were ""early signs"" that vaccination was leading to a drop in hospitalisations. The country has still not seen the full impact of the Christmas loosening of lockdown restrictions, Prof Powis added, although he noted there are now 13,000 more Covid patients in hospital than there were on Christmas Day. Speaking in Bristol earlier, Mr Johnson warned the vaccination programme was in a ""race against time"" because of pressure on the NHS. He said it was ""a very perilous moment because everyone can sense the vaccine is coming in - my worry is that will breed false complacency"". When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Morrisons to ban shoppers who refuse to wear masks The newly-published vaccination plan also says ministers are aiming to offer jabs at more than 2,700 sites across the UK. And it says that daily vaccination figures for England will be published from now on - showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses. Earlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a ""strong case"" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising ""teachers and other key workers"" for vaccination after the ""first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated"". A quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added. In the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations. News that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped. Hitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week. With more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply. There is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February. However, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution. Challenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track. Asseven mass vaccination centresopened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use,although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. Vaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations. All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring,under new plans. And Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nationwill be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at homecan now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measuresare in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said: ""I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"".

"Christina McAnea promised to fight the public sector pay freeze Unison, the UK's biggest trade union, has elected a woman as leader for the first time. Christina McAnea won 47.7% of the vote and takes over as general secretary from Dave Prentis, who has been in the job since 2001. The former assistant general secretary beat fellow officials Paul Holmes, Roger McKenzie and Hugo Pierre in the contest, which began in October. Unison, which represents public sector workers, has 1.3 million members. Will trade union contests help or hinder Starmer? Unison boss stepping down after 20 years in role Stop wrangling over Corbyn, unions tell Labour Ms McAnea said: ""I become general secretary at the most challenging time in recent history - both for our country and our public services. ""Health, care, council, police, energy, school, college and university staff have worked throughout the pandemic, and it's their skill and dedication that will see us out the other side. ""Their union will continue to speak up for them and do all it can to protect them in the difficult months ahead."" Unison is promising action against the government's pay freeze for 1.3 million public sector workers, which it has described as an ""attack"" on members' livelihoods. Ms McAnea said: ""Despite the risks, the immense pressures and their sheer exhaustion, the dedication and commitment of our key workers knows no end. I will not let this government, nor any future one, forget that."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has alsodemanded a U-turn on public sector pay,as he urges ministers to ""protect family incomes"" from the effects of lockdowns and other restrictions in his first speech of the year. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he cannot ""justify a significant, across-the-board"" salary increase while the economy and public finances are suffering in the wake of the pandemic. Ms McAnea, an experienced negotiator and former NHS worker, is expected to be broadly supportive of Sir Keir, as Mr Prentis has been. The Labour leader welcomed her victory, saying: ""I know you will be a brilliant representative for Unison members. ""And it's a significant moment for the union to elect its first woman general secretary. I look forward to working with you."" Her election comes at a strained time between Sir Keir and several other unions whose general secretaries have spoken out in support of his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, who is currently suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party. Mr Holmes came second in the Unison contest, with 33.8%, followed by Mr McKenzie, on 10.8%, and Mr Pierre, on 7.8%. Ms McAnea grew up in Glasgow and worked as a housing officer before becoming a union employee.

"The NHS says ""this sort of misinformation undermines the hard work of everyone working long hours"" Multiple videos posted online claim to show empty hospitals in the UK as evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has been exaggerated. It has provoked a strong reaction from healthcare officials, who have encouraged the public to heed government advice as coronavirus infections surge - putting pressure on the NHS. Responding to a question about hospital beds being empty, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""When people say that, that is a lie."" They're mostly filmed by individuals walking through quiet hospital corridors and are being posted in Facebook groups and on the Twitter feeds of coronavirus sceptics and anti-lockdown activists. There have been videos taken of dozens of locations and some have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. The number of Covid patients has increased significantly in recent weeks and there areserious concerns about the NHS's ability to copewith the surge. However, because of the way healthcare trusts have reorganised hospitals, often separating Covid patients from others, and cancelling non-urgent care to free up capacity, some parts of hospital buildings will currently look empty.  That doesn't mean hospitals aren't busy. How busy are hospitals in England? Woman fined over 'empty hospitals' Facebook posts We've examined videos from two different locations and sought responses to them from the hospitals. This video can not be played Croydon University Hospital doctor: Covid 'not fake news' A video posted on social media purports to show an empty Croydon University Hospital, with a commentary claiming that the government is exaggerating the scale of the pandemic. The video, posted in three parts, has been viewed thousands of times and shared across multiple anonymous social media accounts. It has prompted other users to make comments below the post that their local hospitals are empty too. Croydon University Hospital is a large centre treating patients on a 24-hour basis. In a statement in response to the video posts, the hospital trust said: ""Contrary to videos circulating online claiming to show our hospital is empty, our services remain extremely busy."" The video starts with the camera entering the main reception room through signs saying ""NO ENTRY"". 'Most dangerous time' of the pandemic, says Whitty The main reception area has a closed coffee shop and the person filming says: ""I've never seen this place so empty."" Responding to the footage, a spokesperson for Croydon Health Services told us: ""We have a one-way system in the main entrance to help with social distancing when entering or leaving the hospital. The video shows this person arriving via the exit. ""The video was also filmed overnight, when the coffee shops would be closed and when we would expect to see our corridors less busy,"" they added. The video shows empty corridors. But there's a good reason the corridors are empty. ""We provide this care in our wards and in other clinical areas - not corridors or waiting rooms,"" said the hospital spokesperson. The man then walks around the outside of the A&E waiting room. ""Urgent treatment - empty. Look at this place,"" says the individual, filming the outside of a waiting room which looks fairly full of people sitting socially distanced. ""Regarding the A&E waiting area, the video shows only the entrance to the department,"" said the hospital. ""Patients brought in by ambulance, or those in a serious condition or requiring admission to hospital, are unlikely to be waiting in this area. ""Perpetuating myths and rumours only undermines their [NHS staff] hard work. It also risks the spread of misinformation, which could lead people to risk their own health and the health of their loved ones,"" said the hospital official. Another set of videos, posted on Twitter but without commentary, shows an individual walking down apparently empty corridors of the Princess Royal Hospital in Bromley on - it's claimed - New Year's Day. The NHS says the footage ""misrepresents what is really happening"". Four clips have been uploaded of someone passing down a corridor with a sign for the critical care unit, with a twitter thread referring to ""spare beds"" and the ""closed bereavement unit"" along with the hashtag ""film your hospital"". The videos have been watched tens of thousands of times, but reveal very little about how this particular hospital is dealing with the pandemic. In response, the King's College NHS Trust say the parts of the hospital dealing with the pandemic are extremely busy: ""This corridor is not representative of what is happening in wards across the hospital, which have seen a more than ten-fold increase in Covid admissions in the space of a month."" The bereavement suite, briefly shown in one of the videos, is apparently closed. But according to the Princess Royal University hospital website, it shuts at 4pm and on bank holidays. In a further clip, the person filming the video appears to enter an urgent care centre and on Twitter questions whether it is ""overrun"". The room looks relatively full of people. This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? One particular Facebook group in the UK dedicated to sharing pictures and videos of empty hospitals, had more than 13,000 members. This group was taken down by Facebook on 8 January. Another similar group subsequently set up was taken down by Facebook on 11 January. The administrators of the original group appear to be linked to another Facebook page promoting a baseless conspiracy about the global Covid pandemic,known as the 'Great Reset' theory. In March last year, several viral videos purported to show empty hospitals across the United States, with the hashtag 'film your hospital' being tweeted by thousands of accounts. This sparked a trend that has been repeated in other countries. These videos in the UK are the latest example of people taking direct action to spread misinformation about the pandemic. The year 2020 ended with a group of people standing outside St Thomas' Hospital in London shouting that the pandemic is a ""hoax"". One doctor witnessed the gathering and posted on Twitter that he was ""disgusted but mostly heartbroken."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Health Minister Vaughan Gething has been giving an update on the pandemic All eligible adults will be offered a Covid vaccine by the autumn, as the Welsh Government sets out a series of milestones It follows criticism that Wales is lagging behind the other UK nations in how quickly vaccinations are being given More than 86,000 people in Wales have been vaccinated so far, according to the first daily update on the total Courts should close to help stop the spread of Covid in jails, the body representing prison staff has said Students in Wales want partial refunds for university accommodation they are not using if they are obeying guidelines to stay away Catherine Evans and Andy Roberts That's all from today's live page - thank you for joining us for
our update on the coronavirus outbreak in Wales and the Welsh Government's announcement on vaccinations. Our latest stories: Have a good afternoon - stay safe and well. Wrexham continues to havehighest seven-day rolling case rateper 100,000 population at 851.7 followed by neighbouring Flintshire at 707.2. Bridgend's weekly rate is 695.7 and Merthyr Tydfil's is 605. The overall case rate for Wales is 415 per 100,000 people. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has urged the UK government to""protect family incomes""as it deals with the economic effects of coronavirus. In his first speech of the year, he demanded teachers, the armed forces and care workers are left out of the public sector pay freeze. Sir Keir also called for tougher restrictions to be considered for tackling coronavirus. The Conservatives said ministers were ""already taking steps"" to help people. Hospital staff in Wrexham are under immense pressure aftera ""rapid increase"" in seriously ill coronavirus patients, a medical director has warned. Wrexham now has the highest rate of Covid-19 in Wales, with 851.7 cases per 100,000 of the population. This is more than double the Welsh average. Steve Stanaway, medical director at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, pleaded with people to abide by rules. ""The worry from a staff point of view is how much more stretching can we take, how many more staff can we deploy?"" he said. The hospital - run by the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board - was the latest to suspend routine surgery as it tries to deal with rising numbers of Covid patients. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has welcomed the Welsh Governmentâs vaccination strategy but says it has come âlate in the dayâ. Ministers have pledged to ensure all aged over 70 get a jab by mid-February, over-50s and those at greater risk by spring and all remaining eligible adults by the autumn. Mr Price told BBC Wales: âItâs a positive step - weâve been calling for a vaccination plan for a very long time. âItâs late in the day but itâs progress."" He added that many people, including his own parents, wanted clarity. âMy parents, who are in their 80s, have been told their surgery won't have the ability to vaccinate them for another three weeks yet the GP surgery next door is starting this week,â he said. The Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said Wales should have a vaccinations minister who âgets up in the morning thinking about vaccinations and goes to bed thinking about vaccinationsâ. He said such a move would help the government recover from âits stuttering startâ to the vaccines programme. Mr Davies told BBC Wales the Welsh Government needed ""focus and direction to drive this forward"". âWe are not forgetting about our childcare workforceâ, the Welsh health minister has said. Vaughan Gething was addressing concerns from a member of the public about why places like nurseries and other childcare settings were allowed to remain open when schools had to shut. Speaking during the Welsh Government press conference, he said they were âas everâ acting on advice to âto avoid mortality and harm to peopleâ. Mr Gething said: âThe Welsh Government certainly isn't abandoning people to fend for themselves - weâre making our choices based on the evidence and advice we receive."" He added children still play ""a lesser role"" in transmission of the virus. The Welsh Government âenabledâ childcare facilities to stay open, Mr Gething said, but was not ârequiringâ them to do so. He said such services were essential to many key workers. âIf there wasn't childcare available to some of those people, weâd have a more significant challenge with our numbers,â he said, adding that if the evidence was to change, âwe would have to be prepared to make a different decisionâ. Wales' health minister has acknowledged it was ""entirely understandable people are concerned"" about when they will receive their vaccine. But Vaughan Gething also stressed that supplies will increase over the coming weeks. ""I think a number of people are are anxious because this is a worrying time. And it's entirely understandable on a human level why people are concerned"", he said. Mr Gething admitted that other UK nations had made a better start in rolling out the vaccine. But he said that he believed Wales had still made a ""good start"" and ""that's evidenced by the figures"". When asked about the concerns made by some GP practices, Mr Gething said he understands why some of them ""will be frustrated"". He added: ""But we're delivering the AstraZeneca vaccine in supplies that we have to keep it going. ""And as I said, the availability of that vaccine is the current rate limiting step and significantly increasing our delivery because we know there are a range of general practices and others who could deliver more if we had more supply. ""The supply they're being given is supplied for the week - it's not to stretch through for the whole population that they're covering."" The lessons aim to support home-schooling parents Bilingual lessons will be available to support home-schooling parents during lockdown, BBC Wales has announced. The dedicated Welsh content is part of a plan to deliverthe biggest education offering in the BBC's history. From Monday there will be an extensive service to reflect the curriculum in Wales and Welsh-medium learning. All lessons will be provided in both English and Welsh to help support parents and carers who do not speak Welsh. Primary school pupils will be able to access Welsh and maths online lessons from BBC Bitesize. A range of other subjects is also on offer for primary school pupils, including history, geography and health and well-being. Bitesize daily content and educational short packs are also available onBBC iPlayer, BBC Two Wales and the CBBC channel. The NHS in Wales is under âsevereâ pressure, according to Health Minister Vaughan Gething. He said there were more patients in critical care beds in hospital today than there were in the first week of the pandemic last spring. Mr Gething said it was important that people âdid their bitâ to tackle the spread of the virus and observed the âstay at homeâ message. The minister said he was working from home where possible and as a result he had not visited any hospitals. âI donât intend to go to an NHS hospital in a Level 4 lockdownâ, he said, claiming it would be âa distractionâ for âa photo-opâ. The decision to change the gap between the two doses of the
Pfizer vaccine âwill avoid more deathsâ, according to Wales' health minister. Vaughan Gething said he understood the âanxiety some would
feelâ but he believed it was âthe right choice to makeâ. Chief medical officers in each of the four UK nations and
experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised
giving both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having
initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs. Mr Gething said: âEach of the vaccines provide a high level of protection against
harm from coronavirus. Thatâs really good news for all of us. âThe second dose is important because it does have some impact
on improving the protection but, in particular, we think itâll provide
longer-term protection as well. âThink of it in this way - if you have two doses of the
vaccine available you could choose to give that to one person to provide them
with full excellent protection, or you could decide to give two doses to two
different people to provide both of them with high level protection. âThatâs the advice that weâve received. âThat means weâll actually protect more people, avoid more
hospitalisation and frankly and honestly, the clear advice Iâve had is that
doing things this way will avoid more deaths."" Arriva Buses Wales say that 28 of its staff in Wrexham have tested positive for Covid-19. The company says it's experiencing ""significant disruption"" on its network of bus routes in the area as a result of staff shortages caused by the pandemic. But it is reassuring travellers that its buses are safe to use and are regularly cleaned. A spokesperson for Arriva said: ""The safety of our customers and colleagues is our number one priority and we are being guided every step of the way by expert organisations such as the Health and Safety Executive and Public Health Wales. ""This has caused inevitable disruption to our bus network in Wrexham and we are working to address this as quickly as we can."" Arriva added that disruption to services between Llandudno and Caernarfon was due to staff shortages unrelated to the pandemic. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will offered by a community pharmacy in north west Wales in a three-day trial starting at the end of this week. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the product can be stored in a fridge and is easier to transport than the Pfizer vaccine. He said it was used to vaccinate the over-80s and was being taken to care homes, to vaccinate residents and staff. ""More than 100 GP practices will be running clinics by the end of this week and we have 14 mobile units taking the vaccine to care homes,"" Mr Gething told the briefing. ""This will increase to 250 GP practices by the end of the month."" The military is supporting the rollout of the vaccination programme in Wales, he added, with 14 immunisers working at centres and 70 other personnel. ""On Friday, the first community pharmacy will start to provide the Oxford vaccine in a three-day trial in North West Wales,"" he added. The rollout of the Oxford vaccine would then be extended across primary care, Mr Gething said. The Welsh Government has âgood suppliesâ of the Pfizer vaccine, the health minister said at today's Covid briefing. Vaughan Gething told journalists this was because the government had been âholding stock for the second doses, in line with the original MHRA rulesâ. These rules changed at New Year with the second dose now being given up to 12 weeks after the first, he said. Mr Gething said this change âallows us to speed up the rolloutâ. He added the government had more than 250,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which he expected to be used by mid-February, with more coming at the end of the month. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government was  âputting some early markers downâ on the vaccination strategy. He said: âBy 18 January, all front-line Welsh Ambulance Service staff will have been offered vaccination. âAll people living and working in care homes will have been offered vaccination by the end of this month. âAnd the number of GP practices providing vaccines closer to peopleâs homes will have risen to 250 by the end of January as supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine increasesâ. Mr Gething added that reaching the âmilestonesâ for other age groups depend on Wales receiving regular supplies of the vaccine. A plan to vaccinate around 700,000 people in Wales by the middle of next month has been revealed by the Welsh Government. Health Minister Vaughan Gething made the claim as he outlined âthree key milestonesâ in his strategy. He said: âBy mid-February, we aim to have offered vaccination to all care home residents and staff, front-line health and social care staff, everyone over 70, and  everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable. This is about 700,000 people."" He said this strategy would protect the people most at risk of serious illness and harm if they catch coronavirus. âBy the spring, subject to supply, we will have offered vaccination to everyone in the phase one priority groups â thatâs everyone over 50 and all those who are at risk because they have an underlying health condition,â Mr Gething said. He added: âBy the autumn, our focus will be on offering Covid vaccines to everyone else, in line with the latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.â All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk will be offered a Covid-19 vaccine by spring,under the Welsh Government's new plan. Everyone over 70, all care home residents and staff and front-line NHS workers will be offered a jab in Wales by mid-February. Ministers hope to reach all eligible adults by the autumn. It follows criticism of the speed of the vaccine rollout in Wales. Health Minister Vaughan Gething told Monday's press briefing: âThis is a huge task â we could be offering vaccines to up to 2.5m adults in Wales, depending on the advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationâ. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is about to give an update on the pandemic. You can watch it live on BBC One Wales,the BBC iPlayer, onS4C, and via the Coronavirus Update video link above. The Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area of south Wales has seen the highest number of deaths of people with Covid since the outbreak began. A total of 1,144 people have died in the area. This is followed by 750 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area of south east Wales. Students in Waleswant partial refunds for university accommodationbecause they are not spending as much time there due to the coronavirus pandemic. The National Union of Students (NUS) Wales said students ""shouldn't be penalised financially"" forfollowing Welsh Government guidelines. Two Welsh universities have said they would give partial refunds. The Welsh Government said universities should have staggered returns andstudents only return when asked to. Staggered returns are being introduced in order to ""help stop the spread of the virus in student accommodation"" according to the Welsh Government. It accepted this could mean some students need to stay home longer than anticipated, with online learning used at the start of term. But some students feel they should not be paying for student accommodation when they are not there. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Small business owner Jon Wilding is facing a dilemma: his livelihood is on hold because of Covid restrictions and he has a big tax bill to settle. If his company supplying marquees to outdoor events goes bust, the taxman will get paid, but his reputation as a businessman will be ruined forever. ""If I shut the business down, I then become director of a business that's gone bankrupt, at which stage getting loans in the future becomes nigh-on impossible,"" he told the BBC. ""I feel like I'm one of those people who's been left out. We don't need a lot to keep going,"" said Mr Wilding, of Cannock in the West Midlands. ""The government say their support system is the best in the world, we've done furlough, this that and whatever, but it's not getting to all the people that need it."" Apart from the Bounce Back Loan scheme, his two-person business has received no government assistance. His colleague was furloughed in March last year, but because Mr Wilding is the director, he is not allowed to furlough himself. Business offered new grants to survive lockdown Businesses 'crushed' by new England lockdown PM acted 'decisively' on England lockdown - Sunak The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) is particularly concerned about people like Mr Wilding. It says directors of small companies, who pay themselves in dividends rather than drawing a salary, are not receiving any help from the government. The FSB says somewhere between 700,000 and 1.1 million people fall into this category. It has put forward ideas to help some of those firms, which it hopes ministers will adopt. The FSB's proposed Directors Income Support Scheme would pay them grants of up to Â£7,500 to cover three months of lost trading profits. It would be limited to those who earn less than Â£50,000 a year. ""Company directors, the newly self-employed, those in supply chains and those without commercial premises are still being left out in the cold,"" said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry. Without further government help to cope with the effects of the pandemic, a record 250,000 small businesses could be lost in the next 12 months, the FSB said. ""The development of business support measures has not kept pace with intensifying restrictions,"" Mr Cherry added. ""As a result, we risk losing hundreds of thousands of great, ultimately viable small businesses this year, at huge cost to local communities and individual livelihoods."" The Federation of Small Businesses said the government had met the latest national lockdown ""with a whimper"" The FSB based its prediction on a survey of 1,400 small firms, 5% of which said they expected to close this year. If those figures were replicated across the country, some 250,000 of the UK's 5.9 million small firms could disappear, it said. Mr Cherry said the government had met the latest national lockdown ""with a whimper"" and called for help that went beyond the retail, leisure and hospitality businesses. The FSB said it had submitted its support scheme proposals to the Treasury and was expecting a decision this month. The Treasury said nothing was planned at present, but added: ""Our support schemes are designed to get help to those who need it most whilst protecting the taxpayer from fraud, but of course we keep everything under review and are always open to further ideas.""

"This video can not be played Health Minister Vaughan Gething aims to offer all adults a jab by the autumn. All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid will be offered a vaccine by spring, under new Welsh Government plans. A vaccine strategy unveiled by Health Minister Vaughan Gething aims to offer all adults a jab by the autumn. It comes after criticism that therollout of the vaccine has been slower than in other parts of the UK. The latest figures show 86,039 doses had been administered by 22:00 GMT on Sunday. A total of 327,000 doses - 280,000 of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 47,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - have now been delivered to the Welsh NHS. The figures mean 2.7% of Wales population has so far been vaccinated - compared to just over 4% in Northern Ireland, about 3.5% in England and 3% in Scotland. Q&A: When will I get the Covid-19 vaccines? Wales has given 70,000 of 275,000 vaccine doses UK at 'perilous moment' in Covid pandemic, says PM Across the UK nearly 400,000 second doses have been administered, including 374,613 in England, 79 in Wales, 13,949 in Northern Ireland and, as of January 3, 36 in Scotland. Mr Gething admitted the rest of the UK had ""gone slightly faster than we have"", but said the latest vaccinations figures showed a ""significant acceleration"" in the rollout. The Welsh Conservatives accused the government of a ""stuttering start"", while Plaid Cymru said the plan was ""late in the day"". Everyone over 70, all care home residents and staff, and front-line NHS and social care workers will be offered a jab by mid-February, under similar timescales to other UK nations. This 82-year-old woman was one of 100 to receive her vaccine at a special clinic in Swansea on Saturday The Welsh Government's vaccination plans aim to cover 2.5 million people by September, with vaccines supplied by the UK government. Mr Gething said: ""Delivering this vaccination programme to the people in Wales is a huge task but an enormous amount of work is going on to make it a success. ""We are making good progress with thousands more people being vaccinated every day."" The plan sets out a series of ""milestones"" for the vaccine rollout in Wales - all depending on the supply of vaccines approved for use. At a press conference, Mr Gething said the government aimed to vaccinate: all Welsh Ambulance Service staff by 18 January all those living and working in care homes by the end of January the rest of the top four priority groups - front-line health and social care staff, everyone over 70 and people who are extremely clinically vulnerable - by mid-February everyone over 50 and those at greater risk because they have a underlying health condition by the spring all ""eligible adults"" by the autumn Mr Gething said 700,000 people would be vaccinated by mid-February. According to the plan, the number of GPs' surgeries delivering vaccines will be increased from around 100 to more than 250 by the end of January. The number of mass vaccination centres will increase in the next couple of weeks to 35, according to Welsh Government's plan. One of those is Margam Orangery, in Neath Port Talbot, where about 500 people will be vaccinated each day. At the press conference, Mr Gething defendedthe UK-wide decision to increase the gapbetween giving the two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and said it would ""avoid more deaths"". ""Each of the vaccines provide a high level of protection against harm from coronavirus. That's really good news for all of us,"" he added. Wales 'ready to vaccinate at a higher rate' Wales last in UK nations as 50,000 vaccinated Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh Government should have a vaccinations minister who ""gets up in the morning thinking about vaccinations and goes to bed thinking about vaccinations"". He said such a move would help the government recover from a ""stuttering start"" to the vaccines programme. Mr Davies said the government needed ""focus and direction to drive this forward"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the strategy but said it was ""late in the day"". Mr Price said many people, including his own parents, wanted clarity: ""My parents, who are in their 80s, have been told their surgery won't have the ability to vaccinate them for another three weeks, yet the GP surgery next door is starting this week."" Larger supplies of the Oxford jab will be needed to speed up vaccinations Daniel Davies, BBC Wales political correspondent The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is crucial to ensuring everyone aged over 70 can have at least one jab by Valentine's Day. Health boards plan to use reserves of the Pfizer vaccine, but they alone will not reach the Welsh Government's first milestone. To speed things up, bigger supplies of the Oxford vaccine are needed. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine however, the stock is not held by the Welsh Government. Instead, it is delivered directly to the frontline - including GPs and community pharmacies - by Public Health England. Around 24,000 Oxford doses arrived in Wales last week; 26,000 are due this week; and another 80 to 100,000 are expected to arrive in four batches next week. If the mid-February milestone is reached, attention then turns to the over-50s and younger people whose health puts them at greater risk. They can expect a dose by the Spring, but discussions are continuing between the four UK nations to nail down a more specific date. Dr Helen Alefounder is a GP in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county and part of a team that administered 400 vaccines at care comes last week after receiving the vaccine herself on Wednesday. ""Between us and the surgery next door that we're working with we've got just shy of 20,000 patients to vaccinate,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""It's an absolutely huge task, it's really scary, but we are really keen and committed to get it done because everybody is sick of lockdown and let's be honest, everybody wants life to return to as normal as possible and the only way we're going to do that is to mass vaccinate people."" A mass-vaccination centre has been set up at Margam Orangery near Port Talbot Other GPsurgeries have posted on social media,externalthat they have not received as many doses of the vaccine as promised. Vaccination numbers will now be published daily and the number of mass vaccination centres will rise from 22 to 35. The vaccination plan also suggests pharmacies could be used to deploy the vaccine. Dr Gill Richardson, the senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccination programme in Wales, said GPs were ""raring to go"" to get the vaccine distributed. She said the model for Wales' vaccination programme was focused around the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, which was approved in late December and ""much larger quantities"" were expected. She also said: ""I know it's very difficult if you haven't had a letter and you're feeling anxious but you are going to be approached and when you're approached we'd like it to be as soon as possible and as convenient as possible to you."" Michael Sullivan, 93, from Radyr, Cardiff, is one of those who is yet to receive his letter. He said: ""I hear of all these other people having their second jabs and nobody's even thought of contacting me to say I'm going to have one in the first place. It's a bit depressing. It makes me think somebody's not doing what they should be doing. ""It gets stressful more easily, that's another thing one has to bare in mind - it's going to save my life."" Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. Elen Jones, the Wales director of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said community pharmacists were ""willing and skilled to help deliver the vaccination programme, as they do with flu every year"". She added pharmacists could help deliver the vaccine ""at a more local level"". Welsh ministers have been under intense pressure since it became clear that Wales was lagging behind every other home nation in the initial weeks of vaccine rollout. It's still not clear why that should be the case - the logistical challenges of rollout and the change in advice over the time period between first and second doses apply across the UK, not just to Wales. The health minister says that there has already been ""a significant step-up in delivery"". The test of that will be whether the system in Wales can meet the delivery goals set out in the vaccination strategy - which (as for the other home nations) also rely on a regular and sufficient supply of vaccine.

"He warns this is the ""worst point"" of the pandemic so far and urges people to keep following lockdown rules He says UK on track to offer first dose of vaccine to everyone in top 4 priority groups by mid-February It's still not known how much people who have had vaccine can transmit Covid to others, he says Hospitals are under significant and sustained pressure, says NHS England medical director Stephen Powis, warning vaccine is ""not a free pass"" Hancock says government willing to tighten lockdown rules but support bubbles will stay Seven mass vaccination centres open in England, with more sites to open later this week 2.4 million people in UK have received a first dose of vaccine No herd immunity will be achieved in 2021, says WHO chief scientist Portugal has recorded its highest daily death toll of 122 Spain is racing to distribute vaccines to areas cut off by the weekend snowstorm before temperatures drop More than 1.9m people have died and 90m have been infected worldwide - Johns Hopkins University Edited by James Clarke and Martha Buckley Today's live page coverage was brought to you by Owen Amos, Victoria Bisset, Martha Buckley, James Clarke, Doug Faulkner, Alex Kleiderman, Alix Kroeger, Becky Morton, Paul Seddon and Lauren Turner. Thanks for joining us today. Here are some of the main stories from the day: Today's figure of 46,169 new positive Covid tests is the first time the number has been under 50,000 since 28 December. However, numbers are usually lower after the weekend due to a lag in reporting. Martin PatienceBBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut Empty shelves at a supermarket in Lebanon ahead of a 24-hour curfew which starts on Thursday Lebanon is set to enforce a
24-hour curfew from
this Thursday as it battles to contain the coronavirus. The
authorities say that without drastic action the countryâs fragile health system
will be overwhelmed. The curfew will initially last for eleven days but could
well be extended. Customers will be barred from shopping in
supermarkets and instead will need to rely on deliveries. The countryâs only
airport will remain open but the number of passengers is set to be dramatically
reduced. Compared with other countries, Lebanon had - until now - coped
relatively well with the coronavirus. But despite a rise in
infections, the government relaxed restrictions ahead of Christmas and New
Year, hoping to bolster the countryâs crumbling economy. Health officials say
that relaxation has led to a dramatic spike in the number of cases, which could
sky-rocket in the coming days. More than fifteen hundred Lebanese have died
from the virus in the past year. The World Health Organization has warned herd immunity won't be achieved this year, despite Covid vaccines being rolled out in countries across the world. ""We are not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021,"" the WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a briefing. She stressed that people needed to continue measures such as social distancing, hand washing and wearing face coverings. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened:  The health secretary was questioned about the prime minister beingspotted exercising seven miles from Downing Street. Sun reporter Kate Ferguson asked Matt Hancock for specific details about what people were allowed to do under the rules. She referred to a case where two women in Derbyshire were threatened with a fine after driving five miles to a park to meet each other for a walk. Ferguson then asked whether it was ""all right to go ahead and exercise seven miles away from your home"" - an apparent reference to reports the prime minister had been seen cycling in the Olympic Park in east London. Matt Hancock said: ""If you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles away from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""You should not go from one side of the country to another potentially taking the virus with you. ""So it is OK to go for a long walk, cycle ride or exercise. But stay local."" Asked about the story earlier and whether Boris Johnson was driven to the Olympic park, a spokesperson for the PM did not provide any details but said he had complied with Covid guidelines. A further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have been reported in the UK, bringing the total to 81,960. There have been another 46,169 positive cases reported, bringing the total cases to 3,118,518. This video can not be played Hancock: 'The bubbles policy will stay' Dan Bloom of the Mirror asks the health secretary if he can guarantee that support bubbles and childcare bubbles will remain - as many people rely on them. Matt Hancock says yes, he can ""rule out"" removing them, adding: ""I know how important they are to people. They're an important part of the system we have to support people."" But he stresses that they are there for ""individual specific people"" and that you have to stick to the same bubble, once you are in one. Hancock says he wants to be ""absolutely crystal clear"" about the fact they will stay. And Prof Powis is asked if there have been any incidences of people catching Covid on their way to, or back, from vaccine centres. He replies that all of those set up, whether large-scale centres or GP-led hubs, have infection prevention measures in place to minimise the risk of catching the virus. There is appropriate social distancing so people stay apart and the risk of transmission is as low as possible, adds Prof Powis.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The big question â and it is one that Elaine from Glasgow
asked â is whether mid-February will mark the start of the lifting of lockdown
and the return to normality. It should, but the process is likely to be slow. Firstly, it takes several weeks after the first dose for
an immune response to start to kick in. Second, the over-60s, who are at quite significant risk,
are not part of this initial stage and so will remain vulnerable to the virus. And finally, while trials showed the two vaccines that are
being used in the UK are very effective at preventing infection and certainly
at stopping serious illness, it is still uncertain what impact they will have
on transmission. It is possible people who are vaccinated can still pass
on the virus. We hope it will disrupt this to some extent â and maybe
even stop it. This will be a crucial factor in how quickly the UK and
the rest of the world can get on top of the pandemic. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Is a walk with a friend
and a takeaway coffee allowed? In answer to that simple
question, the health secretary says ""yes"" but goes on to stress that
the rules permit exercise with one other person. The emphasis should be
on exercising, not socialising, he says, and if too many people broke that
rule the government would have to ""have a look at it."" The rules, as ever, are
open to some interpretation and Mr Hancock clearly hopes his appeal for people
to not ""push the boundaries"" will work. But MPs and others are calling
for more clarity here, with some people travelling long distances to exercise
and others being punished for going for a walk relatively close to home. Laura Bundock from Sky News asks if it was complacent for the prime minister to allow mixing indoors over Christmas - and if we are paying the price now. Matt Hancock says what we're seeing is that ""the new variant of the virus is incredibly transmissible"" and is ""highly contagious"". The fact it spreads so easily means we have an ""incredibly difficult few weeks ahead of us"". It is imperative everybody follows the rules - and doesn't see them as a limit to be stretched. ""I know that's difficult but it's so important for everybody,"" he says. Prof Powis says when the NHS is under pressure, it's not just Covid patients affected but anyone requiring medical assistance. He says it's important ""we all pull together"" to ensure the NHS can treat us all and keep us safe. The health secretary stresses the importance of the public following the restrictions of the current lockdown. Asked by Emily Morgan of ITV whether it was time to make the rules stricter amid reports of people not sticking to them at the weekend, Matt Hancock says: ""We keep these things under review and we have demonstrated that we're willing to tighten the rules if they need to be tightened. ""But the thing that really matters right here, right now is that everybody follows the rules as they are today. ""And everybody can play their part in doing that."" He adds he applauds the action supermarket Morrisons has takenin enforcing the wearing of masksby its customers unless they have a medical reason. ""I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this,"" he says. The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the target of 12.5m doses of the vaccine for the most vulnerable, in the next five weeks, is ""doable"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock replies: ""Yes, we're on track to meet that target."" He says the target is ""ambitious"" but ""achievable"" and he is ""confident we're going to do it"". Since Thursday when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was rolled out, there was an increase in 210,000 vaccinations a day, on average. The mass vaccination sites means the speed of the rollout will increase further, he adds. He says of the target: ""It's not going to be easy but we're going to get there."" Prof Powis adds everyone is confident the NHS can ""stand up to this challenge"" and deliver it, and that ""it's in all our interests to speed through those high priority groups"".  Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Another warning, this
time from Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. There is
""significant and sustained pressure"" on hospitals, he says, and they
are ""yet to see"" the impact of the loosening of restrictions at
Christmas reflected in admissions. To summarise, things are
bad and about to get worse. He says the vaccine programme cannot be seen as a ""free pass"" and only if people complied with the
lockdown laws will the situation be manageable. NHS England national medical director Prof Stephen Powis says the country should be ""in no doubt"" that the battle against Covid is ""tougher than it has ever been"". There are 13,000 more patients in hospital since Christmas Day, he says, adding there are ""stubbornly high"" levels of infections and deaths. Hospitals are seeing ""significant and sustained pressure"" from the rising number of patients. And we are still to see the full impact of the loosening of restrictions at Christmas, Prof Powis adds. It is, he says, an ""extremely serious moment for the country"". And the vaccine ""cannot be seen as a free pass"" to ignore the guidance in place, like social distancing and staying inside. ""We have to keep focus and resilience as a country,"" he says.  The health secretary refers to a statement given earlier by the head of the NHS in which he talked about the UK being in a ""sprint"" from now to February, as those in the priority groups get their vaccinations. ""It will then kick off another sprint up to April as we get the rest of the vulnerable groups protected,"" Hancock says. ""And then, finally, a marathon to the autumn as we deliver vaccination to everybody else."" But he says the current pressures on the NHS mean the UK is in an ""extremely serious moment."" Hancock adds the vaccine is ""good news"" but ""cannot be seen by any of us as a free pass to ignore the national guidance"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The rules may not be
getting any stronger but the language certainly is. Matt Hancock repeated
the warning that this was the ""worst point"" of the pandemic so far. He made clear the onus
is on individuals, whose actions could ""make a difference"". Increasingly urgent
appeals to follow the rules reflect deep concern in government that the message
isn't getting through. The health secretary says he wants the UK to get back to normal as fast as possible. ""I want us to have that Great British summer. And my team and I are working hard to deliver this as fast as possible."" Matt Hancock goes on to outline the government's vaccine delivery plan - saying it is the biggest vaccination programme in British history. He adds: ""We have significantly accelerated the care home vaccination rollout. ""Almost a quarter of older care home residents have now received their first dose of the vaccine and we are committed to reach every care home resident this month."" Matt Hancock starts with an update of the number of daily cases. The health secretary says the new variant is highly contagious - with 46,169 cases recorded in the UK in the last day. There were 32,294 people in hospital - up 22% on this time last week, he adds. Hancock says the vaccine rollout is proceeding at pace and is the ""way out"" of the pandemic He says 2.6m doses of the vaccine have been given - to 2.3m people - more than all other countries of Europe together, Â© 2025 BBC.

"Parler has hit back after Amazon pulled support for its so-called ""free speech"" social network. Parler is suing the tech giant,accusing it of breaking anti-trust laws by removing it,external. Parler had been reliant on the tech giant's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing service to provide its alternative to Twitter. The platform was popular among supporters of Donald Trump, although the president is not a user. Amazon took the action after finding dozens of posts on the service that it said encouraged violence. In response, the platform has asked a federal judge to order Amazon to reinstate it. ""AWS's decision to effectively terminate Parler's account is apparently motivated by political animus,"" the complaint reads. ""It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter."" Amazon has issued a statement in response. ""There is no merit to these claims,"" it said. ""AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler's right to determine for itself what content it will allow. However, it is clear that there is significant content on Parler that encourages and incites violence against others, and that Parler is unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which is a violation of our terms of service. ""We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening."" Examples Amazon had provided included posts calling for the killing of Democrats, Muslims, Black Lives Matter leaders, and mainstream media journalists. Google and Apple had already removed Parler from their app stores towards the end of last week saying it had failed to comply with their content-moderation requirements. However, it had still been accessible via the web - although visitors had complained of being unable to create new accounts over the weekend, without which it was not possible to view its content. Parler has been online since 2018, and may return if it can find an alternative host. However, chief executive John Matzetold Fox News on Sunday that,external""every vendor from text message services to email providers to our lawyers all ditched us too"". ""We're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we're having a lot of trouble because every vendor we talk to says they won't work with us because if Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, they won't,"" he added. AWS's move is the latest in a series of actions affecting social media following the rioting on Capitol Hill last week. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ Facebook and Twitter have also banned President Trump's accounts on their platforms,citing concerns that he might incite further violence. Parler's users included the Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who had led an effort in the Senate to delay certifying Joe Biden's electoral college victory. He had about five million followers on the platform - more than his tally on Twitter. Parler's app now shows an error message and its website is offline ""Why should a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires have a monopoly on political speech?""he tweeted over the weekend,external. Parler's downfall appears to have benefited Gab - another ""free speech"" social network that is popular with far-right commentators. Ithas claimed to have,external""gained more users in the past two days than we did in our first two years of existing"". Parler has long been a home for what you might call untouchables, people who had been excluded from mainstream services for offences such as blatant racism or incitement to violence. During a brief excursion onto the site over the weekend, I observed plenty of examples of such behaviour, with users exhibiting vile anti-Semitism, displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika and uttering incoherent threats against those they perceive to be enemies of America. But as Amazon's deadline approached something like panic took hold, with users desperately urging their followers to join them on other platforms. Most seemed to accept that Parler was doomed, while vowing to continue their fight elsewhere. ""Well this is the end,"" wrote one user, who proclaimed his support for the American Nazi Party.

"A number of positive cases have been identified among passengers who had flown into Glasgow from Dubai since the new year Dubai has been added to Scotland's travel quarantine list with anyone coming from the country told to self-isolate for 10 days. The rule, which came into effect at 04:00, will also apply retrospectively for passengers who have  made the journey since 3 January. Celtic confirmedone of their players tested positive for the virusless than 48 hours after the squad returned from a training trip to Dubai on Friday. It is not known if he was on the trip. The Scottish government said clinicians and the local NHS health protection team were in contact with Celtic providing advice. It also confirmed that quarantine rules did not apply to sports people who had attended ""elite training"" abroad. However, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week questioned the purpose of Celtic's trip and whether they were following social-distancing rules after seeing photos from their Dubai base. She warned that professional sport's privileges could be lost if protocols were not followed by all participants. The government said the change was due to a number of positive cases being identified in passengers who had flown into Glasgow from Dubai since the new year. It said the ""preventative action"" would help stem the rise in coronavirus cases. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""It is evident, both in Scotland and in countries across the world, that the virus continues to pose real risks to health and to life and we need to interrupt the rise in cases."" He added: ""Imposing quarantine requirements on those arriving in the UK is our first defence in managing the risk of imported cases from communities with high risks of transmission. That is why we have made the decision to remove Dubai from the country exemptions list. ""Whether or not an overseas destination has been designated for quarantine restrictions, our message remains clear that people should not currently be undertaking non-essential foreign travel. ""People need to stay at home to help suppress the virus, protect our NHS and save lives."" Joanne Dooey, president of the Scottish Passenger Agents' Association (SPAA), said: ""Removing Dubai from the safe list is understandable. We believe that there has been a cluster of infections around Scots who travelled to Dubai over the Christmas and New Year period. ""Whilst we're keen to see a return to increased international travel, protecting the health of the whole country remains our key concern and we are supportive of this move.""

"Terry Irving, 83, from Dumfries, was given the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on Monday Everyone aged 80 or over in Scotland will be given the Covid vaccine by February, the health secretary has said. Jeane Freeman also said care home staff and residents, as well as front-line health and social care staff would be vaccinated in the next few weeks. As of Sunday, 163,377 Scots had been given a first dose of vaccine. Ms Freeman told BBC Scotland that just under 560,000 people will have been vaccinated by the end of the month. The Oxford vaccine will be available at more than 1,100 locations from Monday. Scotland has been given an initial allocation of more than 500,000 doses to use in January. Where are the latest cases? When will I be vaccinated against the virus? Ms Freeman told BBC Radio's GoodMorning Scotland programme: ""We intend that by the end of this month, the very beginning of February, we will have vaccinated all residents in care homes and staff, all front-line health and social care workers and all those aged 80 or over. ""So that's just under 560,000. We've already vaccinated about 70% of people in care homes and about half of the health and social care workforce."" She said the Scottish government was on course to match the UK government's commitment to offer a vaccine jab to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. The health service will be able to vaccinate people as supplies of the jabs arrive, she said, with over-80s being contacted by their GPs. The government has now started publishing vaccination figures on a daily basis, with 163,377 Scots having been given a first dose as of Sunday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the health authorities in Scotland now had enough supplies to give jabs to all over-80s over the coming four weeks. She said the aim was to get throughthe priority listas quickly as possible. This had been expected to be complete by mid-May, but Ms Sturgeon said she was ""very, very hopeful we will be able to accelerate that to an earlier point"". A total of 1,664 people are in hospital being treated for Covid-19, the highest number since the pandemic began - with Ms Sturgeon saying the country was in a ""dangerous situation"". The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has already been administered in the Tayside, Lothian, Orkney and Highlands health board areas but this week will see it being used at vaccination centres across the whole country. Recent figures suggest a slight fall in the average positivity rates for Covid in many parts of Scotland, but pressures on the NHS have intensified. The number of patients in hospital in with Covid rose to new highs at the weekend, and Sunday saw a sharp increase in the number of patients requiring treatment in intensive care. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there were few signs that the threat was ""abating"" and thata tightening of restrictions could not be ruled out. The majority of Scotland's schools are closed until at least February with pupils now learning from home as the new term begins this week.. Only vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will receive face-to-face teaching. Local authorities said schools were better prepared to roll out digital learning than they were during the first lockdown.

"The FBI warns of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Biden inauguration The head of the National Guard says he can deploy up to 15,000 troops in Washington, to bolster security Democrats have asked Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump They also introduced an article of impeachment against the president, to be acted on if Mr Pence fails to act They charge Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Dozens have been charged in connection with last week's violence, which left five people dead Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now, but here's a recap on what happened on this busy Monday: In his letter to staff, circulated on social media, Chad Wolf said he had hoped to remain as acting secretary to homeland security until the end of the Trump administration. ""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by the recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as acting secretary,"" he said, ""which serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power"". Wolf's resignation comes after he last week called on Trump and all elected officials to ""strongly condemn"" the Capitol riot. His exit throws the department into turmoil just as it is gearing up for inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January, which has been designated a national security special event. The Secret Service had planned to lock down most of central Washington DC on the day before Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Now it will proceed with its security preparations six days earlier than originally scheduled, beginning this Wednesday. On the same day he announced his resignation, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the change of plans came ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration"". It comes on a day in which the National Guard said it would deploy up to 15,000 troops to the city to beef up security ahead of the formal presidential transition. The Washington Monument has been closed to visitors and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to attend the ceremony virtually rather than in person. Some news just in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has announced he is stepping down, in a letter to his department.  Ivanka was there at the inauguration of her father, but she will be there for his successor? According to the DailyMail.com, Ivanka Trump is planning to attend
Joe Bidenâs inauguration on 20 January â upsetting her father in the process. The news site quotes a White House insider as saying Ms
Trump believes it will help âher own political aspirationsâ as she will come
across as a âgood sport and will gain future supportersâ. President
Trump is said to be up in arms at his daughterâs decision. â'He
said it's an insult that she would even want to engage with the crooks that are
trying to bring him down,â the source says. If Ms Trump
does attend the inauguration, according to the insider, she will miss the launch of her father's campaign to reclaim the presidency in 2024 which is set for the same day. We previously reported that hotel chain Marriott International, health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield and financial powerhouse Citibank said they will withhold donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the election results last week. Many more companies are now saying they will do the same. They include accounting giant Deloitte, rental company Airbnb, telecom leader AT&T and credit card companies American Express and Mastercard. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in suspending all political giving for some amount of time, as did the Hilton Hotels chain, financial services firm Charles Schwab and manufacturing conglomerate 3M. Greeting card manufacturer Hallmark - one of the largest employers in Kansas City, Missouri - is demanding refunds from two Republican senators who objected to the election results. Other companies like Bank of America and the Ford Motor Company said they would take voting records into consideration before any future campaign contributions. Letâs
look in more detail at the charges against President Trump contained in theresolution brought by the Democrats seeking to invoke the 25th Amendment,external. It
says âthe insurrectionary mobâ threatened the lives of the vice-president, the
speaker of the house and others when Mr Trump tweeted disparaging remarks about
Mike Pence ""after the Capitol had been overrun
and the Vice President was in hiding"". The
âinsurrectionary protests were widely advertised and broadly encouraged by
President Donald J Trumpâ through his social media following and  by promising
activists the day âwould be wildâ. Mr
Trump and his family held a âcelebratory kick-off rally to encourage and charge
up the rioters and insurrectionistsâ before they moved on the Capitol. The charge sheet goes on to say Mr
Trump âignored or rejected repeated real-time entreatiesâ¦ to appeal to his
followers to exit the Capitolâ. One particular sentiment that describes the violence comes from Republican senator - and frequent Trump defender - Lindsey Graham. ââThe mob could have blown the
building up. They could have killed us all."" The House will return tomorrow to debate and vote on the resolution but it is unlikely to advance any further. What is the 25th Amendment? The family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured while defending Congress against rioters, have just released a moving statement. ""There really aren't enough kind words in any language to describe how sweet Brian was,"" say his family. ""He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him terribly."" ""He was sweet natured through and through. Everyone who met him adored him,"" the statement continues. ""He loved his job with the US Capitol Police, and was very passionate about it.  He also had an incredible work ethic.""    Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says she is ""working on a bill that would mean that nothing - not even a bench, no airport, no highway, no school - nothing - ever bear the name"" of President Donald Trump. Sanchez - a Democrat from California - was among the lawmakers under siege at the US Capitol last Wednesday. In her own retelling, she and her staff barricaded themselves inside their office rooms and grabbed baseball bats - from her time as a player on the Congressional Women's Softball team - to protect themselves from the mob. âI don't believe that a seditious occupant of the White House should ever have anything named after him,"" said Sanchez. ""I don't think that he deserves any of the benefits that are conferred on prior presidents.â Her Democratic colleague Joaquin Castro is introducing similar legislation to prevent the Trump name going up on any federal buildings or property. Explaining his decision, Castro said: ""Let us learn from our past. Donald Trump should never become a future generationâs confederate symbol."" A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's deadly riots. Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing toward the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Footage shows a mob chasing Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves one of the assailants - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself - luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The officer has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service.

The poll also found that Trump's approval rating has dropped 11% since last month. He is now at an all-time low of 33% favourable and 60% unfavourable, according to the survey. The survey of 1,239 registered voters was conducted from 7 to 10 January. A separate poll fromPolitico and Morning Consult,externalalso found last week that Trump's ratings appear to have fallen to the lowest point of his entire presidency. A new 7ft (2.1m) tall metal fence has gone up around the building Members of the US National Guard have been deployed to the US Capitol building. Some were seen taking pictures of the monuments and taking a break on the steps that were occupied by rioters last week. Another 10,000 will arrive on Saturday as the FBI warns of the risk of more violence from armed extremists holding pro-Trump events in 50 state capitols between now and inauguration next week.  After receiving his second and final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden tells reporters that he has spoken to senators about holding an impeachment trial while also confirming his Cabinet appointments. He says he discussed the possibility that the Senate, which Democrats will soon control, may do a half-day of each. ""I think it is critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened peoples lives, defaced public property, caused great damage - that they they be held accountable,"" he says while putting on his coat. President Trump is accused of ""incitement of insurrection"" related to the invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday. There have been fears among some Democrats that a Senate trial could hinder Biden as he tries to begin his first term at a rapid pace, with tackling the pandemic his top priority. This video can not be played Joe Biden receives jab and says his number one priority is mass vaccination Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging people to avoid coming to the city for Joe Biden's presidential inauguration on 20 January. She says people should participate virtually instead. At a news conference on Monday, Bowser said her goal was âto protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its groundsâ. In recent days, she has called for federal agencies to beef up security preparations for the ceremony. She also said President Trump must declare a pre-emergency declaration so the city can coordinate resources with the government. Activists have also taken to social media to urge rental property owners not to list their homes in the days leading up to the event. The Pentagon will release up to 15,000 National Guard troops to Washington DC to support Joe Biden's inauguration. General Daniel Hokanson - chief of the National Guard Bureau - said the Department of Defense has authorised the move and about 10,000 troops will be in the city by Saturday. The inauguration is next Wednesday but more pro-Trump protests are planned in the days leading up to it. Questions remain over how long it took for the National Guard to be deployed last week when Trump supporters overwhelmed local police to storm the Capitol.  President Trump is to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom â
the nationâs highest civilian honour - to Ohio Republican representative
Jim Jordan, one of his most loyal allies in Congress. The White House, inits statement announcing the award,external, listed Mr Jordanâs achievements, which included working
âto unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruptionâ and âunearth
malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Governmentâ, and lead the âeffort to confront the impeachment witch huntâ. âHe is an inspiration to freedom-loving Americans everywhere,â the
White House added. The president, who has not spoken in public since last
Wednesday, will give the medal to Mr Jordan in a closed-door
ceremony. Jordan was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers who voted to block Bidenâs victory. He cast his vote even after rioters disputing the election had stormed the building. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, has just received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. The second jab was administered by the chief nurse at a hospital near his home in Delaware, according to his transition team. In one of its final acts under the Trump administration, the State Department will add Cuba back to its state sponsors of terrorism list. The list singles out ""countries determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism"", according to the State Department. Cuba was put on the list in 1982, but the Obama administration took it off in 2015 as it sought to ease economic and travel restrictions on the island nation. However, Trump administration officials labelled the Caribbean island state as part of a ""troika of tyranny"" in Latin America. It says the country has not cooperated in US counterterrorism efforts. Placing Cuba back on the list is a lengthy process and it will hinder President-elect Joe Biden's goal of normalising relations with the country. The state sponsors of terrorism list currently includes Syria, Iran and North Korea (added back to the list in 2017 under President Trump). In December, the administrationtook Sudan off the list. Bonnie Watson Coleman is a Democrat congresswoman for New Jersey US Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman
says she has tested positive for Covid-19 â and believes she caught it while
sheltering from rioters in the Capitol building last Wednesday. âI received a positive test
result for Covid-19, and am home resting at this time. While I am experiencing
mild, cold-like symptoms, I remain in good spirits and will continue to work on
behalf of my constituents,âshe said,external. The Capitolâs physician Dr Brian
Moynihan warned on Sunday that âmany members of the House community were in
protective isolation in the large room â some for several hours,"" and said âindividuals
may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infectionâ. An internal FBI bulletin is warning state and local law enforcement that they should prepare for violence by right-wing extremists on Sunday, according to US media who've seen the document. The FBI memo - reportedly issued a week before last week's attack on the US Capitol - identifies credible threats to the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols, from 16 January to 20 January. A violent far-right group known as the Boogaloo is behind these organising efforts, according to the document. It states the Boogaloo movement believes ""an impending insurgency against the government is forthcoming, and some believe they should accelerate the timeline with armed, anti-government actions leading to a civil war"". Members of the movement are calling for the âstormingâ of state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday - and on the day itself. Who are the Boogaloo Bois? The FBI is currently reviewing over 40,000 digital media tips received from the public in recent days, after it appealed for help identifying rioters who joined the Capitol unrest. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats they needed to ""act with urgency"" US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stepped up the pressure on Vice-President Mike Pence to act to remove Donald Trump from office over his role in last week's storming of Congress. Lawmakers are expected to bring up a resolution asking Mr Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unfit for office. Mr Pence is said to oppose the idea. If he refuses, the House will hold a vote to impeach Mr Trump who had urged supporters to march on the Capitol. The Republican president has been accused by Democrats and an increasing number of fellow Republicans over the riot, following a rally in which Mr Trump repeated unsubstantiated allegations of vote fraud. Five people died in the attack, including a Capitol police officer. Mr Trump has made no public statements since he wasbanned from several social media platforms- including Twitter - on Friday. He is due to leave office on 20 January, when Democrat Joe Biden will be sworn is as president. Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony. What is the 25th Amendment? The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol 'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riots Ms Pelosi wrote to lawmakers saying the House of Representatives would present a resolution on Monday to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which would allow Mr Pence to remove Mr Trump from the White House and become acting president. The House could vote on the resolution on Tuesday. After that, Mr Pence and the cabinet would be given 24 hours to act before the House's potential move toward impeachment. ""We will act with urgency, because this president represents an imminent,"" Ms Pelosi said in her letter on Sunday. ""The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this president is intensified and so is the immediate need for action."" Although Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president by saying on Sunday he planned to attend Mr Biden's inauguration, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment. Meanwhile, a second Republican senator, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, said the president should ""resign and go away as soon as possible"", joining Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ In a separate development, First Lady Melania Trump, who rarely makes public comments about political events, condemned Wednesday's violence,saying the ""nation must heal in a civil manner"".,external ""I implore people to stop the violence, never make assumptions based on the colour of a person's skin or use differing political ideologies as a basis for aggression and viciousness,"" she said in a statement called Our Path Forward released by the White House. House Democrats have vowed to press ahead quickly with impeachment. To impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress, and Ms Pelosi said Democrats could introduce a charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" against Mr Trump. Senior lawmakers say a vote to impeach Mr Trump in the House could be held by mid-week. Mr Trump could become the only president in US history to have been impeached twice. Proceedings would then move to the Senate for a trial, where a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal. If he is convicted, the Senate could also hold a vote to bar Mr Trump from holding public office again. Could Trump be removed from power? The hunt to identify and arrest Capitol rioters However, House whip James Clyburn, another senior Democrat, told CNN the party may not send any impeachment articles to the Senate until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office, saying: ""Let's give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running."" That would allow Mr Biden to confirm his new cabinet and kickstart key policies including tackling coronavirus, something that would have to wait if the Senate had already received the impeachment articles. This video can not be played Voices from Trump land: 'We will continue to be divided' No Republican senators have said they will vote to convict Mr Trump of wrongdoing. The White House and senior Republicans have dismissed impeachment as a ""politically motivated"" move that would ""only serve to further divide our great country"". Mr Biden has said impeachment is for Congress to decide, even though he has thought ""for a long time President Trump was not fit to hold the job"".

"Workers in Madrid clear a hospital entrance of snow Spain is in a race against time to clear roads covered by heavy snow, and get Covid vaccines and food supplies to areas affected by Storm Filomena. Up to 50cm (20 inches) of snow fell on the capital Madrid, one of the worst hit areas, between Friday and Saturday. At least four people died and thousands of travellers were left stranded. Overnight, temperatures plunged to -8C (18F) in parts of Spain, amid warnings by meteorologists that the snow was turning to perilous ice. The unusual cold wave on the Iberian peninsula is expected to last until Thursday. The Spanish government said it had taken extra steps - including police-escorted convoys - to ensure its expected shipment of some 300,000 coronavirus vaccines can be distributed as planned to regional health authorities later on Monday. ""The commitment is to guarantee the supply of health, vaccines and food. Corridors have been opened to deliver the goods,"" Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos said on Sunday. This video can not be played Madrid has been hit by heavy snowfall after Storm Filomena Soldiers have been deployed to clear some of the 700 major roads. Some 3,500 tonnes of salt were later brought on lorries to the capital, Spain's El Mundo website reported on Monday. The record-breaking snowfall has triggered some unprecedented scenes here in Madrid. People have skied along the city's main commercial street, Gran VÃ­a, and one man was pictured being pulled through the district of Hortaleza on a sled by five huskies. But other responses to the snow have been more controversial due to concerns about Covid-19. Dozens of young people had a snowball fight in Callao square, for example, and many of them were without facemasks. Nearby, in Puerta del Sol, others celebrated the snow by dancing a conga. The daily Marca newspaper branded it ""the conga of shame"". Although the snowfall has now stopped, low temperatures have left snow and ice piled up across the capital and the surrounding region. And with residents advised to avoid using their cars, public transport has seen a surge in demand. This has compounded coronavirus concerns as many metro train carriages were packed at rush hour on Monday morning, making social distancing impossible. Madrid's international airport began gradually resuming operations on Sunday afternoon, having cancelled all flights on Friday. Some 500 people across the Madrid region were forced to spend the night in temporary shelter, including sports centres, after they were trapped by the whiteout. About 100 shoppers and staff spent two nights at a shopping centre in Majadahonda, a town north of the capital. ""There are people sleeping on the ground on cardboard,"" one restaurant employee told TVE television. Spain's Meteorological Agency said Saturday's snowfall was the heaviest in Madrid since 1971 But there were stories of heroism too, including doctors and medical workers who abandoned their cars and walked for hours to get to work. One doctor, Alvaro Sanchez, said on social media he had walked 17km (10 miles) over nearly two hours to get to work, while two nurses, Paco and Monica, said they had walked 22km to their hospital. They were praised by Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa, who tweeted: ""The commitment that the entire group of health workers is showing is an example of solidarity and dedication."" Some 4x4 vehicle owners offered to transport medical workers, while other volunteers helped to clear hospital entrance ways. ""Health staff have been working (hard) for more than a year and this is just a short moment for us, so as citizens, we are trying to help; it is everyone's responsibility,"" said Fernando de la Fuente, 60, who helped clear the entrance to Madrid's Gregorio Maranon Hospital.

"The Prince of Wales is urging firms to back a more sustainable future and do more to protect the planet, as he marks 50 years of environmental campaigning. Prince Charles wants companies to join what he is calling ""Terra Carta"" - or Earth charter. The charter is being launched alongside a fund run by the Natural Capital Investment Alliance. It aims to mobilise $10 billion towards natural capital by 2022. Terra Carta will harness the ""irreplaceable power of nature"", the prince said in his virtual address to the One Planet Summit on Monday. Prince Charles calls for 'swift' action on climate Prince Charles warns of approaching climate 'catastrophe' Prince Charles meets Greta Thunberg at Davos He hopes the new charter will help ""reunite people and planet"". He said: ""I can only encourage, in particular, those in industry and finance to provide practical leadership to this common project, as only they are able to mobilise the innovation, scale and resources that are required to transform our global economy."" In his foreword to Terra Carta, the prince writes: ""If we consider the legacy of our generation, more than 800 years ago, Magna Carta inspired a belief in the fundamental rights and liberties of people. ""As we strive to imagine the next 800 years of human progress, the fundamental rights and value of nature must represent a step-change in our 'future of industry' and 'future of economy' approach."" Charles has previously said that people thought he was ""completely dotty"" when he started talking about environmental issues in the 1970s.

"There has been a ""massive outbreak"" of Covid at Cardiff prison, seen here before the pandemic Courts should close to help stop the spread of Covid in jails, the body representing prison staff has said. It comes as data reveals a large rise in cases in Wales' prisons. Mark Fairhurst, from the Prison Officers' Union (POA), said there had been a ""massive outbreak"" at HMP Cardiff, where they struggle to find space for new arrivals to isolate. A Prison Service spokesman said shielding, mass testing and limited regimes were in place at all prisons. He said these safeguarding measures were limiting transmission, and programmes to test prisoners arriving in court were being rolled out - with no plans to shut courts. But the POA said a number of factors were having an impact: Recalling prisoners for seven or 14 days ""doesn't make sense"" in the pandemic The risk of transmission at Cardiff was increased because of transfers between prisons Large numbers of men were unlocked at once in Cardiff, increasing the spread Swansea prison has kept cases low ""Existing trials should be allowed to finish, but new trials should only be started if they can be facilitated through video link,"" Mr Fairhurst said. ""When you first come into jail you isolate for 10 days, but we struggle to find the space to do that because of pressures from the courts. ""If you closed the courts you wouldn't have to do that."" Prisoners making hundreds of PPE items every week 'Trials may collapse' as Covid delays continue Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say Should coronavirus make us rethink our courts? He added that excessive numbers of prisoners were unlocked at once in Cardiff - prior to the lockdown announcement in Wales. ""Swansea has kept levels low because they are following the safe operating procedures and only letting small numbers out, and it's worked."" Cases in HMP Cardiff rose from 22 in June to 110 in November and, while testing has increased in that time, HMP Swansea's cases rose from just 12 to 14 in the same period. The rate of growth in cases in prisons is still well below the wider population. Solicitor Melissa Griffiths says courts need to be open The call has been met with resistance elsewhere in the sector, as the need to keep the courts open is seen as a priority. ""We're busier than ever,"" said criminal solicitor Melissa Griffiths, from Allington Hughes Law in Wrexham. ""Unless you're going to have a moratorium on crime, which will never happen, you need the courts to be open."" She said the dip in crime seen in March last year was short-lived and, while courts have done their best to become Covid-secure, risks were unavoidable. ""Every time  you go to court is a risk - you don't know who you are coming into contact with. But if you don't have the courts carrying on it is all going to fall apart. ""You need remand courts because there will always be serious crimes committed and those people need to be remanded into custody."" She added the court closure at the start of the pandemic caused a backlog in cases that is yet to be cleared and priority is given to those in custody before ""custody time limits"" expire. Criminal solicitor Scott Bowen, from HPJV Solicitors, works out of courts in both Newport and Cardiff, said closing them would have an impact on victims as well as the accused, but removing the threat of recall would have wider implications. HMP Berwyn, the largest prison in Wales, saw the most Covid cases among staff ""If people are not complying with their sentence, do you grant them amnesty because it's a pandemic? If that message got out to repeat offenders it would be anarchy,"" he said. ""The probation service has to stick to policy and recall someone for a breach, because it's a deterrent to everyone."" Figures obtained via a Freedom of Information request by criminologist Dr Robert Jones showed a 210% rise between June and November, compared with a 436% rise across Wales in the same period. A third of all cases were at HMP Cardiff, which saw a leap to 110 positive cases by the end of November, from 22 cases in June (400% rise). Yet cases at HMP Swansea - which, like Cardiff, is an old site taking men on remand from the local courts - rose marginally from 12 to 14. HMP Berwyn cases rose from 41 to 61 (48%), and at HMP Parc cases increased from seven to 44 (528%). Figures are provided jointly for Usk and Prescoed, which saw a rise from 19 to 84 cases (342%), though arguably as an open prison the risks of transmission from the community at Prescoed are greater. Overall, cases went from 101 in June to 313 at the end of November 2020. Dr Jones also requested data for staff working at Wales' prisons, with data being provided to the end of October 2020. It showed a steady rise in cases, with 163 affected by the end of October 2020. HMP Berwyn had the highest number with 66 (double that of June), HMP Parc had 31 (compared with six in June), HMP Cardiff had 30 (six more than in June), HMP Swansea rose from 10 to 14 and HMP Usk/Prescoed rose from 17 to 22.

Thanks for joining us today. Here are some of the main stories from the day: Today's figure of 46,169 new positive Covid tests is the first time the number has been under 50,000 since 28 December. However, numbers are usually lower after the weekend due to a lag in reporting. Martin PatienceBBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut Empty shelves at a supermarket in Lebanon ahead of a 24-hour curfew which starts on Thursday Lebanon is set to enforce a
24-hour curfew from
this Thursday as it battles to contain the coronavirus. The
authorities say that without drastic action the countryâs fragile health system
will be overwhelmed. The curfew will initially last for eleven days but could
well be extended. Customers will be barred from shopping in
supermarkets and instead will need to rely on deliveries. The countryâs only
airport will remain open but the number of passengers is set to be dramatically
reduced. Compared with other countries, Lebanon had - until now - coped
relatively well with the coronavirus. But despite a rise in
infections, the government relaxed restrictions ahead of Christmas and New
Year, hoping to bolster the countryâs crumbling economy. Health officials say
that relaxation has led to a dramatic spike in the number of cases, which could
sky-rocket in the coming days. More than fifteen hundred Lebanese have died
from the virus in the past year. The World Health Organization has warned herd immunity won't be achieved this year, despite Covid vaccines being rolled out in countries across the world. ""We are not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021,"" the WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a briefing. She stressed that people needed to continue measures such as social distancing, hand washing and wearing face coverings. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened:  The health secretary was questioned about the prime minister beingspotted exercising seven miles from Downing Street. Sun reporter Kate Ferguson asked Matt Hancock for specific details about what people were allowed to do under the rules. She referred to a case where two women in Derbyshire were threatened with a fine after driving five miles to a park to meet each other for a walk. Ferguson then asked whether it was ""all right to go ahead and exercise seven miles away from your home"" - an apparent reference to reports the prime minister had been seen cycling in the Olympic Park in east London. Matt Hancock said: ""If you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles away from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""You should not go from one side of the country to another potentially taking the virus with you. ""So it is OK to go for a long walk, cycle ride or exercise. But stay local."" Asked about the story earlier and whether Boris Johnson was driven to the Olympic park, a spokesperson for the PM did not provide any details but said he had complied with Covid guidelines. A further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have been reported in the UK, bringing the total to 81,960. There have been another 46,169 positive cases reported, bringing the total cases to 3,118,518. This video can not be played Hancock: 'The bubbles policy will stay' Dan Bloom of the Mirror asks the health secretary if he can guarantee that support bubbles and childcare bubbles will remain - as many people rely on them. Matt Hancock says yes, he can ""rule out"" removing them, adding: ""I know how important they are to people. They're an important part of the system we have to support people."" But he stresses that they are there for ""individual specific people"" and that you have to stick to the same bubble, once you are in one. Hancock says he wants to be ""absolutely crystal clear"" about the fact they will stay. And Prof Powis is asked if there have been any incidences of people catching Covid on their way to, or back, from vaccine centres. He replies that all of those set up, whether large-scale centres or GP-led hubs, have infection prevention measures in place to minimise the risk of catching the virus. There is appropriate social distancing so people stay apart and the risk of transmission is as low as possible, adds Prof Powis.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The big question â and it is one that Elaine from Glasgow
asked â is whether mid-February will mark the start of the lifting of lockdown
and the return to normality. It should, but the process is likely to be slow. Firstly, it takes several weeks after the first dose for
an immune response to start to kick in. Second, the over-60s, who are at quite significant risk,
are not part of this initial stage and so will remain vulnerable to the virus. And finally, while trials showed the two vaccines that are
being used in the UK are very effective at preventing infection and certainly
at stopping serious illness, it is still uncertain what impact they will have
on transmission. It is possible people who are vaccinated can still pass
on the virus. We hope it will disrupt this to some extent â and maybe
even stop it. This will be a crucial factor in how quickly the UK and
the rest of the world can get on top of the pandemic. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Is a walk with a friend
and a takeaway coffee allowed? In answer to that simple
question, the health secretary says ""yes"" but goes on to stress that
the rules permit exercise with one other person. The emphasis should be
on exercising, not socialising, he says, and if too many people broke that
rule the government would have to ""have a look at it."" The rules, as ever, are
open to some interpretation and Mr Hancock clearly hopes his appeal for people
to not ""push the boundaries"" will work. But MPs and others are calling
for more clarity here, with some people travelling long distances to exercise
and others being punished for going for a walk relatively close to home. Laura Bundock from Sky News asks if it was complacent for the prime minister to allow mixing indoors over Christmas - and if we are paying the price now. Matt Hancock says what we're seeing is that ""the new variant of the virus is incredibly transmissible"" and is ""highly contagious"". The fact it spreads so easily means we have an ""incredibly difficult few weeks ahead of us"". It is imperative everybody follows the rules - and doesn't see them as a limit to be stretched. ""I know that's difficult but it's so important for everybody,"" he says. Prof Powis says when the NHS is under pressure, it's not just Covid patients affected but anyone requiring medical assistance. He says it's important ""we all pull together"" to ensure the NHS can treat us all and keep us safe. The health secretary stresses the importance of the public following the restrictions of the current lockdown. Asked by Emily Morgan of ITV whether it was time to make the rules stricter amid reports of people not sticking to them at the weekend, Matt Hancock says: ""We keep these things under review and we have demonstrated that we're willing to tighten the rules if they need to be tightened. ""But the thing that really matters right here, right now is that everybody follows the rules as they are today. ""And everybody can play their part in doing that."" He adds he applauds the action supermarket Morrisons has takenin enforcing the wearing of masksby its customers unless they have a medical reason. ""I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this,"" he says. The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the target of 12.5m doses of the vaccine for the most vulnerable, in the next five weeks, is ""doable"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock replies: ""Yes, we're on track to meet that target."" He says the target is ""ambitious"" but ""achievable"" and he is ""confident we're going to do it"". Since Thursday when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was rolled out, there was an increase in 210,000 vaccinations a day, on average. The mass vaccination sites means the speed of the rollout will increase further, he adds. He says of the target: ""It's not going to be easy but we're going to get there."" Prof Powis adds everyone is confident the NHS can ""stand up to this challenge"" and deliver it, and that ""it's in all our interests to speed through those high priority groups"".  Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Another warning, this
time from Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. There is
""significant and sustained pressure"" on hospitals, he says, and they
are ""yet to see"" the impact of the loosening of restrictions at
Christmas reflected in admissions. To summarise, things are
bad and about to get worse. He says the vaccine programme cannot be seen as a ""free pass"" and only if people complied with the
lockdown laws will the situation be manageable. NHS England national medical director Prof Stephen Powis says the country should be ""in no doubt"" that the battle against Covid is ""tougher than it has ever been"". There are 13,000 more patients in hospital since Christmas Day, he says, adding there are ""stubbornly high"" levels of infections and deaths. Hospitals are seeing ""significant and sustained pressure"" from the rising number of patients. And we are still to see the full impact of the loosening of restrictions at Christmas, Prof Powis adds. It is, he says, an ""extremely serious moment for the country"". And the vaccine ""cannot be seen as a free pass"" to ignore the guidance in place, like social distancing and staying inside. ""We have to keep focus and resilience as a country,"" he says.  The health secretary refers to a statement given earlier by the head of the NHS in which he talked about the UK being in a ""sprint"" from now to February, as those in the priority groups get their vaccinations. ""It will then kick off another sprint up to April as we get the rest of the vulnerable groups protected,"" Hancock says. ""And then, finally, a marathon to the autumn as we deliver vaccination to everybody else."" But he says the current pressures on the NHS mean the UK is in an ""extremely serious moment."" Hancock adds the vaccine is ""good news"" but ""cannot be seen by any of us as a free pass to ignore the national guidance"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The rules may not be
getting any stronger but the language certainly is. Matt Hancock repeated
the warning that this was the ""worst point"" of the pandemic so far. He made clear the onus
is on individuals, whose actions could ""make a difference"". Increasingly urgent
appeals to follow the rules reflect deep concern in government that the message

And my team and I are working hard to deliver this as fast as possible."" Matt Hancock goes on to outline the government's vaccine delivery plan - saying it is the biggest vaccination programme in British history. He adds: ""We have significantly accelerated the care home vaccination rollout. ""Almost a quarter of older care home residents have now received their first dose of the vaccine and we are committed to reach every care home resident this month."" Matt Hancock starts with an update of the number of daily cases. The health secretary says the new variant is highly contagious - with 46,169 cases recorded in the UK in the last day. There were 32,294 people in hospital - up 22% on this time last week, he adds. Hancock says the vaccine rollout is proceeding at pace and is the ""way out"" of the pandemic He says 2.6m doses of the vaccine have been given - to 2.3m people - more than all other countries of Europe together, Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Professor Whitty: ""We need to really double down â this is everybodyâs problem"" The UK will go through the ""most dangerous time"" of the pandemic in the weeks before vaccine rollout has an impact, England's chief medical officer has warned. Prof Chris Whitty urged people to minimise all unnecessary contact with others. The next few weeks will be ""the worst"" of the pandemic for the NHS, he said. Thousands more people are due to receive a vaccine this week after seven mass centres opened across England. NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. The government is aiming to offer vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. How does a vaccine get approved How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? NHS Covid-19 jab letters 'confusing over 80s' Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the government's vaccine delivery plan at a news conference later. He said the proposals would be the ""keystone of our exit out of the pandemic"". Outlining the vaccine rollout in Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that ministers aim to give all over-80s the first doseof the vaccine over the next four weeks. The Welsh Government plans to offer a vaccine toall over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk by spring. In Northern Ireland, which isrolling out vaccines for care workers, health trusts have seenthe busiest 48 hours since the start of the pandemic. Mr Hancock said on Sunday about two million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far. Over the weekend, the UKpassed the milestone of 80,000 deaths with coronavirussince the start of the pandemic. Currently, around one in 50 people across the UK is infected and Prof Whitty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There's a very high chance that if you meet someone unnecessarily they will have Covid."" In a separate interview with BBC One's Breakfast, he said: ""This is everybody's problem. Any single unnecessary contact you have with someone is a potential link in a chain of transmission that will lead to a vulnerable person."" He said there were over 30,000 people [in English hospitals alone] with Covid-19 - compared to about 18,000 [in England] at the peak last April. He added that ""anybody who is not shocked"" by the number of people in hospital ""has not understood this at all"". ""This is an appalling situation,"" he said. In Essex,Southend Hospital has had to reduce the amount of oxygen used to treat patients after supply ""reached a critical situation"", according to a document shared with the BBC. In Surrey, a temporary mortuary has been opened as hospital mortuaries have reached capacity. Almost 200 bodies are being stored at the emergency site, which is a former military hospital, and other local authorities have told the BBC they expect to open similar facilities soon. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England national medical director, said ""this is much bigger than the first wave back in April"". ""I don't think anyone in the NHS has known anything like this, this is a once-in-a-century pandemic,"" he said. Prof Rupert Pearse, an intensive care doctor, told BBC Breakfast that in a ""normal"" winter it would be ""unlikely"" that more than three of four flu patients would need intensive care at any one time, but his unit is now running 130 intensive care beds because of the effects of Covid. ""To compare this to a normal winter flu epidemic is out of all proportion, it's orders of magnitude larger,"" he said. This video can not be played The emergency body storage facility in a Surrey woodland Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measuresare in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ministers held two meetings on Sunday to discuss how to enforce the current lockdown measures more strictly and whether even tighter restrictions may be needed. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said no decisions on further restrictions were taken as there was a desire within government to wait until reliable data on existing measures becomes available in 10 days. However, he added there had been a discussion on better enforcement of existing regulations, including at shops and workplaces. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said ""we need to see the evidence behind nurseries"" remaining open. Asked whether tighter restrictions were needed, he said: ""I do think it's time to  hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"". There is a lot of debate about whether the lockdown restrictions need to be tightened. There are certainly some anomalies. For example, we are told to only leave the home for essential purposes, but coffee shops remain open for takeaways and retail shops for click-and-collect in England and Wales. However, even if those elements are tightened up, there is a limit to what the government can do. It is why, in his round of media interviews on Monday, Prof Whitty repeatedly talked about individual decision-making. The mixing of different households continues. Some of it is allowed under the support bubble exemptions, but undoubtedly some of it is taking place outside of this. It is, after all, virtually impossible to police what goes on in people's homes. It is why messaging is so important - and so ministers and officials are stressing the pressure the NHS is under. A further tightening of the restrictions could also help make the point. But there is also a recognition this is hard. People are fatigued. A further crackdown could also erode goodwill. The vaccination programme is described as the biggest in NHS history. The seven mass testing sites, which NHS England said were chosen to give a geographical spread, are: Millennium Point, Birmingham Ashton Gate, Bristol ExCel Centre, London Manchester Tennis and Football Centre Centre for Life, Newcastle Robertson House, Stevenage Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey The new centres will each be capable of delivering thousands of vaccinations each week and will be followed by ""dozens more"" large-scale sites, NHS England said. There will be about 1,200 vaccination sites when more GP-led and hospital services open later this week, along with the first pharmacy-led pilot sites, it added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Some vulnerable peoplehave questioned why they have been asked to travel to centres miles away from their homesduring a pandemic, but the NHS has said people would not miss out on their vaccination if they wait for an appointment at a centre closer to home in the coming weeks. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said nobody should be asked to travel more than 10 miles to get a vaccine once more centres open. Asked on Today why the centres were not open 24 hours a day, he said it was ""more convenient"" for older people to attend during the day. ""If we need to go to 24-hour work we will absolutely go to 24 hours a day to make sure we vaccinate as quickly as we can,"" he said. But he cautioned: ""We are limited by the amount of vaccine that is coming through the system."" Pharmaceutical firm Boots said its first vaccination site was due to open later this week to offer the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to the people most vulnerable. It said sites in Huddersfield and Gloucester were planned to open in the coming weeks. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK.

"A number of positive cases have been identified among passengers who had flown into Glasgow from Dubai since the new year Dubai has been added to Scotland's travel quarantine list with anyone coming from the country told to self-isolate for 10 days. The rule, which came into effect at 04:00, will also apply retrospectively for passengers who have  made the journey since 3 January. Celtic confirmedone of their players tested positive for the virusless than 48 hours after the squad returned from a training trip to Dubai on Friday. It is not known if he was on the trip. The Scottish government said clinicians and the local NHS health protection team were in contact with Celtic providing advice. It also confirmed that quarantine rules did not apply to sports people who had attended ""elite training"" abroad. However, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week questioned the purpose of Celtic's trip and whether they were following social-distancing rules after seeing photos from their Dubai base. She warned that professional sport's privileges could be lost if protocols were not followed by all participants. The government said the change was due to a number of positive cases being identified in passengers who had flown into Glasgow from Dubai since the new year. It said the ""preventative action"" would help stem the rise in coronavirus cases. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""It is evident, both in Scotland and in countries across the world, that the virus continues to pose real risks to health and to life and we need to interrupt the rise in cases."" He added: ""Imposing quarantine requirements on those arriving in the UK is our first defence in managing the risk of imported cases from communities with high risks of transmission. That is why we have made the decision to remove Dubai from the country exemptions list. ""Whether or not an overseas destination has been designated for quarantine restrictions, our message remains clear that people should not currently be undertaking non-essential foreign travel. ""People need to stay at home to help suppress the virus, protect our NHS and save lives."" Joanne Dooey, president of the Scottish Passenger Agents' Association (SPAA), said: ""Removing Dubai from the safe list is understandable. We believe that there has been a cluster of infections around Scots who travelled to Dubai over the Christmas and New Year period. ""Whilst we're keen to see a return to increased international travel, protecting the health of the whole country remains our key concern and we are supportive of this move.""

"The Prince of Wales is urging firms to back a more sustainable future and do more to protect the planet, as he marks 50 years of environmental campaigning. Prince Charles wants companies to join what he is calling ""Terra Carta"" - or Earth charter. The charter is being launched alongside a fund run by the Natural Capital Investment Alliance. It aims to mobilise $10 billion towards natural capital by 2022. Terra Carta will harness the ""irreplaceable power of nature"", the prince said in his virtual address to the One Planet Summit on Monday. Prince Charles calls for 'swift' action on climate Prince Charles warns of approaching climate 'catastrophe' Prince Charles meets Greta Thunberg at Davos He hopes the new charter will help ""reunite people and planet"". He said: ""I can only encourage, in particular, those in industry and finance to provide practical leadership to this common project, as only they are able to mobilise the innovation, scale and resources that are required to transform our global economy."" In his foreword to Terra Carta, the prince writes: ""If we consider the legacy of our generation, more than 800 years ago, Magna Carta inspired a belief in the fundamental rights and liberties of people. ""As we strive to imagine the next 800 years of human progress, the fundamental rights and value of nature must represent a step-change in our 'future of industry' and 'future of economy' approach.""

"Lisa Montgomery - the only female inmate on federal death row in the US - has been executed for murder in the state of Indiana. Her lawyers had argued she was a mentally ill victim of abuse who deserved mercy. Her victim's community said otherwise. This story was first published on 11 January - before Lisa Montgomery's execution on 13 January. For Diane Mattingly, there is one moment from her childhood for which she feels both enormous gratitude and guilt. She credits this moment for her ""fairly normal"" life - a house on eight peaceful acres, a loving relationship with her children, nearly two decades at a job working for the state of Kentucky. At the same time, she blames it for the fate of her younger half-sister, Lisa Montgomery. Montgomery was sentenced for the murder of a 23-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant. In December 2004, Montgomery, who was 36 at the time, strangled Bobbie Jo Stinnett before cutting the baby out of her womb and kidnapping it. Stinnett bled to death. Mattingly and Montgomery lived together until Mattingly was eight and her half-sister was four. It was a terrifying household, she says, where physical, psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of Judy Shaughnessy, Montgomery's mother, and her boyfriends was routine. The girls' biological father left the home, and after a while, Mattingly was whisked away to foster care. Montgomery was left behind with her mother. Lisa Montgomery and her half-sister Diane Mattingly as children It would be 34 years before the half-sisters would see each other again. And that would be from across a courtroom, where lawyers for the US government were trying to persuade a jury to sentence Montgomery to death. ""One sister got taken out and got put into a loving home and was nurtured and had time to heal,"" says Mattingly. ""The other sister stayed in that situation, and it got worse and worse and worse. And then at the end, she was broken."" In late December, Montgomery's legal team submitted a petition to President Donald Trump that makes the case that after a lifetime of abuse - which they characterise as torture - she is too mentally ill to be executed and deserves mercy. However, in the tiny town of Skidmore, Missouri, where the crime was committed, there is little sympathy for that argument. Many there believe the final moments of Bobbie Jo Stinnett were so horrific, the death sentence is warranted. Lisa Montgomery and Bobbie Jo Stinnett got to know each other online through a shared love of dogs. They had corresponded for weeks on an online forum for rat terrier breeders and enthusiasts called ""Ratter Chatter"". Montgomery told Stinnett that she was also expecting, and the pair shared pregnancy stories. In December 2004, Montgomery drove 281.5 km (175 miles) from her home in Kansas to Skidmore, where she had an appointment to look at some puppies owned by Stinnett. But it wasn't Montgomery that Stinnett was expecting, it was a woman who went by the name of Darlene Fischer. But Fischer was a name that Montgomery had been using when she separately began messaging Stinnett from a different email address inquiring about buying one of her puppies. When Stinnett answered the door, Montgomery overpowered the pregnant woman, strangled her with a piece of rope, and cut the baby out of her womb. Bobbie Jo Stinnett Investigators quickly realised that ""Darlene Fischer"" did not exist, and tracked Montgomery down the next day using her emails and computer IP address. They found her cradling a new-born girl she claimed to have given birth to the previous day. Her story quickly fell apart and she confessed to the killing. Since 2008, Montgomery has been held in a federal prison in Texas for female inmates with special medical and psychological needs, where she has been receiving psychiatric care. Since receiving her execution date, she's been placed on suicide watch in an isolated cell. Montgomery is scheduled to be put to death by a lethal injection of pentobarbital at Terre Haute prison in Indiana. It is the only federal prison with an active death chamber. Terre Haute Prison, Indiana Montgomery's lawyers argue that because of a combination of years of horrific abuse, and a raft of psychological issues, she should never have been given the death penalty. They believe that at the time of the crime, Montgomery was psychotic and out of touch with reality. They have been joined by a chorus of supportive voices from the legal field, including 41 former and current prosecutors, as well as human rights entities like the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. However, calls for Trump to be merciful are hardly unanimous. According to Gallup, while support for the death penalty in the US is at its lowest level in more than 50 years, 55% of Americans still believe it is an appropriate punishment for murder. And nowhere is that support more palpably felt in this case than in Skidmore. ""Bobbie deserves to be here today. Bobbie's family deserves her,"" says Meagan Morrow, a high school classmate of Stinnett's. ""And Lisa deserves to pay."" Information and support If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. Lisa Montgomery's current legal team has conducted some 450 interviews with family members, friends, case workers, doctors and social workers. Stitched together, they form a tapestry of family dysfunction, abuse, neglect, professional negligence, substance abuse and untreated mental illness. ""The whole story is tragic,"" says Kelley Henry, one of Montgomery's federal defence lawyers. ""But one of the things that the president can do is say - to women who have been trafficked, and who have been sexually abused - 'Your abuse matters'."" For Montgomery, her lawyers argue, it began before she was born. According to an interview with her father, Montgomery's mother Judy Shaughnessy drank heavily throughout her pregnancy, and their daughter was born with foetal alcohol syndrome. Multiple medical experts have given statements agreeing with that diagnosis. Judy Shaughnessy, Lisa Montgomery's mother When Mattingly and Montgomery were young, Shaughnessy beat them and doled out cruel forms of punishment, like taping Montgomery's mouth shut, or pushing Mattingly out into the snow, naked. After their biological father left the home, Mattingly says they were left alone with Shaughnessy's boyfriends, at least one of whom started raping Mattingly. ""Judy was manipulative and - I hate to use this word, but - evil. She enjoyed torturing the people around her,"" says Mattingly. ""She got joy out of it."" After Mattingly was removed from the home by social services, Montgomery fell prey to her mother's new husband, who according to statements from his other children, was a violent alcoholic who began sexually abusing Montgomery when she was a pre-teen. The family moved from place to place dozens of times, but it was in a trailer in Sperry, Oklahoma, where her lawyers say the abuse turned into something more akin to torture. According to interviews with her half-siblings and others who spent time with the family, Montgomery's stepfather built a shed onto the trailer where he, and eventually his friends, raped and beat her. Her mother also began trafficking her, allowing handymen like electricians and plumbers to sexually abuse Montgomery in exchange for work on the house. Watch on BBC iPlayer Execution: Lisa Montgomery's story As a teenager, Montgomery confided in a cousin, telling him the men would tie her up, beat her and even urinate on her afterwards. But the cousin, a sheriff's deputy, confessed to Montgomery's current legal team that he did nothing. In fact, he drove her back home and dropped her off in the hands of her abusers. Lawyer Kelley Henry says one of the things that disturbs her most is that adults in positions of authority were told about what was going on but did nothing. When Shaughnessy eventually split from her second husband, she and Montgomery testified in divorce proceedings about the sexual assaults. The judge in the case scolded Shaughnessy for not reporting the abuse - but did not report the abuse himself. ""There were so many opportunities where people could have intervened and prevented this,"" says Henry. Kelley Henry Montgomery's cousin told her legal team that he lived with ""regret for not speaking up about what happened to Lisa"". When she was 18, Montgomery married her stepbrother. The couple had four children in five years, but the relationship was not the escape from violence that Montgomery might have hoped it would be. At one point, one of Montgomery's brothers found a home movie that showed Montgomery's husband raping and beating her. ""It was violent and like a scene out of a horror movie,"" he said in a statement. ""I felt sick watching the video. I didn't know what to do or how to talk to my sister about it."" Friends and family began noticing Montgomery's tendency to slip into ""a world of her own"". Her children were disturbed by it. Henry says this was an early sign of her mental illnesses, which include bipolar disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorder and traumatic brain injury. Montgomery eventually divorced her first husband and married Kevin Montgomery. Around this time, she repeatedly claimed to be pregnant again, although she had undergone sterilisation after her fourth baby was born. One theory her lawyers put forward regarding the chain of events that led to the murder, is that Montgomery feared her ex-husband would expose her lies about being pregnant and use it against her as he sought custody of their children. ""There was so much pressure on her at that point,"" says Henry. She describes Montgomery's ex-husband as cruel and harassing. ""She was completely detached from reality."" Her lawyers say that as she lost touch with reality, she fantasised about being pregnant. Henry says Montgomery's original legal defence after she was arrested and charged with murder was woefully inadequate, and presented few of the details about her abuse, trauma and mental illness. Her lawyers at the time also presented an alternative theory of the crime, which was that Montgomery's brother had actually committed the murder, even though he had an alibi. That was ultimately dropped in favour of an insanity defence, but Henry believes the damage to Montgomery's credibility was already done. After five hours of deliberation, the jury found Montgomery guilty. They recommended a sentence of death. Diane Mattingly Diane Mattingly has been speaking publicly for the first time in the hope it can make a difference. ""I would say, 'President Trump, I want you to look at the life that Lisa had led, I want to look at all the people that have failed her, I want you to look at the rape, the torture, the mental abuse, the physical abuse that this woman had endured,'"" she says. ""I'm asking him to have compassion on her as a person that has been failed over and over and over again. And to not fail her."" The tiny farming town of Skidmore sits in the far northwest corner of Missouri. A generation ago, it was the kind of place where you could ""get your hair cut, see a show, buy rabbit feed and eat dinner"" - but those days are long gone. Today there is a single restaurant and few of the streets are paved. The population hovers around just 250, and everyone knew Bobbie Jo Stinnett and her family. Friends recall her as a good student with a love of horses and dogs. She liked going down to the Nodaway River to swim, and playing Nintendo games at slumber parties. She was quiet and kind, they say. At the time of her murder, she was newly married and pregnant with her first child. Although the alumni have scattered somewhat, in recent years, the Nodaway-Holt R-VII High School graduating class of 2000 - which had only 22 members - has a tradition to mark the anniversary of the death of their classmate Bobbie Jo Stinnett. They hold a collection and try to do something nice for Stinnett's mother. ""Last year, we got flowers, and gave her a $100-plus gift card and then paid her water bill,"" says Jena Baumli. The murder 16 years ago is never far from the minds of the town's residents. Bobbie Jo Stinnett For one thing, the wider world won't let them forget. It has been the subject of two books, multiple true crime television shows, documentaries and countless podcast episodes. And though there's been much recent debate over the fairness of Montgomery's sentence in courthouses and in the opinion pages of newspapers like the New York Times, a similar debate does not exist here. ""I think that in a lot of the opinion pieces that are being posted, in a lot of things that people are sharing, Bobbie Jo and her daughter, and her mother and her husband and other friends and family, are kind of being forgotten,"" says Tiffany Kirkland, another member of the class of 2000. ""She always wanted to be a mom,"" says Baumli. ""She was really the first one to have a decent marriage, you know, and I guess looking at Bobbie Jo was like, what your dreams were when you were younger."" Because of Stinnett's easy-going reputation, Morrow remembers instantly dismissing the initial reports of her murder. ""I was like, 'Oh, she was not.' You know, like, that doesn't happen to Bobbie,"" Morrow says. But what happened at the modest clapboard house where Stinnett lived with her husband still haunts some of those involved in the investigation. Nodaway County Sheriff Randy Strong says that the scene that he and his four colleagues found that day was so bloody, they are still traumatised by it. It makes him even angrier that it was Stinnett's mother who discovered her that way. ""The people that are defending [Montgomery], I wish I could take them back in time, and put them in that room,"" he says. ""And then go, 'Look at this body'. And then go, 'Stand there and listen to the 911 call of [Stinnett's mother]. This is the stuff of nightmares."" Randy Strong, Nodaway County Sheriff Many of the residents of Skidmore cite the details of the crime, and the amount of planning that went into it, as evidence that Montgomery was a calculating killer. She had catfished Stinnett online under a fake name. She had bought supplies, including a home birth kit, and searched online for how to perform a caesarean section. Sheriff Strong insists that the crime was meticulously planned and that the woman he arrested continued to lie until backed into a corner. Dr Katherine Porterfield, a clinical psychologist who evaluated Montgomery and spent about 18 hours with her, says that psychosis does not always look the way people expect it to. ""Being psychotic, it does not mean you are not intelligent, nor that you cannot act in a planful way,"" she says. ""We've seen crime for years and years in our country in which people enact terrible violence coming out of a psychotic set of beliefs or thought process. Lisa Montgomery is no different. She enacted this in the grip of a very broken mind."" The baby was returned to her father, after being recovered from Montgomery. Bobbie Jo Stinnett's home lies empty today Bobbie Jo's mother and husband have have not spoken publicly in many years. But Strong says this is the first year he's heard directly from Stinnett's husband. He thanked the sheriff for recovering his daughter and allowing him to be the parent that his wife couldn't be. ""I cried,"" says Strong. ""The whole community over there's traumatised by this."" School friend Baumli says she's read the descriptions of Montgomery's abuse, but it mostly just makes her angry. She says it's not as if all the other people of Skidmore lead idyllic lives free from abuse, poverty and other destructive tragedies. She gives herself as an example - when Stinnett was murdered, Baumli was in rehab for a drug addiction. She missed the funeral because of it. ""Let's say I didn't stay clean very long,"" she says. ""I'm sick of hearing about Lisa Montgomery and what she went through. And it's never about what my friend went through,"" she adds. ""I get these images in my head of [Bobbie Jo's mother] finding her daughter that way."" Three federal inmates - Orlando Hall, Alfred Bourgeois and Brandon Bernard - have been put to death since the 3 November presidential election. Several high-profile figures had appealed for clemencyin Brandon's casebut Mr Trump did not heed those calls. President-elect Joe Biden has already pledged to end death penalty proceedings, although he hasn't said when. Until July 2020, there had been no federal executions for 17 years. At state level, the number of sentences and executions continuesa historic decline,external. Only 18 death sentences were handed down in 2020 and the number of executions carried out hit a 30-year low. More recently, the states that have been carrying out executions, such as Texas and Tennessee, have halted and delayed executions because of the pandemic. However, the executions ordered by President Trump are continuing. If they all go ahead, the federal government will have executed more people than any administration in nearly 100 years. Protest against federal executions of death row inmates - outside the US Justice Department, Washington DC, December 2020 Two other inmates are scheduled to die at Terre Haute prison before Mr Trump's presidency ends. Recently, there has been a virus outbreak on death row at the institution, and previous executions have been linked to outbreaks among the execution team and prison staff. ""They made this a priority at the risk of the health and lives of corrections officials, of the prisoners on death row, and the communities that all of those Bureau of Prisons officials who flew in from across the country were returning to,"" says Ngozi Ndulue, senior director of research and special projects at the Death Penalty Information Center. ""This was a very coordinated and determined plan to ensure that as many people could be executed on federal death row as possible before the end of this administration term."" Montgomery's lawyers want her sentence commuted to a life sentence, which would allow her to remain under psychiatric care in prison for the rest of her days. Mattingly says looking back to the moment life changed for her as an eight-year-old, she feels guilty that when the social workers came for her, she didn't tell them what was going on in that house. ""If I had, would they have taken Lisa out of the home also?"" she says. ""There's so many people that failed her throughout her whole life. And I am just asking for somebody - once - not to fail her."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

Thanks for joining us today. Here are some of the main stories from the day: Today's figure of 46,169 new positive Covid tests is the first time the number has been under 50,000 since 28 December. However, numbers are usually lower after the weekend due to a lag in reporting. Martin PatienceBBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut Empty shelves at a supermarket in Lebanon ahead of a 24-hour curfew which starts on Thursday Lebanon is set to enforce a
24-hour curfew from
this Thursday as it battles to contain the coronavirus. The
authorities say that without drastic action the countryâs fragile health system
will be overwhelmed. The curfew will initially last for eleven days but could
well be extended. Customers will be barred from shopping in
supermarkets and instead will need to rely on deliveries. The countryâs only
airport will remain open but the number of passengers is set to be dramatically
reduced. Compared with other countries, Lebanon had - until now - coped
relatively well with the coronavirus. But despite a rise in
infections, the government relaxed restrictions ahead of Christmas and New
Year, hoping to bolster the countryâs crumbling economy. Health officials say
that relaxation has led to a dramatic spike in the number of cases, which could
sky-rocket in the coming days. More than fifteen hundred Lebanese have died
from the virus in the past year. The World Health Organization has warned herd immunity won't be achieved this year, despite Covid vaccines being rolled out in countries across the world. ""We are not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021,"" the WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a briefing. She stressed that people needed to continue measures such as social distancing, hand washing and wearing face coverings. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened:  The health secretary was questioned about the prime minister beingspotted exercising seven miles from Downing Street. Sun reporter Kate Ferguson asked Matt Hancock for specific details about what people were allowed to do under the rules. She referred to a case where two women in Derbyshire were threatened with a fine after driving five miles to a park to meet each other for a walk. Ferguson then asked whether it was ""all right to go ahead and exercise seven miles away from your home"" - an apparent reference to reports the prime minister had been seen cycling in the Olympic Park in east London. Matt Hancock said: ""If you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles away from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""You should not go from one side of the country to another potentially taking the virus with you. ""So it is OK to go for a long walk, cycle ride or exercise. But stay local."" Asked about the story earlier and whether Boris Johnson was driven to the Olympic park, a spokesperson for the PM did not provide any details but said he had complied with Covid guidelines. A further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have been reported in the UK, bringing the total to 81,960. There have been another 46,169 positive cases reported, bringing the total cases to 3,118,518. This video can not be played Hancock: 'The bubbles policy will stay' Dan Bloom of the Mirror asks the health secretary if he can guarantee that support bubbles and childcare bubbles will remain - as many people rely on them. Matt Hancock says yes, he can ""rule out"" removing them, adding: ""I know how important they are to people. They're an important part of the system we have to support people."" But he stresses that they are there for ""individual specific people"" and that you have to stick to the same bubble, once you are in one. Hancock says he wants to be ""absolutely crystal clear"" about the fact they will stay. And Prof Powis is asked if there have been any incidences of people catching Covid on their way to, or back, from vaccine centres. He replies that all of those set up, whether large-scale centres or GP-led hubs, have infection prevention measures in place to minimise the risk of catching the virus. There is appropriate social distancing so people stay apart and the risk of transmission is as low as possible, adds Prof Powis.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The big question â and it is one that Elaine from Glasgow
asked â is whether mid-February will mark the start of the lifting of lockdown
and the return to normality. It should, but the process is likely to be slow. Firstly, it takes several weeks after the first dose for
an immune response to start to kick in. Second, the over-60s, who are at quite significant risk,
are not part of this initial stage and so will remain vulnerable to the virus. And finally, while trials showed the two vaccines that are
being used in the UK are very effective at preventing infection and certainly
at stopping serious illness, it is still uncertain what impact they will have
on transmission. It is possible people who are vaccinated can still pass
on the virus. We hope it will disrupt this to some extent â and maybe
even stop it. This will be a crucial factor in how quickly the UK and
the rest of the world can get on top of the pandemic. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Is a walk with a friend
and a takeaway coffee allowed? In answer to that simple
question, the health secretary says ""yes"" but goes on to stress that
the rules permit exercise with one other person. The emphasis should be
on exercising, not socialising, he says, and if too many people broke that
rule the government would have to ""have a look at it."" The rules, as ever, are
open to some interpretation and Mr Hancock clearly hopes his appeal for people
to not ""push the boundaries"" will work. But MPs and others are calling
for more clarity here, with some people travelling long distances to exercise
and others being punished for going for a walk relatively close to home. Laura Bundock from Sky News asks if it was complacent for the prime minister to allow mixing indoors over Christmas - and if we are paying the price now. Matt Hancock says what we're seeing is that ""the new variant of the virus is incredibly transmissible"" and is ""highly contagious"". The fact it spreads so easily means we have an ""incredibly difficult few weeks ahead of us"". It is imperative everybody follows the rules - and doesn't see them as a limit to be stretched. ""I know that's difficult but it's so important for everybody,"" he says. Prof Powis says when the NHS is under pressure, it's not just Covid patients affected but anyone requiring medical assistance. He says it's important ""we all pull together"" to ensure the NHS can treat us all and keep us safe. The health secretary stresses the importance of the public following the restrictions of the current lockdown. Asked by Emily Morgan of ITV whether it was time to make the rules stricter amid reports of people not sticking to them at the weekend, Matt Hancock says: ""We keep these things under review and we have demonstrated that we're willing to tighten the rules if they need to be tightened. ""But the thing that really matters right here, right now is that everybody follows the rules as they are today. ""And everybody can play their part in doing that."" He adds he applauds the action supermarket Morrisons has takenin enforcing the wearing of masksby its customers unless they have a medical reason. ""I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this,"" he says. The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the target of 12.5m doses of the vaccine for the most vulnerable, in the next five weeks, is ""doable"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock replies: ""Yes, we're on track to meet that target."" He says the target is ""ambitious"" but ""achievable"" and he is ""confident we're going to do it"". Since Thursday when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was rolled out, there was an increase in 210,000 vaccinations a day, on average. The mass vaccination sites means the speed of the rollout will increase further, he adds. He says of the target: ""It's not going to be easy but we're going to get there."" Prof Powis adds everyone is confident the NHS can ""stand up to this challenge"" and deliver it, and that ""it's in all our interests to speed through those high priority groups"".  Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Another warning, this
time from Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. There is
""significant and sustained pressure"" on hospitals, he says, and they
are ""yet to see"" the impact of the loosening of restrictions at
Christmas reflected in admissions. To summarise, things are
bad and about to get worse. He says the vaccine programme cannot be seen as a ""free pass"" and only if people complied with the
lockdown laws will the situation be manageable. NHS England national medical director Prof Stephen Powis says the country should be ""in no doubt"" that the battle against Covid is ""tougher than it has ever been"". There are 13,000 more patients in hospital since Christmas Day, he says, adding there are ""stubbornly high"" levels of infections and deaths. Hospitals are seeing ""significant and sustained pressure"" from the rising number of patients. And we are still to see the full impact of the loosening of restrictions at Christmas, Prof Powis adds. It is, he says, an ""extremely serious moment for the country"". And the vaccine ""cannot be seen as a free pass"" to ignore the guidance in place, like social distancing and staying inside. ""We have to keep focus and resilience as a country,"" he says.  The health secretary refers to a statement given earlier by the head of the NHS in which he talked about the UK being in a ""sprint"" from now to February, as those in the priority groups get their vaccinations. ""It will then kick off another sprint up to April as we get the rest of the vulnerable groups protected,"" Hancock says. ""And then, finally, a marathon to the autumn as we deliver vaccination to everybody else."" But he says the current pressures on the NHS mean the UK is in an ""extremely serious moment."" Hancock adds the vaccine is ""good news"" but ""cannot be seen by any of us as a free pass to ignore the national guidance"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The rules may not be
getting any stronger but the language certainly is. Matt Hancock repeated
the warning that this was the ""worst point"" of the pandemic so far. He made clear the onus
is on individuals, whose actions could ""make a difference"". Increasingly urgent
appeals to follow the rules reflect deep concern in government that the message
isn't getting through. The health secretary says he wants the UK to get back to normal as fast as possible. ""I want us to have that Great British summer. And my team and I are working hard to deliver this as fast as possible."" Matt Hancock goes on to outline the government's vaccine delivery plan - saying it is the biggest vaccination programme in British history. He adds: ""We have significantly accelerated the care home vaccination rollout. ""Almost a quarter of older care home residents have now received their first dose of the vaccine and we are committed to reach every care home resident this month."" Matt Hancock starts with an update of the number of daily cases. The health secretary says the new variant is highly contagious - with 46,169 cases recorded in the UK in the last day. There were 32,294 people in hospital - up 22% on this time last week, he adds. Hancock says the vaccine rollout is proceeding at pace and is the ""way out"" of the pandemic He says 2.6m doses of the vaccine have been given - to 2.3m people - more than all other countries of Europe together, Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Indonesian divers search crash wreckage The Indonesian navy has released footage of divers searching through the wreckage of a passenger plane which crashed into the sea at the weekend as the hunt for its black boxes resumes. Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 left Jakarta with 62 people on board, but vanished from the radar on its way to Borneo island on Saturday. Search teams have found aircraft parts and human remains and believe they know where the black boxes are located. The first victim has been identified. Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant on the plane, was identified by his fingerprints, officials said late on Monday. 'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among air crash missing Indonesia crashed plane's 'black boxes' located Air disasters timeline One official stressed the urgency of the search mission calling it a ""24-hour"" operation. ""It's going to be an around-the-clock operation,"" Rasman MS, head of the search and rescue agency's crash operations told reporters. ""There will be no breaks. The sooner we can find the victims, the better."" According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel are currently involved in the search operation along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Divers have been recovering body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing from waters about 23 metres (75ft) deep. The search resumed on Monday morning There appears to be no hope of finding any survivors. Navy chief of staff Yudo Margono said the search team had pinpointed the location of the black box cockpit voice and flight data recorders and a remote-controlled vehicle was being used to scan the sea bed. ""There is so much debris down there and we have only lifted a few pieces. Hopefully, as we take out more [the recorders] can be found,"" he told reporters. The fact the debris does not appear to have spread far suggests the plane may have been intact before it hit the water, an investigator with Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) told news agency Reuters. ""It possibly ruptured when it hit waters because if it had exploded mid-air, the debris would be distributed more widely,"" said Nurcahyo Utomo. Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. A turbine from one of its engines is also among the debris that has been recovered. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact with the plane was recorded, with the call sign SJY182, according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in West Kalimantan province in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. The plane is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. According to registration details, the plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Indonesian Navy personnel carry debris believed to be from the Sriwijaya Air SJ-182 plane Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations. The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. Mechanical v human: Why do planes crash? Plane crash fatalities fell more than 50% in 2019 Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul.

supermarkets and instead will need to rely on deliveries. The countryâs only
airport will remain open but the number of passengers is set to be dramatically
reduced. Compared with other countries, Lebanon had - until now - coped
relatively well with the coronavirus. But despite a rise in
infections, the government relaxed restrictions ahead of Christmas and New
Year, hoping to bolster the countryâs crumbling economy. Health officials say
that relaxation has led to a dramatic spike in the number of cases, which could
sky-rocket in the coming days. More than fifteen hundred Lebanese have died
from the virus in the past year. The World Health Organization has warned herd immunity won't be achieved this year, despite Covid vaccines being rolled out in countries across the world. ""We are not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021,"" the WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a briefing. She stressed that people needed to continue measures such as social distancing, hand washing and wearing face coverings. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened:  The health secretary was questioned about the prime minister beingspotted exercising seven miles from Downing Street. Sun reporter Kate Ferguson asked Matt Hancock for specific details about what people were allowed to do under the rules. She referred to a case where two women in Derbyshire were threatened with a fine after driving five miles to a park to meet each other for a walk. Ferguson then asked whether it was ""all right to go ahead and exercise seven miles away from your home"" - an apparent reference to reports the prime minister had been seen cycling in the Olympic Park in east London. Matt Hancock said: ""If you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles away from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""You should not go from one side of the country to another potentially taking the virus with you. ""So it is OK to go for a long walk, cycle ride or exercise. But stay local."" Asked about the story earlier and whether Boris Johnson was driven to the Olympic park, a spokesperson for the PM did not provide any details but said he had complied with Covid guidelines. A further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have been reported in the UK, bringing the total to 81,960. There have been another 46,169 positive cases reported, bringing the total cases to 3,118,518. This video can not be played Hancock: 'The bubbles policy will stay' Dan Bloom of the Mirror asks the health secretary if he can guarantee that support bubbles and childcare bubbles will remain - as many people rely on them. Matt Hancock says yes, he can ""rule out"" removing them, adding: ""I know how important they are to people. They're an important part of the system we have to support people."" But he stresses that they are there for ""individual specific people"" and that you have to stick to the same bubble, once you are in one. Hancock says he wants to be ""absolutely crystal clear"" about the fact they will stay. And Prof Powis is asked if there have been any incidences of people catching Covid on their way to, or back, from vaccine centres. He replies that all of those set up, whether large-scale centres or GP-led hubs, have infection prevention measures in place to minimise the risk of catching the virus. There is appropriate social distancing so people stay apart and the risk of transmission is as low as possible, adds Prof Powis.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The big question â and it is one that Elaine from Glasgow
asked â is whether mid-February will mark the start of the lifting of lockdown
and the return to normality. It should, but the process is likely to be slow. Firstly, it takes several weeks after the first dose for
an immune response to start to kick in. Second, the over-60s, who are at quite significant risk,
are not part of this initial stage and so will remain vulnerable to the virus. And finally, while trials showed the two vaccines that are
being used in the UK are very effective at preventing infection and certainly
at stopping serious illness, it is still uncertain what impact they will have
on transmission. It is possible people who are vaccinated can still pass
on the virus. We hope it will disrupt this to some extent â and maybe
even stop it. This will be a crucial factor in how quickly the UK and
the rest of the world can get on top of the pandemic. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Is a walk with a friend
and a takeaway coffee allowed? In answer to that simple
question, the health secretary says ""yes"" but goes on to stress that
the rules permit exercise with one other person. The emphasis should be
on exercising, not socialising, he says, and if too many people broke that
rule the government would have to ""have a look at it."" The rules, as ever, are
open to some interpretation and Mr Hancock clearly hopes his appeal for people
to not ""push the boundaries"" will work. But MPs and others are calling
for more clarity here, with some people travelling long distances to exercise
and others being punished for going for a walk relatively close to home. Laura Bundock from Sky News asks if it was complacent for the prime minister to allow mixing indoors over Christmas - and if we are paying the price now. Matt Hancock says what we're seeing is that ""the new variant of the virus is incredibly transmissible"" and is ""highly contagious"". The fact it spreads so easily means we have an ""incredibly difficult few weeks ahead of us"". It is imperative everybody follows the rules - and doesn't see them as a limit to be stretched. ""I know that's difficult but it's so important for everybody,"" he says. Prof Powis says when the NHS is under pressure, it's not just Covid patients affected but anyone requiring medical assistance. He says it's important ""we all pull together"" to ensure the NHS can treat us all and keep us safe. The health secretary stresses the importance of the public following the restrictions of the current lockdown. Asked by Emily Morgan of ITV whether it was time to make the rules stricter amid reports of people not sticking to them at the weekend, Matt Hancock says: ""We keep these things under review and we have demonstrated that we're willing to tighten the rules if they need to be tightened. ""But the thing that really matters right here, right now is that everybody follows the rules as they are today. ""And everybody can play their part in doing that."" He adds he applauds the action supermarket Morrisons has takenin enforcing the wearing of masksby its customers unless they have a medical reason. ""I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this,"" he says. The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the target of 12.5m doses of the vaccine for the most vulnerable, in the next five weeks, is ""doable"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock replies: ""Yes, we're on track to meet that target."" He says the target is ""ambitious"" but ""achievable"" and he is ""confident we're going to do it"". Since Thursday when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was rolled out, there was an increase in 210,000 vaccinations a day, on average. The mass vaccination sites means the speed of the rollout will increase further, he adds. He says of the target: ""It's not going to be easy but we're going to get there."" Prof Powis adds everyone is confident the NHS can ""stand up to this challenge"" and deliver it, and that ""it's in all our interests to speed through those high priority groups"".  Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Another warning, this
time from Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. There is
""significant and sustained pressure"" on hospitals, he says, and they
are ""yet to see"" the impact of the loosening of restrictions at
Christmas reflected in admissions. To summarise, things are
bad and about to get worse. He says the vaccine programme cannot be seen as a ""free pass"" and only if people complied with the
lockdown laws will the situation be manageable. NHS England national medical director Prof Stephen Powis says the country should be ""in no doubt"" that the battle against Covid is ""tougher than it has ever been"". There are 13,000 more patients in hospital since Christmas Day, he says, adding there are ""stubbornly high"" levels of infections and deaths. Hospitals are seeing ""significant and sustained pressure"" from the rising number of patients. And we are still to see the full impact of the loosening of restrictions at Christmas, Prof Powis adds. It is, he says, an ""extremely serious moment for the country"". And the vaccine ""cannot be seen as a free pass"" to ignore the guidance in place, like social distancing and staying inside. ""We have to keep focus and resilience as a country,"" he says.  The health secretary refers to a statement given earlier by the head of the NHS in which he talked about the UK being in a ""sprint"" from now to February, as those in the priority groups get their vaccinations. ""It will then kick off another sprint up to April as we get the rest of the vulnerable groups protected,"" Hancock says. ""And then, finally, a marathon to the autumn as we deliver vaccination to everybody else."" But he says the current pressures on the NHS mean the UK is in an ""extremely serious moment."" Hancock adds the vaccine is ""good news"" but ""cannot be seen by any of us as a free pass to ignore the national guidance"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The rules may not be
getting any stronger but the language certainly is. Matt Hancock repeated
the warning that this was the ""worst point"" of the pandemic so far. He made clear the onus
is on individuals, whose actions could ""make a difference"". Increasingly urgent
appeals to follow the rules reflect deep concern in government that the message
isn't getting through. The health secretary says he wants the UK to get back to normal as fast as possible. ""I want us to have that Great British summer. And my team and I are working hard to deliver this as fast as possible."" Matt Hancock goes on to outline the government's vaccine delivery plan - saying it is the biggest vaccination programme in British history. He adds: ""We have significantly accelerated the care home vaccination rollout. ""Almost a quarter of older care home residents have now received their first dose of the vaccine and we are committed to reach every care home resident this month."" Matt Hancock starts with an update of the number of daily cases. The health secretary says the new variant is highly contagious - with 46,169 cases recorded in the UK in the last day. There were 32,294 people in hospital - up 22% on this time last week, he adds. Hancock says the vaccine rollout is proceeding at pace and is the ""way out"" of the pandemic He says 2.6m doses of the vaccine have been given - to 2.3m people - more than all other countries of Europe together, Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Professor Whitty: ""We need to really double down â this is everybodyâs problem"" The UK will go through the ""most dangerous time"" of the pandemic in the weeks before vaccine rollout has an impact, England's chief medical officer has warned. Prof Chris Whitty urged people to minimise all unnecessary contact with others. The next few weeks will be ""the worst"" of the pandemic for the NHS, he said. Thousands more people are due to receive a vaccine this week after seven mass centres opened across England. NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. The government is aiming to offer vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. How does a vaccine get approved How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? NHS Covid-19 jab letters 'confusing over 80s' Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the government's vaccine delivery plan at a news conference later. He said the proposals would be the ""keystone of our exit out of the pandemic"". Outlining the vaccine rollout in Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that ministers aim to give all over-80s the first doseof the vaccine over the next four weeks. The Welsh Government plans to offer a vaccine toall over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk by spring. In Northern Ireland, which isrolling out vaccines for care workers, health trusts have seenthe busiest 48 hours since the start of the pandemic. Mr Hancock said on Sunday about two million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far. Over the weekend, the UKpassed the milestone of 80,000 deaths with coronavirussince the start of the pandemic. Currently, around one in 50 people across the UK is infected and Prof Whitty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There's a very high chance that if you meet someone unnecessarily they will have Covid."" In a separate interview with BBC One's Breakfast, he said: ""This is everybody's problem. Any single unnecessary contact you have with someone is a potential link in a chain of transmission that will lead to a vulnerable person."" He said there were over 30,000 people [in English hospitals alone] with Covid-19 - compared to about 18,000 [in England] at the peak last April. He added that ""anybody who is not shocked"" by the number of people in hospital ""has not understood this at all"". ""This is an appalling situation,"" he said. In Essex,Southend Hospital has had to reduce the amount of oxygen used to treat patients after supply ""reached a critical situation"", according to a document shared with the BBC. In Surrey, a temporary mortuary has been opened as hospital mortuaries have reached capacity. Almost 200 bodies are being stored at the emergency site, which is a former military hospital, and other local authorities have told the BBC they expect to open similar facilities soon. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England national medical director, said ""this is much bigger than the first wave back in April"". ""I don't think anyone in the NHS has known anything like this, this is a once-in-a-century pandemic,"" he said. Prof Rupert Pearse, an intensive care doctor, told BBC Breakfast that in a ""normal"" winter it would be ""unlikely"" that more than three of four flu patients would need intensive care at any one time, but his unit is now running 130 intensive care beds because of the effects of Covid. ""To compare this to a normal winter flu epidemic is out of all proportion, it's orders of magnitude larger,"" he said. This video can not be played The emergency body storage facility in a Surrey woodland Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measuresare in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ministers held two meetings on Sunday to discuss how to enforce the current lockdown measures more strictly and whether even tighter restrictions may be needed. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said no decisions on further restrictions were taken as there was a desire within government to wait until reliable data on existing measures becomes available in 10 days. However, he added there had been a discussion on better enforcement of existing regulations, including at shops and workplaces. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said ""we need to see the evidence behind nurseries"" remaining open. Asked whether tighter restrictions were needed, he said: ""I do think it's time to  hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"". There is a lot of debate about whether the lockdown restrictions need to be tightened. There are certainly some anomalies. For example, we are told to only leave the home for essential purposes, but coffee shops remain open for takeaways and retail shops for click-and-collect in England and Wales. However, even if those elements are tightened up, there is a limit to what the government can do. It is why, in his round of media interviews on Monday, Prof Whitty repeatedly talked about individual decision-making. The mixing of different households continues. Some of it is allowed under the support bubble exemptions, but undoubtedly some of it is taking place outside of this. It is, after all, virtually impossible to police what goes on in people's homes. It is why messaging is so important - and so ministers and officials are stressing the pressure the NHS is under. A further tightening of the restrictions could also help make the point. But there is also a recognition this is hard. People are fatigued. A further crackdown could also erode goodwill. The vaccination programme is described as the biggest in NHS history. The seven mass testing sites, which NHS England said were chosen to give a geographical spread, are: Millennium Point, Birmingham Ashton Gate, Bristol ExCel Centre, London Manchester Tennis and Football Centre Centre for Life, Newcastle Robertson House, Stevenage Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey The new centres will each be capable of delivering thousands of vaccinations each week and will be followed by ""dozens more"" large-scale sites, NHS England said. There will be about 1,200 vaccination sites when more GP-led and hospital services open later this week, along with the first pharmacy-led pilot sites, it added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Some vulnerable peoplehave questioned why they have been asked to travel to centres miles away from their homesduring a pandemic, but the NHS has said people would not miss out on their vaccination if they wait for an appointment at a centre closer to home in the coming weeks. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said nobody should be asked to travel more than 10 miles to get a vaccine once more centres open. Asked on Today why the centres were not open 24 hours a day, he said it was ""more convenient"" for older people to attend during the day. ""If we need to go to 24-hour work we will absolutely go to 24 hours a day to make sure we vaccinate as quickly as we can,"" he said. But he cautioned: ""We are limited by the amount of vaccine that is coming through the system."" Pharmaceutical firm Boots said its first vaccination site was due to open later this week to offer the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to the people most vulnerable. It said sites in Huddersfield and Gloucester were planned to open in the coming weeks. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use,although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.

"Terry Irving, 83, from Dumfries, was given the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on Monday Everyone aged 80 or over in Scotland will be given the Covid vaccine by February, the health secretary has said. Jeane Freeman also said care home staff and residents, as well as front-line health and social care staff would be vaccinated in the next few weeks. As of Sunday, 163,377 Scots had been given a first dose of vaccine. Ms Freeman told BBC Scotland that just under 560,000 people will have been vaccinated by the end of the month. The Oxford vaccine will be available at more than 1,100 locations from Monday. Scotland has been given an initial allocation of more than 500,000 doses to use in January. Where are the latest cases? When will I be vaccinated against the virus? Ms Freeman told BBC Radio's GoodMorning Scotland programme: ""We intend that by the end of this month, the very beginning of February, we will have vaccinated all residents in care homes and staff, all front-line health and social care workers and all those aged 80 or over. ""So that's just under 560,000. We've already vaccinated about 70% of people in care homes and about half of the health and social care workforce."" She said the Scottish government was on course to match the UK government's commitment to offer a vaccine jab to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. The health service will be able to vaccinate people as supplies of the jabs arrive, she said, with over-80s being contacted by their GPs. The government has now started publishing vaccination figures on a daily basis, with 163,377 Scots having been given a first dose as of Sunday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the health authorities in Scotland now had enough supplies to give jabs to all over-80s over the coming four weeks. She said the aim was to get throughthe priority listas quickly as possible. This had been expected to be complete by mid-May, but Ms Sturgeon said she was ""very, very hopeful we will be able to accelerate that to an earlier point"". A total of 1,664 people are in hospital being treated for Covid-19, the highest number since the pandemic began - with Ms Sturgeon saying the country was in a ""dangerous situation"". The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has already been administered in the Tayside, Lothian, Orkney and Highlands health board areas but this week will see it being used at vaccination centres across the whole country. Recent figures suggest a slight fall in the average positivity rates for Covid in many parts of Scotland, but pressures on the NHS have intensified. The number of patients in hospital in with Covid rose to new highs at the weekend, and Sunday saw a sharp increase in the number of patients requiring treatment in intensive care. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there were few signs that the threat was ""abating"" and thata tightening of restrictions could not be ruled out. The majority of Scotland's schools are closed until at least February with pupils now learning from home as the new term begins this week.. Only vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will receive face-to-face teaching.

"The UK's Covid vaccine campaign has shifted its focus to boosters - an attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Almost seven in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK have had a booster, while nine in 10 have had a single jab and more than eight in 10 have had a second dose. But despite more than 38 million boosters, or third doses, being given so far, more people are being urged to come forward and jabs are being rolled out to all five to 11-year-olds. The vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two full doses while all five to 11-year-olds are now being offered two low-dose jabs, at least 12 weeks apart. Booster jabs are also available to all over-16s, as well as children aged 12-15 in at-risk groups. The JCVI says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still haveabout 90% protection against hospitalisation. The UK has approved five vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen and Novavax; four of which require two doses for maximum protection. Those receiving boosters have so far been receiving one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 92% of over-12s.  More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far. Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands. The aim of the vaccination programme is toprotect as many people as possible from serious illness,externalthrough developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more thannine in 10 adults,externalin the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine. However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population. Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? Is Covid at risk of becoming a disease of the poor? Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme. Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%. Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far. Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%. When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%. There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by theOpenSAFELY group,external- a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data. In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light. The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats they needed to ""act with urgency"" US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stepped up the pressure on Vice-President Mike Pence to act to remove Donald Trump from office over his role in last week's storming of Congress. Lawmakers are expected to bring up a resolution asking Mr Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unfit for office. Mr Pence is said to oppose the idea. If he refuses, the House will hold a vote to impeach Mr Trump who had urged supporters to march on the Capitol. The Republican president has been accused by Democrats and an increasing number of fellow Republicans over the riot, following a rally in which Mr Trump repeated unsubstantiated allegations of vote fraud. Five people died in the attack, including a Capitol police officer. Mr Trump has made no public statements since he wasbanned from several social media platforms- including Twitter - on Friday. He is due to leave office on 20 January, when Democrat Joe Biden will be sworn is as president. Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony. What is the 25th Amendment? The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol 'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riots Ms Pelosi wrote to lawmakers saying the House of Representatives would present a resolution on Monday to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which would allow Mr Pence to remove Mr Trump from the White House and become acting president. The House could vote on the resolution on Tuesday. After that, Mr Pence and the cabinet would be given 24 hours to act before the House's potential move toward impeachment. ""We will act with urgency, because this president represents an imminent,"" Ms Pelosi said in her letter on Sunday. ""The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this president is intensified and so is the immediate need for action."" Although Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president by saying on Sunday he planned to attend Mr Biden's inauguration, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment. Meanwhile, a second Republican senator, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, said the president should ""resign and go away as soon as possible"", joining Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

House Democrats have vowed to press ahead quickly with impeachment. To impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress, and Ms Pelosi said Democrats could introduce a charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" against Mr Trump. Senior lawmakers say a vote to impeach Mr Trump in the House could be held by mid-week. Mr Trump could become the only president in US history to have been impeached twice. Proceedings would then move to the Senate for a trial, where a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal. If he is convicted, the Senate could also hold a vote to bar Mr Trump from holding public office again. Could Trump be removed from power? The hunt to identify and arrest Capitol rioters However, House whip James Clyburn, another senior Democrat, told CNN the party may not send any impeachment articles to the Senate until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office, saying: ""Let's give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running."" That would allow Mr Biden to confirm his new cabinet and kickstart key policies including tackling coronavirus, something that would have to wait if the Senate had already received the impeachment articles. This video can not be played Voices from Trump land: 'We will continue to be divided' No Republican senators have said they will vote to convict Mr Trump of wrongdoing. The White House and senior Republicans have dismissed impeachment as a ""politically motivated"" move that would ""only serve to further divide our great country"".

As investigators try to prosecute rioters who stormed the Capitol, police departments in Virginia and Washington state have placed officers on administrative leave for allegedly attending the events while off-duty.

"Terry Irving, 83, from Dumfries, was given the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on Monday Everyone aged 80 or over in Scotland will be given the Covid vaccine by February, the health secretary has said. Jeane Freeman also said care home staff and residents, as well as front-line health and social care staff would be vaccinated in the next few weeks. As of Sunday, 163,377 Scots had been given a first dose of vaccine. Ms Freeman told BBC Scotland that just under 560,000 people will have been vaccinated by the end of the month. The Oxford vaccine will be available at more than 1,100 locations from Monday. Scotland has been given an initial allocation of more than 500,000 doses to use in January. Where are the latest cases? When will I be vaccinated against the virus? Ms Freeman told BBC Radio's GoodMorning Scotland programme: ""We intend that by the end of this month, the very beginning of February, we will have vaccinated all residents in care homes and staff, all front-line health and social care workers and all those aged 80 or over. ""So that's just under 560,000. We've already vaccinated about 70% of people in care homes and about half of the health and social care workforce."" She said the Scottish government was on course to match the UK government's commitment to offer a vaccine jab to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. The health service will be able to vaccinate people as supplies of the jabs arrive, she said, with over-80s being contacted by their GPs. The government has now started publishing vaccination figures on a daily basis, with 163,377 Scots having been given a first dose as of Sunday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the health authorities in Scotland now had enough supplies to give jabs to all over-80s over the coming four weeks. She said the aim was to get throughthe priority listas quickly as possible. This had been expected to be complete by mid-May, but Ms Sturgeon said she was ""very, very hopeful we will be able to accelerate that to an earlier point"". A total of 1,664 people are in hospital being treated for Covid-19, the highest number since the pandemic began - with Ms Sturgeon saying the country was in a ""dangerous situation"". The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has already been administered in the Tayside, Lothian, Orkney and Highlands health board areas but this week will see it being used at vaccination centres across the whole country. Recent figures suggest a slight fall in the average positivity rates for Covid in many parts of Scotland, but pressures on the NHS have intensified. The number of patients in hospital in with Covid rose to new highs at the weekend, and Sunday saw a sharp increase in the number of patients requiring treatment in intensive care. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there were few signs that the threat was ""abating"" and thata tightening of restrictions could not be ruled out. The majority of Scotland's schools are closed until at least February with pupils now learning from home as the new term begins this week.. Only vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will receive face-to-face teaching.

"There has been a ""massive outbreak"" of Covid at Cardiff prison, seen here before the pandemic Courts should close to help stop the spread of Covid in jails, the body representing prison staff has said. It comes as data reveals a large rise in cases in Wales' prisons. Mark Fairhurst, from the Prison Officers' Union (POA), said there had been a ""massive outbreak"" at HMP Cardiff, where they struggle to find space for new arrivals to isolate. A Prison Service spokesman said shielding, mass testing and limited regimes were in place at all prisons. He said these safeguarding measures were limiting transmission, and programmes to test prisoners arriving in court were being rolled out - with no plans to shut courts. But the POA said a number of factors were having an impact: Recalling prisoners for seven or 14 days ""doesn't make sense"" in the pandemic The risk of transmission at Cardiff was increased because of transfers between prisons Large numbers of men were unlocked at once in Cardiff, increasing the spread Swansea prison has kept cases low ""Existing trials should be allowed to finish, but new trials should only be started if they can be facilitated through video link,"" Mr Fairhurst said. ""When you first come into jail you isolate for 10 days, but we struggle to find the space to do that because of pressures from the courts. ""If you closed the courts you wouldn't have to do that."" Prisoners making hundreds of PPE items every week 'Trials may collapse' as Covid delays continue Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say Should coronavirus make us rethink our courts? He added that excessive numbers of prisoners were unlocked at once in Cardiff - prior to the lockdown announcement in Wales. ""Swansea has kept levels low because they are following the safe operating procedures and only letting small numbers out, and it's worked."" Cases in HMP Cardiff rose from 22 in June to 110 in November and, while testing has increased in that time, HMP Swansea's cases rose from just 12 to 14 in the same period. The rate of growth in cases in prisons is still well below the wider population. Solicitor Melissa Griffiths says courts need to be open The call has been met with resistance elsewhere in the sector, as the need to keep the courts open is seen as a priority. ""We're busier than ever,"" said criminal solicitor Melissa Griffiths, from Allington Hughes Law in Wrexham. ""Unless you're going to have a moratorium on crime, which will never happen, you need the courts to be open."" She said the dip in crime seen in March last year was short-lived and, while courts have done their best to become Covid-secure, risks were unavoidable. ""Every time  you go to court is a risk - you don't know who you are coming into contact with. But if you don't have the courts carrying on it is all going to fall apart. ""You need remand courts because there will always be serious crimes committed and those people need to be remanded into custody."" She added the court closure at the start of the pandemic caused a backlog in cases that is yet to be cleared and priority is given to those in custody before ""custody time limits"" expire. Criminal solicitor Scott Bowen, from HPJV Solicitors, works out of courts in both Newport and Cardiff, said closing them would have an impact on victims as well as the accused, but removing the threat of recall would have wider implications. HMP Berwyn, the largest prison in Wales, saw the most Covid cases among staff ""If people are not complying with their sentence, do you grant them amnesty because it's a pandemic? If that message got out to repeat offenders it would be anarchy,"" he said. ""The probation service has to stick to policy and recall someone for a breach, because it's a deterrent to everyone."" Figures obtained via a Freedom of Information request by criminologist Dr Robert Jones showed a 210% rise between June and November, compared with a 436% rise across Wales in the same period. A third of all cases were at HMP Cardiff, which saw a leap to 110 positive cases by the end of November, from 22 cases in June (400% rise). Yet cases at HMP Swansea - which, like Cardiff, is an old site taking men on remand from the local courts - rose marginally from 12 to 14. HMP Berwyn cases rose from 41 to 61 (48%), and at HMP Parc cases increased from seven to 44 (528%). Figures are provided jointly for Usk and Prescoed, which saw a rise from 19 to 84 cases (342%), though arguably as an open prison the risks of transmission from the community at Prescoed are greater. Overall, cases went from 101 in June to 313 at the end of November 2020. Dr Jones also requested data for staff working at Wales' prisons, with data being provided to the end of October 2020. It showed a steady rise in cases, with 163 affected by the end of October 2020. HMP Berwyn had the highest number with 66 (double that of June), HMP Parc had 31 (compared with six in June), HMP Cardiff had 30 (six more than in June), HMP Swansea rose from 10 to 14 and HMP Usk/Prescoed rose from 17 to 22.

"Bangor University is one of two Welsh institutions to have said it is offering refunds Students in Wales want partial refunds for university accommodation because they are not spending as much time there due to the coronavirus pandemic. The National Union of Students Wales (NUS Wales) said students ""shouldn't be penalised financially"" forfollowing Welsh Government guidelines. Two Welsh universities have offered students refunds. The Welsh Government said universities should have staggered returns andstudents only return when asked to. Staggered returns are being introduced in order to ""help stop the spread of the virus in student accommodation"" according to the Welsh Government. Calls for clarity for university students in Wales on return Â£9,000 for 'anxiety and stress' university degree It accepted this could mean some students need to stay home longer than anticipated, with online learning used at the start of term. But some students feel they should not be paying for student accommodation when they are not there. Mirain Iwerydd, a first year student at Aberystwyth University -which has told students not to come back- said: ""I think if there are students who've missed out, and haven't had what they've paid for, then as a matter of principle universities should be paying them back, because the students have paid for something they haven't received. ""I think it would help with day-to-day living costs because, when you think about it, students haven't been able to go out and earn a living working in cafes, for example, during their studies."" Mirain Iwerydd believes partial refunds will help students financially BBC Wales asked Wales' universities if they would offer refunds and four of the six who responded said no. Cardiff Metropolitan University said students living in university-operated halls would be given rebates for the weeks where all of their lectures and seminars had been held online. They said they had told students on 4 January they would be offered the refunds. Bangor University is offering eligible students a 10% discount. Tegwen Bruce-Deans is in her second year at Bangor and said the reduction was ""fair"". ""I've spent less time in this room that I've paid for, compared with a year where coronavirus wasn't here,"" she said. ""If they are encouraging their students to leave earlier and return later then it's fair to say 'because you've been good and followed the advice given you can have some money back'."" However, those living in private accommodation may find it harder to get refunds from landlords. Sioned Bowen said some landlords offer half rent to students during the summer Sioned Bowen, who is in her third year at Aberystwyth University, said landlords should consider reduced rent, which some do during a normal summer break. ""It isn't fair if we have to stay at home and we can't even see the house in Aberystwyth, yet are still expected to pay full rent,"" she added. Meanwhile a group of students living in halls at Cardiff University said they were planning to stop their direct debits and hold a ""rent payment strike"" unless their rent is reduced while they are living at home. Unite Students, who provide private rental accommodation for students in Cardiff, said it was offering those unable to move back in a 50% discount from 18 January until 14 February. Students living in the private accommodation will also be offered a four-week extension to their tenancy for free, to allow them to finish their studies, work part time or carry on living in the city after term ends. NUS Wales president Becky Ricketts said she had raised this issue with Education Minister Kirsty Williams. ""Students should not be paying for rooms that they are not able to stay in,"" she said. ""Students should not be financially penalised for essentially following the guidance from the Welsh Government, from their universities. ""It doesn't seem fair, it doesn't seem right and we completely support students who are looking for those rent rebates."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""As autonomous bodies, rental agreements are a matter for individual institutions or landlords. We are providing an extra Â£40m this financial year to universities. ""The education minister has met regularly with NUS Wales throughout the pandemic, and the support we are providing includes Â£10m for student hardship, mental health provision and student union funding."" Swansea University said it was still in discussions about a way forward, while Wrexham Glyndwr, Cardiff and the University of South Wales all said they had no plans to refund students. Aberystwyth University said it was actively considering the implications of new Welsh Government advice. A spokesman said: ""We have told our students not to travel unless absolutely necessary and will be contacting them again over the coming days with further information. ""Our priority continues to be the safety of our students, staff and the wider community.""

"A 78-year-old French woman received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in France A global race is on to vaccinate people against Covid-19 - and with infections soaring in Europe many have complained that the roll-out is too slow in the EU. Member states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021. BBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch. Whatâs happening to the EU vaccine scheme? The country shocked to be Europe's stragglers In an election year, the vaccine has become a political battleground, writesJenny Hill, in Berlin. The fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation. A recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground. Vaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than477,000first doses had been administered. But some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses. Much of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order. Germany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. Mr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand. Germany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer. The Czech prime minister has hit out at apparent delays in distributing the vaccine, writesRob Cameron, in Prague. The Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager. But the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. ""We believed when we contributed â¬12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,"" he told a newspaper this week. The country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to19,918people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. It has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature. However, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer. A sluggish start is being blamed on bureaucracy and vaccine scepticism, writesHugh Schofield, in Paris. France's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to45,500- still so small as to be statistically meaningless. So why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used. The primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. Each recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives. Another problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers. After President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings. Politically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a ""state scandal"", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free. France's vaccine drive has challenging start National pride accelerated Russia's rollout, but one man is conspicuously absent from the list of people vaccinated, writesSarah Rainsford, in Moscow. Russia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity. Sputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded. A poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week thatmore than a million peoplehad been vaccinated. Russia began rolling out its Sputnik V vaccine in December But one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown. Russia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped. As infection rates grow in a country praised by many for its no-lockdown approach, a successful vaccine programme is crucial writesMaddy Savage, in Stockholm. Almost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is stillno official tallyof how many others have received the vaccination. The Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains ""feasible"". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. Alongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February. Swedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine. A successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. Meanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands. A new government in Belgium seems unified on the vaccine rollout - for now at least, writesNick Beake, in Brussels. It seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further700elderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial. The mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be ""seamless and fast"", tweeting: ""If that does not work, shoot me."" The first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December You may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed. After getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its ""careful"" approach. And there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. In a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least. Regional variances and political rows have marked the beginning of Spain's vaccination programme writesGuy Hedgecoe, in Madrid. Spain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with277,976people vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. Each of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. Government data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. Although vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination. However, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro SÃ¡nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. The arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by ""political affiliations or parliamentary needs"", a claim the central government has rejected.
