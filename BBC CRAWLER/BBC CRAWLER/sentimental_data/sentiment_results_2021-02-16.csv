"Overseas holidays are unlikely to be possible in the summer Nicola Sturgeon has warned Scots not to book Easter holidays as it is ""highly unlikely"" that hotels or self catering accommodation will be open. The first minister advised against booking a break either overseas or in Scotland at the start of April. She also said it was unlikely that overseas holidays would be possible in the summer. However, she said ""staycations"" might be possible - although it would depend on the Covid data nearer the time. Giving her Covid update statement to MSPs at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said the risks posed by new variants of the virus meant it was ""hard to overstate the necessity of being careful, cautious and gradual as we exit this lockdown"". Youngest pupils to return to Scotland's classrooms She said that meant continuing to abide by the ""stay-at-home"" requirement. The Scottish government hopes to publish a ""revised strategic framework"" next week which will set out how Scotland can exit lockdown and what conditions will need to be met before restrictions can be eased. ""We are likely to advise against booking Easter holidays, either overseas or within Scotland, as it is highly unlikely that we will have been able to fully open hotels or self catering accommodation by then,"" said the first minister. ""However, for the summer, while it is still highly unlikely that overseas holidays will be possible or advisable, staycations might be - but this will depend on the data nearer the time."" Ms Sturgeon said she had always made it clear that education should be the priority. She confirmed that the youngest pupils are to return to Scotland's classrooms for face-to-face teaching from next week, along with some secondary pupils who need to complete coursework. Other age groups will continue to learn from home, and are unlikely to return to school until at least 15 March. All other existing lockdown measures will remain in place until at least the end of this month, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the country remains in a precarious position. Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA), said the first minister's statement had made tourism businesses ""extremely anxious"". He said the STA Board would meet Ms Sturgeon in the coming weeks and update her on the ""desperate state"" the industry is in. ""I know of numerous businesses who are wholly reliant on being able to trade again at Easter in order to stay solvent,"" Mr Crothall said. ""Today's indication that this is highly unlikely will, I know, serve as a crushing blow to many."" He called for more support if businesses are not going to be able to trade viably for months to come. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Asda has been interested in the former Nortel site since 2012 Asda has new owners. The Issa brothers, two entrepreneurs from Blackburn who made billion-pound fortunes running petrol stations, have completed the deal to buy Britain's third-largest supermarket chain. Asda was valued at Â£6.8bn, but the brothers and the investment firm TDR Capital paid just Â£780m. The rest of the money was borrowed. So how does this kind of deal work? And will it leave Asda with too much debt? This kind of deal is called a leveraged buyout - which means that it involves large amounts of debt. TDR Capital specialises in this kind of deal. It is also co-owner of EG Group, the worldwide petrol station business which built the brothers' fortune, and which also has large borrowings. The Issas and TDR each contribute half of the Â£780m in cash to Asda's former owners, Wal-Mart, which has owned Asda since 1999. Most of the purchase price - just under Â£4bn - will be borrowed. Walmart, the American supermarket which owned Asda for the past 21 years, will retain a small stake in Asda, for Â£500m, along with a seat on Asda's board. Then the new owners will sell off parts of Asda to raise the rest of the purchase price. Asda will sell its warehouses and distribution system for Â£950m. It will still use them, but in future, it will have to pay rent to their new owners. And Asda's 323 petrol stations will be sold for Â£750m to EG Group, adding to the portfolio of more than 6,000 around the world. The deal is still awaiting approval from the Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected by the summer. Buying a Â£6.8bn business for less than Â£800m has certainly raised eyebrows, but it is not unusual for buyers to put up only a small fraction of the purchase price in such big deals. ""10% looks low, compared to the average for leveraged buyouts as a whole of around 50%,"" says Roberto Pozzi, senior vice-president at Moody's, an agency which analyses the riskiness of company's borrowings. ""Keep in mind that it depends also on the stability of the business, and there is no more stable business than supermarkets,"" he adds. Firms such as TDR Capital, known as private equity firms, have backed nearly 5,000 buyout deals over the past decade, worth a total of Â£350bn, according to research firm Preqin - although the Asda buyout is the largest in more than a decade. With big debts come fears that paying interest on the debt will suck money away from investing in the business or paying staff. But interest rates are currently extremely low, which will made Asda's debt burden affordable. On the Â£3.7bn of Asda's debt which is being raised on public markets, the interest bill will be just Â£125m a year, according to Azhar Hussain, head of global credit at the Royal London Asset Management. Leasing back the warehouses will cost about Â£57m a year. So the Â£500m or so of cash which Asda makes each year will easily cover the interest costs incurred in the buyout, leaving plenty spare to pay down the debts and reduce Asda's borrowings even further. The debt burden will be higher than supermarket rivals Tesco and Morrisons, but it's expected to fall over time as new owners pay the debts off. Asda's new owners - Mohsin (left) and Zuber Issa in Blackburn last year Paying back borrowers will be less of an issue than competition from other supermarkets. Asda may still find itself needing to cut costs, but not necessarily to pay back debts. ""Every grocer is cutting costs anyway, because of competition,"" says Mr Pozzi. ""Now their plan is to become more efficient and put in place a lower cost structure, because that's what everybody is doing."" The Issa brothers are new to the hyper-competitive world of UK supermarkets and they will have to learn fast, at the same time as running a vast forecourt empire. ""It won't be easy and they will probably have to work harder to stand still,"" says Mr Pozzi. As the third-largest supermarket in the UK, Asda has seen its market share fall as discounters Aldi and Lidl have grown. Asda is behind in the fast-growing and profitable convenience store business, where Sainsbury's Local and Tesco Express have grown rapidly. The new relationship with EG Group gives it a chance to open convenience stores in petrol stations. How much difference will customers notice? Buyout deals can be extremely profitable for the new owners. Just suppose they pay 10% of the purchase price in cash. If they increase the value by 10%, all that increase in value goes to them, so they've doubled their money. Big buyouts are often controversial. The GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said Asda was ""a profitable company that does not need to be loaded with debt"" and labelled the sale of the warehouses ""asset-stripping"". There are stories of businesses where private equity buyouts have led to underinvestment and subsequent collapse. Debenhams is often cited as an example. But most of the thousands of private equity buyouts do not end that way. Businesses with big debts pay much less tax on their profits. They can deduct the interest payments from their profits before calculating how much tax to pay, which reduces their corporation tax bill. So that's a lower contribution to the costs of schools, hospitals and everything else taxes pay for. Companies owned by private investors are not listed on the stock exchange, meaning private investors can't participate in its future success by buying shares. However, many pension funds will still invest in the new Asda, either by lending their share of that Â£4bn of debt or investing in TDR Capital.

"Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is the 71-year-old billionaire ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. In the Middle East, he is renowned for overseeing the transformation of Dubai into a top business and tourism destination. Elsewhere, he is perhaps best known for his connection to horseracing, as the owner of the Godolphin stables. One of his daughters, Princess Latifa, has now made headlines after secret videos recorded by her in captivity have been obtained and released by the BBC's Panorama. Latifa made the videos while being held under her father's orders in Dubai in a barred villa. Dubai ruler's daughter reveals âhostageâ ordeal Timeline: Failed escapes of sheikh's daughters Frank Gardner: Dubai ruler abducted daughters - UK court Sheikh Mohammed was born in 1949 at his family home in Shindagha, near Dubai Creek. He was the third of the four sons of Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum, who ruled Dubai for 32 years from 1958. After finishing secondary school in 1965, Sheikh Mohammed moved to the UK to study English at a language school in Cambridge. The young sheikh later attended a six-month training court at the British Army's Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot, Hampshire. In 1968, following his return to Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed accompanied his father to a meeting with the then ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan, at which they agreed to a union that would lead to the establishment of a federation of emirates. After the UAE gained independence from the UK in 1971, Sheikh Mohammed was named defence minster - a position he still holds. Hundreds of high-rise buildings now fill Dubai's skyline Sheikh Mohammed also became heavily involved in his father's plan to compensate for Dubai's dwindling oil reserves by diversifying its economy and becoming an international trade and financial centre, as well as a tourist destination. Today, more than 95% of the emirate's gross domestic product is non-oil-based, with tourism contributing 20%. Dubai's population has also grown from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 3.3 million, including almost 3.1 million non-Emiratis, many of whom live in the hundreds of high-rise buildings filling its skyline. In 1990, Sheikh Rashid died after a long illness resulting from a stroke. He was succeeded by Mohammed's eldest brother, Maktoum. Five years later, Sheikh Maktoum named Mohammed crown prince of Dubai. He also handed over much of the day-to-day running of the emirate to him. Sheikh Mohammed succeeded his elder brother Sheikh Maktoum (left) as Dubai's ruler in 2006 Sheikh Mohammed became ruler of Dubai and vice-president and prime minister of the UAE in 2006, after his brother died aged 62 during a visit to Australia. Under his leadership, Dubai's development continued apace. In 2008, the emirate unveiled the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa; Dubai Mall, then world's largest shopping centre by total land area; and the Dubai Metro. Such ambitious projects were, however, reliant on borrowing billions of dollars. The global financial crisis caused Dubai's real estate market to crash and in 2009 state-linked companies came close to defaulting on their debts. Abu Dhabi stepped in and loaned the Dubai government the money it desperately needed. Dubai's construction boom also relied on low-paid migrant construction workers, many of whom complained that they suffered exploitation. Sheikh Mohammed founded the world's largest horseracing team, Godolphin Sheikh Mohammed has also become famous for his involvement in horseracing, and is credited with transforming it into a global industry. He rode horses on beaches in Dubai as a child and was introduced to the sport in 1967 in the UK. Ten years later, he enjoyed his first success as an owner. The sheikh subsequently set up the world's largest horseracing team, Godolphin, as well as the successful stallion breeding operation, Darley. Godolphin - which has facilities in the UAE, England, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Japan and the US - has won 6,000 races across the world since 1992, including 315 prestigious Group One races. Sheikh Mohammed frequently attends major horseracing events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II. Princess Haya and Sheikh Mohammed frequently attended Royal Ascot The sheikh shared a love of horses with his sixth and ""junior"" wife, Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and half-sister of King Abdullah II. The pair married in Amman in 2004 and had two children, Al Jalila and Zayed. Princess Haya painted a picture of a perfect family life in interviews, but cracks began to appear in 2018 when Princess Latifa, one of Sheikh Mohammed's adult daughters with another wife, tried to flee the UAE with the help of a former French spy and a Finnish fitness instructor. A boat carrying them was intercepted at sea off the coast of India and Latifa was returned to Dubai. In a video filmed beforehand, she alleged that she had been imprisoned for more than three years and subjected to physical abuse after another unsuccessful escape attempt in 2002. This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" Now, new videos made by Latifa have been released after beingobtained by the BBC's investigative current affairs programme, Panorama. The footage was recorded over several months by Latifa after she had been taken back to Dubai following her failed escape in 2018. They were made using a phone that was secretly given to her by friends who are campaigning for her freedom. In the videos, she describes how she fought back against the soldiers during her capture, before being tranquillised and flown back to Dubai. She said she was being held alone without access to medical or legal help in a villa with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police. The secret messages have since stopped, leading her friends to urge the UN to step in. After the 2018 escape attempt, Princess Haya had backed claims by the Dubai government that Latifa had been ""vulnerable to exploitation"" and was ""now safe"". But after fleeing Dubai for the UK via Germany along with their children in April 2019, sources alleged that she had become aware of new information relating to Latifa. Sheikh Mohammed did not comment on the breakdown of his marriage, but he did write an angry poem accusing an unnamed woman of ""treachery and betrayal"" and posted it on Instagram. In July 2019, Haya applied for a forced marriage protection order and a non-molestation order at the UK High Court in London - as well as wardship of their children. Sheikh Mohammed meanwhile applied for the children's return to Dubai. Eight months later, the High Court issued a series of fact-finding judgements,externalthat said Sheikh Mohammed had ordered and orchestrated the forcible return of Latifa in 2002 and 2018, as well as the unlawful abduction of her elder sister Princess Shamsa in 2000. Shamsa fled the family's UK estate in Surrey that year but was later recaptured in Cambridgeshire by agents of the sheikh and forcibly returned to Dubai. A request by Cambridgeshire Police to visit Dubai to investigate was refused. The court found that Sheikh Mohammed ""continues to maintain a regime whereby both these two young women are deprived of their liberty"". It also said Haya, who'd had an adulterous affair with a bodyguard, was now living in fear of her life after receiving numerous threats both in Dubai and in London. These included a pistol placed on her pillow. Sheikh Mohammed rejected the judgements and findings, and appealed unsuccessfully to keep them out of the public domain. He said the appeal was ""made to protect the best interests and welfare of the children"" and that the ""outcome does not protect my children from media attention in the way that other children in family proceedings in the UK are protected"". ""As a head of government, I was not able to participate in the court's fact-finding process. This has resulted in the release of a 'fact-finding' judgment which inevitably only tells one side of the story,"" he added.

"Digital currency Bitcoin has risen to a new record high of more than $50,000 (Â£36,000). The so-called cryptocurrency, which was created by an unknown inventor, has risen about 72% this year. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are generated by computers. Part of its supposed value comes from the finite number that can be computed. But regulators have warned that they are risky, since their value can change fast, both downwards and upwards. Much of this year's gain for Bitcoin came after Elon Musk's Tesla bought $1.5bn of them and said it would accept them as payment for its cars. Supporters say Bitcoin can act as a store of value, like a digital version of gold. ""If that narrative comes to fruition, then the growth potential is off the charts as $50,000 per bitcoin equates to a market cap of roughly $931bn, which is almost 9% of gold,"" said John Wu, president at blockchain company Ava Labs. ""If BTC meets gold's market cap, then that would be at least $500,000 per bitcoin."" Valuing Bitcoin is difficult, and pricing is susceptible to large swings because of the limited number which are traded. Many supporters are holding on to them in anticipation of higher valuations. Should they all sell at once, the price could tumble. With no intrinsic value, unlike a physical asset such as land, and no ability to generate an income, unlike a company or bond, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and can crash as fast as they rise. Critics point out that while Bitcoin may have a finite supply of units - 21 million - the number of cryptocurrencies is ever-growing and potentially limitless. People have lost large amounts of money in steep drops in the value of cryptocurrencies and in hacks and scams associated with them. Britain's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), opened 52 investigations into suspected cryptocurrency frauds in the year to 30 June 2020, according to a Freedom of Information request from law firm RPC. That was fewer than the 59 opened in the previous 12 months, sparking speculation that the regulator was short of resources to tackle cryptocurrency frauds. ""Given explosive growth in high-risk cryptocurrency and related frauds, we would expect the number of FCA investigations to jump up and not fall away,"" said Sam Tate, partner at RPC. ""The sheen of respectability now being given to cryptocurrencies is being taken advantage of by cyber-criminals and online fraudsters."" The FCA declined to comment on the figures. Bitcoin's value dropped by $5,000 on 4 January to about $29,000 before recovering the lost ground. On 11 Jan, it dropped $9,000 to $32,000. Because cryptocurrencies can pass international borders quickly and are not regulated in the same way as cash or regular investments, investigating thefts is hard. Last month, the FCA issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets. The financial watchdog said investors should be ""prepared to lose all their money"" should their investment's value collapse.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says pupils will start to return to Scottish classrooms from next week But there will be no other changes to lockdown restrictions until ""at least the beginning of March"", she adds Schools in Wales begin the process of reopening on Monday; in Northern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March In England, PM Boris Johnson will set out a roadmap for easing lockdown - including opening schools - on 22 February About 1.7 million more people are being added to the shielding list in England after experts identified additional adults at serious risk of Covid-19 Covid deaths in the UK are falling, but overall fatalities are higher than usual for this time of year, according to Office for National Statistics data ONS testing shows Covid antibody levels are rising across all four UK nations The newly-appointed head of the World Trade Organization has told the BBC that vaccine protectionism must be overcome to solve the pandemic People arriving in England who have to stay at a quarantine hotel will have to pay an extra Â£1,200 if they test positive for Covid, the government says Globally, there have now been more than 109 million confirmed Covid cases and 2.4 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hamish Mackay We are wrapping up our coronavirus live page for the day, so here's a recap of today's main stories from the UK and around the world:  Thanks for joining us. Today's page has been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans and Lauren Turner.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The smallpox virus was able to be eradicated because the pustules it caused made it clear who was infected Government ministers and their scientific advisers argue that vaccination and new treatments will reduce the death rate and allow us to live with coronavirus, rather than constantly trying to fight it. Wiping Covid from the face of the Earth would, of course, be great given the death and destruction it has caused. But the only problem with that is that eradication has only been achieved with one virus before - smallpox in 1980. It took decades to get to that point, and scientists and governments were only able to achieve this because of a pretty unique set of circumstances. Firstly, the vaccine was so stable it didn't need to be refrigerated, and when it was given it was immediately obvious whether it worked or not - a pustule developed. It was also clear when someone was infected - a lab test was not needed, which was a huge advantage in trying to contain outbreaks. Covid, as we are all too well aware, iscompletely different. A priest in the Republic of Ireland has made ""takeaway ashes"" available for parishioners to administer at home on Ash Wednesday. Fr Brian Brady teamed up with a shop in Clonmany, County Donegal, to provide holy ashes in sauce containers. They are made out of burnt palms from Palm Sunday which have been blessed and left out for collection at the three churches in the parish. Covid-19 restrictions,externalin the country mean all church services must be conducted online. He told BBC News NI that he has been overwhelmed by the response. All 600 portions of ashes have beentaken away. People arriving in the UK now have to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining, and some must pay to self-isolate at a hotel. This is among the rules aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more resistant Covid strains from other countries. Rule-breakers face stricter penalties, including a prison sentence of up to 10 years for those who lie about having been in a banned ""red list"" country, such as Portugal. All incoming passengers must complete a passenger locator form in advance, including their departure country and UK address. They also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours before travelling, to be allowed entry. Travellers must thenself-isolate for 10 days. Here's your guide to the new rules. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Careful, cautious, gradual are the watchwords for the easing of lockdown in Scotland. That is to say we're not going to get back the everyday freedoms we once took for granted, quickly. The stay at home instruction will remain in place into March, possibly longer, with the anniversary of the first lockdown drawing nearer. A further reopening of schools is a priority but will not happen before 15 March. Easter holidays are unlikely to be allowed at home or abroad. The same will probably apply to overseas holidays this summer. Why all this caution when the vaccination programme is now progressing at pace? Because, at this stage, ministers remain nervous that opening up too quickly could mean losing control of the virus again in the wider population. They are desperate to avoid a third lockdown later in the year. A return to local protection levels should form part of the exit plan to be announced next week.

Many who are working or studying from home are staring at laptops and other devices all day. Most schoolchildren currently have no other way of accessing classes. For some, the new ways of working are taking a toll on their eyes. Itchiness, blurry vision and headaches - or eye strain - are among the common problems. More than a third (38%) of respondents toone survey, carried out for the charity Fight for Sight, said their eyesight had worsened since the start of the pandemic.Another survey,externalput the figure at 22%. Eyesight experts say people with persistent problems should visit an optician, which are open in lockdown. But there are things that many of us can do to keep our eyes healthy. We've got more on the four air passengers who were each fined Â£10,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a ""red-list"" country. They were stopped at border control by officials at Birmingham Airport. Under new rules, arrivals in England have to quarantine in hotels if they have been in a country deemed a high Covid risk in the last 10 days. The regulations came into effect on Monday and the four passengers had been fined by midday, a senior officer told a meeting of the West Midlands Strategic Policing and Crime Board. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Chris Todd said that in the same timeframe, the airport received six passengers who did declare travel from a red-list country, who were taken to a quarantine hotel. But of the offenders he says: ""There are some people who have attempted to hide their routes - butthat's not worked out."" Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News A team of scientists has used artificial intelligence (AI) to work out which animals the next coronavirus strain could come from. Dr Marcus Blagrove, a virologist from the University of Liverpool, UK, who was involved in the study, says: ""One way [new coronaviruses] are generated is through recombination between two existing coronaviruses - so two viruses infect the same cell and they recombine into a 'daughter' virus that would be an entirely new strain."" The researchers were able to plug biological evidence into an algorithm that taught a computer how to spot viruses and host species that were most likely to be a source of this recombination. The team ""asked"" their algorithm to find biological patterns to predict which mammals might be susceptible to known coronaviruses, which revealed links between 411 strains of coronavirus and 876 potential mammal species. The scientists say their findings could help to target the surveillance for new diseases - possibly helping prevent the next pandemic before its starts. You can read the full story here.

Putting police officers in schools when they fully reopen could help prevent a surge in violent crime, the mayor of London says. Sadiq Khan says the Metropolitan Police will use school safety officers and targeted policing in areas of high violent crime to in a bid to avoid a post-lockdown spike. ""One of the things that we've been looking at, in those parts of the world where they've come out of lockdown sooner than us, is there has been, I'm afraid, a surge in violent crime,"" he says. The Labour mayor says other cities have seen a rise in crime after lockdowns were lifted and the key challenge is to avoid something similar in London. ""So for example, making sure when schools fully reopen, school safety officers are there, making sure that police are properly targeted in those areas in London where there's a concern,"" he says. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has finished giving a statement about a ""gradual and phased"" return to school for some pupils - here's the upshot: Nicola Sturgeon is at pains to warn people that the return of some pupils to school is not a ""return to greater normality"". The first minister warns the risk is that schools going back leads to parents socialising more - at the school gates, for example - or returning to the workplace rather than working from home. She adds that this ""will then jeopardise our ability to sustain even this limited return to school"" and make it less likely that more pupils can return soon. ""Please treat Mondayâs important milestone as a return to education for children only, and not as a return to greater normality for the rest of us,"" she says. Scotland's first minister has just announced that all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school will return to class from Monday. So how does that to compare to schools in the rest of the UK? InWales, three-to-seven-year-olds will start going back on Monday, along with some older children on vocational courses. InNorthern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March. InEngland, PM Boris Johnson has said pupils could return to school on 8 March""at the earliest"". He will set out a roadmap for easing lockdown - including opening schools - on 22 February. Asked again whether teachers will be prioritised in the next phase of vaccination rollout, Nicola Sturgeon says she will wait for scientific advice, which is being considered while the vaccine programme reaches the current priority list. ""It may be, I can't say this for sure right now, but it may be that occupations have more of a priority in this next phase given that the first phase has focused so much on clinical vulnerability,"" she says. The first minister says testing is very important for safety in schools and there will be additional funding available for local councils and schools. ""Let me be very clear here we want children back in school but we will not compromise the safety of children or those who work in schools,"" she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Asda has been interested in the former Nortel site since 2012 Asda has new owners. The Issa brothers, two entrepreneurs from Blackburn who made billion-pound fortunes running petrol stations, have completed the deal to buy Britain's third-largest supermarket chain. Asda was valued at Â£6.8bn, but the brothers and the investment firm TDR Capital paid just Â£780m. The rest of the money was borrowed. So how does this kind of deal work? And will it leave Asda with too much debt? This kind of deal is called a leveraged buyout - which means that it involves large amounts of debt. TDR Capital specialises in this kind of deal. It is also co-owner of EG Group, the worldwide petrol station business which built the brothers' fortune, and which also has large borrowings. The Issas and TDR each contribute half of the Â£780m in cash to Asda's former owners, Wal-Mart, which has owned Asda since 1999. Most of the purchase price - just under Â£4bn - will be borrowed. Walmart, the American supermarket which owned Asda for the past 21 years, will retain a small stake in Asda, for Â£500m, along with a seat on Asda's board. Then the new owners will sell off parts of Asda to raise the rest of the purchase price. Asda will sell its warehouses and distribution system for Â£950m. It will still use them, but in future, it will have to pay rent to their new owners. And Asda's 323 petrol stations will be sold for Â£750m to EG Group, adding to the portfolio of more than 6,000 around the world. The deal is still awaiting approval from the Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected by the summer. Buying a Â£6.8bn business for less than Â£800m has certainly raised eyebrows, but it is not unusual for buyers to put up only a small fraction of the purchase price in such big deals. ""10% looks low, compared to the average for leveraged buyouts as a whole of around 50%,"" says Roberto Pozzi, senior vice-president at Moody's, an agency which analyses the riskiness of company's borrowings. ""Keep in mind that it depends also on the stability of the business, and there is no more stable business than supermarkets,"" he adds. Firms such as TDR Capital, known as private equity firms, have backed nearly 5,000 buyout deals over the past decade, worth a total of Â£350bn, according to research firm Preqin - although the Asda buyout is the largest in more than a decade. With big debts come fears that paying interest on the debt will suck money away from investing in the business or paying staff. But interest rates are currently extremely low, which will made Asda's debt burden affordable. On the Â£3.7bn of Asda's debt which is being raised on public markets, the interest bill will be just Â£125m a year, according to Azhar Hussain, head of global credit at the Royal London Asset Management. Leasing back the warehouses will cost about Â£57m a year. So the Â£500m or so of cash which Asda makes each year will easily cover the interest costs incurred in the buyout, leaving plenty spare to pay down the debts and reduce Asda's borrowings even further. The debt burden will be higher than supermarket rivals Tesco and Morrisons, but it's expected to fall over time as new owners pay the debts off. Asda's new owners - Mohsin (left) and Zuber Issa in Blackburn last year Paying back borrowers will be less of an issue than competition from other supermarkets. Asda may still find itself needing to cut costs, but not necessarily to pay back debts. ""Every grocer is cutting costs anyway, because of competition,"" says Mr Pozzi. ""Now their plan is to become more efficient and put in place a lower cost structure, because that's what everybody is doing."" The Issa brothers are new to the hyper-competitive world of UK supermarkets and they will have to learn fast, at the same time as running a vast forecourt empire. ""It won't be easy and they will probably have to work harder to stand still,"" says Mr Pozzi. As the third-largest supermarket in the UK, Asda has seen its market share fall as discounters Aldi and Lidl have grown. Asda is behind in the fast-growing and profitable convenience store business, where Sainsbury's Local and Tesco Express have grown rapidly. The new relationship with EG Group gives it a chance to open convenience stores in petrol stations. How much difference will customers notice? Buyout deals can be extremely profitable for the new owners. Just suppose they pay 10% of the purchase price in cash. If they increase the value by 10%, all that increase in value goes to them, so they've doubled their money. Big buyouts are often controversial. The GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said Asda was ""a profitable company that does not need to be loaded with debt"" and labelled the sale of the warehouses ""asset-stripping"". There are stories of businesses where private equity buyouts have led to underinvestment and subsequent collapse. Debenhams is often cited as an example. But most of the thousands of private equity buyouts do not end that way. Businesses with big debts pay much less tax on their profits. They can deduct the interest payments from their profits before calculating how much tax to pay, which reduces their corporation tax bill. So that's a lower contribution to the costs of schools, hospitals and everything else taxes pay for. Companies owned by private investors are not listed on the stock exchange, meaning private investors can't participate in its future success by buying shares. However, many pension funds will still invest in the new Asda, either by lending their share of that Â£4bn of debt or investing in TDR Capital.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The smallpox virus was able to be eradicated because the pustules it caused made it clear who was infected Government ministers and their scientific advisers argue that vaccination and new treatments will reduce the death rate and allow us to live with coronavirus, rather than constantly trying to fight it. Wiping Covid from the face of the Earth would, of course, be great given the death and destruction it has caused. But the only problem with that is that eradication has only been achieved with one virus before - smallpox in 1980. It took decades to get to that point, and scientists and governments were only able to achieve this because of a pretty unique set of circumstances. Firstly, the vaccine was so stable it didn't need to be refrigerated, and when it was given it was immediately obvious whether it worked or not - a pustule developed. It was also clear when someone was infected - a lab test was not needed, which was a huge advantage in trying to contain outbreaks. Covid, as we are all too well aware, iscompletely different. A priest in the Republic of Ireland has made ""takeaway ashes"" available for parishioners to administer at home on Ash Wednesday. Fr Brian Brady teamed up with a shop in Clonmany, County Donegal, to provide holy ashes in sauce containers.

Covid-19 restrictions,externalin the country mean all church services must be conducted online. He told BBC News NI that he has been overwhelmed by the response. All 600 portions of ashes have beentaken away. People arriving in the UK now have to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining, and some must pay to self-isolate at a hotel. This is among the rules aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more resistant Covid strains from other countries. Rule-breakers face stricter penalties, including a prison sentence of up to 10 years for those who lie about having been in a banned ""red list"" country, such as Portugal. All incoming passengers must complete a passenger locator form in advance, including their departure country and UK address. They also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours before travelling, to be allowed entry. Travellers must thenself-isolate for 10 days. Here's your guide to the new rules. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Careful, cautious, gradual are the watchwords for the easing of lockdown in Scotland. That is to say we're not going to get back the everyday freedoms we once took for granted, quickly. The stay at home instruction will remain in place into March, possibly longer, with the anniversary of the first lockdown drawing nearer. A further reopening of schools is a priority but will not happen before 15 March. Easter holidays are unlikely to be allowed at home or abroad. The same will probably apply to overseas holidays this summer. Why all this caution when the vaccination programme is now progressing at pace? Because, at this stage, ministers remain nervous that opening up too quickly could mean losing control of the virus again in the wider population. They are desperate to avoid a third lockdown later in the year. A return to local protection levels should form part of the exit plan to be announced next week.

We've got more on the four air passengers who were each fined Â£10,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a ""red-list"" country. They were stopped at border control by officials at Birmingham Airport. Under new rules, arrivals in England have to quarantine in hotels if they have been in a country deemed a high Covid risk in the last 10 days. The regulations came into effect on Monday and the four passengers had been fined by midday, a senior officer told a meeting of the West Midlands Strategic Policing and Crime Board. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Chris Todd said that in the same timeframe, the airport received six passengers who did declare travel from a red-list country, who were taken to a quarantine hotel. But of the offenders he says: ""There are some people who have attempted to hide their routes - butthat's not worked out."" Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News A team of scientists has used artificial intelligence (AI) to work out which animals the next coronavirus strain could come from. Dr Marcus Blagrove, a virologist from the University of Liverpool, UK, who was involved in the study, says: ""One way [new coronaviruses] are generated is through recombination between two existing coronaviruses - so two viruses infect the same cell and they recombine into a 'daughter' virus that would be an entirely new strain."" The researchers were able to plug biological evidence into an algorithm that taught a computer how to spot viruses and host species that were most likely to be a source of this recombination. The team ""asked"" their algorithm to find biological patterns to predict which mammals might be susceptible to known coronaviruses, which revealed links between 411 strains of coronavirus and 876 potential mammal species. The scientists say their findings could help to target the surveillance for new diseases - possibly helping prevent the next pandemic before its starts. You can read the full story here.

Private test results shared with NHS Test and Trace led to 3,853 notifications being wrongly issued on 13 February, the government confirmed.

One test and trace call centre received more than 500 calls from employees. Here's the full story. Putting police officers in schools when they fully reopen could help prevent a surge in violent crime, the mayor of London says. Sadiq Khan says the Metropolitan Police will use school safety officers and targeted policing in areas of high violent crime to in a bid to avoid a post-lockdown spike. ""One of the things that we've been looking at, in those parts of the world where they've come out of lockdown sooner than us, is there has been, I'm afraid, a surge in violent crime,"" he says. The Labour mayor says other cities have seen a rise in crime after lockdowns were lifted and the key challenge is to avoid something similar in London. ""So for example, making sure when schools fully reopen, school safety officers are there, making sure that police are properly targeted in those areas in London where there's a concern,"" he says. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has finished giving a statement about a ""gradual and phased"" return to school for some pupils - here's the upshot: Nicola Sturgeon is at pains to warn people that the return of some pupils to school is not a ""return to greater normality"". The first minister warns the risk is that schools going back leads to parents socialising more - at the school gates, for example - or returning to the workplace rather than working from home. She adds that this ""will then jeopardise our ability to sustain even this limited return to school"" and make it less likely that more pupils can return soon. ""Please treat Mondayâs important milestone as a return to education for children only, and not as a return to greater normality for the rest of us,"" she says. Scotland's first minister has just announced that all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school will return to class from Monday. So how does that to compare to schools in the rest of the UK? InWales, three-to-seven-year-olds will start going back on Monday, along with some older children on vocational courses. InNorthern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March. InEngland, PM Boris Johnson has said pupils could return to school on 8 March""at the earliest"". He will set out a roadmap for easing lockdown - including opening schools - on 22 February. Asked again whether teachers will be prioritised in the next phase of vaccination rollout, Nicola Sturgeon says she will wait for scientific advice, which is being considered while the vaccine programme reaches the current priority list. ""It may be, I can't say this for sure right now, but it may be that occupations have more of a priority in this next phase given that the first phase has focused so much on clinical vulnerability,"" she says. The first minister says testing is very important for safety in schools and there will be additional funding available for local councils and schools. ""Let me be very clear here we want children back in school but we will not compromise the safety of children or those who work in schools,"" she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Amazon has been privately testing UK frontline employees since October and sharing the results with public health bodies Nearly 4,000 Amazon workers were given incorrect coronavirus test results after an error. Private test results shared with NHS Test and Trace led to 3,853 notifications being wrongly issued on 13 February, the government confirmed. Employees were told by Amazon the day before they were negative for the virus, then given the exact opposite message by contact tracers. One test and trace call centre received more than 500 calls from employees. The company has been testing frontline UK workers privately since October, sending the results to Public Health England, who then share them with NHS Test and Trace and equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Amazon said it had followed NHS instructions and all workers had been made aware of the error and supported to take ""appropriate action steps"". The Department for Health and Social care said all employees wrongly issued self-isolation notifications were ""rapidly"" informed they did not need to. In messages seen by the BBC, one warehouse worker was told they were negative for Covid-19 on Friday by their employer and then wrongly notified they were positive by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate for 10 days on Saturday morning. A follow up message from contact tracers confirming a ""system error"" was sent that evening. A call centre employee, working for a private company on behalf of test and trace, told the BBC the error led to thousands of confused Amazon employees contacting the 119 helpline. The call handler, who wishes to remain anonymous, said their team alone received more than 500 calls on Saturday. They said: ""It's not only affected their staff, but the families and households of their staff as well. ""Partners and children of Amazon staff who were added as contacts, told bosses they had to isolate and have lost income."" The Department of Health and Social care said the ""vast majority"" of people reported no issues with the testing and contact tracing process. A spokesman said: ""Working closely with Amazon, NHS Test and Trace rapidly notified affected employees to let them know they did not need to isolate.""

"This video can not be played The government is not planning for domestic vaccine passports, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi says A combination of rapid testing and the Covid vaccination programme will help entertainment venues to reopen in England, the vaccines minister says. Nadhim Zahawi said it was those measures which would get ""our economy back on its feet"". His comments come after the PM said ""rapid"" lateral flow testscould be used by ""those parts of the economy we couldn't get open last year"". Industry bosses have queried whether using rapid tests would be practical. Some venues such as nightclubs have been unable to open since March 2020, while others like theatres and cinemas have struggled to make social distancing work. Reopen pubs to save jobs, says Wetherspoons The night the theatres went dark Festival season is 'still possible' in 2021 Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi said: ""It's a combination of rapid testing as well as a national vaccination programme that will get our economy back on its feet and venues open again."" He said that the government favoured testing over vaccine passports as a means to reopening the economy, since it was not yet clear whether a vaccinated individual could still transmit the virus. Mr Zahawi describedpreliminary evidence on the effect of vaccines on coronavirus transmissionas ""really encouraging"", but said the full data might not be available for weeks. ""We have a couple of very large-scale studies related to giving us better data on the vaccines,"" he said. ""We should be able to see really good data in the next few weeks from those studies."" He added that the government would be ""data driven, rather than date driven"" when it comes to relaxing lockdown measures. This video can not be played How theatres are changing in the age of coronavirus Boris Johnson is due to set out a road map on 22 February for easing the lockdown in England. At Monday's Downing Street briefing, the prime minister said lateral flow tests, along with vaccination, would ""probably be the route forward"" to reopening the economy. Lateral flow tests give a result in 20-30 minutes - unlike the more expensive PCR tests used by NHS Test and Trace which need to be taken to a lab to be processed. The UK Cinema Association said asking all customers to have a rapid test and then to wait 30 minutes for a result would be ""impractical"" and in many instances add a ""50% uplift on their cinema ticket"". Its chief executive, Phil Clapp, said he was not aware of any of its members considering rapid testing or vaccine passports ""as a viable way forward for the return to cinema"". He added that he believed cinemas offered a ""materially different environment than nightclubs or music venues"". Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade association UKHospitality, said the organisation would be ""keen to understand"" the government's plans for mass lateral flow testing in the community and workplaces. She also said the industry body stood ready to work with ministers on ""a risk-assessed approach to be applied on a voluntary basis where proportionate, pragmatic and necessary"". Michael Kill, the boss of the Night Time Industries Association, welcomed the PM's comments, saying: ""Finally we have some acknowledgement from the prime minister and government on the existence of late-night economy businesses, including nightclubs, theatres, casinos and late bars, particularly as they are some of the hardest hit since the start of the pandemic."" However, he told the BBC that administering rapid tests would not be straightforward. He said professionals would be required to administer swab tests outside the venue, which would force venues to stagger admissions and have procedures in place to deal with positive cases and those who they came into contact with. Sacha Lord, who co-founded Manchester's Parklife Festival, said the events sector had been calling for on-site rapid testing for more than five months, and any further delay to implementing such initiatives would do ""irreversible"" damage to the UK's cultural sector. ""My fear is that they take another five months to get moving, which the industry simply doesn't have,"" he said. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen?

"Syrup joins his siblings Banana, Peanut, Piccolo and Prairie. A newborn weighs about 17g Keepers at Longleat Safari Park are celebrating the success of their pancake tortoise breeding programme, with five newborns. Syrup, Banana, Peanut, Piccolo and Prairie have been born to Poppadom and Jua in the past year. Newborns are about as big as a 50p coin. Pancake tortoises, named for their flat shells, are critically-endangered, and native to Kenya and Tanzania. They are at risk because of habitat destruction and the illegal pet trade. Pancake tortoises have lightweight shells and are known for their speed, agility and climbing skills The tortoises also have such slow reproductive rates that wild populations take a while to recover when numbers drop. In the wild, they can live for up to 25 years, reaching up to 35 years in captivity. Longleat now have seven pancake tortoises, including the two parents. Because of their flattened size, they prefer to run and hide from predators in crevices rather than using their shells like other species. The tortoises' light weight also makes them good climbers. The five were born over the course of a year, with the first, Syrup, arriving in February 2020, and the youngest one arriving on 18 January 2021.

"Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since December Nicola Sturgeon is to announce whether some pupils will start to return to Scottish classrooms from next week in a statement at Holyrood. This could include children aged four to seven and secondary pupils required to carry out practical assignments. The first minister has said she was ""very keen"" to begin the phased return of younger pupils to schools. However, she warned this would not mark the start of a broader easing of the Covid-19 restrictions. The devolved nations have the powers to set their own coronavirus rules, and while they have made similar decisions during the crisis, they have moved at different speeds. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to set out a roadmap on 22 February for easing lockdown there - including the date schools can reopen to all pupils. He warned on Monday people must be ""optimistic but patient"" about the end of national restrictions,and that now was not the time to ""relax"". Primary schools in Wales begin the process of reopening next Monday, while in Northern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March. How soon will children return to school? 'No evidence' schools spread lots of Covid What can families do over the half-term break? In Scotland, ministers will examine the latest data and scientific advice on Tuesday morning, before their decision is announced to MSPs in the afternoon. Opposition parties have called for the Scottish government to set out more detail about its approach to eventually easing restrictions and lifting lockdown. Most school pupils have been learning remotely during 2021 as part of Scotland's ""stay at home"" lockdown. A small number of children, including those whose parents have key worker status, are allowed to attend. At her daily Covid-19 briefing on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said she was ""very, very, very keen to go ahead"" with plans for a phased return to the classroom. However, she said only between 5% and 8% of any school's roll should return. It had previously been indicated that children in P1 to P3 years and a limited number of secondary pupils who need practical resources to complete qualifications would return to schools from next Monday. Ministers will take a final decision about this, based on the latest data, at a meeting of the Scottish government's cabinet on Tuesday morning. They will also consider an ""indicative timetable"" for other pupils returning. However, Ms Sturgeon warned that it was unlikely that other lockdown restrictions would start to be eased, with schools the top priority. Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney will discuss plans with ministers on Tuesday morning before the Holyrood announcement She said: ""What is really important is that that's not seen as a trigger for people who are currently able to work from home to go back to work, or parents deciding to meet up with each other more. ""What was often the risk factor around schools is not transmission inside schools, its all the activity that takes place around schools."" The first minister also said there would be ""trade-offs"" over the coming months as the country eases out of lockdown, with schools and care home visiting ""the kind of things we focus on first as we try to get things back to normal"". MSPs will have the chance to question Ms Sturgeon following the statement, with opposition leaders pressing for more details on the government's future plans. Secondary pupils could face two-metre distance rule Scottish schools to start phased return this month Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was understandable that there were not ""specific dates set in stone"" for easing restrictions, but said it was important ministers provided more of a ""route map"" out of lockdown. He said: ""We need to know the triggers that will be in place for all school pupils to go back, for businesses to reopen - will we have a tiered approach or a national approach? ""These are the crucial points that businesses really need to be aware of so we can see our way out of this crisis."" Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said there was ""no point in setting dates"" for lifting lockdown due to uncertainty about vaccine supplies and new variants. He said: ""What the government can do is list the policies they want to bring in, the safety measures they want to bring in, and as those measures come in it can be easier for us to ease some restrictions and return back to normal."" Scottish Labour, meanwhile, has called for supply teachers to be given a greater role in delivering online learning, saying they had been ""forgotten"" in Education Secretary John Swinney's latest plans. Education spokesman Iain Gray said: ""Many supply teachers face financial hardship and are unable to rely on furlough funds - this is unacceptable. It's time for John Swinney to bring our supply teachers in from the cold and get them to work."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, to air next month. Oprah With Meghan And Harry: A CBS Primetime Special has been described by the US television network as an ""intimate conversation"". The ""wide-ranging"" interview will be broadcast on 7 March. The news follows the announcement thatthe royal couple are expecting their second child. According to CBS, Meghan will be interviewed about ""stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood"" and ""how she is handling life under intense public pressure"". She will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the United States last year and their future plans. Winfrey was a guest at the couple's wedding in 2018 The decision to speak publicly comes just over a year after the couple announced they had decided to ""step back"" from life as senior royals and work to become financially independent. They carried out their final formal royal duties last March.

It is not known whether Harry and Meghan informed the royal household about their plans to be interviewed. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. It is also not known which broadcaster, if any, will show the interview in the UK. Jonny Dymond, the BBC's royal correspondent, said there would now be ""three weeks of frantic speculation"" about the contents of the interview. ""We wait to see what it will be and what kind of secrets are revealed about the past two or three years,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. Dymond described Winfrey as ""a very close acquaintance"" of the royal couple and that she had apparently been ""angling"" for the interview ""for some time"". He added that their conversation was unlikely to be a ""hostile"" interview like the one between the Duke of York and Newsnight's Emily Maitlis last year. Meanwhile, press reports on Tuesday suggested the duke and duchess are set to lose their remaining royal patronages. It is claimed that Harry will also lose his three honorary military titles - Captain General of the Royal Marines, Honorary Air Force Commandant of the Royal Air Force Base Honington, and Honorary Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Naval Commands' Small Ships and Diving.

"This video can not be played Covid: Youngest pupils to return to classrooms in Scotland The youngest pupils are to return to Scotland's classrooms for face-to-face teaching from next week. The move will see all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school returning from Monday 22 February. Other age groups will continue to learn from home, apart from some secondary pupils who need to complete coursework. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was unlikely that any other pupils would return to school before 15 March at the earliest. All other existing lockdown measures will all remain in place until at least the end of this month, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the country remains in a precarious position. The EIS teaching union said it still had significant concerns over school safety which had not yet been addressed, and a blended learning model - with around half of pupils in classes at any one time - would have more appropriate. The union's general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said: ""Everyone is supportive of face-to-face teaching returning as soon as possible - that should not override safety concerns, however, and teachers will be understandably nervous around today's announcement.""

In an update at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""more reason to be hopeful now than we did a few weeks ago"" that the race against the virus could be won, with the vaccination programme picking up pace while lockdown contains the spread of new cases. Teaching unions say they are concerned that the new variants of the virus could be more transmissible She said she was ""very hopeful that vaccination will start to have a significant impact in reducing the number of people who die from Covid"", saying there was already evidence of this in care homes. However, the first minister warned that ""our situation is still very fragile"", saying: ""Even a slight easing of restrictions could cause cases to start rising rapidly again"". While she said it would continue to be ""extremely cautious"", the government is focused on a ""gradual, phased return to as much normality as possible"". This is to begin with schools, with the youngest pupils to return to classrooms as soon as next week. But Ms Sturgeon said there would be trade-offs, adding: ""We are choosing to use the very limited headroom we have right now to get at least some children back to school - because children's education and wellbeing is such a priority. ""But being able to get children back to education may mean the rest of us living with some other restrictions for longer."" Careful, cautious, gradual are the watchwords for the easing of lockdown in Scotland. That is to say we're not going to get back the everyday freedoms we once took for granted, quickly. The stay at home instruction will remain in place into March, possibly longer, with the anniversary of the first lockdown drawing nearer. A further reopening of schools is a priority but will not happen before 15 March. Easter holidays are unlikely to be allowed at home or abroad. The same will probably apply to overseas holidays this summer. Why all this caution when the vaccination programme is now progressing at pace? Because, at this stage, ministers remain nervous that opening up too quickly could mean losing control of the virus again in the wider population. They are desperate to avoid a third lockdown later in the year. A return to local protection levels should form part of the exit plan to be announced next week. But expect the restrictions associated with each level to be tighter than before, given this system was overwhelmed as autumn turned to winter last year. The first pupils to return to schools will be those in preschools, those in P1, P2 and P3, and ""a limited number of senior phase students who need access to school for essential practical work"". Ministers hope to set out second phase of schools reopening in two weeks time, but Ms Sturgeon said there was ""unlikely to be any further return to school before 15 March"" so that the impact of the initial changes can be assessed. She said at-home testing sets would be provided to senior phase pupils, teachers and school staff once they do return, and that secondary pupils would have to maintain a 2m distance in school buildings. Plans for the ""gradual"" easing of the strict stay at home lockdown are set to include a return to a regional levels system. Ms Sturgeon said that ""caution will be necessary"", and that she would be clear about what will not be possible in the immediate future - including holidays. She said: ""We are likely to advise against booking Easter holidays, either overseas or within Scotland, as it is highly unlikely that we will have been able to fully open hotels of self-catering accommodation by then. ""However, for the summer, while it is still highly unlikely that overseas holidays will be possible or advisable, staycations might be - but this will depend on the data nearer the time."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said it was ""very welcome news"" that schools could start opening again safely. However she said that ""to get us even closer to normality, we need to get all key workers vaccinated as early as we can"", saying government plans were ""short on detail"". And she urged the Scottish government to publish its plans for helping pupils to catch-up with the schooling they have missed, which she said should be built around a tutoring service to stop the attainment gap growing. Scottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie also challenged Ms Sturgeon over the vaccine rollout, urging the first minister to commit to more ambitious targets for completing priority groups.

"There is to be a large expansion of the number of people being asked to shield in England. An extra 1.7 million people are expected to be added to the 2.3 million already on the list. Half of the group have not yet been vaccinated so will now be prioritised urgently by their local GPs. It comes after anew model,externalwas developed that takes into account extra factors rather than just health. This calculation includes things such as ethnicity, deprivation (by postcode) and weight to work out a person's risk of becoming seriously ill if they were to catch Covid. It also looks at age, underlying health issues and prescribed medications. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which has been involved in the modelling, said it considered a ""combination of factors"" such as age, ethnicity and chronic illness and put them together to reach a score. Do people have to shield? He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that this score could ""more or less order people in the population according to their level of risk"" and ""identify those at the top of that range to say, 'you should be prioritised for vaccine and you have a level of risk that is similar to those on the shielding list'"". Until now, only those with specific conditions or undergoing certain types of treatment have been advised to shield until 31 March. They include adults with Down's Syndrome, organ donor recipients and people with severe respiratory conditions. The new model was developed following work by Oxford University which looked at the characteristics of people who died in the first wave to better understand risk. Medical records have been searched to identify high-risk patients, based on their combined risk factors. They are now being sent letters by the NHS informing of them of their new status, which means they are entitled to statutory sick pay, prioritisation for online shopping slots and help collecting medicines. Some local authorities with areas of high deprivation will now have a major task in contacting people to check what support they need, according to the BBC's health editor Hugh Pym. Cllr Neil Nerva, public health lead at Brent Council, in north-west London, told BBC News: ""We've got 17,000 people who are shielding. The news today means that over the next two weeks we're going to be shielding another 12,000 people who are over 70 and another 12,000 who are under 70.""

The remainder are all thought to fall into one of the priority groups for vaccination that are being invited for vaccination next. They will be bumped up the list first for a jab, the government said. It means they will receive the offer a few weeks later than if they had been in the shielding group originally. Shielding was re-introduced in tier four areas from mid-December, before being expanded nationally once the third lockdown was announced in early January. Unlike in the first lockdown, people who are shielding are being advised they can leave their homes for exercise. Government guidelines,externalstrongly advise clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or to attend a medical appointment. They should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within their household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate. People on the list are still advised to shield even if they have had two doses of the vaccine. High risk categories,externalinclude: Solid organ transplant recipients Some people with cancer who are undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy People on immunosuppression drugs Women who are pregnant and have heart disease People with severe respiratory conditions - cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD Some people with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency Adults with Down's syndrome Adults on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease The list does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to do social distancing. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: ""All of these people who are identified for the first time, are those who have not had an individual clinical condition that we've previously been able to identify through the clinically extremely vulnerable group, but they are people who have multiple personal risk factors and underlying health conditions which move them into a higher risk group."" She said adding people to the shielding list ensured ""those most vulnerable to Covid can benefit from both the protection that vaccines provide and from enhanced advice and support should they choose it"". The approach was ""risk averse"" to ""protect as many people as possible"", she added. Phillip Anderson, of the MS Society, said some people with multiple sclerosis were being added to the shielding list. He said it would come as a ""huge shock"" to people who would potentially have to make ""drastic changes"" to their lives. The Westminster government said the model had been shared with the other nations of the UK, who would decide individually how to use it. There are no current plans to formally expand the shielding list in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the same way as in England. The Welsh government said the same computer model had already been used to add those with chronic kidney disease and adults with Down's Syndrome to its list of those who are extremely clinically vulnerable. In Northern Ireland, GPs and hospital doctors can add individual patients to the shielding list if they are assessed as extremely vulnerable based on a range of factors.

"Guidance for people in England identified as being ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing? Formal advice telling them to take extra care, or ""shield"", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. Most coronavirus restrictionsare being lifted in Englandon 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else. However, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to ""think particularly carefully"" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including: limiting moments of close contact considering whether you and others have been fully vaccinated (you might want to wait until 14 days after your second dose before meeting) considering the risk if Covid levels are high in the general community meeting outside if possible ensuring inside spaces are well-ventilated washing hands regularly and avoiding face-touching continuing social distancing if that feels right for you asking friends/family to take lateral flow tests before meeting There is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Although Scotland moves toCovid protection level zero,externalon 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidkeeping the mandatory use of face coveringspast then would give ""added protection and assurance"" to people who were particularly vulnerable. From 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace. However, companies still havelegally binding health and safety responsibilities,external- and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. Some firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people. TheCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough),externalis available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. You may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons. Read theupdated government advice,external. Although the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it ""expects and recommends"" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport. You should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. TheNHS Volunteer Responders,externalprogramme is still available to offer support. Data showsCovid vaccines are highly effectivein most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection. Being double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. You should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not,book through the NHS website,externalor call 119. The most vulnerable peopleare likely to be offered booster jabs from September,external, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions. The pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The governmentrecommends several support websites,external. If you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on theNHS Shielded Patient List,external. A combination of factors can contribute toa person's risk,external, including: age (older being higher risk) ethnicity deprivation (according to postcode) weight (body mass index) underlying health issues prescribed medications Cancer patients need to take extra care High risk categories,externalinclude people: with transplanted solid organs undergoing some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy on immunosuppression drugs with heart disease who are also pregnant with severe respiratory conditions (for example: cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD) with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency with Down's syndrome (adults) on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (adults) EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 Videos secretly recorded by Princess Latifa, a daughter of Dubai's ruler, have been obtained by the BBC's Panorama programme. She sent them to friends after her failed escape attempt from the Middle East emirate in 2018. Twenty years ago, her sister Princess Shamsa, also tried to escape the ruling family, while staying in the UK. The governments of Dubai and the UAE have failed to respond to requests for comment from the BBC about Latifa's current condition. July 2000 Princess Latifaâs older sister Shamsa escapes while on holiday with other members of the Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoumâs family at their Surrey estate. The sheikh launches a search for her, but doesnât inform the police â his men track her down in Cambridge over a month later. In an email to her solicitor, Shamsa says she was bundled into a car by four Arab men and driven to her fatherâs house in Newmarket, where she was injected and given tablets. The next morning, she is flown back to Dubai on a private plane. June 2002 Latifa makes her first escape attempt aged 16. She tries to get across the border of UAE and Oman but is caught and brought back to Dubai, where she is jailed for three years and four months. She says she was kept in solitary confinement and tortured. 2010 Latifa meets Tiina Jauhiainen, a fitness instructor hired to teach her a Brazilian martial art called capoeira. They become close friends. Latifaâs movements are restricted - sheâs not allowed to have a passport, drive or leave Dubai. 2011 Latifa contacts Herve Jaubert, a French businessman who years before had successfully escaped Dubai after being convicted in absentia of embezzlement. Over the next few years, they plan her escape in detail and Tiina Jauhiainen is enlisted as an aide and go-between. Early February 2018 Latifa records a video documenting her life and plans. She calls it a “just in case” videoand sends it to a group of trusted people with instructions to publish it if the escape fails. It details the restrictions she is under in Dubai, her first escape attempt and her plan to leave Dubai and claim asylum. 24 February 2018 Latifa and Ms Jauhiainen meet early in the morning and take a 26-mile trip by inflatable boat and jet ski to international waters, where Mr Jaubert is waiting in a US flagged yacht. They plan to head to India, from where Latifa hopes to fly to the United States and claim political asylum. 4 March 2018 Eight days into the journey, just off the coast of India, the boat is boarded by Indian special forces. Latifa and Ms Jauhiainen hide in the bathroom, but smoke grenades make it hard for them to breathe and they make their way to the top of the deck, where they are held at gunpoint. Latifa is dragged off the boat. Ms Jauhiainen and the crew are detained in a high security facility in the UAE before being released two weeks later. 11 March 2018 The anti-UAE pressure group Detained in Dubai release her video and Ms Jauhiainen begins to tell her story to the world. 5 December 2018 The day before the release of a BBC documentary telling the story of Latifaâs escape attempt, the government of Dubai publishes a statement saying that Latifa and her sister Shamsa are “adored and cherished"" by the family. They say that Latifa is now ""safe in Dubai"" and is celebrating her birthday ""in privacy and peace”. 24 December 2018 The UAE Foreign Ministry releases three photos of Latifa from a 15 December lunch with one of Sheikh Mohammedâs wives, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, and Mary Robinson, a former UN human rights commissioner. This is the first time anyone has seen Latifa since the failed escape. Three days later, Mary Robinson appears on the BBCâs Today Programme where says she was asked to visit Latifa by Princess Haya. She describes Latifa as a “troubled young woman"" who is receiving ""psychiatric care.” She immediately receives pushback from the international human rights community and campaign groups accuse her of pedalling the “Dubai line”. Early 2019 Tiina Jauhiainen receives a message from a stranger claiming to be in contact with Latifa. After Ms Jauhiainen passes a number of security questions, she begins direct communication with Latifa and manages to get a phone to her. Latifa begins recording video messages in which she describes the conditions she is being kept in: solitary confinement, the windows barred shut and no daylight. In the months after they establish phone contact, Ms Jauhiainen, her lawyer David Haigh, and her maternal cousin Marcus Essabri have daily contact with Latifa. April 2019 On the 15 April, Princess Haya, the second “official wife” of Sheikh Mohammed, escapes Dubai to the UK with her two children, reportedly in fear of her life. Haya, who became the Sheikhâs sixth wife in April 2004, is his only spouse with a public profile, and is often seen with him at events around the world. 14 May 2019 Sheikh Mohammed starts proceedings in the UK court to have his two children with Princess Haya returned to Dubai. Princess Haya applies for her children to become Wards of Court as well as a forced marriage protection order and non-molestation order. 5 March 2020 The High Court in the UK releases a fact-finding judgment which finds that on the balance of probabilities, Sheikh Mohammed was responsible for the abduction and forced return of both Shamsa and Latifa to Dubai. The judge rules that the sheikh has waged a campaign of intimidation towards Haya and that he has not been open and honest with the court. Later in 2020 David Haigh realises the messages to Latifa are not getting through. Contact with her is lost. February 2021 In her first interview since the pictures of her and Latifa were released in 2018, Mary Robinson says that Princess Haya and her were tricked by the sheikh,and that she is deeply worried about Latifa. She says she was blindsided when the UAE released the photographs of her and Latifa, and she admits that she regrets not seeing Latifa on her own, or asking her about her condition. 24 February 2021 UK police are passed a letter written by Latifa in 2019 urging them to re-investigate the kidnap of her sister Shamsa from a Cambridge street in August 2000. Cambridgeshire Police said the letter would be “looked at as part of the ongoing review” into the incident.

"Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, to air next month. Oprah With Meghan And Harry: A CBS Primetime Special has been described by the US television network as an ""intimate conversation"". The ""wide-ranging"" interview will be broadcast on 7 March. The news follows the announcement thatthe royal couple are expecting their second child. According to CBS, Meghan will be interviewed about ""stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood"" and ""how she is handling life under intense public pressure"". She will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the United States last year and their future plans. Winfrey was a guest at the couple's wedding in 2018 The decision to speak publicly comes just over a year after the couple announced they had decided to ""step back"" from life as senior royals and work to become financially independent. They carried out their final formal royal duties last March. Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royals Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Winfrey is a personal friend of Meghan and attended the couple's wedding in 2018. It is not known whether Harry and Meghan informed the royal household about their plans to be interviewed. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. It is also not known which broadcaster, if any, will show the interview in the UK. Jonny Dymond, the BBC's royal correspondent, said there would now be ""three weeks of frantic speculation"" about the contents of the interview. ""We wait to see what it will be and what kind of secrets are revealed about the past two or three years,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. Dymond described Winfrey as ""a very close acquaintance"" of the royal couple and that she had apparently been ""angling"" for the interview ""for some time"". He added that their conversation was unlikely to be a ""hostile"" interview like the one between the Duke of York and Newsnight's Emily Maitlis last year. Meanwhile, press reports on Tuesday suggested the duke and duchess are set to lose their remaining royal patronages. It is claimed that Harry will also lose his three honorary military titles - Captain General of the Royal Marines, Honorary Air Force Commandant of the Royal Air Force Base Honington, and Honorary Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Naval Commands' Small Ships and Diving.

"This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" The daughter of Dubai's ruler who tried to flee the country in 2018 later sent secret video messages to friends accusing her father of holding her ""hostage"" as she feared for her life. In footage shared with BBC Panorama, Princess Latifa Al Maktoum says commandos drugged her as she fled by boat and flew her back to detention. The secret messages have stopped - and friends are urging the UN to step in. Dubai and the UAE have previously said she is safe in the care of family. Ex-UN rights envoy Mary Robinson, who had described Latifa as a ""troubled young woman"" after meeting her in 2018, now says she was ""horribly tricked"" by the princess's family. The former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and president of Ireland has joined calls for international action to establish Latifa's current condition and whereabouts. ""I continue to be very worried about Latifa. Things have moved on. And so I think it should be investigated,"" she said. The princess who vanished Timeline: Failed escapes of sheikh's daughters Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum: Who is Dubai's ruler? Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 Latifa's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is one of the richest heads of state in the world, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The videos were recorded over several months on a phone Latifa was secretly given about a year after her capture and return to Dubai. She recorded them in a bathroom as it had the only door she could lock. In the messages, she detailed how: she fought back against the soldiers taking her off the boat, ""kicking and fighting"" and biting one Emirati commando's arm until he screamed after being tranquillised she lost consciousness as she was being carried on to a private jet, and didn't wake up until it landed in Dubai she was being held alone without access to medical or legal help in a villa with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police Tiina Jauhiainen, Latifa's fitness instructor, helped her with the escape plan Latifa's account of her capture and detention was revealed to Panorama by her close friend Tiina Jauhiainen, maternal cousin Marcus Essabri and campaigner David Haigh, who are all behind the Free Latifa campaign. They say they have taken the difficult decision to release the messages now out of concern for Latifa's safety. It was they who managed to establish contact with Latifa as she was held in a Dubai ""villa"", which she said had barred windows and police guards. Panorama has independently verified the details of where Latifa was held. The Missing Princess is on BBC One in the UK on Tuesday at 20:30, orwatch it later on BBC iPlayer Sheikh Mohammed has built a hugely successful city but rights activists say there is no tolerance of dissent and the judicial system can discriminate against women. He has a vast horse-racing enterprise and frequently attends major events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II. Queen Elizabeth in 2019 with Sheikh Mohammed, second from right, who regularly attends horse racing events But he has faced severe criticism over Princess Latifa and also her stepmother, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussain, who fled to London in 2019 with her two children. Latifa, now 35, first tried to flee at 16 but it was only after contacting French businessman Herve Jaubert in 2011 that a long-planned escape was put into motion. This was done with the help of Ms Jauhiainen, initially her instructor for capoeira, a Brazilian martial art. On 24 February 2018, Latifa and Ms Jauhiainen took an inflatable boat and jet ski to international waters, where Mr Jaubert was waiting in a US flagged yacht. But eight days later, off India, the boat was boarded by commandos. Ms Jauhiainen says smoke grenades forced her and Latifa out of hiding in the bathroom below deck and they were held at gunpoint. Latifa was returned to Dubai, and hadn't been heard from since until now. Ms Jauhiainen and the crew on the boat were freed after two weeks of detention in Dubai. The Indian government has never commented on its role. This video can not be played Dubaiâs Princess Latifa reveals details of alleged kidnapping Before her 2018 escape attempt, Latifa recorded another video which was posted on YouTube after her capture. ""If you are watching this video, it's not such a good thing, either I'm dead or I'm in a very, very, very bad situation,"" she said. It was this that sparked huge international concern and calls for her release. The UAE came under intense pressure to account for her and a meeting was arranged with Ms Robinson. She flew to Dubai in December 2018 at the request of her friend, Princess Haya, for a lunch at which Latifa was also present. Ms Robinson told Panorama she and Princess Haya had earlier been presented with details of Latifa's bipolar disorder, a condition she does not have. This video can not be played Former UN official Mary Robinson says she was ""horribly tricked"" in the Dubai princess scandal She said she did not ask Latifa about her situation because she did not want to ""increase the trauma"" of Latifa's ""condition"". Nine days after the lunch, the UAE's foreign ministry published photographs of Ms Robinson with Latifa, which it said was proof that the princess was safe and well. Ms Robinson said: ""I was particularly tricked when the photographs went public. That was a total surprise... I was absolutely stunned."" In 2019, the tensions within Dubai's ruling family were laid bare before England's High Court after one of the sheikh's wives, Princess Haya, fled to the UK with two of her children and applied for a protection order and non-molestation order against the sheikh. Princess Haya (left) arrives with Baroness Fiona Shackleton her lawyer, at the High Court in February 2020 Last year, the High Court issueda series of fact-finding judgments,externalthat said Sheikh Mohammed had ordered and orchestrated the forcible return of Latifa in 2002 and 2018, as well as the unlawful abduction from the UK in 2000 of her older sister Princess Shamsa, who had also tried to escape. The court found Sheikh Mohammed ""continues to maintain a regime whereby both these two young women are deprived of their liberty"". Latifa's friends had hoped that the court case in March last year that ruled against Sheikh Mohammed, calling him ""not honest"" and in favour of Princess Haya, might help. On the decision to release the messages now, Ms Jauhiainen just says that ""a lot of time has passed"" since contact was lost. She says she thought hard about releasing the video messages now, but adds: ""I feel that she would want us to fight for her, and not give up."" The governments of Dubai and the UAE have failed to respond to requests for comment from the BBC about Latifa's current condition.

She flew to Dubai in December 2018 at the request of her friend, Princess Haya, for a lunch at which Latifa was also present. Ms Robinson told Panorama she and Princess Haya had earlier been presented with details of Latifa's bipolar disorder, a condition she does not have. This video can not be played Former UN official Mary Robinson says she was ""horribly tricked"" in the Dubai princess scandal She said she did not ask Latifa about her situation because she did not want to ""increase the trauma"" of Latifa's ""condition"". Nine days after the lunch, the UAE's foreign ministry published photographs of Ms Robinson with Latifa, which it said was proof that the princess was safe and well. Ms Robinson said: ""I was particularly tricked when the photographs went public. That was a total surprise... I was absolutely stunned."" In 2019, the tensions within Dubai's ruling family were laid bare before England's High Court after one of the sheikh's wives, Princess Haya, fled to the UK with two of her children and applied for a protection order and non-molestation order against the sheikh. Princess Haya (left) arrives with Baroness Fiona Shackleton her lawyer, at the High Court in February 2020 Last year, the High Court issueda series of fact-finding judgments,externalthat said Sheikh Mohammed had ordered and orchestrated the forcible return of Latifa in 2002 and 2018, as well as the unlawful abduction from the UK in 2000 of her older sister Princess Shamsa, who had also tried to escape. The court found Sheikh Mohammed ""continues to maintain a regime whereby both these two young women are deprived of their liberty"". Latifa's friends had hoped that the court case in March last year that ruled against Sheikh Mohammed, calling him ""not honest"" and in favour of Princess Haya, might help. On the decision to release the messages now, Ms Jauhiainen just says that ""a lot of time has passed"" since contact was lost. She says she thought hard about releasing the video messages now, but adds: ""I feel that she would want us to fight for her, and not give up."" The governments of Dubai and the UAE have failed to respond to requests for comment from the BBC about Latifa's current condition.

"Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since December Nicola Sturgeon is to announce whether some pupils will start to return to Scottish classrooms from next week in a statement at Holyrood. This could include children aged four to seven and secondary pupils required to carry out practical assignments. The first minister has said she was ""very keen"" to begin the phased return of younger pupils to schools. However, she warned this would not mark the start of a broader easing of the Covid-19 restrictions. The devolved nations have the powers to set their own coronavirus rules, and while they have made similar decisions during the crisis, they have moved at different speeds. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to set out a roadmap on 22 February for easing lockdown there - including the date schools can reopen to all pupils. He warned on Monday people must be ""optimistic but patient"" about the end of national restrictions,and that now was not the time to ""relax"".

In Scotland, ministers will examine the latest data and scientific advice on Tuesday morning, before their decision is announced to MSPs in the afternoon. Opposition parties have called for the Scottish government to set out more detail about its approach to eventually easing restrictions and lifting lockdown. Most school pupils have been learning remotely during 2021 as part of Scotland's ""stay at home"" lockdown. A small number of children, including those whose parents have key worker status, are allowed to attend. At her daily Covid-19 briefing on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said she was ""very, very, very keen to go ahead"" with plans for a phased return to the classroom. However, she said only between 5% and 8% of any school's roll should return. It had previously been indicated that children in P1 to P3 years and a limited number of secondary pupils who need practical resources to complete qualifications would return to schools from next Monday. Ministers will take a final decision about this, based on the latest data, at a meeting of the Scottish government's cabinet on Tuesday morning. They will also consider an ""indicative timetable"" for other pupils returning. However, Ms Sturgeon warned that it was unlikely that other lockdown restrictions would start to be eased, with schools the top priority. Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney will discuss plans with ministers on Tuesday morning before the Holyrood announcement She said: ""What is really important is that that's not seen as a trigger for people who are currently able to work from home to go back to work, or parents deciding to meet up with each other more. ""What was often the risk factor around schools is not transmission inside schools, its all the activity that takes place around schools.""

Secondary pupils could face two-metre distance rule Scottish schools to start phased return this month Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was understandable that there were not ""specific dates set in stone"" for easing restrictions, but said it was important ministers provided more of a ""route map"" out of lockdown.

Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said there was ""no point in setting dates"" for lifting lockdown due to uncertainty about vaccine supplies and new variants.

"At least 80 people had to leave their homes in the village after flooding People flooded out of their homes after a mine blow-out are in ""limbo and need answers"". Eighty peoplewere evacuated from Skewenin Neath Port Talbot on 21 January and residents have beenurged to stay away due to safety fears. Some people willnot be able to returnhome for at least six months, the Coal Authority has said. Resident Kelly Birch said there was no clear plan about what was happening and insurers had been unable to visit. Ms Birch said she and her family had been able to move in with her parents but many of her neighbours were staying in hotels. Is Wales' coalmining heritage behind flooding? Financial help offered to flood victims ""It's been really difficult because our houses are still full of flood water, sludge and slurry,"" shetold BBC Radio Wales. ""We haven't been able to get any insurers in to have a look. Firefighters in Skewen helped evacuate people from their homes ""The Coal Authority have advised a six-month window but we don't know if that is six months before we can get people to start working on our houses or if that is six months until we're actually able to go back and live there. ""So we're all in a bit of limbo at the moment, we're getting pieces of information but we're never really getting the full picture."" This video can not be played Another resident Cerys Thomas said her mother's conservatory windows were blown open by the force of the water She said if it was not for their local councillor Mike Harvey they would ""not know anything at all"". Ms Birch said they had just finished decorating their home after moving there 18 months ago. Kelly Birch's husband Wayne took this photo of the damage in their home ""We literally just finished doing everything to that house in November,"" she said. ""Every single thing downstairs is ruined, there's nothing salvageable."" This video can not be played One local saw a river of orange water rushing through the village She said she feared their possessions upstairs were becoming damaged because the house was damp after the flooding. ""It is full of mud and we don't know when that's going to be cleaned out,"" she said. Many people had been unable to return to get belongings and some neighbours had been unable to get their cars so could not go to work, she said. A Â£6.5m support package is available to people affected by flooding - ontop of payments of between Â£500 to Â£1,000per household - to help with the ""immediate cost of water damage and replacing belongings"" from Welsh Government. The Coal Authority said the ""blow out"" was caused by a blockage underground which led to the water breaking out to find the easiest path. The water rushed through the streets of Skewen Chief executive Lisa Pinney said work to cap the mine shaft would take three months but a new water management system will have to be built deep underground to divert the water, which will take at least six months. She said the authority was looking at ""every option"" to get as many people as possible back in their homes as quickly and safely as possible.

"Kiernan Wong is reunited with her mother after 16 months apart An eight-year-old girl and her father, wrongly quarantined under Scotland's new hotel isolation rules, have been reunited with the girl's mother after just one day in the UK. Chun Wong and his daughter Kiernan got the hugs they were desperate for with his wife Danielle on Tuesday after immigration delays kept them apart for 16 months. They were allowed to leave their hotel after an error was discovered. They will now isolate at home in Fife. Since Monday, all passengers arriving in Scotland on international flights have to enter ""managed isolation"". However, this does not apply to those coming from within the Common Travel Area, including the UK and Ireland. Girl's hotel quarantine puts hug with mum on hold Hancock 'happy to discuss' quarantine loophole Which countries trigger hotel quarantine? Mr Wong and Kiernan had arrived in Edinburgh from the US via Dublin. They had gone straight to a hotel at Edinburgh airport, following advice they had been given. Later that night they were told that as they had got a connecting flight from Ireland, they could instead isolate at home. The family was finally reunited on Tuesday afternoon. Chun Wong and his wife Danielle have been apart for more than a year Mrs Wong told BBC Scotland about the moment she got to hug Kiernan for the first time in more than a year. She said: ""I have never had that level of anxiety on my life. My legs were shaking so much and when she came out of the hotel she was scared to run to me. It was lovely and I didn't want to let her go."" Mr Wong added: ""I just told her to run to mummy. What a reunion to remember."" He said an official from the airport had come to see him in the hotel on Monday night. ""He said that it was an error on their part that since we came into the country through Dublin we didn't need to quarantine,"" he said. ""They were very apologetic. They said they screwed up, which I understand. It was day one and what process is perfect on day one?"" The new arrivals will still carry out self-testing on the second and eighth day, in line with the isolation rules. Chun and Kiernan Wong are now quarantining at home after arriving from the US via Dublin Travellers who are required to self-isolate in hotels have to pay Â£1,750 each, plus an extra fee for additional isolating guests. In Mr Wong's case that was a further Â£325 for Kiernan. The Scottish government said it was investigating why he was ""wrongly advised"" at the airport. But Mrs Wong said she had found it difficult to get the right information ahead of her family's arrival. She said: ""We believed because they came from the US and the Scottish rule says that is international travel regardless of whether it is a red list country or not, they have to quarantine."" She was advised to book a quarantine hotel but again found problems with the England-based system. She said that online forms had no prompts for Scotland. She added: ""It is confusing. I believe based on the regulations they should be at the hotel. I don't disagree with the stance Scotland is taking. ""We were willing and happy to do it. It's an appropriate measure but it needs to be made simpler for people coming here. ""I didn't expect this. But I am thankful because I get to see my daughter. I was frantically running to the shops this morning to stock up on food."" Danielle Wong has not seen her daughter for 16 months. Photo taken when the family were previously together Mr Wong and Kiernan have moved to Scotland to be with Mrs Wong who has been in the country since November 2019. A dual UK/US citizen, she is a front-line NHS worker, involved in addiction services. The family have been separated for 16 months, after the pandemic hit the immigration system. On Monday Mr Wong said it would be ""heartbreaking"" to be apart for another 10 days if they had to isolate in a hotel. He said his daughter was ""ecstatic, overjoyed and a little nervous"" as it had been more than a year since she had seen her mum. ""The last time she saw her she was seven and in April she'll be nine. Crazy."" On Tuesday Kiernan had two Christmases' worth of presents waiting for her at her new home. The family, in an earlier photograph, are now reunited A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We are looking into the circumstances that led to Mr Wong being wrongly advised at the airport that he needed to book a managed isolation package. This is a very new system, being implemented at pace, and some initial challenges are to be expected. ""We are following up with the travel management company to ensure a full refund is provided to Mr Wong."" An Edinburgh Airport spokesman wished the Wong family well as they settled into their new life in Scotland. However, he insisted that ""inaccurate advice"" had come from the government which was evidence of the ""confusion"" the policy had created. The spokesman added: ""It is a clear example of the loophole that our governments have created in action and they should work together to close it before this happens again."" All those arriving into Scotland directly from outside the Common Travel Area must pay to isolate for 10 days in a quarantine hotel. But Scotland's first minister has raised concerns about the risk of people spreading new Covid variants if they arrive at airports and ferry terminals elsewhere, then travel to Scotland on public transport. For example, in England only travellers from 33 ""red list"" countries must enter managed quarantine. UK minister Nadhim Zahawi claimed on Tuesday that the quarantine rollout had ""gone smoothly"" in England. Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""As for day one, it's gone reasonably well, we can always do better and, of course, work with Scotland."" He added: ""Our discussions with the Scottish government will lead to a better operating system. I think it would be unwise to close the border, we are one United Kingdom."" The guidelines for international travel are published on theScottish government website,external. A section of it says: ""You must also book and pay for managed isolation if you travel to Scotland from the Republic of Ireland, and have been in an acute risk country (a ""red list"" country) in the 10 days before your arrival. ""If you arrive in Scotland from within the Common Travel Area, but have been in a country not on the acute risk list in the 10 days before your arrival, you must self-isolate. ""There are some limited exemptions from isolation. You may still be required to self-isolate when you are not doing the essential activity the exemption allows.""

"Fake reviews for products sold on Amazon's Marketplace are being sold online ""in bulk"", according to Which? The consumer group found 10 websites selling fake reviews from Â£5 each and incentivising positive reviews in exchange for payment or free products. It suggested the firm was facing an ""uphill struggle"" against a ""widespread fake reviews industry"". An Amazon spokesman said: ""We remove fake reviews and take action against anyone involved in abuse."" The retail giant's Marketplace allows other retailers to sell their goods via the Amazon website. Which? identified websites offering review services for goods for sale on Amazon Marketplace that violated the firm's terms and conditions. These included ""packages"" of fake reviews available for sellers to buy for about Â£15 individually, as well as bulk packages starting at Â£620 for 50 reviews and going up to Â£8,000 for 1,000. The group also suggested that five of the businesses it looked at had more than 702,000 ""product reviewers"" on their books. Product reviewers are offered small payments ranging from a few pounds up to more than Â£10, alongside free or discounted products. They can even take part in ""loyalty schemes"" and earn themselves premium goods, from children's toys to exercise equipment. The websites Which? reviewed also offered advice on how to write reviews so as not to arouse Amazon's suspicion, and in some cases had criteria for reviewers to meet to qualify for rewards, it said. They included leaving reviews that were at least two sentences long, or including photos, for example. Be sceptical.This is probably your best weapon, especially if there is an unusually high number of reviews of one product compared with others in that category. Read and read again.Look for the same language used in multiple reviews. Brands you don't know.If you don't recognise the brand, check to see if it has its own legitimate-looking website, with clear contact details. Be wary of products with lots of pictures or videos.Sellers can incentivise fake reviewers to encourage people to add photos and videos. Read more on how to spot fake reviews here Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, called on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to look into the sale of fake reviews urgently. ""The regulator must crack down on bad actors and hold sites to account if they fail to keep their users safe,"" she said. ""If it is unable to do so, the government must urgently strengthen online consumer protections."" A previous investigation by the consumer group found dozens of Facebook groups with sellers offering refunds or commissions in exchange for fake, favourable reviews. It led to Facebook and eBay signing agreements with the CMA to ""better identify, investigate and respond to fake and misleading reviews"". But Ms Hitchins said: ""Amazon, and other online platforms, must do more to proactively prevent fake reviews infiltrating their sites so that consumers can trust the integrity of their reviews."" Amazon's murky world of one-star reviews 'Why I write fake online reviews' Fake online reviews under investigation by competition authority An Amazon spokesman pointed out that it worked with other tech firms to ""report bad actors"", but added that online retailers ""cannot do this alone"". He said that customers need to be able to trust the reviews they see online and that more enforcement powers should be given to regulators such as the CMA. As demand for online shopping grew at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic,the UK regulator launched a reviewinto how different websites detect and respond to fake and misleading reviews. The authority warned last May it would ""not hesitate"" to take action if sites were disobeying the law. That could include taking major retailers to court, although it did not name the specific websites it would be investigating.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says pupils will start to return to Scottish classrooms from next week But there will be no other changes to lockdown restrictions until ""at least the beginning of March"", she adds Schools in Wales begin the process of reopening on Monday; in Northern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March In England, PM Boris Johnson will set out a roadmap for easing lockdown - including opening schools - on 22 February About 1.7 million more people are being added to the shielding list in England after experts identified additional adults at serious risk of Covid-19 Covid deaths in the UK are falling, but overall fatalities are higher than usual for this time of year, according to Office for National Statistics data ONS testing shows Covid antibody levels are rising across all four UK nations The newly-appointed head of the World Trade Organization has told the BBC that vaccine protectionism must be overcome to solve the pandemic People arriving in England who have to stay at a quarantine hotel will have to pay an extra Â£1,200 if they test positive for Covid, the government says Globally, there have now been more than 109 million confirmed Covid cases and 2.4 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hamish Mackay We are wrapping up our coronavirus live page for the day, so here's a recap of today's main stories from the UK and around the world:  Thanks for joining us. Today's page has been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans and Lauren Turner.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The smallpox virus was able to be eradicated because the pustules it caused made it clear who was infected Government ministers and their scientific advisers argue that vaccination and new treatments will reduce the death rate and allow us to live with coronavirus, rather than constantly trying to fight it. Wiping Covid from the face of the Earth would, of course, be great given the death and destruction it has caused. But the only problem with that is that eradication has only been achieved with one virus before - smallpox in 1980. It took decades to get to that point, and scientists and governments were only able to achieve this because of a pretty unique set of circumstances. Firstly, the vaccine was so stable it didn't need to be refrigerated, and when it was given it was immediately obvious whether it worked or not - a pustule developed. It was also clear when someone was infected - a lab test was not needed, which was a huge advantage in trying to contain outbreaks. Covid, as we are all too well aware, iscompletely different. A priest in the Republic of Ireland has made ""takeaway ashes"" available for parishioners to administer at home on Ash Wednesday. Fr Brian Brady teamed up with a shop in Clonmany, County Donegal, to provide holy ashes in sauce containers. They are made out of burnt palms from Palm Sunday which have been blessed and left out for collection at the three churches in the parish. Covid-19 restrictions,externalin the country mean all church services must be conducted online. He told BBC News NI that he has been overwhelmed by the response. All 600 portions of ashes have beentaken away. People arriving in the UK now have to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining, and some must pay to self-isolate at a hotel. This is among the rules aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more resistant Covid strains from other countries. Rule-breakers face stricter penalties, including a prison sentence of up to 10 years for those who lie about having been in a banned ""red list"" country, such as Portugal. All incoming passengers must complete a passenger locator form in advance, including their departure country and UK address. They also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours before travelling, to be allowed entry. Travellers must thenself-isolate for 10 days. Here's your guide to the new rules. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Careful, cautious, gradual are the watchwords for the easing of lockdown in Scotland. That is to say we're not going to get back the everyday freedoms we once took for granted, quickly. The stay at home instruction will remain in place into March, possibly longer, with the anniversary of the first lockdown drawing nearer. A further reopening of schools is a priority but will not happen before 15 March. Easter holidays are unlikely to be allowed at home or abroad. The same will probably apply to overseas holidays this summer. Why all this caution when the vaccination programme is now progressing at pace? Because, at this stage, ministers remain nervous that opening up too quickly could mean losing control of the virus again in the wider population. They are desperate to avoid a third lockdown later in the year. A return to local protection levels should form part of the exit plan to be announced next week. But expect the restrictions associated with each level to be tighter than before, given this system was overwhelmed as autumn turned to winter last year.

The pandemic means many plans have been flipped on their head, including for the annual St Albans pancake race, which is going online for the first time. The Hertfordshire street race has been held in the streets for the past 21 years but this year is taking place virtually.

Grant Findley says he wanted to make the day special, after not seeing Lorraine Findley in almost a year due to Covid-19. Millions of people are using screens more than ever before. Many who are working or studying from home are staring at laptops and other devices all day. Most schoolchildren currently have no other way of accessing classes. For some, the new ways of working are taking a toll on their eyes. Itchiness, blurry vision and headaches - or eye strain - are among the common problems. More than a third (38%) of respondents toone survey, carried out for the charity Fight for Sight, said their eyesight had worsened since the start of the pandemic.Another survey,externalput the figure at 22%. Eyesight experts say people with persistent problems should visit an optician, which are open in lockdown. But there are things that many of us can do to keep our eyes healthy. We've got more on the four air passengers who were each fined Â£10,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a ""red-list"" country. They were stopped at border control by officials at Birmingham Airport. Under new rules, arrivals in England have to quarantine in hotels if they have been in a country deemed a high Covid risk in the last 10 days. The regulations came into effect on Monday and the four passengers had been fined by midday, a senior officer told a meeting of the West Midlands Strategic Policing and Crime Board. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Chris Todd said that in the same timeframe, the airport received six passengers who did declare travel from a red-list country, who were taken to a quarantine hotel. But of the offenders he says: ""There are some people who have attempted to hide their routes - butthat's not worked out."" Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News A team of scientists has used artificial intelligence (AI) to work out which animals the next coronavirus strain could come from. Dr Marcus Blagrove, a virologist from the University of Liverpool, UK, who was involved in the study, says: ""One way [new coronaviruses] are generated is through recombination between two existing coronaviruses - so two viruses infect the same cell and they recombine into a 'daughter' virus that would be an entirely new strain."" The researchers were able to plug biological evidence into an algorithm that taught a computer how to spot viruses and host species that were most likely to be a source of this recombination. The team ""asked"" their algorithm to find biological patterns to predict which mammals might be susceptible to known coronaviruses, which revealed links between 411 strains of coronavirus and 876 potential mammal species. The scientists say their findings could help to target the surveillance for new diseases - possibly helping prevent the next pandemic before its starts. You can read the full story here. Whoopi Goldberg says she is ""disappointed"" she willnot appear in the London stage version of her musical Sister Act, after its opening was postponed from this summer. Due to Covid restrictions, it will now run from 19 July to 28 August 2022, at the Eventim Apollo, Hammersmith. Goldberg was due to star as singer Deloris van Cartier, who hides in a convent, disguised as a nun, after witnessing a murder. She says: ""Sister Act is near and dear to my heart. And I'm disappointed."" Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online More people are being added to the shielding list in England, as health advisers say they now have a clearer picture of who is at a higher risk from Covid. About 1.7 million people are being added to the list, bringing the total to about 4 million. These people will soon get a letter explaining why they are being advised to shield. A combination of factors can contribute to a person's risk - those taken into consideration include: You can read more about shielding, and who's being added to the list, here. A total of 15,576,107 people have now received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK, the government'sdaily figures show.,external And in addition, 546,165 people have now had their second dose, the data says. A further 799 deaths have been recorded in the UK, according to the government'sdaily coronavirus figures.,external The number of people who died within 28 days of a positive Covid test is down 24% from 1,052 recorded last Tuesday. There have been 10,625 new cases recorded in the past 24 hours, down 14% from 12,364 last Tuesday. Nearly 4,000 Amazon workers were given incorrect coronavirus test results after an error. Private test results shared with NHS Test and Trace led to 3,853 notifications being wrongly issued on 13 February, the government confirmed. Employees were told by Amazon the day before they were negative for the virus, then given the opposite message by contact tracers. One test and trace call centre received more than 500 calls from employees. Here's the full story. Putting police officers in schools when they fully reopen could help prevent a surge in violent crime, the mayor of London says. Sadiq Khan says the Metropolitan Police will use school safety officers and targeted policing in areas of high violent crime to in a bid to avoid a post-lockdown spike. ""One of the things that we've been looking at, in those parts of the world where they've come out of lockdown sooner than us, is there has been, I'm afraid, a surge in violent crime,"" he says. The Labour mayor says other cities have seen a rise in crime after lockdowns were lifted and the key challenge is to avoid something similar in London. ""So for example, making sure when schools fully reopen, school safety officers are there, making sure that police are properly targeted in those areas in London where there's a concern,"" he says. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has finished giving a statement about a ""gradual and phased"" return to school for some pupils - here's the upshot: Nicola Sturgeon is at pains to warn people that the return of some pupils to school is not a ""return to greater normality"". The first minister warns the risk is that schools going back leads to parents socialising more - at the school gates, for example - or returning to the workplace rather than working from home. She adds that this ""will then jeopardise our ability to sustain even this limited return to school"" and make it less likely that more pupils can return soon. ""Please treat Mondayâs important milestone as a return to education for children only, and not as a return to greater normality for the rest of us,"" she says. Scotland's first minister has just announced that all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school will return to class from Monday. So how does that to compare to schools in the rest of the UK? InWales, three-to-seven-year-olds will start going back on Monday, along with some older children on vocational courses. InNorthern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March. InEngland, PM Boris Johnson has said pupils could return to school on 8 March""at the earliest"". He will set out a roadmap for easing lockdown - including opening schools - on 22 February. Asked again whether teachers will be prioritised in the next phase of vaccination rollout, Nicola Sturgeon says she will wait for scientific advice, which is being considered while the vaccine programme reaches the current priority list. ""It may be, I can't say this for sure right now, but it may be that occupations have more of a priority in this next phase given that the first phase has focused so much on clinical vulnerability,"" she says. The first minister says testing is very important for safety in schools and there will be additional funding available for local councils and schools. ""Let me be very clear here we want children back in school but we will not compromise the safety of children or those who work in schools,"" she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Viral videos of people having full-face ""hot wax"" treatments on TikTok have led to warnings from skin experts. They show softened resin covering subjects' face, mouth and neck - and partially penetrating their ears and nose - before being removed. A barber posting some of the most watched examples says it is beneficial. But the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) said: ""Attempting to wax inside your nose or ears is not recommended."" A UK-based skin specialist has also raised safety concerns about the risk of obstructed breathing. And one expert has suggested TikTok should add a warning. But it has indicated the videos are excluded from its community guidelines on dangerous behaviour because they show skilled professionals. They have gained barbershop Kapsalon Freedom, in the Netherlands, a following more than 800,000 TikTok users. One of its first attempts, posted in November, attracted nearly 84 million views, after Dutch media reports. It left the bottom portion of the customer's face exposed. But a more recent example, with more than 19 million views, shows the wax resin coming down over a man's chin and on to his neck. Sections pulled out of his ears and nose are held up to the camera to show dozens of hairs poking out of the now hardened substance. In this case, the wax runs around but not over his mouth. But other clips show fully covered faces, with cotton swabs used to create air passages. One video with more than one million views shows this full-face mask being removed from a woman's face and neck Strips of paper are also used to protect eyelashes and eyebrows. Barber Renaz Ismael has said face-waxing is common in the Middle East, where he was born. But he has taken it to a new level. ""I am the first person in the world who has done whole waxing,"" he told BBC News. ""It's not bad for your skin."" Mr Ismael is now using the hashtag #viral to promote the clips. And some have been set to music. He has also posted examples on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. But they have attracted much smaller audiences. Alex Echeverri, who works at John and Ginger salon, in West Sussex, raised safety concerns about others attempting the process. ""Our first consideration would be that it could cause suffocation,"" the beautician, who has more than two decades of experience in the industry, said. ""There's no control element to smothering the face with wax. ""And wax hardens. ""So it could harden in the airways and have to be surgically removed."" London-based Turkish barbershop Adam Grooming Atelier said: ""To wax such a large area of delicate skin is very irresponsible."" The BAD also raised concern the videos could lead to copycat incidents. ""Social-media platforms have the ability of quickly spreading health and beauty trends,"" Dr Anjali Mahto said. ""Waxing is a traumatic process for the skin, especially sensitive areas such as those found around the eyes. ""These areas can become inflamed and irritated. ""In some cases, tiny pimples or pus-filled bumps could develop as a result. ""This is known as folliculitis."" The British Skin Foundation also raised concern some of the clips showed the wax being used on what appear to be primary-school-age youngsters. ""Personally I would not recommend treating children,"" consultant dermatologist Dr Emma Wedgeworth said. ""It seems sensible to have a warning. ""There is a lot of misinformation and potentially harmful DIY beauty practices on TikTok and other social-media channels. ""And it would be good to see these more tightly regulated.""

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says pupils will start to return to Scottish classrooms from next week But there will be no other changes to lockdown restrictions until ""at least the beginning of March"", she adds Schools in Wales begin the process of reopening on Monday; in Northern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March In England, PM Boris Johnson will set out a roadmap for easing lockdown - including opening schools - on 22 February About 1.7 million more people are being added to the shielding list in England after experts identified additional adults at serious risk of Covid-19 Covid deaths in the UK are falling, but overall fatalities are higher than usual for this time of year, according to Office for National Statistics data ONS testing shows Covid antibody levels are rising across all four UK nations The newly-appointed head of the World Trade Organization has told the BBC that vaccine protectionism must be overcome to solve the pandemic People arriving in England who have to stay at a quarantine hotel will have to pay an extra Â£1,200 if they test positive for Covid, the government says Globally, there have now been more than 109 million confirmed Covid cases and 2.4 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hamish Mackay We are wrapping up our coronavirus live page for the day, so here's a recap of today's main stories from the UK and around the world:  Thanks for joining us. Today's page has been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans and Lauren Turner.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The smallpox virus was able to be eradicated because the pustules it caused made it clear who was infected Government ministers and their scientific advisers argue that vaccination and new treatments will reduce the death rate and allow us to live with coronavirus, rather than constantly trying to fight it. Wiping Covid from the face of the Earth would, of course, be great given the death and destruction it has caused. But the only problem with that is that eradication has only been achieved with one virus before - smallpox in 1980. It took decades to get to that point, and scientists and governments were only able to achieve this because of a pretty unique set of circumstances. Firstly, the vaccine was so stable it didn't need to be refrigerated, and when it was given it was immediately obvious whether it worked or not - a pustule developed. It was also clear when someone was infected - a lab test was not needed, which was a huge advantage in trying to contain outbreaks. Covid, as we are all too well aware, iscompletely different. A priest in the Republic of Ireland has made ""takeaway ashes"" available for parishioners to administer at home on Ash Wednesday. Fr Brian Brady teamed up with a shop in Clonmany, County Donegal, to provide holy ashes in sauce containers. They are made out of burnt palms from Palm Sunday which have been blessed and left out for collection at the three churches in the parish. Covid-19 restrictions,externalin the country mean all church services must be conducted online. He told BBC News NI that he has been overwhelmed by the response. All 600 portions of ashes have beentaken away. People arriving in the UK now have to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining, and some must pay to self-isolate at a hotel. This is among the rules aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more resistant Covid strains from other countries. Rule-breakers face stricter penalties, including a prison sentence of up to 10 years for those who lie about having been in a banned ""red list"" country, such as Portugal. All incoming passengers must complete a passenger locator form in advance, including their departure country and UK address. They also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours before travelling, to be allowed entry. Travellers must thenself-isolate for 10 days. Here's your guide to the new rules. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Careful, cautious, gradual are the watchwords for the easing of lockdown in Scotland. That is to say we're not going to get back the everyday freedoms we once took for granted, quickly. The stay at home instruction will remain in place into March, possibly longer, with the anniversary of the first lockdown drawing nearer. A further reopening of schools is a priority but will not happen before 15 March. Easter holidays are unlikely to be allowed at home or abroad. The same will probably apply to overseas holidays this summer. Why all this caution when the vaccination programme is now progressing at pace? Because, at this stage, ministers remain nervous that opening up too quickly could mean losing control of the virus again in the wider population. They are desperate to avoid a third lockdown later in the year. A return to local protection levels should form part of the exit plan to be announced next week. But expect the restrictions associated with each level to be tighter than before, given this system was overwhelmed as autumn turned to winter last year.

Many who are working or studying from home are staring at laptops and other devices all day. Most schoolchildren currently have no other way of accessing classes. For some, the new ways of working are taking a toll on their eyes. Itchiness, blurry vision and headaches - or eye strain - are among the common problems. More than a third (38%) of respondents toone survey, carried out for the charity Fight for Sight, said their eyesight had worsened since the start of the pandemic.Another survey,externalput the figure at 22%. Eyesight experts say people with persistent problems should visit an optician, which are open in lockdown. But there are things that many of us can do to keep our eyes healthy. We've got more on the four air passengers who were each fined Â£10,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a ""red-list"" country. They were stopped at border control by officials at Birmingham Airport. Under new rules, arrivals in England have to quarantine in hotels if they have been in a country deemed a high Covid risk in the last 10 days. The regulations came into effect on Monday and the four passengers had been fined by midday, a senior officer told a meeting of the West Midlands Strategic Policing and Crime Board. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Chris Todd said that in the same timeframe, the airport received six passengers who did declare travel from a red-list country, who were taken to a quarantine hotel. But of the offenders he says: ""There are some people who have attempted to hide their routes - butthat's not worked out."" Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News A team of scientists has used artificial intelligence (AI) to work out which animals the next coronavirus strain could come from. Dr Marcus Blagrove, a virologist from the University of Liverpool, UK, who was involved in the study, says: ""One way [new coronaviruses] are generated is through recombination between two existing coronaviruses - so two viruses infect the same cell and they recombine into a 'daughter' virus that would be an entirely new strain."" The researchers were able to plug biological evidence into an algorithm that taught a computer how to spot viruses and host species that were most likely to be a source of this recombination. The team ""asked"" their algorithm to find biological patterns to predict which mammals might be susceptible to known coronaviruses, which revealed links between 411 strains of coronavirus and 876 potential mammal species. The scientists say their findings could help to target the surveillance for new diseases - possibly helping prevent the next pandemic before its starts. You can read the full story here.

Putting police officers in schools when they fully reopen could help prevent a surge in violent crime, the mayor of London says. Sadiq Khan says the Metropolitan Police will use school safety officers and targeted policing in areas of high violent crime to in a bid to avoid a post-lockdown spike. ""One of the things that we've been looking at, in those parts of the world where they've come out of lockdown sooner than us, is there has been, I'm afraid, a surge in violent crime,"" he says. The Labour mayor says other cities have seen a rise in crime after lockdowns were lifted and the key challenge is to avoid something similar in London. ""So for example, making sure when schools fully reopen, school safety officers are there, making sure that police are properly targeted in those areas in London where there's a concern,"" he says. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has finished giving a statement about a ""gradual and phased"" return to school for some pupils - here's the upshot: Nicola Sturgeon is at pains to warn people that the return of some pupils to school is not a ""return to greater normality"". The first minister warns the risk is that schools going back leads to parents socialising more - at the school gates, for example - or returning to the workplace rather than working from home. She adds that this ""will then jeopardise our ability to sustain even this limited return to school"" and make it less likely that more pupils can return soon. ""Please treat Mondayâs important milestone as a return to education for children only, and not as a return to greater normality for the rest of us,"" she says. Scotland's first minister has just announced that all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school will return to class from Monday. So how does that to compare to schools in the rest of the UK? InWales, three-to-seven-year-olds will start going back on Monday, along with some older children on vocational courses. InNorthern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March. InEngland, PM Boris Johnson has said pupils could return to school on 8 March""at the earliest"". He will set out a roadmap for easing lockdown - including opening schools - on 22 February. Asked again whether teachers will be prioritised in the next phase of vaccination rollout, Nicola Sturgeon says she will wait for scientific advice, which is being considered while the vaccine programme reaches the current priority list. ""It may be, I can't say this for sure right now, but it may be that occupations have more of a priority in this next phase given that the first phase has focused so much on clinical vulnerability,"" she says. The first minister says testing is very important for safety in schools and there will be additional funding available for local councils and schools. ""Let me be very clear here we want children back in school but we will not compromise the safety of children or those who work in schools,"" she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since December Nicola Sturgeon is to announce whether some pupils will start to return to Scottish classrooms from next week in a statement at Holyrood. This could include children aged four to seven and secondary pupils required to carry out practical assignments. The first minister has said she was ""very keen"" to begin the phased return of younger pupils to schools. However, she warned this would not mark the start of a broader easing of the Covid-19 restrictions. The devolved nations have the powers to set their own coronavirus rules, and while they have made similar decisions during the crisis, they have moved at different speeds. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to set out a roadmap on 22 February for easing lockdown there - including the date schools can reopen to all pupils. He warned on Monday people must be ""optimistic but patient"" about the end of national restrictions,and that now was not the time to ""relax"". Primary schools in Wales begin the process of reopening next Monday, while in Northern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March. How soon will children return to school? 'No evidence' schools spread lots of Covid What can families do over the half-term break? In Scotland, ministers will examine the latest data and scientific advice on Tuesday morning, before their decision is announced to MSPs in the afternoon. Opposition parties have called for the Scottish government to set out more detail about its approach to eventually easing restrictions and lifting lockdown. Most school pupils have been learning remotely during 2021 as part of Scotland's ""stay at home"" lockdown. A small number of children, including those whose parents have key worker status, are allowed to attend. At her daily Covid-19 briefing on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said she was ""very, very, very keen to go ahead"" with plans for a phased return to the classroom. However, she said only between 5% and 8% of any school's roll should return. It had previously been indicated that children in P1 to P3 years and a limited number of secondary pupils who need practical resources to complete qualifications would return to schools from next Monday. Ministers will take a final decision about this, based on the latest data, at a meeting of the Scottish government's cabinet on Tuesday morning. They will also consider an ""indicative timetable"" for other pupils returning. However, Ms Sturgeon warned that it was unlikely that other lockdown restrictions would start to be eased, with schools the top priority. Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney will discuss plans with ministers on Tuesday morning before the Holyrood announcement She said: ""What is really important is that that's not seen as a trigger for people who are currently able to work from home to go back to work, or parents deciding to meet up with each other more. ""What was often the risk factor around schools is not transmission inside schools, its all the activity that takes place around schools."" The first minister also said there would be ""trade-offs"" over the coming months as the country eases out of lockdown, with schools and care home visiting ""the kind of things we focus on first as we try to get things back to normal"". MSPs will have the chance to question Ms Sturgeon following the statement, with opposition leaders pressing for more details on the government's future plans. Secondary pupils could face two-metre distance rule Scottish schools to start phased return this month Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was understandable that there were not ""specific dates set in stone"" for easing restrictions, but said it was important ministers provided more of a ""route map"" out of lockdown. He said: ""We need to know the triggers that will be in place for all school pupils to go back, for businesses to reopen - will we have a tiered approach or a national approach? ""These are the crucial points that businesses really need to be aware of so we can see our way out of this crisis."" Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said there was ""no point in setting dates"" for lifting lockdown due to uncertainty about vaccine supplies and new variants. He said: ""What the government can do is list the policies they want to bring in, the safety measures they want to bring in, and as those measures come in it can be easier for us to ease some restrictions and return back to normal."" Scottish Labour, meanwhile, has called for supply teachers to be given a greater role in delivering online learning, saying they had been ""forgotten"" in Education Secretary John Swinney's latest plans. Education spokesman Iain Gray said: ""Many supply teachers face financial hardship and are unable to rely on furlough funds - this is unacceptable. It's time for John Swinney to bring our supply teachers in from the cold and get them to work."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"This video can not be played Efforts to improve landscapes have led to a ""sandbag effect"", the National Trust says A scheme to try to hold back floodwater is bidding for Â£800,000 to continue its work. The Upper Conwy project aims to slow water from the uplands to cut flooding lower down the valley, in towns including Llanrwst. It is the first time in Wales anyone has tried to tackle the problem by looking at an entire river catchment. The project is a partnership between the National Trust, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and landowners. So far, it has involved blocking drainage ditches in blanket bog to make ground wetter so it will hold more water for longer. Trees have also been planted on riverbanks to stop surface water from running into rivers so quickly and gravel and boulders have been put back into them to make the water flow more slowly. Rail line reopens after Â£2.2m flood repairs Residents discuss flood concerns after Storm Ciara Historic hotel suffers after heavy rain A bid for another Â£800,000 of Welsh Government funds is being made to continue the work. NRW's north-west Wales operations manager, Euros Jones, said: ""The mountains used to act as a sponge, soaking up the water and supporting wildlife. ""We want to work with landowners to restore that system, so the mountains can once again work like a sponge rather than like a slate roof."" He said there was a need for ""harder defences"" further down the valley. ""But anything we can do in the mountains to slow that flow is a good thing. ""But it needs to be done at scale - the more places the better."" Work is being done to slow water in the upper Conwy Valley to reduce water entering the River Conwy The scheme is being done across the entire catchment of the River Conwy. Mr Jones added: ""It won't deal with the whole flooding problem, but it can hopefully bring the water levels down just enough to add some resilience to our defences."" The Conwy catchment area covers 222 sq miles (574 sq km), an area the size of the Isle of Man. The Upper Conwy project started as a smaller plan to block drainage ditches in moorland near Betws-y-Coed, a place called the Migneint. More than 30,000 small dams have been built to make the blanket bog wetter and officials say the success of that led them to expand the project. Llanrwst is among places that have been hit by floods in the Conwy Valley Dewi Davies, a project manager from the National Trust, said: ""In the past, there was a tendency to try to improve the landscape, to try to drain wet areas and to use rivers to carry the water away as quickly as possible."" Mr Davies said work had already been successful in slowing the River Machno before it entered the Conwy. ""The river was almost like a canal,"" he said. ""The banks and the bed were almost square and it had been dredged to the point where all it did was to shift the water downstream. ""Now it flows more slowly. It's starting to meander. What we've achieved here is small in scale, but it shows what can be done across the catchment."" He also said the work could be improving wildlife habitats: ""You notice the fish more, darting between the boulders we put back in the channel.  More fish helps other wildlife, like otters."" It is hoped slowing down the water could help to reduce flooding WINTER LOCKDOWN GETTING YOU DOWN? :6 Top tips for looking after your mental health TRY SOME NEW RELAXATION TECHNIQUES:What is mindfulness and how can you achieve it?
