"The menu was owned by Second Officer Charles Lightoller, the highest ranking surviving officer from the Titanic A menu of the first meal ever served aboard the Titanic has fetched Â£100,000 at auction. The lunch, including consommÃ© mirrette, sweetbreads and spring lamb, was served to officers on the first day of sea trials on 2 April 1912. It belonged to Second Officer Charles Lightoller, the most senior crew member to survive, who gave it to his wife as he left Southampton on 10 April 1912. Auctioneer Alan Aldridge said it was ""one of the rarest menus in existence"". It was sold to a British collector at the auction at Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes, Wiltshire on Saturday. A key to the doomed vessel's chart room sold to a collector from Texas for Â£78,000, while a drowned steward's badge sold for Â£57,000. The badge belonged to a Thomas Mullen and was found with his body. Andrew Aldridge, from the firm, said: ""We are delighted with the results of the auction and think the rarity of the objects is reflected in the prices which illustrates the ongoing fascination with the story of the Titanic."" He said items had been snapped up by collectors in ""all four corners of the globe"". On 2 April, on Titanic's first day of sea trials, officers and crew enjoyed their first meal served in the main dining saloon before being joined by the passengers. The menu was given to Charles Lightoller's wife as a souvenir as he departed from Southampton on 10 April 1912 Mr Aldridge said it was believed only one other example of a 2 April menu had survived, which belonged to Titanic's Fifth Officer Harold Lowe. ""He wrote a notation on the bottom 'this is first meal ever served on board' however the bottom of the Lowe menu was removed,"" he said. ""So this [the Charles Lightoller menu] is believed to be the only complete example and is one of the most important examples of its type in existence today."" The Lowe menu sold at auction for Â£28,000 in 2004.

"Ten shots were fired at the Palestinian professor early on Saturday morning A Palestinian professor and member of the Hamas militant organisation has been killed in a drive-by shooting on the streets of the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. The family of Fadi al-Batsh, 35, has accused Israel's spy agency Mossad of being behind his killing on Saturday. Malaysian officials said the suspects are believed to have links to a foreign intelligence agency. Israeli officials have not yet commented on the killing. Hamas has accused Israel of conducting assassinations of its experts abroad in the past, although Mossad has never confirmed such operations. A recent case involvedthe killing of a Tunisian national who was believed to be a Hamas drone expert in 2016. Who are Hamas? A simple guide to the Gaza conflict Fadi al-Batsh was walking from his residence to a nearby mosque at about 0600 on Saturday (2300 GMT Friday) when he came under attack. Two gunmen on a motorbike fired 10 shots, killing him on the spot, Kuala Lumpur police chief Mazlan Lazim said. ""Preliminary investigations found four gunshot wounds on the victim's body. Two bullet slugs were found at the scene of the incident,"" he added in a statement. The police chief said that CCTV footage showed the suspects, who later fled the scene, had waited about 20 minutes in the area before attacking Mr Batsh. ""We believe the lecturer was their target because two other individuals walked by the place earlier unharmed."" Hamas said the victim, a research scientist who specialised in energy issues, was one of its members Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid, quoted by state news agency Bernama, said the victim had links to a foreign intelligence organisation and was active in pro-Palestinian non-governmental organisations. The suspects are believed to be Caucasians who also have ties to a foreign intelligence service, Mr Zahid told reporters. Mr Batsh, who had lived in Malaysia for several years, was a lecturer in electrical engineering. Hamas said one of its members had been ""assassinated"", describing him as a ""martyr"" - a term it usually uses for people killed by Israeli forces. However, it stopped short of directly accusing Israel of the killing. Israel is believed to have assassinated members of militant groups abroad in the past. In 1997, Mossad agents conducted a failed bid to kill Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal in Jordan by spraying poison into his ear. The holiday village run by spies The spy agency is also believed to have been behind the 2010 murder of top Hamas militant Mahmud al-Mabhuh, who died in a Dubai hotel. Israel has never confirmed or denied involvement in his killing.

"Ten years ago I attempted to live plastic-free. With the government pledging to crack down on plastic waste, will it be any easier a decade on? Summer 2008 was a warm one. I know that because my kitchen gently hummed with the sour scent of plastic milk bottles and yoghurt cartons. During that July, I saved all 603 plastic items my husband, toddler and I generated so I could compare withan experimental month ""off"" plastic,externalin the August that followed. The project was triggered by a BBC report onplastic pollution in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,external, which left me wondering if it was possible to eliminate disposable plastic from normal daily life. The answer was: ""not quite"". But that August we reduced our plastic tally to just 116 items, of which 63 were disposable nappies. Plastic fantastic: How it changed the world Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Six simple ways to cut back on plastic UK faces build-up of plastic waste Ten years later, nappies are no longer in my shopping trolley. It's now laden with the full range of groceries consumed by a family with two school-age children. Much of it is packed in plastic - and it's easy to see why: this lightweight, durable material keeps food fresh and is easy to move and store. But with avoiding disposable plastic high on many people's to-do lists, I decided to rerun my 2008 experiment. Would spending a month without buying anything wrapped in, or containing, plastic be any easier now? I tackle our breakfast routine first. We awake to milk on the doorstep, in glass bottles, just like in my childhood, albeit ordered online rather than via handwritten note. The kids are amused by the novelty and I overhear my eight-year-old daughter telling a friend: ""They appear outside our house overnight."" Milk doorstep delivery new subscriptions have risen since the start of January It seems we are not alone in making the switch in 2018. MÃ¼ller-owned delivery company Milk & More says it has had 10,000 new online customers signing up since 1 January, of which 90% are ordering milk in glass bottles. It comes despite a long term downward trend for milk deliveries which last year accounted for just 3% by volume of the milk sold - down from 7% in 2008. Delivered milk is more costly: a glass doorstep pint is around 81p, whereas a four-pint supermarket bottle is about Â£1.10. But not having to pick up milk has already cut my ""top-up"" trips to the local convenience store. My homemade bagels won't win any prizes Milk bottles are one of the most widely and easily-recycled pieces of plastic packaging. At the other end of the recyclability scale are plastic films such as bags, pouches and peelable lids which make up more than a quarter of plastic household waste. As a family we are heavily reliant at breakfast time on bags of bagels and boxes of cereals with plastic inners. This prompts me to try making bagels for the first time in my life - not as hard as you might think. But as for cereals, my suggestion to the rest of the family that we all eat porridge for a month (boxes of oats have no liners) goes down like a gruel-filled balloon. Then I find a new ""zero waste"" shop a couple of miles away that has versions of our usual options but loose in bins for scooping into our own containers. Family breakfast truce achieved. There's no avoiding the fact that visiting separate shops for separate goods takes longer than my normal one-hit blitz at the supermarket. So I decide to give my usual routine a try - but on my new avoid-plastic-at-all-costs rule. Attempting to shop based on packaging status alone leads to some combinations worthy of Ready Steady Cook: leeks, carrots, a giant mango and a box of eggs. Films and nets are not currently easily recycled Bags of salad are out, as is most pasta and rice. Tinned food is easier although cans of acidic foods such as tomatoes, or even fizzy drinks, have a plastic lining to stop the contents reacting with the metal. Many glass jars have plastic lids or labels so items such as chocolate hazelnut spread are off the menu too (sorry kids) but I take a risk with some pasta sauces, wondering whether the synthetic rubber lining to the lids counts as plastic. I'm reminded how heavy glass, tins and cardboard are - and, of course, have their own environmental impact - as I heave my trolley to the checkout. Here, there is a major change since my original challenge. Single-use carrier bags are no longer dished out freely, since 2015 in England (and earlier in other parts of the UK) they cost at least 5p. The levy has slashed usage by 83%, according to government figures. Several chains are now dropping the 5p bags altogether and only selling ""bags for life"". Like so many shoppers, I'd brought my own reusable bags, so no rule-breaking there. But the food on the shelves doesn't seem any less plastic-wrapped than a decade ago. Retailers say shrink-wrapping fish and meat has cut the amount of plastic used and prolongs shelf life However, Iain Ferguson, environment manager at the Co-op says food retailers have made many changes, they just may not be immediately visible. ""In the past 10 years a lot of work has gone into making plastic films thinner and plastic bottles lighter,"" he says. Modifications such as removing polystyrene from pizza bases, switching tomato punnets to cardboard and packing meat in one type of plastic rather than layers of differing types are other moves the Co-op has made. ""Our customers say they want no plastic but customers also buy in plastic because they want the convenience,"" Mr Ferguson says. ""The best thing we can do is to make it easier to recycle."" All the major supermarkets insist they havemade or are making significant changesand frozen food retailer Iceland hasannounced it will do away with plastic altogether,externalfor its own brand products by 2023. Back to the pressing issue of family teatime, I grab a cardboard box of fish-fingers, some naked broccoli and loose potatoes. Giant mango for pudding. Half term and we travel from London to Cornwall. Unfortunately I forget my reusable cup and water bottle and end up with a pile of junk from the journey down, adding to the21 million water bottles,externaland6.8 million coffee cups,externalthe UK gets through each day. Avril Sainsbury of Bude Cleaner Seas says attitudes to plastic litter are changing I turn to social media for a nudge back on track. Online campaigning has increased massively since 2008 and hashtags such as #oneless, #nomoresingleuse and #strawssuck, are all used to promote the idea that small changes can create a big effect. Among them is my children's favourite -#2minutebeachclean,externalwhich started in the north Cornish seaside resort of Bude in 2014. Known for its long sandy beaches and rolling surf, the town sees the effects of plastic pollution every day, especially after a storm. ""It can feel overwhelming,"" says Avril Sainsbury of water quality projectBude Cleaner Seas,externalas we survey Crooklets Beach together. ""You will see everything that you'll find in your home, disposable lighters, bottles, caps, seals - to ghost nets, which are [abandoned] fishing nets."" But she says attitudes to marine litter are changing and people are now more likely to say ""gosh I'll help you"" if they see a beach clean taking place. Micro plastics mingle with the sand on Crooklets Beach in Bude I'm feeling guilty about those water bottles and coffee cups from the journey but Bude is a practical place. Local teacher Deb Rosser has come up with a practical solution. ""You can go to anywhere in Bude - that can be cafes, shops and accommodation providers - and they will refill your bottle for free with pure Cornish tap water,"" says Deb, describing herRefill Bude,externalconcept which has spread nationwide since starting in 2014. Sales of branded Refill Bude cups and bottles have raised more than Â£5,000 for Bude Sea Pool There are now 7,800 refill points around the UK and I find a new one in Boscastle National Trust Cafe, near where we are staying. The manager says the cafe has also just swapped from cardboard cups and plates to crockery. No excuse then for plastic-free fails while we're on holiday. Back at home and some plastic-packed toiletries run out this week. I purchase a bamboo toothbrush (admittedly with nylon bristles), and get to grips with a shampoo bar instead of a bottle. Our stock of toilet paper holds out, just, but I research a paper-wrapped alternative that can be delivered. At the end of the month, we have not managed to live entirely plastic-free but we have cut down on our normal consumption. It's taken a lot more time but has not necessarily been more expensive as it's forced me to limit what I buy. My 48-item plastic tally for the month The tally for the month comes to 48 plastic items including: Five ham packets - several packed lunch fails Three cereal inners Two chicken packs A polystyrene pizza base Chocolate mini eggs - they were foil wrapped but in a plastic net Two jelly wrappers A sachet of yeast from making those bagels Once nappies are taken out of the equation, it's not too different from the 53 items I gathered during my experiment 10 years ago. Yet looking back on my normal consumption in 2008, there have been big changes. Then, I used 36 disposable carrier bags a month, got through 23 polystyrene coffee cups at work and a plastic water bottle every other day. Now, my office has a stock of mugs, and taking a reusable bag and water bottle everywhere with me has become second nature. The same can't be said for plastic-free food shopping. While I will keep some of my swaps (including the milk delivery) I do find it currently impractical to keep my family fed without buying any plastic at all. However, with changes coming thick and fast - plastic-free teabags, the deposit return scheme, stores encouraging customers to bring their own containers - I may not need to wait 10 more years to give it another try.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Man Utd 2-1 Tottenham Ander Herrera's winner sent Manchester United into a record-equalling 20th FA Cup final and condemned Tottenham to their eighth successive defeat at this stage of the competition. Spurs started at a ferocious pace and fully deserved the early lead they took after only 11 minutes when Dele Alli slid home a finish from Christian Eriksen's cross after Davinson Sanchez's long pass opened up Manchester United's defence. Jose Mourinho's side survived the siege and levelled on 24 minutes, Wembley specialist Alexis Sanchez rising to direct an athletic header across Spurs keeper Michel Vorm from Paul Pogba's perfect cross for his eighth goal in eight appearances at the stadium. Eric Dier's deflected shot hit the post on the stroke of half-time but Spurs had lost vital momentum and Herrera's crisp low finish just after the hour set up an FA Cup final date for United with Chelsea or Southampton on 19 May. It left Spurs suffering more FA Cup semi-final pain and with a losing sequence stretching back to their win in the last four against Arsenal here in 1991 - and Pochettino still without a trophy after four seasons at the club. How the players rated Podcast: Man Utd into FA Cup final, Sunderland relegated Man Utd v Tottenham: How you rated the players Analysis: 'Tottenham will be accused of choking until they prove otherwise' United have now reached their 29th major domestic cup final, more than any other side in English football Manchester United's style has been criticised on a number of levels this season - but the character and resilience in Jose Mourinho's side is beyond question. In recent weeks alone, they have come from behind to beat Chelsea at Old Trafford then recovered from 2-0 deficits to win at Crystal Palace and, most notably, at Premier League champions Manchester City. And they needed to call on all those reserves in the face of an opening salvo from Spurs that was fierce in its intensity and pressing, as well as bringing that opening goal from Dele Alli. United held on, with moments of good fortune, and grasped the lifeline that came with a cheap concession of possession from Spurs, a perfect cross from Paul Pogba and an athletic header from Sanchez to beat Michel Vorm in the 24th minute. Spurs were still left cursing their luck when Eric Dier's shot deflected off Chris Smalling to hit the foot of the post - and when ruthlessness and a clinical edge was required it was United who provided it. It came courtesy of Ander Herrera's low finish and gave United an advantage they never seriously looked like relinquishing. Mourinho, now on course for another trophy after lifting the League Cup and Europa League in his first season at Manchester United last term, prides himself on his ability to inject the strengths winners require into his players. And his Manchester United players showed that at Wembley. Tottenham have not won an FA Cup semi-final since 1991 Tottenham must wonder when they will ever win another FA Cup semi-final - or indeed be rewarded with a trophy for all the obvious fine work manager Mauricio Pochettino has done. This was their eighth successive FA Cup semi-final defeat, the longest sequence of losses in the history of the competition and stretching back to the victory over Arsenal at the old Wembley in 1991. And as expectations rise and Pochettino's side progresses, so those losses get more painful and this will feel as bad as any others coming after the way they also lost here to Chelsea 12 months ago. The usual ""Spursy"" argument will be made - the team that somehow never gets across the line - and there will come a point when this undoubtedly talented side must back up the bouquets it gets with actual trophies, the true currency of success. Pochettino's side flew out of the blocks but simply could not put United away and there was an air of desperation and frustration about their work once Herrera put Mourinho's side in front and time started to ebb away. Questions must also be asked of Pochettino's decision to persist with Michel Vorm in goal and keep first-choice Hugo Lloris on the bench. It is harsh to place defeat solely at Vorm's door but he certainly could have done better with Herrera's winner. Harry Kane could not find his usual sure touch and Son Heung-min, superb this season, had one of those days when nothing went right. The wait goes on without a trophy for both Spurs and Pochettino, who has now had four full seasons at the club. It is something they must change soon to shed the tag of the team that always falters with the finishing line in sight. This video can not be played FA Cup semi-final 2018: Sanchez levels for Man Utd Alexis Sanchez has struggled to make a serious impact since his January switch from Arsenal to Manchester United - but the Chilean showed perfect timing to demonstrate his class on the Wembley stage he loves. When he showed great strength and athleticism to direct Pogba's cross back across Vorm for that vital equaliser, it was Sanchez's eighth goal for club and country at Wembley in eight appearances. Sanchez is also still on course for a third FA Cup win, having won the trophy twice previously at Arsenal, scoring in victorious finals against Aston Villa and Chelsea. Here, this was Sanchez at his best - busy, dangerous, revelling in the fight and making the crucial contribution that has become his Wembley trademark. Eyebrows were raised when  Mourinho ignored the pace of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford in his starting line-up - but he was rewarded with the industry of Jesse Lingard, Romelu Lukaku and Sanchez  - with the latter delivering a man-of-the-match performance. Alexis Sanchez has scored eight goals in his eight appearances at Wembley for club and country, including six goals in five FA Cup matches Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho,speaking to BBC Sport:""We deserve it. If we split the match into periods we were the best team for many of these periods. Even when they had the ball when we were winning we were totally in control. ""We lost control after the 1-0. At half-time we spoke - we came back late for the second half because we spoke a lot - and organised ourselves. ""We should ask ourselves why there are too many critics on all of us? We can finish second [in the Premier League] by getting six points. To do that with all the fantastic teams we play against will be an achievement for a club that couldn't do it for a few years now. ""And it will be a fourth final in three years. So, maybe too much criticism."" Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino,speaking to BBC Sport:""I think every defeat is bad. It's difficult to accept but of course we are disappointed we are out and cannot achieve the final. ""We competed but not enough to win. We dominated the first half and were much better than Manchester United. ""United defended very well and so deep. We are disappointed because we are so close. We need to think, move on, finish the season and try to finish in the top four. ""I think we need to understand where we have come from. It's easy to talk about winning trophies. ""To win a trophy when you face a side like Manchester United, Chelsea or Manchester City is not easy. But the most important thing is we are able to compete."" The Red Devils have reached the FA Cup final in two of the last three seasons, having failed to reach the showpiece in eight consecutive seasons previously. Tottenham have not lost a single Premier League game in which they have led this season, but have now been eliminated from their three other competitions this season in games in which they took the lead (2-3 v West Ham in the League Cup, 1-2 v Juventus in the Champions League). Spurs also extended their record run of consecutive FA Cup semi-final defeats to eight, last winning one in 1991. Romelu Lukaku has been directly involved in 14 goals in his last 12 FA Cup appearances (12 goals, two assists), including seven in five for Manchester United. Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has now recorded 12 assists in all competitions this season - twice as many as he registered last season. Christian Eriksen has had a hand in 10 goals in his last six FA Cup appearances for Spurs (three goals, seven assists). Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has scored in each of his last two FA Cup games, as many as he had in his previous 15 in the competition. Jose Mourinho has reached his sixth major domestic final in England (two FA Cup, four League Cup), winning each of his previous five.

"Dean Tate was last seen in the Somerset and Dorset pub late on February 24 Police searching for a man last seen two months ago have found a body. Dean Tate, 40, from Highbridge, Somerset, was reported missing from Burnham-on-Sea during the early hours of February 24. He was last seen in a pub on Pier Streetand specialist teams searched for him on both land and in water. Police said a member of the public contacted them on Saturday to report they had discovered a body on an island in the Bristol Channel. The remains have not been formally identified but police believe they are Mr Tate's.

"Police were called to a David Lloyd fitness club at 09:45 BST after reports of a child drowning in a pool A three-year-old boy has died while swimming at a pool in Leeds. Police were called to Tongue Lane at about 09:45 BST after reports of a child drowning in a pool at a David Lloyd fitness club in the Moortown area of the city. The boy was taken by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary accompanied by his mother but was later confirmed dead. West Yorkshire Police said they believed his death was not suspicious and was a ""tragic accident"". In a statement, the club said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened"" and its thoughts were ""very much with the boy's family at this very sad time"". ""The child was swimming with his family in our indoor pool at the time of the incident,"" the statement continued. ""He was found unconscious just after 9.30am this morning, and was rescued from the water by one of our team. ""Our club teams are fully trained to deal with incidents of this nature, and they immediately administered CPR and the emergency services were called."" The club said it was closing for the rest of the day following the death and would be making no further comment. David Lloyd apologised to customers after it shut its club following the boy's death Det Insp James Entwistle said: ""While there is nothing to suggest that the death was suspicious, we do have a duty to investigate the circumstances of what has happened. ""We understand there were a number of people in the pool at the time who have left the area prior to police arriving at the scene.

"Judah Adunbi is a founding member of an independent group set up to improve relations between the police and the Afro-Caribbean community A former race relations advisor to the police has been charged with a racially aggravated offence. Judah Adunbi, 64, was arrested at his Bristol home on 18 April and will appear in court next month. Mr Adunbi was hit in the face with a Taser in January 2017. PC Claire Boddie, of Avon and Somerset Police, is due in court on Monday for a pre-trial hearing in relation to that case. She denies a charge of common assault. Mr Adunbi of Easton, Bristol, was charged with a racially aggravated public order offence following an incident at a betting shop in Stapleton Road, Bristol, on 29 March. He has been released on conditional bail to appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court on 22 May. PC Claire Boddie denies a charge of common assault Mr Adunbi was allegedly hit in the face by an officer using an electric stun weapon in Colston Road, Easton, Bristol. A video of the alleged incident on 14 January 2017 was widely shared at the time. A court summons was issued following an investigation by the police watchdog to whom Avon and Somerset Police voluntarily referred itself. The Independent Police Complaints Commission, as it was known at the time, then passed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service, which issued the summons to PC Boddie. She is due at Bristol Magistrates' Court for a pre-trial hearing after District Judge David Taylor ruled that ""given the nature of the case, particularly the circumstances of the case"" it should be heard outside the Avon and Somerset Police force area.

"This video can not be played The Orcas were seen between Gourock and Dunoon A pod of killer whales - including at least one calf - has been spotted in the River Clyde. The mammals, which have been dubbed ""urban Orcas"" by one expert, have been filmed near Gourock and Dunoon. David Nairn, of Clyde Porpoise marine mammal project, told the BBC Scotland website that they are regularly seen near Arran in the Firth of Clyde. However, they have not been regular visitors to the upper Clyde for many years. Chris Denovan said he saw up to six of the mammals whenhe filmed them in water near Dunoon,externalearlier this week. They were also spotted by Lindsay Moss during a Western Ferries trip between Gourock and Dunoon on Saturday afternoon. Chris Denovan said he saw up to six of the mammals in water near Dunoon Mr Nairn saidher video footage,externalclearly shows at least one calf, which was being taught to eat by other members of the pod. He said they were likely to have been attracted to the Clyde by its abundance of food - porpoises and seals. ""It's absolutely fantastic for the Clyde,"" he said. ""It's just so exciting. Everyone's on the beach with binoculars"". However, he said there were some concerns about the effect aJoint Warrior military exercisecould have on the pod. He said he had alerted Belfast Coastguard as well as Faslane naval base to the presence of the whales.

"Reported rapes of children had more than doubled in India between 2012 and 2016 India's Cabinet has approved the introduction of the death penalty for those who rape children, amid uproar over a series of high-profile cases. The change to the country's penal code applies to those convicted of raping a child under the age of 12. There have been nationwide protests in recent weeks over the gang rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl. The government has come under fire for not doing enough to prevent sexual-assault cases, many involving children. A number of serious crimes in India carry the death penalty, but raping a child was not among them until now. Nearly 19,000 cases were registered in India in 2016 - more than 50 each day. What do parents tell their children about rape? The hunger striker demanding death for rapists Why India's rape crisis shows no signs of abating The executive order was cleared at a special cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It allows capital punishment for anyone convicted of raping children under the age of 12. Minimum prison sentences for rape against girls under the age of 16 and women have also been raised. According to Reuters, which has seen a copy of the order, there was no mention of boys or men. Two recent rape cases have shocked the nation. Protests erupted earlier this month after police released horrific details ofthe rape of an eight-year-old Muslim girl by Hindu men in Kathua, in Indian-administered Kashmir in January. Anger has also been mounting after a member of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was accused last week overthe rape of a 16-year-old girl in northern Uttar Pradesh state. India's poor record of dealing with sexual violence came to the fore after the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus. This led to huge protests and changes to the country's rape laws. But sexual attacks against women and children have since continued to be reported across the country. Executions are rarely carried out in India, with just three recorded in the last decade. The four men convicted in the Delhi bus case were sentenced to death, though this has not yet been carried out. The judge in that case said it fell into ""the rarest of rare category"" which justifies capital punishment in India. India's penal code, according to the Hindustan Times, had already prescribed the death penalty for gang rape. Hanging is the main method of execution.A man convicted of financing the deadly 1993 Mumbai bombings was the last person to be executed in India - in 2015.

"Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) members have narrowly rejected plans to widen the organisation's remit to be the voice of all beer, cider and perry drinkers. The proposal, which could have seen Camra representing all beer drinkers - not just real ale -  will not go ahead. The organisation has however voted to target its ""education and training"" at all types of drinker. Camra's chairman said the membership had ""made its views clear"". Almost 18,000 members voted online and at Camra's AGM in Coventry on Saturday. Five othernew objectives,externalwere voted through, after Camra's leadership recommended changesfollowing a ""root-and-branch review"",external. They included: To play a leading role in the provision of information, education, and training to all those with an interest in beer, cider, and perry of any type To promote and protect pubs and clubs as social centres as part of the UK's cultural heritage To increase recognition of the benefits of responsible, moderate social drinking. But the motion ""to act as the voice and represent the interests of all pub goers and beer, cider and perry drinkers"" failed to pass after receiving 72% of the votes. It needed the support of 75% of voting members to succeed. Real ale usually comes from a hand pump and is conditioned in a cask, giving it a fuller flavour than other beers, say supporters. National pub campaigner, and former Liberal Democrat MP, Greg Mulholland was one of those who opposed the changes. He wrote on his Facebook page: ""If the revitalisation plans go through, Camra will not be a campaign for anything but a vague 'we like any 'nice' beer and cider club'."" The vote followed Camra's largest ever consultation of its members. More than 25,000 members filled in surveys and attended consultation meetings across the country. Camra chairman Colin Valentine said: ""We were determined to give every single member the right to have the final say on the recommendations by voting on the changes to the Articles of Association. The membership has taken advantage of that right and made its views clear. ""We're delighted that all but one of the Special Resolutions was approved, which shows the majority of members agreed with the consultation findings that Camra needs to change to remain a relevant and effective campaigning organisation."" He added: ""We need to do all we can to reassure all members that our core campaigning objectives remain focussed on real ale, cider and perry as ever.""

"Kim Jong-un says the North has achieved nuclear ""weaponisation"" North Korea's announcement that it is halting nuclear and missile tests has received a broad international welcome. Leader Kim Jong-un said further tests were not needed, as the North had demonstrated it had nuclear weapons. Donald Trump described the move as ""good news"" for the world, and South Korea said it was meaningful progress. The EU said it was ""positive"", but called for complete denuclearisation. North Korea is preparing for historic summits with South Korea and the US. Early on Saturday Kim Jong-un said: ""From 21 April, North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles."" This video can not be played The news was announced on North Korean state TV The surprise announcement, relayed by the country's KCNA news agency, also said a test site would be shut down. Welcoming it on Twitter, Mr Trump said he was looking forward to a face-to-face meeting with Mr Kim in June. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are due to meet next week for the first inter-Korean summit in over a decade. Mr Moon's office said the North's decision would ""contribute to creating a very positive environment for the success of the upcoming South-North summit and North-United States summit."" European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said it was a ""long sought-after step"" that should lead to ""verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation"". The call was echoed by the UK. The statement from the British government added: ""We hope this indicates an effort to negotiate in good faith."" North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's nuclear programme explained Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? The US and its allies have been pushing Pyongyang to abandon nuclear weapons. China, North Korea's main backer, said it believed the move would ""help ameliorate the situation on the peninsula"". Russia's foreign ministry also welcomed it, but called on the US and South Korea to reduce their military activity in the region. In his statement, Mr Kim said it was no longer necessary to conduct missile tests because ""nuclear weaponisation"" had been achieved. This echoes a previous statement made during a New Year address in whichMr Kim declared his nuclear and ballistic missile programmes completed. Although Pyongyang said it would abolish its nuclear test site, there is no indication it is planning to get rid of its existing weapons. The decision to halt missile tests is also aimed at pursuing economic growth, according to KCNA. Mr Kim reportedly pledged to ""concentrate all efforts"" on developing a socialist economy during Friday's meeting. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? By Ankit Panda, senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists These concessions from North Korea have come before the two anticipated summits with the US and South Korea. One may wonder why Mr Kim should give up so much in advance instead of hanging on to a nuclear test-ban and an ICBM moratorium as aces up his sleeve. The answer is simple: a summit with a US president is enough of a prize in itself. For Mr Kim, it's something that neither his grandfather nor his father could attain. What North Korea loses by demolishing its nuclear test site and submitting to a unilateral moratorium on ICBM launches is entirely tolerable compared with what Mr Kim gains by sitting alongside President Trump. Read Ankit Panda's full analysis here This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts North Korea has carried out numerous missile tests. Some of these exploded shortly after launch, but others travelled for hundreds of miles before landing in the sea. Here are some of the major tests reported last year alone: 12 February 2017- A medium-range ballistic missile launched from Banghyon air base near the west coast. It flew east towards the Sea of Japan for about 500km. 4 July 2017- Pyongyang claimed to have successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time.

"Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) members have narrowly rejected plans to widen the organisation's remit to be the voice of all beer, cider and perry drinkers. The proposal, which could have seen Camra representing all beer drinkers - not just real ale -  will not go ahead. The organisation has however voted to target its ""education and training"" at all types of drinker. Camra's chairman said the membership had ""made its views clear"". Almost 18,000 members voted online and at Camra's AGM in Coventry on Saturday. Five othernew objectives,externalwere voted through, after Camra's leadership recommended changesfollowing a ""root-and-branch review"",external. They included: To play a leading role in the provision of information, education, and training to all those with an interest in beer, cider, and perry of any type To promote and protect pubs and clubs as social centres as part of the UK's cultural heritage To increase recognition of the benefits of responsible, moderate social drinking. But the motion ""to act as the voice and represent the interests of all pub goers and beer, cider and perry drinkers"" failed to pass after receiving 72% of the votes. It needed the support of 75% of voting members to succeed. Real ale usually comes from a hand pump and is conditioned in a cask, giving it a fuller flavour than other beers, say supporters. National pub campaigner, and former Liberal Democrat MP, Greg Mulholland was one of those who opposed the changes. He wrote on his Facebook page: ""If the revitalisation plans go through, Camra will not be a campaign for anything but a vague 'we like any 'nice' beer and cider club'."" The vote followed Camra's largest ever consultation of its members. More than 25,000 members filled in surveys and attended consultation meetings across the country. Camra chairman Colin Valentine said: ""We were determined to give every single member the right to have the final say on the recommendations by voting on the changes to the Articles of Association. The membership has taken advantage of that right and made its views clear. ""We're delighted that all but one of the Special Resolutions was approved, which shows the majority of members agreed with the consultation findings that Camra needs to change to remain a relevant and effective campaigning organisation."" He added: ""We need to do all we can to reassure all members that our core campaigning objectives remain focussed on real ale, cider and perry as ever.""

The PM said money will be offered to resolve ""anxieties and problems"". Some immigrants who came to the UK from the Commonwealth decades ago have been threatened with deportation or refused jobs or healthcare. Labour MP David Lammy, who has led the campaign, said more detail on compensation was ""needed urgently"". He tweeted:,external""Compensation must be provided to anyone who has forked out for legal fees or has lost their job, their pension, benefits, access to healthcare or been detained, deported or refused re-entry back to the UK. ""That is justice."" What should Windrush generation do now? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? On Thursday, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss,told BBC Question Timethat the government would ""look sympathetically"" at compensation requests from Windrush immigrants. Mrs May's first public mention of remuneration came at a news conference at the end of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) in London on Friday. She said: ""On Tuesday, I met with Caribbean leaders, where I gave an absolute commitment that the UK government will do whatever it takes - including where appropriate payment of compensation - to resolve the anxieties and problems which some of the Windrush generation have suffered.

In Pictures: The Windrush generation Meanwhile the government has played down the significance of newly-discovered arrival records held by the National Archives holds on thousands of the Windrush generation. It said those documents - ships' passenger lists rather thanthe landing cards the Home Office destroyed in 2010- do not provide evidence of long-term residency in the UK which was ""key to demonstrating the status of the Windrush generation"". It will review any evidence to help resolve each case, the Home Office added. Immigration lawyer Adam Sinfield agreed the records would be of ""limited use"". He said: ""The ""biggest problem remains the bureaucracy of having to prove their (immigrants')continuous residency in the late '70s and early '80s"". A total of 286 people have contacted the Home Office since Monday, after the department set up a helpline to support those who had concerns about their migration status.

"Police were called to a David Lloyd fitness club at 09:45 BST after reports of a child drowning in a pool A three-year-old boy has died while swimming at a pool in Leeds. Police were called to Tongue Lane at about 09:45 BST after reports of a child drowning in a pool at a David Lloyd fitness club in the Moortown area of the city. The boy was taken by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary accompanied by his mother but was later confirmed dead. West Yorkshire Police said they believed his death was not suspicious and was a ""tragic accident"". In a statement, the club said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened"" and its thoughts were ""very much with the boy's family at this very sad time"". ""The child was swimming with his family in our indoor pool at the time of the incident,"" the statement continued. ""He was found unconscious just after 9.30am this morning, and was rescued from the water by one of our team. ""Our club teams are fully trained to deal with incidents of this nature, and they immediately administered CPR and the emergency services were called."" The club said it was closing for the rest of the day following the death and would be making no further comment. David Lloyd apologised to customers after it shut its club following the boy's death Det Insp James Entwistle said: ""While there is nothing to suggest that the death was suspicious, we do have a duty to investigate the circumstances of what has happened.

"Dairy farmer Michael Oakes while the straw was still available for bedding ""You almost need a Securicor escort to move a load of straw up the motorway these days,"" says farmer Michael Oakes. His dairy farm, in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, has suffered much from this winter's poor weather, as  have many farms in the country. The poor weather has prompted a spike in demand for straw, while last year's weather conditions severely curtailed straw production. The combination has pushed the price of both wheat and barley straw to record levels. In February, the average barley straw price in England and Wales was Â£90 a tonne, 73% from a year earlier, while wheat straw was Â£81 a tonne, up 62%. ""Everybody's bank accounts have taken a big hit,"" says Mr Oakes, who is also the chairman of the National Farmers' Union's (NFU) Dairy Board. Last year's dry spring meant a sparser crop. Very wet weather then limited the number of harvest days, curtailing the crop further. Simon Dee Shapland, from straw supplier Abbot & Co, explained that wet weather also affected the harvest in two other ways: ""When straw gets wet in the very large swathes left by the modern combine harvesters, it is very difficult to get it dry enough to bale. ""And that frustrates the farmer in re-sowing the fields again. They often decide to chop the remaining crop [back into the soil]."" On the demand side, that same wet weather has kept livestock indoors for longer, meaning a greater need for bedding and feed. Although straw producers have less straw to sell, you would think they would find some relief in the higher prices. But not all of them can access this. Excess straw, which acted as the farmers' reserve supply in years gone by is now used as biofuel, adding to demand and helping to keep prices high. But Gavin Strathern from Blackwater Baling in Essex, which buys and sells straw, says many companies like his are on contracts to supply power stations and so are unable to sell their goods on the open market. ""Demand has increased four-fold from the power generators as, until recently, there was only one power station burning 250,000 tonnes of straw per year and now we have four burning 1 million tonnes per year."" Many farmers have been struggling to pay the extra costs for the straw they need. As a result, the NFU has relaunched its fodder bank, a service that helps its members find animal bedding and feed. ""As well as contributing Â£112bn to the economy and providing 3.8 million jobs, food and farming underpins rural communities and it is during these difficult times that the support of both government and the wider industry is so important,"" the NFU said. The Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs said there were other bedding options available. ""We understand the impact rising wheat straw prices are having on farmers,"" a spokesperson said. ""Farmers and livestock keepers seeking a cheaper alternative to straw should discuss alternative bedding with their vet so that animal health and welfare issues are considered. There are alternative types of bedding such as waste paper or recycled wood shavings."" Mr Oakes says this is something farmers are aware of, but prices there are rising too: ""That can work for some systems, but it doesn't work for all - because the demand for those products has shot up. ""If straw is expensive, farmers look for other types of bedding, but the cost of that is up about 25%. I'm using sawdust to bed some of my cows. The price of that should drop at this time of this year but it's gone the other way."" Farmers are now keeping their eye on the forecast. Mr Shapland says conditions need to be very favourable to fill the barns up again. The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board says the weather is improving which should provide some relief: ""Grass growth records are finally recording some strong daily growth. However, with many fields currently waterlogged it may not be as simple as turning livestock back out just yet."" Back in Bromsgrove, Mr Oakes says the leaner times are not over: ""It will have an effect on next winter - normally we all carry a bit over - this time most of us are going into summer with no stock. ""A lot of crops would be planted in the spring, but a lot of farmers are saying its too late to plant now. ""It does look like its going to be another very expensive winter next year.""

"Carwyn Jones defended his sacking of Carl Sargeant but was accused of failing to treat him fairly Few things demonstrate a leader's grip on power better than a reshuffle. Last November, Carwyn Jones refreshed his top team. And for the second time, gave a job to someone from outside the Labour Party by appointing ex-Plaid Cymru leader Lord Elis-Thomas as a minister. It was the act of a leader who felt comfortable in his job. How dramatically things have changed. Carwyn Jones to quit as first minister Since handing out the promotions - and sacking Carl Sargeant - Carwyn Jones's authority has drained away. He has been tested in office: his time as first minister coincided with the steel crisis, a vote for Brexit he campaigned against, and he's faced the conundrum of how to improve services with a shrinking budget. But nothing comes close to the last few months. In truth, Carwyn Jones has had a fair wind. His party has been united and his opponents divided. Deadlock: Carwyn Jones after the initial tied vote for first minister following the 2016 election Evena dramatic tied vote that stalled his progress back into office in 2016was just that - drama.  There was no realistic prospect of Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and UKIP uniting to unseat him. There has never been a hint of a challenge to his authority from within the Labour group in the assembly. Against the backdrop of the miners' strikes in the 1980s, Carwyn Jones joined Labour as a law student at Aberystwyth University. He was a barrister in Swansea, before being elected as the AM for Bridgend - his home town - at the first assembly elections in 1999, aged 32. He was a disciple of Rhodri Morgan. After his death in 2017,Mr Jones described him as a ""father figure"". With Alun Michael teetering as Welsh Labour's first leader under devolution, Mr Morgan recalled in his autobiography how he met Carwyn Jones at a pub in the Vale of Glamorgan to discuss their next move. Carwyn Jones succeeded Rhodri Morgan as first minister in 2009 When he got the chance,Mr Morgan promoted the young AM to his cabinet,external, replacing Christine Gwyther in charge of agriculture in July 2000. Trudging around the countryside talking to farmers might not be the most glamorous job prospect for an ambitious Labour politician. It proved to be the making of him. Foot and mouth disease tore through rural Britain while Carwyn Jones was in the post. Responding to the outbreak in 2001 wasan early test for the young minister,externaland the young devolved administration. He was a mainstay of the Morgan cabinets, his last job being counsel general in the coalition with Plaid Cymru. Rhodri Morgan never anointed him - or anyone else - as a chosen successor, but it was widely assumed for years that if anyone wanted to be Welsh Labour leader when Mr Morgan eventually stood down, Carwyn Jones would be the man to beat. The vacancy arose whenMr Morgan retired as first minister in 2009,external. Carl Sargeant had been one of Carwyn Jones's longest-serving cabinet ministers After seeing off rivals Edwina Hart and Huw Lewis, Carwyn Jones set about putting his stamp on the coalition cabinet by appointing allies in a reshuffle - among them, Carl Sargeant. In two assembly elections under his leadership, Labour fell short of a majority, forcing Mr Jones to shore up his position by reaching out to opponents. But those election results have been better than many expected. The assembly's electoral system makes majorities elusive. In public, Carwyn Jones has been a sure-footed performer, especially when roaming across favourite terrain, like the intricacies of the UK constitution.A bizarre invitation to store nuclear weapons in Milford Havenin 2012 was a rare gaffe. Delivery was his watchword. It was meant as code for better public services. Opponents and supporters can choose from a range of statistics about the performance of schools and hospitals to make the case for and against his record. Likewise on the economy, Carwyn Jones's Welsh Government claims the credit for low unemployment. So too does the UK Government. Grand plans remain unfulfilled. A proposed merger of local councils never happened. The M4 relief road around Newport is in the hands of a planning inquiry. Jeremy Corbyn joined Carwyn Jones on the 2017 general election campaign trail in Cardiff He has presided over further devolution. Carwyn Jones was first minister whenthe assembly acquired full law-making powersand itsfirst measure of tax powers. But he has failed to secure the powers over policing that he wanted. Reforms to the way the Welsh Government is funded have not gone as far as he wanted. In 2016 he spoke about how being first minister - a job he ""loves"" - had, at times, beendifficult for his family. He and wife Lisa have a son, Ruairi, and a daughter, Seren. Speculation was rife, but only his closest confidants know when Mr Jones would have stood down had he been able to choose his own timing. ""My children have only known me as a minister and you do make sacrifices in this job,"" he said. Carwyn Jones talked about completing a decade of delivery, taking him to 2019 - a hint, perhaps, that he wanted ten years in office.

"This video can not be played Carwyn Jones told Nick Servini the inquiry should start as soon as possible The lawyers of Jack Sargeant have written a strongly-worded letter accusing First Minister Carwyn Jones of causing ""considerable distress"". Mr Sargeant's father Carl was found dead in November, four days after being dismissed from the cabinet. An inquiry into how Mr Jones handled the sacking will be led by Paul Bowen QC, but has not yet begun. Asked whether his manner had caused distress, Mr Jones told BBC Wales he could not see how that can be the case. Family agree Sargeant inquiry chairman Carl Sargeant: Timeline of events On the eve of the Welsh Labour conference, Jack Sargeant's lawyers said in a letter to Mr Bowen that the first minister's manner was causing ""considerable distress to our client and his family"". They added: ""The inescapable fact here is that someone sadly has lost their life, a much loved family member, and due process must be followed expeditiously to enable to those closest to him to find some closure."" Later, interviewed by BBC Wales, Jack Sargeant's lawyer Neil Hudgell, said: ""It's a culmination of a series of frustrations over the delay to the start of the inquiry."" He said the process ""seems to have stalled"". ""Our thoughts very much are that it's been de-humanised within the first minister's office, there's some game-playing going on and some deliberate stalling tactics."" Carl Sargeant was found dead days after he was sacked from his cabinet level job Asked about the letter's release on the eve of the Welsh Labour Party conference in Llandudno, Mr Hudgell said there had been ""a degree of co-incidental timing"" in light of this week's developments in the assembly. ""There might be some cynicism because it's so close to conference but there's been a number of important events this week, a number of comments made that the family just find unacceptable,"" he said. Carl Sargeant was dismissed from the cabinet after being subjected to a Labour Party inquiry into allegations of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"" when he died. Mr Bowen was appointed in January to lead the independent inquiry into Mr Jones's handling of Mr Sargeant's sacking but the inquiry has yet to start. Speaking at a school in Llandudno Junction, Mr Jones told BBC Wales he had not seen the letter. ""I think it's in everyone's interests that any issues are resolved as quickly as possible in order for things to move forward,"" he said. When asked about the accusation that his manner has caused distress to the family of Jack Sargeant, he said: ""I can't see how that can be the case."" Earlier this year Jack Sargeant was elected to represent his father's former seat of Alyn and Deeside in the assembly. The letter comes at the end of a week where the Conservatives failed in a bid to publish a separate report into whether Carl Sargeant's sacking was leaked in the days before a cabinet reshuffle. It found no ""unauthorised"" leaking of information on his sackingbut its full details were withheld over fears about the confidentiality of witnesses. Mr Jones threatened legal action against the assembly over the attempts to publish the report. He was alsocleared of any wrongdoingover allegations he misled the assembly over claims of a bullying culture within the Welsh Government. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said the first minister's judgement had ""come under considerable scrutiny in recent days"" and that the lawyers' letter would ""only add to the growing pressure his leadership is under"". Mr Davies warned Mr Jones against kicking Mr Bowen's inquiry ""deep into the long grass"". The significance of this letter is all wrapped up in the timing. The shadow caused by the death of Carl Sargeant was always going to be in the background of what promises to be a packed Welsh Labour conference but this ensures it remains front and central. From the perspective of the family, there is clearly intense frustration that the main inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his sacking has not even started. There is difficulty for the Welsh Government too. Even if ministers share that frustration, no-one can be seen to be meddling in such a highly sensitive area.

Care sector: 'Short of nurses and other key staff' The cost of care Overnight carer back pay scheme 'unaffordable' ""As with many independent providers in the UK health and social care sector, Allied Healthcare has been operating in a highly challenging environment for a sustained period of time, which has placed pressure on the company,"" a company spokesperson said. ""As a result of these challenges, Allied Healthcare has taken the decision to pursue a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)."" Allied said there will be no redundancies or branch closures as a result of the CVA plan being implemented. BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said the CVA would allow the company to pause repaying some creditors - including its pensions contributions - while the future of the business is sorted out. It will ""shield them from some of their debts while they get their house in order financially"", he explained. Changes to the Care Act, which came into effect in 2015, means that if a provider like Allied were to stop trading, local authorities would step in to protect individuals receiving care. The Local Government Association, which represents local authorities, said it was working alongside the Care Quality Commission and government to support Allied where possible. An LGA spokesman said: ""The absolute priority for councils affected is to protect the vital care and support that older and disabled people rely on and ensure it is able to continue without interruption. ""Councils have robust contingency plans in place to manage the care of individuals if necessary."" Last year,HMRC ruled carers sleeping overnight should be be paid the national minimum wage,externalfor all hours, as opposed to a flat rate, and that social care providers will be required to make back-dated payments for these stays. At the time the charity Mencap warned about the ""devastating"" financial impact of the changes, claiming the total bill to social care providers for back pay - in some cases dating back six years - could be Â£400m. It is understood Allied's bill could amount to Â£11m. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the government would ""continue to monitor the financial stability"" of Allied and other adult social care providers.""

"The Marsican bear is a critically endangered subspecies of the brown bear A national park in central Italy is investigating the death of a rare brown bear during an operation to capture it. Biologists at the park in the Apennine mountains had trapped the animal to fit him with a radio collar so they could track his movements. But the male Marsican bear began to struggle to breathe as he was being sedated and died shortly afterwards, despite efforts to revive him. Wildlife officials have described the loss of the animal as ""very serious"". ""This is a subspecies in danger of extinction that now counts only 50 individuals or little more,"" said WWF Italia, as it called for a review of capture procedures. Dog's 'cancer' turns out to be teddies Cows jump for joy after winter indoors Angry badger calms down and leaves castle The bear was captured in a tube trap on Wednesday night, as part of an authorised operation at the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise nature reserve. According to Italian media, the young bear was not the intended object of the operation and park staff were trying to capture a different animal. The other bear, Mario, had wandered into a village at night, and was deemed to pose a risk to its inhabitants. ""It is the first time we have been faced with an anaesthetic emergency during a capture,"" Antonio Carrara, president of the national park, told media. Although the protocol ""reduces the risks for the bear to a minimum, they cannot be ruled out completely"", he said. He had ""full confidence in the park's staff"" and hoped that the post-mortem would ""shed full light on the cause of death"", he added. Bear gets root canal treatment.

"Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) members have narrowly rejected plans to widen the organisation's remit to be the voice of all beer, cider and perry drinkers. The proposal, which could have seen Camra representing all beer drinkers - not just real ale -  will not go ahead. The organisation has however voted to target its ""education and training"" at all types of drinker. Camra's chairman said the membership had ""made its views clear"". Almost 18,000 members voted online and at Camra's AGM in Coventry on Saturday. Five othernew objectives,externalwere voted through, after Camra's leadership recommended changesfollowing a ""root-and-branch review"",external. They included: To play a leading role in the provision of information, education, and training to all those with an interest in beer, cider, and perry of any type To promote and protect pubs and clubs as social centres as part of the UK's cultural heritage To increase recognition of the benefits of responsible, moderate social drinking. But the motion ""to act as the voice and represent the interests of all pub goers and beer, cider and perry drinkers"" failed to pass after receiving 72% of the votes. It needed the support of 75% of voting members to succeed. Real ale usually comes from a hand pump and is conditioned in a cask, giving it a fuller flavour than other beers, say supporters. National pub campaigner, and former Liberal Democrat MP, Greg Mulholland was one of those who opposed the changes. He wrote on his Facebook page: ""If the revitalisation plans go through, Camra will not be a campaign for anything but a vague 'we like any 'nice' beer and cider club'."" The vote followed Camra's largest ever consultation of its members. More than 25,000 members filled in surveys and attended consultation meetings across the country. Camra chairman Colin Valentine said: ""We were determined to give every single member the right to have the final say on the recommendations by voting on the changes to the Articles of Association. The membership has taken advantage of that right and made its views clear. ""We're delighted that all but one of the Special Resolutions was approved, which shows the majority of members agreed with the consultation findings that Camra needs to change to remain a relevant and effective campaigning organisation."" He added: ""We need to do all we can to reassure all members that our core campaigning objectives remain focussed on real ale, cider and perry as ever.""

"Carwyn Jones addressing last year's Labour conference in Brighton First Minister Carwyn Jones has called on Welsh Labour to ""stand united"" as it gathers for the party's conference. He said the Welsh Government was sticking to its promises and delivering the commitments it made to voters. The conference in Llandudno is the first since the dramatic events that began with the death offormer minister Carl Sargeantin November 2017. It will also see the election ofeither Carolyn Harris or Julie Morganas Welsh Labour's first deputy leader. Mr Jones has been under intense pressure as this weekhe saw off opposition demands to publish a confidential reportinto last November's reshuffle, which included sacking Mr Sargeant as Communities and Children minister. But the first ministerthreatened the assembly itself with legal proceedingsover the publication of the report. Union Morgan row members reinstated FM setting no timetable to stand down The inquiry into whether information about the reshuffle was leaked is one of three he ordered following Mr Sargeant's death, which happened just days after his cabinet dismissal. Another report this weekcleared the first minister of misleading the assemblyover claims of bullying within the government. In a statement before the conference, Mr Jones said: ""While we should be rightly proud of what we have achieved together - Assembly members, councillors, parliamentarians and trades unions - we must also stand together, ready to face the challenges ahead. ""As Tory cuts to Wales bite deeper, protecting services becomes ever harder. And we must stand united, together, to face these challenges head on."" He added: ""I said in 2016 that my Welsh Labour government should be judged on its record. Either Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris and Cardiff North AM Julie Morgan will be Welsh Labour's first deputy leader ""And it is that record - one of promises kept, communities protected, and investment made - that provides the backdrop to this year's Welsh Labour conference. ""Today, we see a Welsh Labour Party staying true to our promises - and to our values."" The deputy leadership contest between Ms Harris, the Swansea East MP, and Mrs Morgan, the Cardiff North AM, has become a flashpoint in a debate about whether rank-and-file members should have a bigger say in electing the party's leaders. Mrs Morgan has called for the introduction of one-member-one-vote elections, something the party's ruling executive rejected last year, while Ms Harris has supported retaining the current electoral college. Proposals for a democracy review within the party are due to be discussed this weekend.

"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded International chemical weapons experts have finally inspected the site of a suspected attack near Damascus which caused an international crisis. The team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) travelled to the town of Douma and collected samples and other items. Last week Western states bombed several Syrian government sites in retaliation for the suspected attack on 7 April. Syria and Russia, which now control Douma, deny chemical arms were used. More than 40 people are said to have died on 7 April. The joint military response by the US, UK and France followed a war of words with Russia, Syria's main military ally. The delay in the OPCW visit encouraged the proliferation of rival theories and accusations ricocheted between the various capitals and across the internet, BBC Arab Affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. What did Western strikes target? Were the Syria strikes legal? In a press release, the OPCW said its team had visited one of the two sites reportedly bombed in Douma on 7 April. The unspecified samples will be sent to the OPCW Laboratory in Rijswijk, a suburb of The Hague, and then analysed by designated labs, the agency said. Other information and ""materials"" have also been collected by the inspectors, it said. An ITV News correspondent recorded the return of the OPCW convoy to Damascus. Allow Twitter content?

The nine-strong team had been waiting for a week in the Syrian capital for clearance to visit the town. They had been due to enter the town on Wednesday but the visit was delayed after a UN risk assessment team came under fire while checking the sites on Tuesday. The OPCW at The Hague has shown the kind of bullet-proof vests and helmets used by its staff on missions Western officials fear that evidence of the alleged double chemical attack may have been tampered with. However, important traces of toxic chemicals would probably still be present in the environment and in the remains of victims, Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told AFP news agency. ""Nerve agents like sarin can be present in the environment for many weeks after use and particularly if you look near the site where a weapon has exploded,"" he said. ""Autopsy samples, if available, will provide invaluable evidence and nerve agents can be found in many organs."" How do you test for chemical weapons? What we know about the 'chemical attack' Journalists have been visiting a warren of tunnels dug in Douma to avoid air strikes Douma was constantly under attack during the recent Russian-backed Syrian offensive to drive rebels out of areas near Damascus and is still littered with the debris of war, making any inspection potentially hazardous. Warren of war tunnels revealed The rebels withdrew under a deal with the Russian military just after 7 April. While there is suspicion that efforts may have been made to remove forensic evidence of chemical weapons, foreign journalists have already visited the town. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry accused the OPCW of itself taking too long,externalto inspect the suspected attack sites. On the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under the control of the Jaish al-Islam  group, the last rebel bastion in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus.

"More than 10,000 people in the UK suffer from cystic fibrosis, which causes fatal lung damage Health ministers have urged a pharmaceutical company to drop the price of a life-changing cystic fibrosis (CF) drug for NHS patients. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Orkambicosts Â£100,000 a year per patient, and has been deemed too expensive for the NHS. The company rejected an NHS England counter offer, saying it was not enough to fund research into future medicines. Health ministers Steve Brine and Lord O'Shaughnessy said ""time was of the essence"" for CF patients. Vertex said it wants to reach an agreement ""as soon as possible"". Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening genetic condition that causes fatal lung damage and affects around 10,400 people in the UK. Only around half of those with the condition live to celebrate their 40th birthday. Orkambi is prescribed for people with the F508del mutation, which causes the production of an abnormal protein that disrupts how water and chloride are transported in the body. The drug has been shown in clinical trials to improve lung function and respiratory symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which helps decide which treatments should be available on the NHS in England and Wales, rejected the drug in 2016 on cost grounds. Vertex has since urged the NHS to act ""in the best interest"" of cystic fibrosis patients. 'I lost my two sisters to cystic fibrosis' Orkambi drug means 'I can plan for my future' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, cystic fibrosis sufferer Lynsey Beswick said: ""The median life expectancy for someone like myself is just 31 years old - I'm 35. ""People like myself just don't have time to wait for these decisions. ""This is a really urgent issue and people like myself need access [to Orkambi] as soon as possible."" The letter from the health ministers to Simon Bedson, senior vice president of Vertex, follows a debate in the House of Commons about access to the drug last month.

"Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) members have narrowly rejected plans to widen the organisation's remit to be the voice of all beer, cider and perry drinkers. The proposal, which could have seen Camra representing all beer drinkers - not just real ale -  will not go ahead. The organisation has however voted to target its ""education and training"" at all types of drinker. Camra's chairman said the membership had ""made its views clear"". Almost 18,000 members voted online and at Camra's AGM in Coventry on Saturday. Five othernew objectives,externalwere voted through, after Camra's leadership recommended changesfollowing a ""root-and-branch review"",external. They included: To play a leading role in the provision of information, education, and training to all those with an interest in beer, cider, and perry of any type To promote and protect pubs and clubs as social centres as part of the UK's cultural heritage To increase recognition of the benefits of responsible, moderate social drinking. But the motion ""to act as the voice and represent the interests of all pub goers and beer, cider and perry drinkers"" failed to pass after receiving 72% of the votes. It needed the support of 75% of voting members to succeed. Real ale usually comes from a hand pump and is conditioned in a cask, giving it a fuller flavour than other beers, say supporters. National pub campaigner, and former Liberal Democrat MP, Greg Mulholland was one of those who opposed the changes. He wrote on his Facebook page: ""If the revitalisation plans go through, Camra will not be a campaign for anything but a vague 'we like any 'nice' beer and cider club'."" The vote followed Camra's largest ever consultation of its members. More than 25,000 members filled in surveys and attended consultation meetings across the country. Camra chairman Colin Valentine said: ""We were determined to give every single member the right to have the final say on the recommendations by voting on the changes to the Articles of Association. The membership has taken advantage of that right and made its views clear. ""We're delighted that all but one of the Special Resolutions was approved, which shows the majority of members agreed with the consultation findings that Camra needs to change to remain a relevant and effective campaigning organisation."" He added: ""We need to do all we can to reassure all members that our core campaigning objectives remain focussed on real ale, cider and perry as ever.""

"Police were called to a David Lloyd fitness club at 09:45 BST after reports of a child drowning in a pool A three-year-old boy has died while swimming at a pool in Leeds. Police were called to Tongue Lane at about 09:45 BST after reports of a child drowning in a pool at a David Lloyd fitness club in the Moortown area of the city. The boy was taken by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary accompanied by his mother but was later confirmed dead. West Yorkshire Police said they believed his death was not suspicious and was a ""tragic accident"". In a statement, the club said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened"" and its thoughts were ""very much with the boy's family at this very sad time"". ""The child was swimming with his family in our indoor pool at the time of the incident,"" the statement continued. ""He was found unconscious just after 9.30am this morning, and was rescued from the water by one of our team. ""Our club teams are fully trained to deal with incidents of this nature, and they immediately administered CPR and the emergency services were called."" The club said it was closing for the rest of the day following the death and would be making no further comment. David Lloyd apologised to customers after it shut its club following the boy's death Det Insp James Entwistle said: ""While there is nothing to suggest that the death was suspicious, we do have a duty to investigate the circumstances of what has happened. ""We understand there were a number of people in the pool at the time who have left the area prior to police arriving at the scene. ""We would ask these people to come forward to give their accounts of what they have seen and heard."" On its website, the club states it has a 25m (82ft) indoor pool, a 20m (66ft) outdoor pool, plus indoor and outdoor splash pools. One child, who went to use the club with a friend, said he could not get into the pool and saw ""most of the people crying and upset"". ""There were loads of workers all panicking... and they had red faces. People were just going in, out, in, out. ""We were just really scared so we just hid behind the bike sheds."" The club said it was ""deeply saddened"" by what had happened A woman, who did not give her name, turned up at the club with two children. She said: ""I've just been told not to go in because a small child has died there this morning. ""That's made me really really upset because David Lloyd is really good and I've seen lots of lifeguards everyday watching over the children, but I don't know what's happened and that's scaring me. ""I don't think I'll be able to swim again in that pool."" Another man, known on social media as Chris R,tweeted,external: ""We often take our 2-year-old to this pool.

"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded International chemical weapons experts have finally inspected the site of a suspected attack near Damascus which caused an international crisis. The team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) travelled to the town of Douma and collected samples and other items. Last week Western states bombed several Syrian government sites in retaliation for the suspected attack on 7 April. Syria and Russia, which now control Douma, deny chemical arms were used. More than 40 people are said to have died on 7 April. The joint military response by the US, UK and France followed a war of words with Russia, Syria's main military ally. The delay in the OPCW visit encouraged the proliferation of rival theories and accusations ricocheted between the various capitals and across the internet, BBC Arab Affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. What did Western strikes target? Were the Syria strikes legal? In a press release, the OPCW said its team had visited one of the two sites reportedly bombed in Douma on 7 April. The unspecified samples will be sent to the OPCW Laboratory in Rijswijk, a suburb of The Hague, and then analysed by designated labs, the agency said. Other information and ""materials"" have also been collected by the inspectors, it said. An ITV News correspondent recorded the return of the OPCW convoy to Damascus. Allow Twitter content?

The nine-strong team had been waiting for a week in the Syrian capital for clearance to visit the town. They had been due to enter the town on Wednesday but the visit was delayed after a UN risk assessment team came under fire while checking the sites on Tuesday. The OPCW at The Hague has shown the kind of bullet-proof vests and helmets used by its staff on missions Western officials fear that evidence of the alleged double chemical attack may have been tampered with. However, important traces of toxic chemicals would probably still be present in the environment and in the remains of victims, Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told AFP news agency. ""Nerve agents like sarin can be present in the environment for many weeks after use and particularly if you look near the site where a weapon has exploded,"" he said. ""Autopsy samples, if available, will provide invaluable evidence and nerve agents can be found in many organs."" How do you test for chemical weapons? What we know about the 'chemical attack' Journalists have been visiting a warren of tunnels dug in Douma to avoid air strikes Douma was constantly under attack during the recent Russian-backed Syrian offensive to drive rebels out of areas near Damascus and is still littered with the debris of war, making any inspection potentially hazardous. Warren of war tunnels revealed The rebels withdrew under a deal with the Russian military just after 7 April. While there is suspicion that efforts may have been made to remove forensic evidence of chemical weapons, foreign journalists have already visited the town. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry accused the OPCW of itself taking too long,externalto inspect the suspected attack sites. On the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under the control of the Jaish al-Islam  group, the last rebel bastion in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus.

The Syrian government and Russia deny chemical weapons were used and say evidence was fabricated. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media While the Syrian government denies having ever used chemical weapons, experts from the UN and the OPCW have ascribed four chemical attacks to the government during the civil war.

"Kim Jong-un's announcement that North Korea is to halt nuclear and missile tests immediately comes as he prepares for two major diplomatic events. Analyst Ankit Panda asks what the North Korean leader hopes to gain with his latest move. North Korea's declaration will no doubt lead to effusive headlines touting an end to nuclear and long-range missile testing, but a look at the country's historical record and the context of its nuclear and missiles programme suggests that we might temper our expectations. First, regarding nuclear testing, the statement released on Saturday makes clear that the reason Kim Jong-un is submitting voluntarily to a testing freeze and to the closing of the Punggye-ri nuclear testing site - the scene of all six of North Korea's nuclear tests since 2006 - is because he feels that his country has mastered the design of nuclear weapons. Although difficult to verify, this claim is not obviously an exaggeration or unbelievable. Consider that India and Pakistan, by 1998, had each conducted six nuclear tests and are now counted among the pantheon of nuclear weapons possessors, without conducting further tests. North Korea, with an additional eight years of access to knowledge available in open source material concerning nuclear weapons design, can feel similarly comfortable with its six nuclear tests. North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's nuclear programme explained Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? On a more granular level, North Korea's fifth and sixth nuclear tests - in September 2016 and 2017 respectively - marked important benchmarks. The September 2016 test, according to North Korean state media, involved a standardized and compact nuclear device, one that could be mounted on any of its various short, medium, intermediate, and intercontinental-range missiles (ICBMs). Kim Jong-un has taken a close personal interest in the North Korean missile programme The expected yield - or explosive power - of those weapons might be of the order of two-to-three times the weapon that the United States used against Nagasaki in the final days of the World War Two -  but that's quite powerful enough for North Korea's purposes. More seriously, North Korea's most recent nuclear test demonstrated that it had the capability to generate seriously powerful nuclear yields. While independent experts and various national intelligence agencies haven't reached a consensus on whether North Korea had truly mastered a thermonuclear bomb design, as it claimed to have done, the seismic data recorded on 3 September 2017 gave the world enough information to conclude that North Korea had a nuclear device capable of ""city-busting"" explosive yields. The bottom line is that just as Kim Jong-un's recent trip to Beijing was a show of strength - a signal that he felt comfortable enough in his consolidated domestic power to leave North Korea - so too is the declaration of a nuclear test ban a sign that he feels renewed confidence. Regarding his missiles, Kim has said that he will no longer test ICBMs. On the one hand, that's surprising. North Korea has conducted just three tests in total of missiles that could deliver nuclear weapons to the contiguous United States. None of these tests have involved a missile flying on a trajectory similar to what might be necessary for a nuclear strike, leaving further flight-testing something of a necessity for North Korea to become sufficiently confident in its ability to strike the US homeland. But North Korea may have other plans. For instance, while it has mastered most of what is necessary on a technical level to threaten the United States, its missile forces continue to be limited by a small number of launchers. Currently, North Korea has probably only six launch vehicles for its ICBMs. Even though Kim Jong-un, during his 2018 New Year's address, declared his nuclear forces ""complete,"" there is good reason to believe that he would want to increase his ICBM launchers and even work on components of North Korea's nuclear command and control systems. North Korea may now want to concentrate on developing launch vehicles, not missiles themselves Tactically, then, submitting to a self-imposed ICBM flight-testing ban would have limited costs. Ultimately, these test bans are restricted in their extent. The nuclear test ban could be made credible by a bona fide gesture at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. North Korea, for instance, could demolish its test tunnels; the statement released on Saturday notes only  that the site will be ""dismantled"". But as long as North Korea hangs on to its missiles, it can break its self-imposed ban with little warning. In 1999, North Korea submitted to a missile testing moratorium, but that eventually broke down in 2006, a few years after the collapse of the 1994 Agreed Framework. Beyond the bans, Mr Kim used the latest Central Committee meeting to tout the success of his fundamental national strategic project, which is summarized in what he has called the byungjin line. This concept refers to the simultaneous development of a powerful state nuclear force alongside a more prosperous economy. On Saturday, Kim Jng-un clearly indicated that with the cessation of nuclear testing, he will ""concentrate all the efforts on building a powerful socialist economy and markedly improving the standard of people's living."" That should be taken seriously. North Korea will seek relief from international sanctions at the forthcoming summits to realise this objective. The concessions from North Korea have come before the two anticipated summits with the United States and South Korea. The meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim comes just months after the pair exchanged deeply personal insults One may wonder why Mr Kim should give up so much in advance instead of hanging on to a nuclear test-ban and an ICBM moratorium as aces up his sleeve to give up when he meets US President Donald Trump. The answer is simple:  a summit with a US president is enough of a prize in itself. For Mr Kim, it's something that neither his grandfather nor his father could attain. In the end, what North Korea loses by demolishing its nuclear test site and submitting to a unilateral moratorium on ICBM launches is entirely tolerable compared to what Mr Kim gains by sitting alongside President Trump. Reading KCNA's announcements on Saturday, there is also absolutely no hint of the ""denuclearization"" intent that South Korean officials have been eager to tout on North Korea's behalf. On the contrary, North Korea's announcement sounds like the declamations of a nuclear weapons state - one that has no intention of giving up those weapons which give the country its ultimate guarantee of survival. Even though President Trump has lauded Mr Kim's move as ""big progress,"" the sooner he recognises Kim's ultimate objectives, the better.

"The Hwasong-18 missile uses solid fuel North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un plans to meet President Putin this month about potentially providing Moscow with weapons for its war in Ukraine, according to a US official. There are concerns that in return, North Korea may seek advanced weapons technology from Russia. North Korea has continued regular tests of its missiles this year, after a significant increase in tests carried out in 2022. North Korea has tested a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles in recent years. It's also tested hypersonic missiles, which can fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude to escape radar detection, as well as others launched from submarines. In April, North Korea tested what it called ""its most powerful"" missile to date - the Hwasong-18. It's a solid-fuel missile, which are generally quicker to launch than liquid-fuel ones. It reportedly flew about 1,000km on its maiden flight, but its true range is estimated to be in excess of 15,000km, according to the US-based CSIS Missile Defense Project. A second test launch in July 2023 saw a Hwasong-18 reach a claimed altitude of over 6,600km, with a flight time of 74 minutes. In November last year, an intercontinental ballistic missilewas tested at a high angle, short-range trajectory. Launched at a lower trajectory, this same missile could have reached the US mainland, according to the Japanese government. Images from North Korean state media of Kim Jong-un with his daughter at the launch appear to show it was the Hwasong-17 - or possibly a modified version of it. The missile is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more, and could potentially carry three or four warheads, rather than only one. Several earlier attempts to launch the Hwasong-17 are thought to have failed, althoughit may have been used in a test carried out in March 2022.,external In October last year, North Korea fired another type of missile which flew over Japan - thought to have been the intermediate-range Hwasong-12. This can travel up to 4,500km - putting the US island of Guam in the Pacific within range. North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile with a range of 8,000km - although some studies suggest it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York. And there is the Hwasong-15 missile, which is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights. North Korea tested a record number of missiles in 2022, including ones capable of reaching US territory. The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or ""yield"", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device- the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon. However, North Korea may be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. ""It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles"" he says. North Korea says it simulated nuclear strike on South Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea saidit would shut the site down, because it had ""verified"" its nuclear capabilities. Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use. In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trumpthat North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities. However, the UN's atomic energy agency, the IAEA, says satellite images suggest that North Korea has restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium. In September 2022, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said there were signs that a test site at Punggye-ri was open again.  And in March this year, Mr Grossi said that activity thereas well as at Yongbyon was ""deeply regrettable."",external The IAEA has not had physical access to North Korea's nuclear facilities since April 2009.

"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded International chemical weapons experts have finally inspected the site of a suspected attack near Damascus which caused an international crisis. The team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) travelled to the town of Douma and collected samples and other items. Last week Western states bombed several Syrian government sites in retaliation for the suspected attack on 7 April. Syria and Russia, which now control Douma, deny chemical arms were used. More than 40 people are said to have died on 7 April. The joint military response by the US, UK and France followed a war of words with Russia, Syria's main military ally. The delay in the OPCW visit encouraged the proliferation of rival theories and accusations ricocheted between the various capitals and across the internet, BBC Arab Affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. What did Western strikes target? Were the Syria strikes legal? In a press release, the OPCW said its team had visited one of the two sites reportedly bombed in Douma on 7 April. The unspecified samples will be sent to the OPCW Laboratory in Rijswijk, a suburb of The Hague, and then analysed by designated labs, the agency said. Other information and ""materials"" have also been collected by the inspectors, it said. An ITV News correspondent recorded the return of the OPCW convoy to Damascus. Allow Twitter content?

The nine-strong team had been waiting for a week in the Syrian capital for clearance to visit the town. They had been due to enter the town on Wednesday but the visit was delayed after a UN risk assessment team came under fire while checking the sites on Tuesday. The OPCW at The Hague has shown the kind of bullet-proof vests and helmets used by its staff on missions Western officials fear that evidence of the alleged double chemical attack may have been tampered with. However, important traces of toxic chemicals would probably still be present in the environment and in the remains of victims, Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told AFP news agency. ""Nerve agents like sarin can be present in the environment for many weeks after use and particularly if you look near the site where a weapon has exploded,"" he said. ""Autopsy samples, if available, will provide invaluable evidence and nerve agents can be found in many organs."" How do you test for chemical weapons? What we know about the 'chemical attack' Journalists have been visiting a warren of tunnels dug in Douma to avoid air strikes Douma was constantly under attack during the recent Russian-backed Syrian offensive to drive rebels out of areas near Damascus and is still littered with the debris of war, making any inspection potentially hazardous. Warren of war tunnels revealed The rebels withdrew under a deal with the Russian military just after 7 April. While there is suspicion that efforts may have been made to remove forensic evidence of chemical weapons, foreign journalists have already visited the town. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry accused the OPCW of itself taking too long,externalto inspect the suspected attack sites. On the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under the control of the Jaish al-Islam  group, the last rebel bastion in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus.

The Syrian government and Russia deny chemical weapons were used and say evidence was fabricated. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media While the Syrian government denies having ever used chemical weapons, experts from the UN and the OPCW have ascribed four chemical attacks to the government during the civil war.

"Mack is best known for playing the role of Chloe Sullivan on Smallville's decade-long run Allison Mack, a US actress known for the TV show Smallville, has appeared in court on charges of aiding a sex trafficking operation disguised as a mentoring group. Keith Raniere, the leader of the so-called self-help group, was arrested by the FBI in Mexico in March. Ms Mack is accused of helping him to recruit women who were then exploited ""both sexually and for their labour"", the New York prosecuting attorney said. She pleaded not guilty to all charges. At a brief hearing on Friday evening in a Brooklyn federal court, the judge ordered Ms Mack, 35, to be held in custody.   She will appear in court again on Monday. 'Sex-slave' group leader arrested by FBI The society was supposed to empower and strengthen the women who joined it, according to prosecutors. But they allege Mr Raniere oversaw a ""slave and master"" system in his group called Nxivm, where female members were expected to have sex with him and were branded with his initials. ""Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere,"" Richard Donoghue, US attorney for the Eastern District in New York, said in a statement. Keith Raniere was detained in Mexico, where he has reportedly been living for several months Prosecutors allege that Nxivm has the features of a pyramid scheme, in which members pay ""thousands of dollars"" for courses to rise within its ranks. ""Mack directly or implicitly required her slaves... to engage in sexual activity with Raniere,"" the statement from the attorney's office claims. ""In exchange for this, Mack received financial and other benefits."" If found guilty, both Ms Mack and Mr Raniere, who has been charged with sex trafficking and is being held without bail, face at least 15 years in prison. Allison Mack was a mainstay of the popular Superman series Smallville, which ran from 2001 to 2011. Within Nxivm, a smaller group called DOS - or Dominus Obsequious Sororium - was created. The quasi-Latin phrase roughly translates as Master Over the Slave Women. The group encouraged women to recruit new slaves ""who in turn owed service not only to their own masters, but also to masters above them"" in the pyramid scheme, prosecutors say. Mr Raniere, 57, is alleged to have stood at the top of that pyramid, as the only man, with Ms Mack at the top level of women, immediately below him. Investigators say Mr Raniere had a rotating group of 15 to 20 sexual partners, who were not allowed to discuss their relationship with him or have one with anyone else. Compliance was assured in part through the use of ""collateral"" which had to be provided when joining - which prosecutors said included damaging information about friends or family, nude photographs, or rights to assets. They allege that ""slaves"" in the group had to eat extremely low-calorie diets because of Mr Raniere's preference for thin women. ""Under the guise of female empowerment, [Ms Mack] starved women until they fit her co-defendant's sexual ideal, and she targeted vulnerable women,"" prosecutor Moira Kim Penza said at Friday's hearing. In late March, Smallville co-star, Kristin Kreuk was forced to deny rumours she had acted as a recruiter for Mr Raniere. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The existence of the group's darker side came to widespread attention in October 2017, when the New York Times published a story including interviews with former members and their families.

"A fictional video reporting the onset of thermonuclear war and featuring BBC News branding has been shared widely. It is not real but alarmed viewers have contacted the BBC, apparently convinced it is true. On YouTube, the company behind the video clearly stated it was fiction before their account was removed. But on WhatsApp, where the video has been passed on without that clarification, some users were fooled. This is not what the end of the world looks like Opening with a familiar shot of the BBC newsroom, a grim-faced presenter announces a ""serious incident between Russia and Nato"". ""Although the details are uncertain, early reports indicate that a Russian surveillance aircraft was fired upon by naval vessels of Nato forces,"" the presenter says. As the report progresses, the incident escalates to the point where Russian warships have fired on Nato targets, the Royal Family has been moved, an emergency broadcast advises everyone else to stay at home and thermonuclear war erupts, destroying the German city of Mainz and part of Frankfurt. Again, this is a work of fiction. It is nicely produced, but there are several key giveaways. Although BBC branding is used in the video, the font, style and layout is very different. If you are sent a video on WhatsApp which appears to be from a major media organisation but you are not sure, search for it on the organisation's website. In this instance, if thermonuclear war was breaking out in much of the world and the BBC had reported on it, it is likely the news would be mentioned on the website and would be corroborated by other news organisations. How to report fake news to social media The YouTube account where the video was uploaded has been closed The video features actor Mark Ryes and was produced for an Irish company in 2016. Mr Ryes told the BBC: ""It was created by a company called Benchmarking Assessment Group as a psychometric test for their clients to see how they'd react in a disaster scenario. ""On the original YouTube posting it says very clearly that it's fictional. It doesn't even look like a genuine BBC News report. It was never meant to. ""As an actor playing this role, I recorded the video against a green screen. I had no part in the editing or production of the final piece."" Mr Ryes sent his recorded material to David Ringwood, Benchmarking Assessment Group's head of assessment services. According to the company website, Benchmarking Assessment Group was ""founded in 2006 in Ireland"" and works with clients to develop ""methodologies in assessment for selection, development and talent management"". Mr Ringwood had not responded to requests for comment at the time of writing. Syria war: The online activists pushing conspiracy theories The people who think governments control the weather The people who think mass shootings are staged On Thursday morning the BBC press office tweeted it was aware of a video clip ""claiming to be a BBC news report about Nato and Russia... circulating widely"". ""The video appears to have come from YouTube, where there is a disclaimer about it being a fictional dramatisation,"" a BBC spokesperson wrote. ""However, this information isn't being repeated when it's being shared, hence our tweet,"" it continued. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Synthetic technology could help medicine become much more targeted With advances in stem cell research and nanotechnology helping us fight illnesses from heart disease to superbugs, is the fusion of biology and technology speeding us towards a sci-fi future - part human, part synthetic? In Ridley Scott's seminal blockbuster Blade Runner, humanity has harnessed bio-engineering to create a race of replicants that look, act and sound human - but are made entirely from synthetic material. We may be far from realising that sci-fi future, but synthetics are beginning to have a  profound effect on medicine. At their state-of-the-art laboratories in Hong Kong, scientists from Canadian company Novoheart are using stem cells to create bio-artificial hearts the company calls ""hearts in a jar"". From just 2.5ml of your blood, Professor Ronald Li and his team are able to create stem cells that can then be turned into a miniature ""clone"" version of your heart that beats like yours and reacts to new drugs the way yours would. The process takes six months. This video can not be played Breakthroughs take time to sell Prof Li believes the tech could speed up the flow of vital new medicines because potential side-effects could be spotted before reaching the expensive human trial stage. ""Drug development is a notoriously lengthy, expensive and inefficient process, typically costing $2-$3bn and taking more than 10 years to develop a single drug, with unacceptably high failure rates of 90% or worse,"" he says. ""The significant business risk has resulted in depletion of the pipeline of new drugs under experimental development."" Stem cell-derived, bio-artificial cloned organs built from the patient's own blood could eventually be the future of transplant medicine, says Prof Li. ""Stem cell-derived tissues and organs are not just science fiction any more."" Could lab-grown organs help speed up drug development? As well as creating ""hearts in a jar"", biotech companies are also ""printing"" living tissue using specialised 3D printers. This tissue can be used to produce skin for grafts, or cartilage for joints, for example. Methods of bioprinting differ but the underlying principle involves using genetic material or ""bio inks"" the way a normal printer uses ordinary ink, along with a ""scaffolding"" material to join the genetic material together to form specific shapes. One bioprinting specialist, Aspect Biosystems, recently formed a partnership with Johnson & Johnson to develop 3D-printed knee meniscus tissue - the thin, fibrous cartilage between some of your joints. ""In the next 10 to 15 years, I believe we will see the first truly cell-containing bioprinted 3D tissues that are approved for use as implantable tissue therapeutics,"" says Tamer Mohamed, chief executive at Aspect Biosystems. Tamer Mohamed (right) thinks bioprinted tissue will be used for transplants in the future As well as cartilage and organs, the synthetic additions to our bodies could one day include ""nanobots"" - tiny programmable bio-machines patrolling our blood streams looking for cancer cells and bacteria to kill, just as our white blood cells do. Arizona State University (ASU) scientists, in collaboration with researchers from the National Centre for Nanoscience and Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently programmed nanobots to shrink tumours by cutting off their blood supply. Unlike machine robots made of mechanical parts, these nanobots were designed using ""DNA origami"", a technique involving DNA being folded into shapes. Each one was made from a flat, rectangular DNA origami sheet, 90 nanometres by 60 nanometres - a nanometre is a billionth of a metre - and a blood-clotting enzyme, called thrombin, was attached to their surface. In the first such test on mammals of its kind, the team injected cancer cells into a mouse to create a tumour, then injected the nanobots. The polymer sheets are rolled up and carry their chemical payload to the cancer They started working within hours, blocking the tumour's blood supply and shrinking it after a two-week course of treatment. Hao Yan, director of the ASU Biodesign Institute's Centre for Molecular Design and Biomimetics, says the next step will be to perform a human trial, which should be in the next three-to-five years. ""This result represents only the beginning stages of nano-medicine,"" he says, ""and we are particularly excited because this technology is a strategy that can be used for many types of cancer, since all solid tumour-feeding blood vessels are essentially the same."" Synthetics are also being marshalled in the fight against antimicrobial resistance - when antibiotics become ineffective against new strains of ""superbug"". These superbugs kill around 700,000 people a year worldwide, says the UK Review on Antimicrobial Resistance. By 2050, 10 million people could die each year if existing antibiotics continue to lose their effectiveness, the report suggests. Step forward ""ninja polymers"" - synthetic bacteria killers. The synthetic ""ninja"" polymers attack superbugs and stop them multiplying Scientists at IBM Research Almaden in California, working with Singapore's Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology of the Agency for Science, have developed a synthetic molecule polymer designed to kill five deadly types of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The polymer works by binding itself to the infectious material, making its way inside the outer membrane, then turning the liquid inside the bacteria into solid material. Crucially, this happens so fast that the bacteria don't have time to reproduce and pass on any resistance. The team tested the polymers on mice infected with five hard-to-treat multi-drug resistant bacteria - the results showed that the bacteria were destroyed. One of the men leading the research, Dr James Hedrick, says the team is also developing the tech for use in cancer therapy, with hopefully far fewer side effects. ""In each case, the therapeutics are highly selective to their target without detectable side reactions,"" he says.

Dr Bertalan Mesko, director of The Medical Futurist Institute, says medicine has been lagging behind in the technology stakes for far too long. ""While many industries stepped into the 21st Century, healthcare hasn't. Millions of patients are on transplantation waiting lists; clinical trials that put new drugs on the market sometimes take a decade and cost billions of dollars."" These advances in synthetics promise the targeting and customisation of treatments to an individual's genetic and molecular background, says Dr Mesko.

"Mack is best known for playing the role of Chloe Sullivan on Smallville's decade-long run Allison Mack, a US actress known for the TV show Smallville, has appeared in court on charges of aiding a sex trafficking operation disguised as a mentoring group. Keith Raniere, the leader of the so-called self-help group, was arrested by the FBI in Mexico in March. Ms Mack is accused of helping him to recruit women who were then exploited ""both sexually and for their labour"", the New York prosecuting attorney said. She pleaded not guilty to all charges. At a brief hearing on Friday evening in a Brooklyn federal court, the judge ordered Ms Mack, 35, to be held in custody.   She will appear in court again on Monday. 'Sex-slave' group leader arrested by FBI The society was supposed to empower and strengthen the women who joined it, according to prosecutors. But they allege Mr Raniere oversaw a ""slave and master"" system in his group called Nxivm, where female members were expected to have sex with him and were branded with his initials. ""Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere,"" Richard Donoghue, US attorney for the Eastern District in New York, said in a statement. Keith Raniere was detained in Mexico, where he has reportedly been living for several months Prosecutors allege that Nxivm has the features of a pyramid scheme, in which members pay ""thousands of dollars"" for courses to rise within its ranks. ""Mack directly or implicitly required her slaves... to engage in sexual activity with Raniere,"" the statement from the attorney's office claims. ""In exchange for this, Mack received financial and other benefits."" If found guilty, both Ms Mack and Mr Raniere, who has been charged with sex trafficking and is being held without bail, face at least 15 years in prison. Allison Mack was a mainstay of the popular Superman series Smallville, which ran from 2001 to 2011. Within Nxivm, a smaller group called DOS - or Dominus Obsequious Sororium - was created. The quasi-Latin phrase roughly translates as Master Over the Slave Women. The group encouraged women to recruit new slaves ""who in turn owed service not only to their own masters, but also to masters above them"" in the pyramid scheme, prosecutors say. Mr Raniere, 57, is alleged to have stood at the top of that pyramid, as the only man, with Ms Mack at the top level of women, immediately below him. Investigators say Mr Raniere had a rotating group of 15 to 20 sexual partners, who were not allowed to discuss their relationship with him or have one with anyone else. Compliance was assured in part through the use of ""collateral"" which had to be provided when joining - which prosecutors said included damaging information about friends or family, nude photographs, or rights to assets. They allege that ""slaves"" in the group had to eat extremely low-calorie diets because of Mr Raniere's preference for thin women. ""Under the guise of female empowerment, [Ms Mack] starved women until they fit her co-defendant's sexual ideal, and she targeted vulnerable women,"" prosecutor Moira Kim Penza said at Friday's hearing. In late March, Smallville co-star, Kristin Kreuk was forced to deny rumours she had acted as a recruiter for Mr Raniere. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The existence of the group's darker side came to widespread attention in October 2017, when the New York Times published a story including interviews with former members and their families.

"Hundreds of CFM56-7B engines will be checked worldwide US and European aviation authorities have ordered emergency inspections of jet engines similar to the one involved in a fatal accident earlier this week. A female passenger died after she was nearly sucked from the cabin of a Southwest Airlines flight en route from New York to Dallas on Tuesday. Investigators say there was a fault with the engine's fan blades. Almost 700 Boeing 737 engines will need to be inspected worldwide over the next 20 days, regulators say. ""Fan blade failure due to cracking... could result in an engine in-flight shutdown, uncontained release of debris, [and] possible airplane decompression,"" the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement announcing the inspections. Fan blades that have undergone a certain number of flights will be given ultrasonic tests, they added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, a Boeing 737 which was carrying 149 people, was forced to make an emergency landing at Philadelphia airport following a fault with one of its CFM56-7B engines. An initial investigation found evidence of metal fatigue where a fan blade had broken off, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Why you should listen to flight safety demos 'American hero' lands stricken airliner Pilot: 'Someone went out' of the window The CFM56-7B engine is in use on more than 8,000 Boeing 737 planes worldwide, the manufacturer says. NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that a fan blade had broken off due to metal fatigue and that a second fracture had been recorded about halfway along its length. He could not say if the incident indicated a fleet-wide issue with the Boeing 737-700. The airliner made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport Mr Sumwalt also said a casing on the engine was meant to contain any parts that come loose but, due to the speed at impact, the metal was able to penetrate the shell. The FAA did not say how many engines would be inspected. It said that any fan blades that failed the inspection would have to be replaced. In 2016,a Southwest Airlines flight made a safe emergency landing in Florida after a fan blade separated from a similar CFM engine.,external Debris ripped a hole more than a foot long in the fuselage of the jet above the left wing, causing cabin decompression. An investigation into that incident also found signs of metal fatigue, according to the NTSB. Related aviation stories: A timeline of air disasters since 1998 Why do planes crash?

Shrapnel from the shredded engine smashed the window next to her causing rapid decompression in the cabin that nearly blasted her out of the jet. Other passengers pulled her back in and tried to revive her but she died from her injuries. Philadelphia's medical examiner said on Wednesday that Ms Riordan had died of blunt impact trauma to her head, neck and torso. Seven other passengers were slightly injured. Ms Riordan was the first passenger to die in an accident on a US commercial airliner since 2009. This video can not be played Air traffic control: ""I'm sorry, you said there is a hole?"" About 20 minutes after the twin-engine Boeing 737 took off, shrapnel pierced the passenger compartment causing the plane to lose pressure and rapidly descend. With oxygen masks over their mouths, passengers screamed and braced for impact. For a few seconds, the aircraft rolled to an angle of 41 degrees before levelling out and starting an emergency descent, federal investigators said on Wednesday. ""Southwest 1380, we're single engine,"" the pilot radioed to air traffic control. ""We have part of the aircraft missing so we're going to need to slow down a bit,"" she said, adding that some passengers had been hurt. ""Injured passengers, okay, and is your airplane physically on fire?"" asks a male voice in the tower, according to a recording released by officials. ""No, it's not on fire, but part of it's missing,"" the pilot, Capt Tammie Jo Shults, replies. ""They said there's a hole, and uh, someone went out,"" she calmly adds.

"Kim Jong-un says there is no need for further missile tests North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says he has suspended all missile tests and will shut down a nuclear test site. ""From 21 April, North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles,"" the country's state news agency said. Mr Kim said further tests were unnecessary because Pyongyang's nuclear capabilities had been ""verified"". The surprise announcement comes as North Korea prepares for historic talks with South Korea and the US. Mr Kim is due to meet his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in next week for the first inter-Korean summit in over a decade, and US President Donald Trump by June. Both countries have been pushing Pyongyang to denuclearise and they reacted positively to the latest development. ""This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress!""

On Thursday, the US leader said there was a ""bright path available to North Korea when it achieves denuclearisation"". A spokesperson for the South Korean president called the North's move ""meaningful progress"". ""It will also contribute to creating a very positive environment for the success of the upcoming South-North summit and North-United States summit,"" a statement from Mr Moon's office said. North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's nuclear programme explained Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? This video can not be played The news was announced on North Korean state TV China, North Korea's main ally, also welcomed the move, saying it would ""help ameliorate the situation on the peninsula"". The decision to suspend missile launches was made during a meeting of the ruling party's central committee on Friday, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. In a statement quoted by the agency, Mr Kim said it was no longer necessary to conduct missile tests because ""nuclear weaponisation"" had been achieved. ""The northern nuclear test site has completed its mission,"" he said. This echoes a previous statement made during a New Year address in whichMr Kim declared his nuclear and ballistic missile programmes completed. After six nuclear tests North Korea may feel it does not need to upgrade its existing designs, says the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul. Although Pyongyang said it would abolish its nuclear test site, there is no indication it is planning to get rid of its existing weapons. The decision to halt missile tests is also aimed at pursuing economic growth, according to KCNA. Mr Kim reportedly pledged to ""concentrate all efforts"" on developing a socialist economy during Friday's meeting. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? By Ankit Panda, senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists These concessions from North Korea have come before the two anticipated summits with the US and South Korea. One may wonder why Mr Kim should give up so much in advance instead of hanging on to a nuclear test-ban and an ICBM moratorium as aces up his sleeve. The answer is simple: a summit with a US president is enough of a prize in itself. For Mr Kim, it's something that neither his grandfather nor his father could attain. What North Korea loses by demolishing its nuclear test site and submitting to a unilateral moratorium on ICBM launches is entirely tolerable compared to what Mr Kim gains by sitting alongside President Trump. Read Ankit Panda's full analysis here Mr Trump surprised the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader. He has said the summit will take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites are under consideration. Experts have speculated that a location for talks could be the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea, another Asian country, or a neutral European country. Speaking on Thursday, President Trump said that if he did not think the meeting would be successful he would not go, and if the meeting went ahead but was not productive, he would walk out. ""Our campaign of maximum pressure will continue until North Korea denuclearises,"" he said. This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts North Korea has carried out numerous missile tests. Some of these exploded shortly after launch, but others travelled for hundreds of miles before landing in the sea. Here are some of the major tests reported so far: 12 February 2017- A medium-range ballistic missile launched from Banghyon air base near the west coast. It flew east towards the Sea of Japan for about 500km. 4 July 2017- Pyongyang claimed to have successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time. Officials said it reached an altitude of 2,802km and flew for 39 minutes. 29 August 2017- North Korea fired what is thought to be its first nuclear-weapon capable ballistic missile over Japan. It was launched from near Pyongyang and reached a height of about 550km. 15 September 2017- A ballistic missile was fired across Japan for the second time and landed in the sea off Hokkaido. It reached an altitude of about 770km and travelled 3,700km. 29 November 2017- North Korea said it had successfully tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the whole of the continental US. The Hwasong-15 missile landed in Japanese waters but flew higher than any other missile the North had previously tested.

"Back in 1994, when Tina Turner was moving into her new home in Switzerland, a couple of advertising copywriters in London were having a terrible time trying to come up with a strapline for a wood varnish product. Their creative juices were flowing all right, but the client wasn't buying any of their fancy-pants puns or arty references. He wanted something more direct, less hyperbolic. Saying it was ""Simply the Best"" accompanied by Tina Turner belting out her 1989 hit obviously wasn't going to do the trick. So instead they settled on: ""Ronseal Woodstain - it does exactly what it says on the tin."" It was hardly Shakespearian but it worked. Which you could also say about The Tina Turner Musical, a West End jukebox show that does exactly what it saysâ¦ Except. And this is a major exception. Except for the titular performance given by Adrienne Warren. Adrienne Warren as Tina Turner, and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Ike Turner The American actress is not unlike the chap in the Ronseal ads, in that she is not a household name. Yet. She will be though. And that's because very few performers have the ability to transform the ordinary into extraordinary in the way she does with this show. Warren is a 24-carat, all singing, all dancing, bona fide star. She starts slow and a little tentative; reflecting the early steps Anna-Mae Bullock was taking on her journey to becoming Tina Turner. At 17, Anna-Mae meets Ike Turner (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith) who schmoozes her mother (Zelma Bullock) and then abuses her gifted daughter. For 16 years. Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Ike Turner, with Madeline Appiah as Tina's mother Zelma Bullock The early Ike and Tina scenes see him forcibly shaping his musical protegee. Cymbals fly and a menacing finger is wagged in what feels like a direct lift from J.K. Simmons's merciless jazz teacher in Damien Chazelle's Oscar-winning movie Whiplash. The show stutters at this point but then bursts into sonic life when we first hear Warren give full vent to her voice. It is as if she's drawing up the sound from deep within the earth and releasing it in a controlled eruption with a Janis Joplin-meets-Tina-Turner growl. She is, Ike tells us, ""spitting fire"". Hannah Jay-Allan, Adrienne Warren, Perola Congo and Sia Kiwa (Tina and the Ikettes) The hits - 23 in all - are rolled out in a reasonably subtle manner (not always the case with this type of fare), woven, as they are, into the chronology of her life story, which is told through Katori Hall's rather disappointingly two-dimensional script. I say disappointing, because Hall is generally a very good writer and you'd have thought Tina Turner's tumultuous life story would have provided a feast of opportunities into which she could sink her playwriting teeth. What we have is a serviceable script elegantly staged by the experienced and astute Phyllida Lloyd (Mamma Mia!), who uses an uncluttered, layered, geometric set to good effect. Adrienne Warren as Tina Turner with the cast on the layered, geometric set She has had to overcome one of the trickier aspects of staging a musical production, which is to figure out a workable plan for getting actors and objects on and off stage in a seamless manner. It is a technical problem that is exacerbated in this production by the frequency and speed of the costume changes Warren is required to make. There are a couple of occasions where Lloyd appears to have been so flummoxed by the logistics of it all that she's given up, leaving the unfortunate Warren to strip to her underwear and perform an awkward costume change in front of the audience. There are other moments though, when you sit back and enjoy the intelligence and wit of her direction. Most memorably in a scene in which Phil Spector (Tom Godwin) takes over from Ike as Tina's producer and has her sing River Deep Mountain High with such intensity and ferocity that there is absolutely nothing left of the song when she's finally done. Phil Spector (Tom Godwin) who takes over from Ike as Tina Turner's producer If this show had premiered on Broadway and not the West End, the audience would have risen as one and given her a standing ovation at this point. But this is low-key London not noisy New York, so we sat still. Until, that is, Warren donned her big 1980s Tina wig and started to belt out The Best. Adrienne Warren as Tina Turner Nobody could resist that. Up we all went with a gentle side-to-side sway and the occasional self-conscious shoulder inflection. I turned round and saw the lady herself three rows back beaming from ear-to-ear. She'd enjoyed the show. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the show. The star of the show embraces Tina Turner OK, it's not Hamilton, but then, nothing is Hamilton. But it is a decent alternative for fans of the musical genre who can't get tickets to Lin-Manuel Miranda's blockbuster and are in need of a fix. You never know, The Tina Turner Musical might just run as long as those Ronseal ads.

"This video can not be played The protest against pension changes have escalated in recent days Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega has said his government is willing to review the pension reforms that have triggered violent protests since they were were approved on Wednesday. Mr Ortega has offered talks, but business leaders have rebuffed him, saying police violence must stop first. At least 10 people have been killed in clashes between police and protesters. Government buildings have been damaged or set on fire, and troops have been deployed in several cities. This is the biggest challenge to Mr Ortega's authority since he took office in 2007. Mr Ortega won the 2016 election along with his wife, Rosario Murillo, who became Nicaragua's vice-president It follows legislation that increased pension contributions for workers and employers and reduced overall benefits. ""If in the talks we find a better way of carrying out these reforms, this decree can be amended or replaced by a new one,"" said Mr Ortega on national television. He said the measures do not go into effect until 1 July, which gives the government and the private sector time to negotiate. However, Nicaragua's powerful business association, Cosep, has released a statement saying it will not join talks with the government until police violence ceases and freedom of speech is restored. Mr Ortega has accused parts of the opposition of inciting violence and plotting to topple his left-wing government. The violence began on Wednesday, when pensioners took to the streets in the capital Managua. They were joined the next day by thousands of students and workers. At least 100 people have been injured. The dead include two protesters and a policeman who were killed in Managua on Friday, after demonstrations turned violent. The protests appeared to be largely led by students Who is Daniel Ortega? Nicaragua's first lady The unrest continued into Friday night in several cities. The government seemed to have the situation under control on Saturday, with deployment of army troops across the country. Protesters have accused riot police and government supporters of initiating the violence. Independent TV stations say they have been taken off-air after broadcasting the demonstrations live.

That's not something that happens that often during a DJ set (who needs to see the stage anyway?) but it was a testament to Avicii's ability to enchant an audience. Confetti cannons and bass drops aside, his shows encapsulated the inclusive, everyone-welcome philosophy that led him to collaborate with Coldplay, Nile Rodgers and Antony and the Johnsons as well as bluegrass and metal musicians in the studio. That final show, at Ushuaia Ibiza, was a two-hour greatest hits set, featuring crowd pleasers like Levels and Wake Me Up alongside his remixes of Robyn and Dizzee Rascal. But the DJ, who famously let the cat out of the bag when he revealed most major DJs pre-programmed their sets (comments he later walked back), was also known for dropping unexpected, whimsical tracks into his performances. A bit of Smokey Robinson here; a dash of Chicago there. He approached it all with an energy and optimism that permeated his own recordings. It's no surprise he was one of the most beloved DJs on the circuit. More about Avicii on BBC Music To Billboard Magazine in 2016: ""When I look back on my life, I think: whoa, did I do that? It was the best time of my life in a sense. It came with a price - a lot of stress, a lot of anxiety for me - but it was the best journey of my life"" Post-retirement on his website: ""[Creating music], that is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do... The next stage will be all about my love of making music to you guys. It is the beginning of something new."" Prelude to music video for hit The Nights: ""When I was 16, my father said, 'You can do anything you want with your life, you just have to be willing to work hard to get it.' That's when I decided when I die, I want to be remembered for the life I live, not the money I make.""

"More than 10,000 people in the UK suffer from cystic fibrosis, which causes fatal lung damage Health ministers have urged a pharmaceutical company to drop the price of a life-changing cystic fibrosis (CF) drug for NHS patients. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Orkambicosts Â£100,000 a year per patient, and has been deemed too expensive for the NHS. The company rejected an NHS England counter offer, saying it was not enough to fund research into future medicines. Health ministers Steve Brine and Lord O'Shaughnessy said ""time was of the essence"" for CF patients. Vertex said it wants to reach an agreement ""as soon as possible"". Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening genetic condition that causes fatal lung damage and affects around 10,400 people in the UK. Only around half of those with the condition live to celebrate their 40th birthday. Orkambi is prescribed for people with the F508del mutation, which causes the production of an abnormal protein that disrupts how water and chloride are transported in the body. The drug has been shown in clinical trials to improve lung function and respiratory symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which helps decide which treatments should be available on the NHS in England and Wales, rejected the drug in 2016 on cost grounds. Vertex has since urged the NHS to act ""in the best interest"" of cystic fibrosis patients. 'I lost my two sisters to cystic fibrosis' Orkambi drug means 'I can plan for my future' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, cystic fibrosis sufferer Lynsey Beswick said: ""The median life expectancy for someone like myself is just 31 years old - I'm 35. ""People like myself just don't have time to wait for these decisions. ""This is a really urgent issue and people like myself need access [to Orkambi] as soon as possible."" The letter from the health ministers to Simon Bedson, senior vice president of Vertex, follows a debate in the House of Commons about access to the drug last month. They wrote: ""To reiterate the heartfelt and vitally important points made in the debate, and in the many letters we have received from patients suffering from this disease and their friends and families, time really is of the essence. ""Therefore we ask you as a matter of the utmost urgency to proceed with negotiations in a way that is constructive and supports our joint aim of securing access to your medicines currently licensed in the UK at a price that is cost-effective and fair."" The letter continued: ""We urge that you provide all available data supporting the cost-effectiveness of your proposal promptly to ensure progress towards an agreement."" In response Vertex issued a statement saying they were pleased there was an agreement ""to get our medicines to cystic fibrosis patients as soon as possible"". The company said a meeting was planned with ministers soon.

"Fifteen military airfields have been earmarked for closure over the next six years with the potential loss of thousands of jobs, MPs have warned. The all-party group on general aviation says they are a vital national asset which once closed will never be replaced. Most of the airfields, which are used by private pilots and flight training firms, will be sold off for housing. The government said the sites will be used to help the local economy. The all-party group has written to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, urging him to consider keeping them open for private planes and allowing them to be brought back into military use if needed. The group's chairman, Conservative MP Grant Shapps, said general aviation - the name given to all non-commercial flying - was worth Â£3bn a year to the UK economy,citing government figures.,external ""At a time when the UK and our allies are facing significant global threats and uncertainties,"" said Mr Shapps, MPs were ""deeply concerned"" to see the Ministry of Defence disposing of military aerodromes across the country. He claimed air traffic control and flight training firms were moving their operations abroad due to a lack of airfields in the UK - and the planning system meant it was effectively impossible to build new ones. Mr Shapps, a former housing minister, holds a pilot's licence - he said he recognised the need to build more new homes but the airfields were ""large sites"" that could retain runways and outbuildings. The airfields earmarked for closure are: Abingdon, Oxfordshire Alconbury, Cambridgeshire Arbroath, Angus Brawdy, Pembrokeshire Chivenor, Devon Colerne, Wiltshire Dishforth, North Yorkshire Halton, Buckinghamshire Henlow, Bedfordshire Mildenhall, Suffolk Molesworth, Cambridgeshire North Luffenham, Rutland Wethersfield, Essex Woodbridge, Suffolk Wyton, Cambridgeshire A Ministry of Defence spokesman said around Â£300m is planned to be spent on key RAF sites across the UK. He said that a defence minister will ""be pleased to meet"" with the parliamentary group on aviation. The spokesman added: ""Where airfields are no longer required, we will work closely with potential buyers and the local council to make sure that the sites' future use best meets the needs of the local economy, including providing thousands of much-needed new housing or their potential for use as civilian airfields.""

"The updated map shows red dog icons where mess has been seen and green ones where it has been cleared, along with the location of bins A village ""poo-shaming"" scheme designed to combat dog fouling could soon be seen across the country. Residents in Wimblington, Cambridgeshire,hit the headlines with the interactive mapshowing the locations of unwanted deposits. Creator Amanda Carlin said media attention had drawn interest from as far away as Kuwait. In response, a ""how-to"" pack has been created and sent to about 60 councils and community groups. The scheme, dubbed Doodoowatch, encourages users to report dog mess sightings. Once logged, the poo's location is marked on an online map, alerting public-spirited locals or the district council's street cleaning team. Mrs Carlin and other dedicated doodoo-watchers have made an instruction manual to help others join the fight against faeces. Amanda Carlin, who started ""doodoo-watching"", says she always carries extra poop bags to clear up after pet Molly It includes advice on how to engage the community in the project, create a map and signage, liaise with authorities and deal with negative social media comments. Doodoowatch guides have been sent to more than 60 councils and community groups as far afield as Cornwall, Yorkshire and Sussex, Mrs Carlin said. Hazel Walton, from Euxton in Lancashire, is part of a community group which has taken up the scheme. ""I clean up after my very large dog and it bothers me that others don't,"" she said. ""This is about reporting it and shaming people into doing something - anything we can do to try to change local attitudes."" Dog's 'cancer' turns out to be teddies Copperfield forced to reveal magic trick No the BBC is not reporting the end of the world Zena Aris-Sutton, from New Mills in Derbyshire, said they run a litter-pick group in the area and have picked up 100 bags of dog mess in just one two-hour stint. She said the Doodoowatch appealed as it had structure, comedy, enabled people to feel they are ""actively doing something"" and would provide information to share with the council. Mrs Carlin said she was ""delighted"" others have been inspired by what they have done and they can ""help them at no charge"".

"Hundreds of CFM56-7B engines will be checked worldwide US and European aviation authorities have ordered emergency inspections of jet engines similar to the one involved in a fatal accident earlier this week. A female passenger died after she was nearly sucked from the cabin of a Southwest Airlines flight en route from New York to Dallas on Tuesday. Investigators say there was a fault with the engine's fan blades. Almost 700 Boeing 737 engines will need to be inspected worldwide over the next 20 days, regulators say. ""Fan blade failure due to cracking... could result in an engine in-flight shutdown, uncontained release of debris, [and] possible airplane decompression,"" the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement announcing the inspections. Fan blades that have undergone a certain number of flights will be given ultrasonic tests, they added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, a Boeing 737 which was carrying 149 people, was forced to make an emergency landing at Philadelphia airport following a fault with one of its CFM56-7B engines. An initial investigation found evidence of metal fatigue where a fan blade had broken off, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Why you should listen to flight safety demos 'American hero' lands stricken airliner Pilot: 'Someone went out' of the window The CFM56-7B engine is in use on more than 8,000 Boeing 737 planes worldwide, the manufacturer says. NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that a fan blade had broken off due to metal fatigue and that a second fracture had been recorded about halfway along its length. He could not say if the incident indicated a fleet-wide issue with the Boeing 737-700. The airliner made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport Mr Sumwalt also said a casing on the engine was meant to contain any parts that come loose but, due to the speed at impact, the metal was able to penetrate the shell. The FAA did not say how many engines would be inspected. It said that any fan blades that failed the inspection would have to be replaced. In 2016,a Southwest Airlines flight made a safe emergency landing in Florida after a fan blade separated from a similar CFM engine.,external Debris ripped a hole more than a foot long in the fuselage of the jet above the left wing, causing cabin decompression.

"Kim Jong-un's announcement that North Korea is to halt nuclear and missile tests immediately comes as he prepares for two major diplomatic events. Analyst Ankit Panda asks what the North Korean leader hopes to gain with his latest move. North Korea's declaration will no doubt lead to effusive headlines touting an end to nuclear and long-range missile testing, but a look at the country's historical record and the context of its nuclear and missiles programme suggests that we might temper our expectations. First, regarding nuclear testing, the statement released on Saturday makes clear that the reason Kim Jong-un is submitting voluntarily to a testing freeze and to the closing of the Punggye-ri nuclear testing site - the scene of all six of North Korea's nuclear tests since 2006 - is because he feels that his country has mastered the design of nuclear weapons. Although difficult to verify, this claim is not obviously an exaggeration or unbelievable. Consider that India and Pakistan, by 1998, had each conducted six nuclear tests and are now counted among the pantheon of nuclear weapons possessors, without conducting further tests. North Korea, with an additional eight years of access to knowledge available in open source material concerning nuclear weapons design, can feel similarly comfortable with its six nuclear tests. North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's nuclear programme explained Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? On a more granular level, North Korea's fifth and sixth nuclear tests - in September 2016 and 2017 respectively - marked important benchmarks. The September 2016 test, according to North Korean state media, involved a standardized and compact nuclear device, one that could be mounted on any of its various short, medium, intermediate, and intercontinental-range missiles (ICBMs). Kim Jong-un has taken a close personal interest in the North Korean missile programme The expected yield - or explosive power - of those weapons might be of the order of two-to-three times the weapon that the United States used against Nagasaki in the final days of the World War Two -  but that's quite powerful enough for North Korea's purposes. More seriously, North Korea's most recent nuclear test demonstrated that it had the capability to generate seriously powerful nuclear yields. While independent experts and various national intelligence agencies haven't reached a consensus on whether North Korea had truly mastered a thermonuclear bomb design, as it claimed to have done, the seismic data recorded on 3 September 2017 gave the world enough information to conclude that North Korea had a nuclear device capable of ""city-busting"" explosive yields. The bottom line is that just as Kim Jong-un's recent trip to Beijing was a show of strength - a signal that he felt comfortable enough in his consolidated domestic power to leave North Korea - so too is the declaration of a nuclear test ban a sign that he feels renewed confidence. Regarding his missiles, Kim has said that he will no longer test ICBMs. On the one hand, that's surprising. North Korea has conducted just three tests in total of missiles that could deliver nuclear weapons to the contiguous United States. None of these tests have involved a missile flying on a trajectory similar to what might be necessary for a nuclear strike, leaving further flight-testing something of a necessity for North Korea to become sufficiently confident in its ability to strike the US homeland. But North Korea may have other plans. For instance, while it has mastered most of what is necessary on a technical level to threaten the United States, its missile forces continue to be limited by a small number of launchers. Currently, North Korea has probably only six launch vehicles for its ICBMs. Even though Kim Jong-un, during his 2018 New Year's address, declared his nuclear forces ""complete,"" there is good reason to believe that he would want to increase his ICBM launchers and even work on components of North Korea's nuclear command and control systems. North Korea may now want to concentrate on developing launch vehicles, not missiles themselves Tactically, then, submitting to a self-imposed ICBM flight-testing ban would have limited costs. Ultimately, these test bans are restricted in their extent. The nuclear test ban could be made credible by a bona fide gesture at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. North Korea, for instance, could demolish its test tunnels; the statement released on Saturday notes only  that the site will be ""dismantled"". But as long as North Korea hangs on to its missiles, it can break its self-imposed ban with little warning. In 1999, North Korea submitted to a missile testing moratorium, but that eventually broke down in 2006, a few years after the collapse of the 1994 Agreed Framework. Beyond the bans, Mr Kim used the latest Central Committee meeting to tout the success of his fundamental national strategic project, which is summarized in what he has called the byungjin line. This concept refers to the simultaneous development of a powerful state nuclear force alongside a more prosperous economy. On Saturday, Kim Jng-un clearly indicated that with the cessation of nuclear testing, he will ""concentrate all the efforts on building a powerful socialist economy and markedly improving the standard of people's living."" That should be taken seriously. North Korea will seek relief from international sanctions at the forthcoming summits to realise this objective. The concessions from North Korea have come before the two anticipated summits with the United States and South Korea. The meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim comes just months after the pair exchanged deeply personal insults One may wonder why Mr Kim should give up so much in advance instead of hanging on to a nuclear test-ban and an ICBM moratorium as aces up his sleeve to give up when he meets US President Donald Trump. The answer is simple:  a summit with a US president is enough of a prize in itself. For Mr Kim, it's something that neither his grandfather nor his father could attain. In the end, what North Korea loses by demolishing its nuclear test site and submitting to a unilateral moratorium on ICBM launches is entirely tolerable compared to what Mr Kim gains by sitting alongside President Trump. Reading KCNA's announcements on Saturday, there is also absolutely no hint of the ""denuclearization"" intent that South Korean officials have been eager to tout on North Korea's behalf. On the contrary, North Korea's announcement sounds like the declamations of a nuclear weapons state - one that has no intention of giving up those weapons which give the country its ultimate guarantee of survival. Even though President Trump has lauded Mr Kim's move as ""big progress,"" the sooner he recognises Kim's ultimate objectives, the better.

"The meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim comes just months after the pair exchanged deeply personal insults US President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in what appears to be a breakthrough after months of insults, threats and mutual hostility. It could happen as early as May which leaves little time to get things organised, from venues to core negotiations. So it's perhaps not surprising that there are many questions about what happens next. The talks would be unprecedented, marking the first face-to-face meeting between sitting leaders of North Korea and the US.  Former US presidents have met North Korean leaders before, but they were all out of office at that point. ""The [significance of this] could almost be compared to President Nixon meeting China's Chairman Mao, to a lesser degree,"" analyst Michael Madden of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins SAIS told the BBC. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un Not much. The White House has confirmed that Trump will meet Kim ""by May"", but an exact time and location is yet to be determined. According to Mr Madden, there's a ""speculative chance"" that the meeting might take place at the North Korean truce village of Panmunjom, which sits at the demilitarised zone between the North and the South. However, Dr John Park of the Korea Working Group says that he believes the meeting might instead be held ""in a neutral location"". This could be in China or elsewhere. Analysis: The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full Are North and South Korea friends again? This is the first time the US has been in direct talks with North Korea about its nuclear program since 2012. Kim Jong-un has never met another foreign leader until now, though he is scheduled to meet South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in April at Panmunjom. Denuclearisation will undoubtedly be the biggest issue that the meeting will hope to address. But while Mr Kim says he is ""committed to denuclearisation"", North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. ""The US will be pushing for total denuclearisation and South Korea has also said that it is their main objective,"" said Bruce Bennett, an analyst at the RAND Corporation. ""But it's important to remember that Mr Kim has said over and over again that they will not give up their nuclear weapons."" North Korea has rapidly advanced its nuclear missile programme Other points that might be brought up are: US pushing for Americans held in Pyongyang to be brought home, North Korea looking for recognition as a nuclear-capable state and a possible peace treaty being signed. ""A peace treaty would give North Korea reassurance and deprive them of one of the key rationales behind their nuclear program [that they have to defend themselves],"" said Mr Madden. But one of the terms of a potential peace treaty could be the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, a move which could prove deeply problematic. ""I think Mr Kim anticipates that if a peace treaty is signed, that after say 10 years most of the US troops in South Korea could be withdrawn,"" said Mr Bennett. ""Then maybe if later on he then wanted to forcefully reunify South Korea, [it would be easier] as the US troops would be gone. This would be the safest way to reach his objective."" Analysts agree that it is hard to predict the extent to which sanctions will be lifted or eased, adding that it is dependent on how successful the talks are. ""North Korea is definitely looking for sanctions relief, that will be a key demand of theirs,"" said Mr Bennett. ""The question is, would we lift sanctions in an incremental manner or are we going to insist on total denuclearisation before we lift?"" Mr Bennett also believes that the harsh sanctions placed on North Korea had real effect in bringing them to the table. ""There were reports that North Korea was going to possibly run out of hard currency by this October. So I think the campaign was really causing some pain in the North."" A successful meeting would see an ""agreement"" being signed by all parties, according to Mr Madden. ""If they can reach a point that has certain tangible achievements, like North Korea agreeing to a freeze in nuclear test activities and letting international inspectors in to the country to view their nuclear facilities that would be a success,"" said Mr Madden. But Mr Bennett argues that it is more likely that both sides would reach a compromise where they had ""given things up but also gained"". ""The worst case scenario is North Korea walking out of talks and claiming it's because Trump is being totally unresponsive and the US is being difficult,"" said Mr Bennett. South Korean delegates had earlier met Mr Kim in Pyongyang But a more plausible scenario is the US and North Korea simply failing to make any progress at all. ""I call it the 'kick the can down the road' policy, we just delay discussing this until further down the line with another US President,"" said Mr Bennett. ""By say 2030, North Korea could have 200 nuclear weapons and what happens then if they force the South to surrender? If we kick the can again we're going to have a bigger problem a few years down the road.""

"A fictional video reporting the onset of thermonuclear war and featuring BBC News branding has been shared widely. It is not real but alarmed viewers have contacted the BBC, apparently convinced it is true. On YouTube, the company behind the video clearly stated it was fiction before their account was removed. But on WhatsApp, where the video has been passed on without that clarification, some users were fooled. This is not what the end of the world looks like Opening with a familiar shot of the BBC newsroom, a grim-faced presenter announces a ""serious incident between Russia and Nato"". ""Although the details are uncertain, early reports indicate that a Russian surveillance aircraft was fired upon by naval vessels of Nato forces,"" the presenter says. As the report progresses, the incident escalates to the point where Russian warships have fired on Nato targets, the Royal Family has been moved, an emergency broadcast advises everyone else to stay at home and thermonuclear war erupts, destroying the German city of Mainz and part of Frankfurt. Again, this is a work of fiction. It is nicely produced, but there are several key giveaways. Although BBC branding is used in the video, the font, style and layout is very different. If you are sent a video on WhatsApp which appears to be from a major media organisation but you are not sure, search for it on the organisation's website. In this instance, if thermonuclear war was breaking out in much of the world and the BBC had reported on it, it is likely the news would be mentioned on the website and would be corroborated by other news organisations. How to report fake news to social media The YouTube account where the video was uploaded has been closed The video features actor Mark Ryes and was produced for an Irish company in 2016. Mr Ryes told the BBC: ""It was created by a company called Benchmarking Assessment Group as a psychometric test for their clients to see how they'd react in a disaster scenario. ""On the original YouTube posting it says very clearly that it's fictional. It doesn't even look like a genuine BBC News report. It was never meant to. ""As an actor playing this role, I recorded the video against a green screen. I had no part in the editing or production of the final piece."" Mr Ryes sent his recorded material to David Ringwood, Benchmarking Assessment Group's head of assessment services. According to the company website, Benchmarking Assessment Group was ""founded in 2006 in Ireland"" and works with clients to develop ""methodologies in assessment for selection, development and talent management"". Mr Ringwood had not responded to requests for comment at the time of writing. Syria war: The online activists pushing conspiracy theories The people who think governments control the weather The people who think mass shootings are staged On Thursday morning the BBC press office tweeted it was aware of a video clip ""claiming to be a BBC news report about Nato and Russia... circulating widely"".

""However, this information isn't being repeated when it's being shared, hence our tweet,"" it continued. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Synthetic technology could help medicine become much more targeted With advances in stem cell research and nanotechnology helping us fight illnesses from heart disease to superbugs, is the fusion of biology and technology speeding us towards a sci-fi future - part human, part synthetic? In Ridley Scott's seminal blockbuster Blade Runner, humanity has harnessed bio-engineering to create a race of replicants that look, act and sound human - but are made entirely from synthetic material. We may be far from realising that sci-fi future, but synthetics are beginning to have a  profound effect on medicine. At their state-of-the-art laboratories in Hong Kong, scientists from Canadian company Novoheart are using stem cells to create bio-artificial hearts the company calls ""hearts in a jar"". From just 2.5ml of your blood, Professor Ronald Li and his team are able to create stem cells that can then be turned into a miniature ""clone"" version of your heart that beats like yours and reacts to new drugs the way yours would. The process takes six months. This video can not be played Breakthroughs take time to sell Prof Li believes the tech could speed up the flow of vital new medicines because potential side-effects could be spotted before reaching the expensive human trial stage. ""Drug development is a notoriously lengthy, expensive and inefficient process, typically costing $2-$3bn and taking more than 10 years to develop a single drug, with unacceptably high failure rates of 90% or worse,"" he says. ""The significant business risk has resulted in depletion of the pipeline of new drugs under experimental development."" Stem cell-derived, bio-artificial cloned organs built from the patient's own blood could eventually be the future of transplant medicine, says Prof Li. ""Stem cell-derived tissues and organs are not just science fiction any more."" Could lab-grown organs help speed up drug development? As well as creating ""hearts in a jar"", biotech companies are also ""printing"" living tissue using specialised 3D printers. This tissue can be used to produce skin for grafts, or cartilage for joints, for example. Methods of bioprinting differ but the underlying principle involves using genetic material or ""bio inks"" the way a normal printer uses ordinary ink, along with a ""scaffolding"" material to join the genetic material together to form specific shapes. One bioprinting specialist, Aspect Biosystems, recently formed a partnership with Johnson & Johnson to develop 3D-printed knee meniscus tissue - the thin, fibrous cartilage between some of your joints. ""In the next 10 to 15 years, I believe we will see the first truly cell-containing bioprinted 3D tissues that are approved for use as implantable tissue therapeutics,"" says Tamer Mohamed, chief executive at Aspect Biosystems. Tamer Mohamed (right) thinks bioprinted tissue will be used for transplants in the future As well as cartilage and organs, the synthetic additions to our bodies could one day include ""nanobots"" - tiny programmable bio-machines patrolling our blood streams looking for cancer cells and bacteria to kill, just as our white blood cells do. Arizona State University (ASU) scientists, in collaboration with researchers from the National Centre for Nanoscience and Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently programmed nanobots to shrink tumours by cutting off their blood supply. Unlike machine robots made of mechanical parts, these nanobots were designed using ""DNA origami"", a technique involving DNA being folded into shapes. Each one was made from a flat, rectangular DNA origami sheet, 90 nanometres by 60 nanometres - a nanometre is a billionth of a metre - and a blood-clotting enzyme, called thrombin, was attached to their surface. In the first such test on mammals of its kind, the team injected cancer cells into a mouse to create a tumour, then injected the nanobots. The polymer sheets are rolled up and carry their chemical payload to the cancer They started working within hours, blocking the tumour's blood supply and shrinking it after a two-week course of treatment. Hao Yan, director of the ASU Biodesign Institute's Centre for Molecular Design and Biomimetics, says the next step will be to perform a human trial, which should be in the next three-to-five years. ""This result represents only the beginning stages of nano-medicine,"" he says, ""and we are particularly excited because this technology is a strategy that can be used for many types of cancer, since all solid tumour-feeding blood vessels are essentially the same."" Synthetics are also being marshalled in the fight against antimicrobial resistance - when antibiotics become ineffective against new strains of ""superbug"". These superbugs kill around 700,000 people a year worldwide, says the UK Review on Antimicrobial Resistance. By 2050, 10 million people could die each year if existing antibiotics continue to lose their effectiveness, the report suggests. Step forward ""ninja polymers"" - synthetic bacteria killers. The synthetic ""ninja"" polymers attack superbugs and stop them multiplying Scientists at IBM Research Almaden in California, working with Singapore's Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology of the Agency for Science, have developed a synthetic molecule polymer designed to kill five deadly types of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The polymer works by binding itself to the infectious material, making its way inside the outer membrane, then turning the liquid inside the bacteria into solid material. Crucially, this happens so fast that the bacteria don't have time to reproduce and pass on any resistance. The team tested the polymers on mice infected with five hard-to-treat multi-drug resistant bacteria - the results showed that the bacteria were destroyed. One of the men leading the research, Dr James Hedrick, says the team is also developing the tech for use in cancer therapy, with hopefully far fewer side effects. ""In each case, the therapeutics are highly selective to their target without detectable side reactions,"" he says.

Dr Bertalan Mesko, director of The Medical Futurist Institute, says medicine has been lagging behind in the technology stakes for far too long. ""While many industries stepped into the 21st Century, healthcare hasn't. Millions of patients are on transplantation waiting lists; clinical trials that put new drugs on the market sometimes take a decade and cost billions of dollars."" These advances in synthetics promise the targeting and customisation of treatments to an individual's genetic and molecular background, says Dr Mesko. ""Companies developing digital health technologies not only bring healthcare to the 21st Century but also make patients the point-of-care.""

"Back in 1994, when Tina Turner was moving into her new home in Switzerland, a couple of advertising copywriters in London were having a terrible time trying to come up with a strapline for a wood varnish product. Their creative juices were flowing all right, but the client wasn't buying any of their fancy-pants puns or arty references. He wanted something more direct, less hyperbolic. Saying it was ""Simply the Best"" accompanied by Tina Turner belting out her 1989 hit obviously wasn't going to do the trick. So instead they settled on: ""Ronseal Woodstain - it does exactly what it says on the tin."" It was hardly Shakespearian but it worked. Which you could also say about The Tina Turner Musical, a West End jukebox show that does exactly what it saysâ¦ Except. And this is a major exception. Except for the titular performance given by Adrienne Warren. Adrienne Warren as Tina Turner, and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Ike Turner The American actress is not unlike the chap in the Ronseal ads, in that she is not a household name. Yet. She will be though. And that's because very few performers have the ability to transform the ordinary into extraordinary in the way she does with this show. Warren is a 24-carat, all singing, all dancing, bona fide star. She starts slow and a little tentative; reflecting the early steps Anna-Mae Bullock was taking on her journey to becoming Tina Turner. At 17, Anna-Mae meets Ike Turner (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith) who schmoozes her mother (Zelma Bullock) and then abuses her gifted daughter. For 16 years. Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Ike Turner, with Madeline Appiah as Tina's mother Zelma Bullock The early Ike and Tina scenes see him forcibly shaping his musical protegee. Cymbals fly and a menacing finger is wagged in what feels like a direct lift from J.K. Simmons's merciless jazz teacher in Damien Chazelle's Oscar-winning movie Whiplash. The show stutters at this point but then bursts into sonic life when we first hear Warren give full vent to her voice. It is as if she's drawing up the sound from deep within the earth and releasing it in a controlled eruption with a Janis Joplin-meets-Tina-Turner growl. She is, Ike tells us, ""spitting fire"". Hannah Jay-Allan, Adrienne Warren, Perola Congo and Sia Kiwa (Tina and the Ikettes) The hits - 23 in all - are rolled out in a reasonably subtle manner (not always the case with this type of fare), woven, as they are, into the chronology of her life story, which is told through Katori Hall's rather disappointingly two-dimensional script. I say disappointing, because Hall is generally a very good writer and you'd have thought Tina Turner's tumultuous life story would have provided a feast of opportunities into which she could sink her playwriting teeth. What we have is a serviceable script elegantly staged by the experienced and astute Phyllida Lloyd (Mamma Mia!), who uses an uncluttered, layered, geometric set to good effect. Adrienne Warren as Tina Turner with the cast on the layered, geometric set She has had to overcome one of the trickier aspects of staging a musical production, which is to figure out a workable plan for getting actors and objects on and off stage in a seamless manner. It is a technical problem that is exacerbated in this production by the frequency and speed of the costume changes Warren is required to make. There are a couple of occasions where Lloyd appears to have been so flummoxed by the logistics of it all that she's given up, leaving the unfortunate Warren to strip to her underwear and perform an awkward costume change in front of the audience. There are other moments though, when you sit back and enjoy the intelligence and wit of her direction. Most memorably in a scene in which Phil Spector (Tom Godwin) takes over from Ike as Tina's producer and has her sing River Deep Mountain High with such intensity and ferocity that there is absolutely nothing left of the song when she's finally done. Phil Spector (Tom Godwin) who takes over from Ike as Tina Turner's producer If this show had premiered on Broadway and not the West End, the audience would have risen as one and given her a standing ovation at this point. But this is low-key London not noisy New York, so we sat still. Until, that is, Warren donned her big 1980s Tina wig and started to belt out The Best. Adrienne Warren as Tina Turner Nobody could resist that. Up we all went with a gentle side-to-side sway and the occasional self-conscious shoulder inflection. I turned round and saw the lady herself three rows back beaming from ear-to-ear. She'd enjoyed the show. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the show. The star of the show embraces Tina Turner OK, it's not Hamilton, but then, nothing is Hamilton. But it is a decent alternative for fans of the musical genre who can't get tickets to Lin-Manuel Miranda's blockbuster and are in need of a fix. You never know, The Tina Turner Musical might just run as long as those Ronseal ads.
