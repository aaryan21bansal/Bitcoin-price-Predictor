"The UK's financial watchdog has lifted restrictions on German payments company Wirecard, allowing it to resume payment activities. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed restrictions on the company's UK arm after its collapse last week. Thousands of people could notaccess their money or make payments through apps as a result. ""Our primary objective all along has been to protect the interests and money of consumers,"" the FCA said. Customers should now, or very shortly, be able to use their cards as usual. Christopher Woolard, the FCA's interim chief executive, told the BBC's Today programme the FCA had ""imposed very strict conditions"" on Wirecard's UK subsidiary based in Newcastle, which had knock-on effects for about 70 payments firms. ""When we did that we were acutely conscious that there are some really vulnerable people who rely on those services for example to get benefits payments paid to them,"" he said. Mr Woolard said the FCA had spent the last few days making sure money belonging to people in the UK was now safeguarded in UK bank accounts with strict conditions. ""What that means is, if you've got either a card direct from Wirecard or from one of these 70-odd firms that relies upon them, those cards should start working today,"" he said. On Tuesday morning, Wirecard issued a statement saying some customers may find themselves unable to make transactions immediately, but the company anticipated the delay would last no longer than 24 hours. Several British technology companies were forced to suspend services due to the FCA restrictions, leaving thousands of accounts blocked. Online firm Pockit's payment cards, for example, were locked because they used a payment processing service owned by Wirecard. Dawn Guilfoyle worried that her frozen funds would mean no hot water Dawn Guilfoyle is one of thousands who were barred from using their cash cards because of the failure of huge German payments firm Wirecard. ""It's really bad. I'm left with nothing,"" she says. ""Once the gas goes off, I'll have none for cooking or hot water."" Ms Guilfoyle's card, from the online firm Pockit, was frozen because the FCA wanted to make sure the money is safe. Read more about her story here. The FCA said any customers who were still experiencing difficulties in using their card should contact their card provider directly. The action came after the German parent firm Wirecard last week disclosed a â¬1.9bn (Â£1.7bn) hole in its accounts, and subsequently filed for insolvency. Former boss Markus Braun has been arrested and accused of inflating Wirecard's finances to make them appear healthier to investors and customers. On Monday, the FCA said: ""There continue to be certain requirements in place, which have been imposed on Wirecard's authorisation. ""These requirements include restrictions over where it can hold customer monies and restrictions over its ability to transfer its own assets."" ""The FCA continues to work with the firm to progress these matters,"" it added. Mr Woolard told the Today programme: ""Obviously there's a separate story developing around Wirecard in Germany where there's a German bank regulated by our colleagues in Germany"". He said the FCA was closely monitoring Wirecard's UK operation, but it was not in the process of trying to find a new owner for the UK subsidiary. The FCA has restricted Wirecard from some operations such as initiating payments on customers' behalf. Wirecard said it planned to ""continue working closely with the FCA to have these remaining restrictions lifted as soon as possible"". Wirecard: 'Itâs really bad.

"Facebook's new media literacy campaign will ask users questions about what they see online Facebook is launching a campaign to help people spot fake news amid a growing advertising boycott putting pressure on the company to tackle misinformation and hate speech. Steve Hatch, Facebook's vice president for Northern Europe, says the media literacy campaign launched with fact-checkers FullFact is evidence that the company is ""listening and adapting"". But some experts and critics argue the effort across the UK, Europe, Africa and the Middle East is ""too little, too late"". The campaign will direct people to the websiteStampOutFalseNews.com,externaland ask users key questions about what they see online: ""Where's it from?"" ""What's missing?"" and ""How did you feel?"" Seven ways to stop fake news from going viral In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Hatch says ""financial considerations"" are not behind the new ads. In recent days, more than 150 companies - including Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Unilever - have announced temporary halts to advertising buys on Facebook as a result of the #StopHateForProfit campaign. Could a boycott kill Facebook? Facebook's Steve Hatch says the company is working to stop coronavirus fakes Misinformation or viral ""fake news"" has been a persistent issue for years on the social network, and it flared up dramatically after the emergence of Covid-19. In May, aBBC investigationfound links between coronavirus misinformation and assaults, arsons and deaths, with potential - and potentially much greater - indirect harm caused by rumours, conspiracy theories and bad health advice. The human cost of virus misinformation The (almost) complete history of 'fake news' Mr Hatch says Facebook employees have working ""night and day"" to tackle false claims during the pandemic. ""If people were sharing information that could cause real-world harm, we will take that down. We've done that in hundreds of thousands of cases,"" he says. But the media literacy effort is ""too little too late"" says Chloe Colliver, head of the digital research unit at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an anti-extremism think tank. ""We've seen Facebook try to take reactive and often quite small steps to stem the tide of disinformation on the platform,"" Ms Colliver says. ""But they haven't been able to proactively produce policies that help prevent users from seeing disinformation, false identities, false accounts, and false popularity on their platforms."" Facebook also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook and other social media companies have also come under pressure over misleading information or comments that could arguably incite violence, in particular posts by US President Donald Trump. Following widespread protests after the death of George Floyd, the President warned: ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The post was hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"", but remained on Facebook. Mr Hatch says that the US president's posts ""come under a high level of scrutiny"" by Facebook bosses. Echoing earlier comments by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, he denied that the comment in question broke Facebook's rules, and stated that the company interpreted it as a reference to the possible use of National Guard troops. ""Whether you're a political figure or anyone on the platform,"" Mr Hatch says, you will be reprimanded for sharing posts that could cause real-world harm.

"Mary Catterall made ammunition during World War Two A 102-year-old great-grandmother has made a ""miraculous recovery"" from coronavirus, her carer has said. Mary Catterall fell ill at Birch Court Care Home in Warrington in May and was nursed back to health at the facility. Mrs Catterall, who took up horse riding and abseiling aged 86, said she was ""OK"" and was ""glad to be knitting"". Carer Sophie Rutter said the 102-year-old was a ""fighter"", adding: ""It was touch and go at one point, but Mary is so determined and brilliant."" Mrs Catterall worked at industrial factory Cockhedge Mill during World War Two making ammunition. The home believes Mrs Catterall is one of Warrington's oldest residents. Sophie Rutter, 24, who works at Birch Court Care Home, said the great-grandmother was ""a privilege to look after"". ""It has been a miraculous recovery, there is no stopping her,"" Miss Rutter said.

"Canadian entertainment firm Cirque du Soleil is to cut 3,500 jobs after striking a deal to avoid bankruptcy. The group, best known for its flamboyant touring circuses, said the coronavirus pandemic had forced it to cancel shows and lay off its artists. The company will now try to restructure while shedding about 95% of its staff. ""With zero revenue since the forced closure of all of our shows due to Covid-19, the management had to act decisively,"" said boss Daniel Lamarre. The firm had to pause production of all of its shows, including six in Las Vegas, back in March. Along with its circuses, its also has musicals that tour the world including Michael Jackson One and The Beatles Love. Theatre and music figures say roadmap is 'meaningless' without support Theatre worker fears cuts will mean career change The firm said it had entered an agreement under which its existing shareholders will take over Cirque's liabilities and invest $300m (Â£244m) in the business. Some $200m of this will take the form of a loan from the province of Quebec, where the firm is based. It also said shareholders would set aside $20m to provide additional relief to affected employees and contractors. It said it intended to rehire ""a substantial majority"" of terminated employees, business conditions allowing, once coronavirus-related shutdowns were lifted and operations could resume.

"A couple in Madrid getting married in early June The government has published new guidance on weddings in England, allowing ceremonies of up to 30 people but advising against receptions. From 4 July, wedding and civil partnerships can go ahead but with only 30 people including the couple, staff such as a photographer and witnesses. People should socially distance, singing should not take place and hands must be washed before exchanging rings. Receptions should be small, with only two households able to meet indoors. Since lockdown began on 23 March, weddings in England have been banned under almost all circumstances. Wedding dress shops have reopened in England, but with masks and social distancing Small weddings are currently allowed in the other nations of the UK, which set their own lockdown rules. In Northern Ireland,weddings of up to 10 people are allowed outdoors.In Wales, ceremonies can alsotake place, but social distancing must be observed, while outdoor marriages and civil partnershipscan take place in Scotland. Under thenew guidance for England,externalreleased on Monday, small wedding and civil partnership ceremonies are allowed to go ahead only when they can be done safely and follow social distancing guidelines. The advice says: Ceremonies should be kept ""as short as reasonably possible"" and limited as much as possible to just the parts that are legally binding No more than 30 people should attend Everyone should follow the 2m rule if possible, or 1m with extra safety measures No food and drink should be consumed as part of the event Hands should be washed before and after the exchanging of rings, and the rings should be handled by as few people as possible Singing, shouting or playing music at a volume that means people have to raise their voice should all be avoided. Instead of singing, recordings are suggested Speaking during the ceremony - for example saying the responses to the vows - should not be in a raised voice Playing instruments that are blown into should be avoided When singing or chanting is required, only one person is allowed to and the couple or venue should consider installing a clear screen Venues frequently used for weddings should mark the floor with tape or paint to help people maintain social distance. The government advice also suggests changing traditional wedding layouts to avoid face-to-face seating, improving ventilation or using face masks. The requirement to follow the 2m rule - or 1m with extra precautions -  will likely rule out the tradition of a father walking his daughter down the aisle, unless they live in the same household. The maximum number of 30 people includes everybody at the ceremony - including the couple, witnesses, officiants, guests and suppliers such as photographers and caterers. What should I do if I have a wedding coming up? The wedding capital where no-one can get married Brother and sister hold outdoor weddings on same day The guidance also says receptions that ""typically follow or accompany marriages or civil partnerships are strongly advised not to take place at this time"". It says small celebrations should only take place if they follow social distancing guidelines, such as groups of up to two households indoors, or up to six people from different households outdoors. The reason people are urged not to sing or speak loudly is based on scientific advice which suggests doing so produces more respiratory droplets which enter the air and can be inhaled by others. Some of the science behind the lockdown easing Hannah Randolph and her fiance are due to get married at the beginning of September but have decided to leave it to ""the last possible moment"" to decide whether to walk up the aisle. The 33-year-old from south-west London worries that if they cancel now, their suppliers will be unlikely to offer a refund as the ceremony can go ahead. But she says: ""I just don't think it'll feel like a wedding."" ""Weddings are every expensive but you can maybe justify it if you're having a party for 100 people,"" she says. Under the new guidance, she would have to cut that by two-thirds. For her, uninviting guests will not be an easy task: ""My fiance has got three siblings and their partners and a nephew and once you add that up it means you've got to have some really awkward conversations with members of the family."" While Hannah says weddings can feel ""frivolous"" given the circumstances, the lack of clarity from the government has left her feeling completely in the dark. ""I can go to a pub and have drinks with a bunch of strangers, but can't have socially distanced drinks with loved ones,"" she said. ""It seems nonsensical."" The government says venues that do not follow the guidance could face action from the Health and Safety Executive or the local authority. Failing to put in place sufficient measures could constitute a breach of existing health and safety legislation and venues could face enforcement notices, the guidance adds. One man, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he and his fiancee are due to get married at the end of July but the new rules ""have made it impossible to have the wedding as planned"". ""It's a joke - the venue we have is a farmhouse and we would have been in the courtyard,"" he said. ""We can protest with hundreds of other people, we can gather to celebrate a football game with strangers, yet we cannot have an outdoor reception with our 25 guests. It goes beyond illogical.""

"With the coronavirus pandemic reachinga global total of 10m cases,external, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of a dangerous new phase in the crisis. While many countries in western Europe and Asia have the virus under some degree of control, other regions of the world are now seeing the disease spread at an accelerating rate. It took three months for the first one million people to become infected, but just eight days to clock up the most recent million. And because these numbers only reflect who has tested positive, they're likely to be ""the tip of the iceberg"", according to one senior Latin American official. The graphs are moving in completely the wrong direction in parts of the Americas, south Asia and Africa. The US, already recording the most infections and most deaths from Covid-19 anywhere in the world, is seeing further startling increases. The number of positive tests recorded in the past few days has reached a daily record total of 40,000, and it's still climbing, fuelled by an explosion of clusters in Arizona, Texas and Florida. This is not a ""second wave"" of infections.Instead, it's a resurgence of the disease, often in states which decided to relax their lockdown restrictions, arguably too early. Brazil,the second country after the US to pass 1m cases, is also experiencing dangerous rises. Its biggest cities, SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, are the hardest hit but many other areas of the country are doing little testing, and the real numbers are bound to be far higher. Something similar is happening in India. It recently recorded its greatest number of new cases on a single day - 15,000. But because there's relatively little testing in some of the most heavily populated states, the true scale of the crisis is inevitably larger. Why is this happening? Deprived and crowded communities in developing countries are vulnerable. Coronavirus has become ""a disease of poor people"", according to David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy for Covid-19. When whole families are crammed into single-room homes, social distancing is impossible, and without running water, regular hand-washing isn't easy. Where people have to earn a living day-by-day to survive, interactions on streets and in markets are unavoidable. For indigenous groups in the Amazon rainforest and other remote areas, healthcare can be limited or even non-existent. GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the coronavirus pandemic EUROPE:How are lockdowns being lifted? SYMPTOMS:What are the symptoms of the coronavirus? TRACKER:Coronavirus cases in Africa UNITED STATES:How the Najavo Nation is battling America's worst outbreak And the rate of infection itself is often worryingly high: of everyone tested in Mexico, just over half are turning out to be positive. That's a far higher proportion than was found in hotspots like New York City or northern Italy even at their worst moments. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline medical staff are far more severe where budgets are small. In Ecuador, where at one stage bodies were being dumped in the streets because the authorities could not cope, a key laboratory ran out of the chemicals needed to test for coronavirus. And where economies are already weak, imposing a lockdown to curb the virus potentially carries far greater risks than in a developed nation. Dr Nabarro says there is a still a chance to slow the spread of infections but only with urgent international support. ""I don't like giving a depressing message,"" he says, ""but I am worried about supplies and finance getting through to those who need them."" But these are not the only things driving the rise. Many politicians have chosen for their own reasons not to follow the advice of their health experts. The president of Tanzania took the bold step of declaring that his country had largely defeated the virus. Since early May he has blocked the release of proper data about it, though the signs are that Covid-19 is still very much a threat. In the US, President Trump has either played down the disease or blamed China and the WHO for it, and urged a rapid re-opening of the American economy. He praised the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, for being among the first to bring his state out of lockdown, a move now being reversed as cases rise. Even the wearing of masks in public, which has been an official US government recommendation since early April, has become a symbol of political division. Mr Abbott has refused to allow Texan mayors to insist on them so that, as he put it, ""individual liberty is not infringed"". By contrast the governor of California, a Democrat, says the ""science shows that face coverings and masks work"". Mr Trump, meanwhile, has refused to wear one. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has been caught up in the same kind of argument. Having dismissed the coronavirus as ""a little cold"", he's repeatedly tried to stop officials from doing anything that might disrupt the economy. And after regularly appearing in public without a mask, he's now been ordered by a court to wear one. It's attitudes like this that prompted the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to warn that the greatest threat is not the virus itself but ""the lack of global solidarity and global leadership"". As a remote set of islands in the Pacific, New Zealand is able to isolate easily, and the government of Jacinda Ardern has been widely praised for an aggressive response which recently led to a 24-day period with no new cases. That came to an end as citizens started to return from abroad, some of them infected, and further measures have been needed to monitor people on arrival. But rather than this being a blow to New Zealand's hopes of becoming Covid-free, many experts see it as evidence of a surveillance system that generally works effectively. Similarly, South Korea is lauded for using technology and contact tracing to drive down infections to extremely low numbers and had three days in a row with no new cases. Its officials now say they are seeing a second wave, with clusters centred on nightclubs in the capital Seoul, though the numbers are relatively small. The mayor of Seoul has warned that if cases go above 30 for three days, social distancing measures will be re-imposed. By contrast, the UK has roughly 1,000 new cases a day. Proudest of all is Vietnam, which claims to have had no deaths from Covid-19 at all. A rapid lockdown and strict border controls combined to keep the numbers of infections low. What's next? A big unknown is what happens in most of the countries of Africa, which in many cases have not seen the scale of disease than some feared. One view is that a lack of infrastructure for mass testing is obscuring the true spread of the virus. Another is that with relatively young populations, the numbers becoming afflicted are likely to be lower. A third perspective is that communities with fewer connections to the outside world will be among the last to be touched by the pandemic. In countries that have most successfully controlled the virus, the challenge is remaining vigilant while trying to allow some normality to resume. But the reality for many of the rest is Dr Nabarro's grim forecast of ""continued increases in the numbers of people with coronavirus and the associated suffering"". Which is why he and many others are hoping that developing countries will get the help they need, before the crisis escalates any further.

"Right at the moment when the prime minister is planning to turn the page to usher in a different political phase, the reinstatement of some restrictions on people's lives in Leicester is a reminder that the risk to our health from the coronavirus crisis is neither gone, nor forgotten. Ministers have been clear for some weeks that the possibility of 'local lockdowns' was very real. And the announcement from the health secretary on Monday evening was not just to put the brakes on easing of elements of the lockdown, he has also reversed some of the changes that have already been made: closing non-essential shops again, and schools - aside from the children of key workers, or the vulnerable - restricted. It is not a small ask of the people of Leicester, a major city, to watch the rest of the country progress, while they have to go into reverse for now, to protect everyone's health. How will local lockdown rules be enforced?,external Lockdown tightened in Leicester over Covid surge How many confirmed cases are there in your area? But this kind of on, and off, measure may become a regular feature of how the government tries to manage the infection as the months pass. And there are already questions from opposition politicians about why speculation was allowed to build over the last few days about whether it was going to happen at all. Local leaders expressed significant frustration, too, at a lack of coordination and information sharing about exactly what was going on. On TuesdayBoris Johnson will make big promisesusing echoes of the past, the New Deal that took the United States out of the Great Depression, to try to show that the government has the imagination and the drive to move the country out of the worst phases of the pandemic. But just as he and the Cabinet are starting to focus on the risk of very widespread financial hardship, what's happening in Leicester makes it clear that the balance between managing public health and how the country makes its living is still precarious too.

"Pupils will face the front, but the safety plans will not be based on social distancing The return-to-school plans for autumn in England will involve entire year groups staying in separate ""bubbles"". A draft of the plans, set to be announced later this week, has beenpublished by the Huffington Post,external. It means that groups of up to 240 pupils could be kept apart within a school, with a separate time for starting and finishing. It could also mean they would all be sent home if there was a Covid-19 case in the group. There will also be a recognition of the need for pupils to catch up after months out of regular lessons, with an emphasis on core subjects such as English and maths. The plans, understood to be draft documents shared as part of a consultation, show the approach to safety in the autumn is an expansion of the ""protective bubble"" approach already used. Penalty fines for missing school next term All pupils back in school full-time in September Â£1bn catch-up tutoring plan for autumn 2 metre distancing would mean schools part-time Rather than relying on social distancing, the aim is to limit the points at which the infection could be spread, by keeping pupils in separate, isolated groups through the school day, with their own breaks and lunchtimes. In primary schools this term, these bubbles have been up to 15 pupils, but in the plans for the autumn they could include a full secondary year group, which if there were eight classes, could be 240 pupils. In primary schools in the autumn, the bubbles are expected to be a whole class of 30 pupils. In secondary school entire year groups could be kept apart in the protective ""bubble"" system If a pupil shows coronavirus symptoms, parents will have to quickly come to collect their child. ""While waiting, the child should be kept 2m away from the supervising teacher,"" says the leaked guidance. ""If that is not possible, in the case of a young child or one with complex needs, staff should wear full PPE - disposable gloves, a disposable apron, a fluid-resistant surgical face mask and in some cases eye goggles."" There will not be any fixed social distancing requirements for pupils in primary school - and in secondary it will be 1m, but only where possible, the leaked documents suggest. But teachers will be expected to maintain social distancing at the front of a class - in classrooms in which pupils will face forward, rather than facing each other around circular tables. On Monday, the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson promised a comprehensive track and trace system would be in place for autumn. That would allow year groups or schools to be closed down if there were Covid-19 cases, or if there were signs of a local upsurge infections. There will be routines of regular hand-washing, but there are not expected to be temperature checks or masks, either for staff or pupils. Pupils will be encouraged to get back on track with their learning when schools return for full-time lessons. Attendance will be compulsory - with confirmation on Monday that penalty fines can once again be issued to parents who do not send their children back to school, at the usual level of Â£60 and then Â£120 for late payment. And there will be a push on helping children to catch up in English and maths, which could include narrowing options in GCSE subjects and repeating work from before the lockdown. An increase in disruptive behaviour is anticipated - but it is expected that Ofsted will not be carrying out routine inspections during the term. In response to the leaked documents, a Department for Education spokesman said there would be continuing consultation, ahead of the full plans being published this week. ""We've said we want to see all children back at school in September - returning to full primary and secondary class sizes in a safe way,"" said the DfE spokesman.

"Boris Johnson is unveiling government plans to soften the economic impact of coronavirus with a promise to ""build build build"". Speaking in the West Midlands, the prime minister will say he wants to use the coronavirus crisis ""to tackle this country's great unresolved challenges"". As part of a ""new deal"", Mr Johnson is setting out plans to accelerate Â£5bn on infrastructure projects. Labour has called for a ""laser-like focus"" on preventing job losses. The prime minister's speech comesas BBC analysis foundthat the UK was the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations by the virus in the weeks leading up to early June. In April, the UK economy shrunk by a record 20.4% as a result of the spread of coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown measures. What a shrinking economy means in one town Where do governments go when they need money? UK 'on knife edge' ahead of lockdown easing Aiming to emulate the New Deal policies of the depression-era American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mr Johnson will say he wants a government that ""puts its arms around people at a time of crisis"". In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, President Roosevelt launched one of the largest, most expensive US government programmes which included building schools, hospitals and dams. In a bid to boost the country's financial outlook, Mr Johnson is pledging to put jobs and infrastructure at the centre of the government's economic growth with a commitment to ""build, build, build"". Unemployed men queuing for food in depression-era America - the crisis that prompted President Roosevelt's New Deal Mr Johnson will say he wants to use the coronavirus crisis as an opportunity to ""to build the homes, to fix the NHS, to tackle the skills crisis, to mend the indefensible gap in opportunity and productivity and connectivity between the regions of the UK"". ""Too many parts of this country have felt left behind, neglected, unloved, as though someone had taken a strategic decision that their fate did not matter as much as the metropolis. ""And so I want you to know that this government not only has a vision to change this country for the better, we have a mission to unite and level up."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers Projects in the Â£5bn investment plan include: Â£1.5bn for hospital maintenance, eradicating mental health dormitories, enabling hospital building and improving A&E capacity Â£100m for 29 road network projects including bridge repairs in Sandwell and improving the A15 in the Humber region Â£900m for ""shovel ready"" local projects in England this year and in 2021 Â£500,000 - Â£1m for each areain the towns fundto spend on improvements to parks, high street and transport Over Â£1bn to fund a schools building project,as announced on Monday Â£83m for maintenance of prisons and youth offender facilities, and Â£60m for temporary prison places. The government says it will bring forward funding to ""accelerate"" infrastructure projects in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the PM's plans fell ""woefully short"" of an economic recovery package recently announced in Germany. ""I also suspect there will be less to it than meets the eye in terms of genuinely new money,"" shetweeted,external. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will provide an update on the economy next week, and in the autumn the government will publish a National Infrastructure Strategy. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the focus should be on ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" Earlier, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told BBC Breakfast Labour supported investment, but a ""strong laser-like focus on unemployment"" was needed. She urged the government to abandon a ""one-size fits all approach"" to economic support, calling for measures ""more focused"" on individual sectors. She added that spending to improve prisons and courts had been promised ""quite some time ago,"" adding: ""What the prime minister is talking about appears to be mainly spending that's already been committed to"". Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman and party leadership contender Layla Moran said Mr Johnson's plans looked like ""a rehash of manifesto pledges"" and accused the government of ""running out of ideas"". The prime minister has promised to ""level up"" communities across the UK Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chairman Mike Cherry said the announcement was ""encouraging"" but said it was important that small businesses were not ""locked out of the ambition to build... because of cumbersome public sector procurement rules"". And British Chamber of Commerce director-general Adam Marshall said the government's plans had to ""take shape on the ground swiftly to give a real confidence boost to businesses and communities"". For weeks ministers, including Mr Johnson, have been promising a bold green recovery package to create jobs whilst cutting carbon emissions. In the pre-released summary of his speech the prime minister did pledge to ""build back greener"" - but some environmentalists consider his response inadequate. The think tank Green Alliance, for instance,calculates that ministersneed to spend Â£14bn to meet CO2 targets. It says the government is spending Â£9bn on projects that actually harm the climate. Mr Johnson re-iterated a policy of planting 75,000 acres of forest a year and said he'd create new conservation rangers. But he didn't mention home insulation - the sector consistently judged best for cutting emissions and creating jobs. And there was no suggestion of scaling back the Â£27bn roads programme, which will increase emissions and is judged by the Trades Union Congress to be poor value for job creation.

"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says the changes will support those caring for others Two households in Wales will be able to form one ""extended household"" to meet indoors and stay overnight from next Monday, the Welsh Government has said. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it means grandparents ""will be able to see and hold their grandchildren again"". People can only be in one extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Travel restrictions are due to be lifted the same day. It follows similar ""support bubble"" arrangements elsewhere in the UK. Can I be in a coronavirus 'social bubble'? Covid 'support bubbles' begin in England and NI What is a support bubble? The changes will mean people can have physical contact, exercise, cook and eat together, and also stay in each other's homes. There is no limit to the number of people that can be in the two households. But, under the rules, if anyone in an extended household develops symptoms the entire household will need to self-isolate. The Welsh Government has asked people to keep records to help with contact tracing if that happens. Two households will be able meet indoors from Monday People shielding can also be included but the first minister warned that if they join an extended household it ""will increase their risk of being exposed"" to coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Creating extended households will enable many families to be reunited for the first time since March. ""Grandparents will be able to see and hold their grandchildren again. ""It will help support many working parents with informal childcare over the summer months and it will also support those who are caring for others."" Jan Maddox in Newport has been apart from Nigel Swaby in Tamworth since the day before lockdown. Jan Maddox, 71, has been living alone in Newport since March and has not been able to see her partner Nigel Swaby, who lives in a village near Tamworth. ""Virtually for the last three months I've been walking up and down the road,"" she said. ""It's the same houses, its the same hedgerows, it's the same everything."" Ms Maddox said the changes will be a ""game-changer"" for her, and if the travel restrictions end on 6 July she said her partner would ""pick me up and he's going to take me back to the Midlands"". This video can not be played Two homes in Wales will be able to link up from Monday Mr Drakeford said extended households means that in some cases ""especially in larger families, this may mean making some difficult choices."" The first minister asked viewers of the daily Welsh Government press conference to ""think about the risks"". ""Think about the consequences - if anyone in the extended household becomes ill, everyone will have to isolate for 14 days,"" he said. ""For some people this will have a greater impact than for others, and needs to be thought about carefully."" The moves coincide with plans to end Wales' stay local rules on 6 July if cases continue to fall, and follows the opening of non-essential retail last week. The moves come into force next week If the changes result in any ""flare ups"" the Welsh Government will be able to ""make a connection between cause and effect"", Mr Drakeford said. ""We make the changes on the basis of advice and the advice is always that these steps are proportionate and shouldn't lead to a further acceleration in the spread of coronavirus."" The first minister said he did not have the ""detail in front"" of him when he was asked how it would impact people in houses of multiple occupation. Mr Drakeford said further guidance will to be published later this week. The Welsh Conservatives welcomed the news but questioned why it could not have been announced last Friday ""to prevent another lost weekend"". Angela Burns, health spokeswoman, said: ""So many families in Wales need such a boost after so long apart, and so if there is science behind why the decision could not have been announced on Friday, then the First Minister should put it into the public domain."" Every time there's an announcement on lifting a lockdown restriction, it's accompanied at some point with guidance notes explaining the finer details. On extended households, those guidance notes will be awaited more keenly than usual because there's a lot we still don't know. The first minister said that extended households would be required to keep records to help track and trace contacts in the event that a member develops Covid. It's not clear what the nature of those records will be. Will extended households have to register and provide contact information? Will they have to keep records of meetings? What happens if they don't? Another big question is what happens to people who rent rooms in shared houses or older people in care homes. Will they be allowed to participate in the extended household scheme and if so how will that work? In Englandhouseholds of any sizewill be able to meet indoors or outside from 4 July. It does not need to be the same set of households. The groups are expected to maintain social distancing, unless they are part of the same support bubble. That is where people living alone can stay with other households -measures also in place in Northern Ireland. The Welsh Government has not used the word bubbles, instead using the term ""extended households"" also seen inScotland. There, extended households are limited to a household meeting another which has just one person alone, or only with children under 18. Who can you have in your bubble?

"Byron Burger has filed a notice to appoint administrators, as it tries to protect the restaurant chain from creditors while it seeks a rescue deal. The chain has 1,200 staff and 52 restaurants across the UK. Sources confirmed that the Byron Burger board still remain hopeful that it can be sold as a ""going concern"". The chain is believed to be in talks with three potential buyers, who could buy the firm or parts of it, in a so-called ""pre-pack"" administration deal. This is where a firm sells all or some of its assets to a pre-determined buyer, and appoints administrators to do so. If the chain does go formally into administration in the coming days, KPMG is set to deal with the process. The accountancy firm has been trying to sell Byron since early May. The notice to appoint administratorswas first reported by Sky news.,external Coronavirus: Restaurants are 'hurting', says Deliveroo boss Coronavirus lockdown: Why can't some businesses reopen in England yet? Coronavirus lockdown: Pubs, restaurants and barbers reopen in Ireland A source close to the company said that an investor could buy the brand and parts of the business, but reduce the size of the firm. That could potentially mean job losses and restaurant closures. The filing of the notice to appoint administrators gives legal protection from creditors while a sale or pre-pack administration is prepared. Discussions are currently taking place with creditors about debts, the source said. The company is aiming for a phased re-opening from mid-July, but it will probably be a smaller company, the source added. Byron has been struggling for a number of years. In 2018 itagreed a rescue planand restructuring which was handled by KPMG. As part of that deal, investment house Three Hills Capital Partners became the biggest shareholder. On Monday, The Restaurant Group said its own rescue deal had been approved by creditors, meaning 160 outlets would remain open. As announced on 10 June,up to 3,000 jobs are to goas the group closes 125 restaurants, mainly at its Frankie & Benny's chain. That's out of about 7,000 jobs in that division of the group. The restaurants that will not reopen are located across the UK, but mainly in England. Many of them are located in out-of-town retail parks, which have been hit by lower footfall as consumers increasingly shop online. The coronavirus crisis accelerated a process of permanently closing those restaurants that was already happening, a spokesman for the firm said. The Restaurant Group started a consultation process with staff after the June announcement, and those that have not already been made redundant remain on furlough. Restaurant chains, which were already under pressure before the coronavirus crisis, have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.

"Many businesses in Leicester have been preparing to reopen on 4 July Just as the rest of England prepares for the welcome easing of lockdown restrictions at the weekend, people in Leicester are reacting to the news that they may have to carry on as they are. The city's mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has said the government has recommended current restrictions are maintained for another two weeks due to a surge in coronavirus cases. That means pubs, restaurants and hairdressers could have to keep their doors closed for a further fortnight. Leicester reacts to lockdown extension plans Sarah Gillett, manager of the Market Tavern, said she was ""gutted"" to hear restrictions may be extended and called for clarity as about Â£8,000 worth of stock needed to be ordered. Pub manager Sarah Gillett says if the extension is going to happen then businesses need to be told now ""We wanted to take some of the staff off furlough [to help clean] tomorrow and we just don't know what to do. We're in limbo. ""If we can't open, we can't open, but let us know sooner rather than later,"" she said. Margaret Barton, 41, owner of Cafe Mbriki, said only being able to serve takeaways was hardly worth staying open for. Margaret Barton says it's hard to run her business just serving takeaways She said: ""If the government says we need to stay like this for two more weeks we will - we have to get rid of the virus. ""But I think the council should offer us more [financial] help if it does happen."" Indy Burmi, owner of Indy's hairdressing, said the phones had been ringing non-stop with clients asking what was happening and he was worried those holding on for reopening might now just cut or dye their own hair. Indy Burmi is worried customers will just start cutting and dying their own hair ""It's embarrassing that it has happened here,"" he said. ""It seems like some people haven't been listening to the rules. It's not happened in London, where there's lots of people, or in Birmingham... it's a shame."" Blake Edwards said his salon was fully booked for the next five weeks Blake Edwards, owner of the Flappers and Gentlemen salon, said they had put plans in place to reopen, including limiting numbers, asking customers to wear masks and putting staff in PPE. He said he would be ""gutted"" if restrictions were extended as ""it will be heartbreaking to tell all those clients we're having to delay"". The 38-year-old said his salon was fully booked for the next five weeks and they would need to know if they cannot open soon, as people needed to be contacted and their appointments moved back. ""Yes if it's clear from the numbers that there has been a huge increase we would do it - lives come first - but it needs to be strong to warrant what they want to do,"" he said. Mr Edwards said the potential long-term impact on businesses and the city's workforce was worrying. He said: ""If this is going to be around for a long time we have to learn to live with it and is locking down again the answer?"" Sailesh Ghelani believes people are following government advice where he lives Sailesh Ghelani, 38, from Evington, who had a ""horrible"" bout of coronavirus in March himself, said his first thought when he heard there was a spike in Leicester was that it was to do with the city's ethnic mix rather than behaviour, as he believes everyone has been listening to the government advice and staying safe. ""I'm relieved they are not talking about going into a stricter lockdown,"" he said. ""But if it's extending it a couple of weeks, we've gone without for so long, a couple of weeks is not going to make much of a difference."" Amdadur Rahman had been hoping business would pick up on 4 July as restrictions eased Taxi driver Amdadur Rahman, 53, also from Evington, said extending the restrictions would be hard as ""work is very slow"" at the moment and he had been hoping the reopening of pubs would improve matters. ""The data is worrying, particularly hearing it is in my area, but it might be a bit old, so we need to know about the situation. ""But good or bad, we have to accept it. It is for our safety,"" he said. Market worker Stephen Powley says he misses seeing friends Market worker Stephen Powley, 56, who is sporting a Leicester City mask made for him by a friend, believes the rise in cases is because of the ethnic mix in the city. ""It's crazy [that we are potentially going to have a longer lockdown]. And it's frightening,"" he said. ""I was looking forward to getting a haircut, going to restaurants. I miss seeing friends, I've not seen some for a long time."" Lyndsey Portas said she couldn't believe Leicester was worse than any other big cities Lyndsey Portas, 42, owner of TG Portas fruit and veg stall at the market, said she ""can't believe"" Leicester is ""worse than more heavily populated cities"". ""We've been open the whole time as an essential food business but it's been really hard for businesses. The High Street seems to be dying around us. ""It would have been nice to have felt it was a bit back to normal, but if it's spreading through the community, it does need to be stopped.""

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning. The UK was the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations in the weeks leading up to early June,according to BBC analysis of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Analysis also showed that England fared the worst in Europe, just above Spain. The research compared 11-week periods for each nation as the virus hit its peak in each country. ""The cash is there"" for long-term investment to help the UK recover from the economic impact of coronavirus, according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Speaking while touring a school construction site, the PM promised""an activist approach to the economy"". This video can not be played PM says the âactivist interventionist approachâ to rebuild and repair schools would drive job creation. The government has published new guidance on weddings in England, allowing ceremonies of up to 30 people -but couples will have to say their vows quietly. Among the rules is a ban on singing and having to wash hands before the exchange of rings while gatherings are limited to 30 people. The 2020 county cricket season will begin on 1 August,the England and Wales Cricket Board has confirmed. Final approval of the formats will come next month and discussion about the women's domestic game is ongoing. A self-isolating nurse has finally hugged her two-year-old son after 11 ""heartbreaking"" lockdown weeks apart. Charlotte Cole, 30, of Kirkham, Lancashire, said her ""heart feels full again"" as she was reunited with George - the momentis shown in a series of beautifully shot photographs.

"A couple in Madrid getting married in early June The government has published new guidance on weddings in England, allowing ceremonies of up to 30 people but advising against receptions. From 4 July, wedding and civil partnerships can go ahead but with only 30 people including the couple, staff such as a photographer and witnesses. People should socially distance, singing should not take place and hands must be washed before exchanging rings. Receptions should be small, with only two households able to meet indoors. Since lockdown began on 23 March, weddings in England have been banned under almost all circumstances. Wedding dress shops have reopened in England, but with masks and social distancing Small weddings are currently allowed in the other nations of the UK, which set their own lockdown rules. In Northern Ireland,weddings of up to 10 people are allowed outdoors.In Wales, ceremonies can alsotake place, but social distancing must be observed, while outdoor marriages and civil partnershipscan take place in Scotland. Under thenew guidance for England,externalreleased on Monday, small wedding and civil partnership ceremonies are allowed to go ahead only when they can be done safely and follow social distancing guidelines. The advice says: Ceremonies should be kept ""as short as reasonably possible"" and limited as much as possible to just the parts that are legally binding No more than 30 people should attend Everyone should follow the 2m rule if possible, or 1m with extra safety measures No food and drink should be consumed as part of the event Hands should be washed before and after the exchanging of rings, and the rings should be handled by as few people as possible Singing, shouting or playing music at a volume that means people have to raise their voice should all be avoided. Instead of singing, recordings are suggested Speaking during the ceremony - for example saying the responses to the vows - should not be in a raised voice Playing instruments that are blown into should be avoided When singing or chanting is required, only one person is allowed to and the couple or venue should consider installing a clear screen Venues frequently used for weddings should mark the floor with tape or paint to help people maintain social distance. The government advice also suggests changing traditional wedding layouts to avoid face-to-face seating, improving ventilation or using face masks. The requirement to follow the 2m rule - or 1m with extra precautions -  will likely rule out the tradition of a father walking his daughter down the aisle, unless they live in the same household. The maximum number of 30 people includes everybody at the ceremony - including the couple, witnesses, officiants, guests and suppliers such as photographers and caterers. What should I do if I have a wedding coming up? The wedding capital where no-one can get married Brother and sister hold outdoor weddings on same day The guidance also says receptions that ""typically follow or accompany marriages or civil partnerships are strongly advised not to take place at this time"". It says small celebrations should only take place if they follow social distancing guidelines, such as groups of up to two households indoors, or up to six people from different households outdoors. The reason people are urged not to sing or speak loudly is based on scientific advice which suggests doing so produces more respiratory droplets which enter the air and can be inhaled by others. Some of the science behind the lockdown easing Hannah Randolph and her fiance are due to get married at the beginning of September but have decided to leave it to ""the last possible moment"" to decide whether to walk up the aisle. The 33-year-old from south-west London worries that if they cancel now, their suppliers will be unlikely to offer a refund as the ceremony can go ahead. But she says: ""I just don't think it'll feel like a wedding."" ""Weddings are every expensive but you can maybe justify it if you're having a party for 100 people,"" she says. Under the new guidance, she would have to cut that by two-thirds. For her, uninviting guests will not be an easy task: ""My fiance has got three siblings and their partners and a nephew and once you add that up it means you've got to have some really awkward conversations with members of the family."" While Hannah says weddings can feel ""frivolous"" given the circumstances, the lack of clarity from the government has left her feeling completely in the dark. ""I can go to a pub and have drinks with a bunch of strangers, but can't have socially distanced drinks with loved ones,"" she said. ""It seems nonsensical."" The government says venues that do not follow the guidance could face action from the Health and Safety Executive or the local authority. Failing to put in place sufficient measures could constitute a breach of existing health and safety legislation and venues could face enforcement notices, the guidance adds. One man, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he and his fiancee are due to get married at the end of July but the new rules ""have made it impossible to have the wedding as planned"". ""It's a joke - the venue we have is a farmhouse and we would have been in the courtyard,"" he said. ""We can protest with hundreds of other people, we can gather to celebrate a football game with strangers, yet we cannot have an outdoor reception with our 25 guests. It goes beyond illogical."" This video can not be played Coronavirus wedding delays 'frustrating' for couples in Wales The 2020 spring and summer wedding season in the UK has been hit hard by the pandemic, with many couples forced to postpone their weddings. Some couples have held substitute celebrations instead, with one couple in Northamptonshireholding a street partyand two hospital workersstaging a mock weddingwhile wearing personal protective gear. While the majority of wedding companies and venues have been flexible about postponing,some brides and grooms said they had beenlocked in a battle to get their money back.

"Dawn Guilfoyle worries her frozen funds will mean no hot water Dawn Guilfoyle is one of thousands who have been barred from using their cash cards because of the failure of huge German payments firm Wirecard. ""It's really bad. I'm left with nothing,"" she says. ""Once the gas goes off, I'll have none for cooking or hot water."" Ms Guilfoyle's card, from the online firm Pockit, has been frozen because the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants to make sure the money is safe. It is one of dozens of payment cards and foreign currency cards which have been blocked, because they used a payment processing service owned by Wirecard. Wirecard's UK arm insisted the problem was ""temporary"" and progress was being made. Many of Pockit's hundreds of thousands of customers have their benefits paid into the card account, which is easier to open than a bank account. Ms Guilfoyle, a single mother from Poplar, in London, is being barred from using Â£500 of child benefit and other benefits which should be in her hands this week. ""I am going to have to see if I can go to a food bank,"" she adds, ""I have bills to pay and I am already in debt management."" Tim Potter is fighting cancer and his frozen money is causing him worry Pockit has apologised, telling customers: ""We are working with the Financial Conduct Authority to reactivate all accounts as quickly as we can and reunite you with your money. ""Unfortunately, we cannot give a timeframe for the resolution of this issue, but we are working round the clock."" Tim Potter is battling cancer and having to look after his elderly mother, at Sherborne, in Dorset, so the failure of his card has been a serious worry. ""I am suffering extreme anxiety - Pockit is used by many highly vulnerable people,"" he says, ""The FCA have failed to look after us with their heavy-handed, inept approach."" Mr Potter sent Â£400 from Pockit to his bank account at RBS, but is concerned that the funds have not arrived yet. Nor has a phone bill been paid. ""Fortunately I managed to pay my rent early in the morning before the freeze,"" Tim adds, ""The DWP were meant to run a support service for this problem but I have no idea how to access this help."" UK cardholders' money locked amid Wirecard fallout Tech giant collapses after German accounts scandal In the FCA's statement announcing the freeze, benefit recipients were advised to contact the Department for Work and Pensions for assistance. A DWP spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are contacting the small number of claimants who we believe have been affected to make sure they have the support they need and can access their money as quickly as possible."" Wirecard disclosed a â¬1.9bn (Â£1.7bn) hole in its accounts Izabelle Butterworth, who works part-time in a shop at Dewsbury, in West Yorkshire, saw her pay go into her Pockit account last week. But she is unable to draw her money out. ""I think it is absolutely ridiculous,"" she complains, ""I am in a really sticky situation. I can't transfer the money or get cashback, and I can't borrow."" Izabelle is concerned that she may not get her money back. ""I've checked and it's there. But is it going to disappear? I don't know."" Funds held by e-money firms like Pockit are not guaranteed up to Â£85,000 as bank deposits are, although they are held in banks and should be safeguarded. Pockit has told customers: ""Your funds are being held by Wirecard in a ring-fenced designated account with Barclays. This means in the event of a Wirecard going bust you are protected."" Even so, the FCA is anxious to make sure no money is siphoned off because of Wirecard's collapse in Germany. ""Following last week's news of â¬1.9bn missing from the accounts of the German company, Wirecard, we placed requirements on the firm's UK business so that it should stop carrying out regulated activities and not pay out or reduce any money it holds,"" the regulator said. ""Our primary objective all along has been to protect the interests and money of consumers who use Wirecard."" The FCA said it was working with the firm, and other international and UK authorities, and is making good progress. ""We are maintaining pressure on the firm to resolve these issues which would allow it to operate under certain conditions,"" the FCA said, adding: ""However, we cannot lift the restrictions without reassuring ourselves that the firm has been able to satisfy all our concerns for example that all clients' money is safe."" A spokesperson for Wirecard said: ""We fully understand the inconvenience the temporary suspension of our services has caused for our valued customers. We are in constant dialogue with the FCA and are working hard with them and our advisors to have the steps in place which will enable the suspension to be lifted so business can resume. ""The FCA has announced today that it has seen good progress from the firm in meeting the conditions that they set. We will provide further updates on our website as soon as we can.""

"Pupils will face the front, but the safety plans will not be based on social distancing The return-to-school plans for autumn in England will involve entire year groups staying in separate ""bubbles"". A draft of the plans, set to be announced later this week, has beenpublished by the Huffington Post,external. It means that groups of up to 240 pupils could be kept apart within a school, with a separate time for starting and finishing. It could also mean they would all be sent home if there was a Covid-19 case in the group. There will also be a recognition of the need for pupils to catch up after months out of regular lessons, with an emphasis on core subjects such as English and maths. The plans, understood to be draft documents shared as part of a consultation, show the approach to safety in the autumn is an expansion of the ""protective bubble"" approach already used. Penalty fines for missing school next term All pupils back in school full-time in September Â£1bn catch-up tutoring plan for autumn 2 metre distancing would mean schools part-time Rather than relying on social distancing, the aim is to limit the points at which the infection could be spread, by keeping pupils in separate, isolated groups through the school day, with their own breaks and lunchtimes. In primary schools this term, these bubbles have been up to 15 pupils, but in the plans for the autumn they could include a full secondary year group, which if there were eight classes, could be 240 pupils. In primary schools in the autumn, the bubbles are expected to be a whole class of 30 pupils. In secondary school entire year groups could be kept apart in the protective ""bubble"" system If a pupil shows coronavirus symptoms, parents will have to quickly come to collect their child. ""While waiting, the child should be kept 2m away from the supervising teacher,"" says the leaked guidance. ""If that is not possible, in the case of a young child or one with complex needs, staff should wear full PPE - disposable gloves, a disposable apron, a fluid-resistant surgical face mask and in some cases eye goggles."" There will not be any fixed social distancing requirements for pupils in primary school - and in secondary it will be 1m, but only where possible, the leaked documents suggest. But teachers will be expected to maintain social distancing at the front of a class - in classrooms in which pupils will face forward, rather than facing each other around circular tables. On Monday, the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson promised a comprehensive track and trace system would be in place for autumn. That would allow year groups or schools to be closed down if there were Covid-19 cases, or if there were signs of a local upsurge infections. There will be routines of regular hand-washing, but there are not expected to be temperature checks or masks, either for staff or pupils. Pupils will be encouraged to get back on track with their learning when schools return for full-time lessons. Attendance will be compulsory - with confirmation on Monday that penalty fines can once again be issued to parents who do not send their children back to school, at the usual level of Â£60 and then Â£120 for late payment. And there will be a push on helping children to catch up in English and maths, which could include narrowing options in GCSE subjects and repeating work from before the lockdown. An increase in disruptive behaviour is anticipated - but it is expected that Ofsted will not be carrying out routine inspections during the term. In response to the leaked documents, a Department for Education spokesman said there would be continuing consultation, ahead of the full plans being published this week. ""We've said we want to see all children back at school in September - returning to full primary and secondary class sizes in a safe way,"" said the DfE spokesman.

"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says the changes will support those caring for others Two households in Wales will be able to form one ""extended household"" to meet indoors and stay overnight from next Monday, the Welsh Government has said. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it means grandparents ""will be able to see and hold their grandchildren again"". People can only be in one extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Travel restrictions are due to be lifted the same day. It follows similar ""support bubble"" arrangements elsewhere in the UK. Can I be in a coronavirus 'social bubble'? Covid 'support bubbles' begin in England and NI What is a support bubble? The changes will mean people can have physical contact, exercise, cook and eat together, and also stay in each other's homes. There is no limit to the number of people that can be in the two households. But, under the rules, if anyone in an extended household develops symptoms the entire household will need to self-isolate. The Welsh Government has asked people to keep records to help with contact tracing if that happens. Two households will be able meet indoors from Monday People shielding can also be included but the first minister warned that if they join an extended household it ""will increase their risk of being exposed"" to coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Creating extended households will enable many families to be reunited for the first time since March. ""Grandparents will be able to see and hold their grandchildren again. ""It will help support many working parents with informal childcare over the summer months and it will also support those who are caring for others."" Jan Maddox in Newport has been apart from Nigel Swaby in Tamworth since the day before lockdown. Jan Maddox, 71, has been living alone in Newport since March and has not been able to see her partner Nigel Swaby, who lives in a village near Tamworth. ""Virtually for the last three months I've been walking up and down the road,"" she said. ""It's the same houses, its the same hedgerows, it's the same everything."" Ms Maddox said the changes will be a ""game-changer"" for her, and if the travel restrictions end on 6 July she said her partner would ""pick me up and he's going to take me back to the Midlands"". This video can not be played Two homes in Wales will be able to link up from Monday Mr Drakeford said extended households means that in some cases ""especially in larger families, this may mean making some difficult choices."" The first minister asked viewers of the daily Welsh Government press conference to ""think about the risks"". ""Think about the consequences - if anyone in the extended household becomes ill, everyone will have to isolate for 14 days,"" he said. ""For some people this will have a greater impact than for others, and needs to be thought about carefully."" The moves coincide with plans to end Wales' stay local rules on 6 July if cases continue to fall, and follows the opening of non-essential retail last week. The moves come into force next week If the changes result in any ""flare ups"" the Welsh Government will be able to ""make a connection between cause and effect"", Mr Drakeford said. ""We make the changes on the basis of advice and the advice is always that these steps are proportionate and shouldn't lead to a further acceleration in the spread of coronavirus."" The first minister said he did not have the ""detail in front"" of him when he was asked how it would impact people in houses of multiple occupation. Mr Drakeford said further guidance will to be published later this week. The Welsh Conservatives welcomed the news but questioned why it could not have been announced last Friday ""to prevent another lost weekend"". Angela Burns, health spokeswoman, said: ""So many families in Wales need such a boost after so long apart, and so if there is science behind why the decision could not have been announced on Friday, then the First Minister should put it into the public domain."" Every time there's an announcement on lifting a lockdown restriction, it's accompanied at some point with guidance notes explaining the finer details. On extended households, those guidance notes will be awaited more keenly than usual because there's a lot we still don't know. The first minister said that extended households would be required to keep records to help track and trace contacts in the event that a member develops Covid. It's not clear what the nature of those records will be. Will extended households have to register and provide contact information? Will they have to keep records of meetings? What happens if they don't? Another big question is what happens to people who rent rooms in shared houses or older people in care homes. Will they be allowed to participate in the extended household scheme and if so how will that work? In Englandhouseholds of any sizewill be able to meet indoors or outside from 4 July. It does not need to be the same set of households. The groups are expected to maintain social distancing, unless they are part of the same support bubble. That is where people living alone can stay with other households -measures also in place in Northern Ireland. The Welsh Government has not used the word bubbles, instead using the term ""extended households"" also seen inScotland. There, extended households are limited to a household meeting another which has just one person alone, or only with children under 18. Who can you have in your bubble?

"Mary Catterall made ammunition during World War Two A 102-year-old great-grandmother has made a ""miraculous recovery"" from coronavirus, her carer has said. Mary Catterall fell ill at Birch Court Care Home in Warrington in May and was nursed back to health at the facility. Mrs Catterall, who took up horse riding and abseiling aged 86, said she was ""OK"" and was ""glad to be knitting"". Carer Sophie Rutter said the 102-year-old was a ""fighter"", adding: ""It was touch and go at one point, but Mary is so determined and brilliant."" Mrs Catterall worked at industrial factory Cockhedge Mill during World War Two making ammunition. The home believes Mrs Catterall is one of Warrington's oldest residents. Sophie Rutter, 24, who works at Birch Court Care Home, said the great-grandmother was ""a privilege to look after"". ""It has been a miraculous recovery, there is no stopping her,"" Miss Rutter said. ""She is always making sure staff are happy and keeps us smiling,"" A Birch Court Care Home spokesperson said ""everyone is one big family"", and the team was planning a celebration party for Mrs Catterall.

"The WHO warns that the ""worst is yet to come"" for the coronavirus pandemic The number of people to die with Covid-19 worldwide passes half a million Since the outbreak began, there have been more than 10 million cases With cases rising in 30 US states, the Texas governor speaks of ""a swift and very dangerous turn"" The EU says from 1 July it will allow travellers in from an initial list of ""safe"" non-EU countries Iran reports its highest single-day death toll since its outbreak began in February, with 162 fatalities In the UK, school pupils return in Wales, while more shops reopen in Scotland UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""concerned"" about a rise in coronavirus cases in Leicester Edited by Lauren Turner There are rising fears in Leicester as the city sees a spike in cases We're pausing the coronavirus live page for now but will be back tomorrow morning. We leave you with a round-up of today's biggest developments from around the globe.  Many thanks for joining us.     We will be wrapping up today's live page shortly. The coverage has been brought to you by: Owen Amos, Oliver Brett, Joshua Cheetham, Alice Evans, Paulin Kola, Max Matza, Ashitha Nagesh, Krutika Pathi, Yvette Tan, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and George Wright. Here are some of the latest graphics showing how the world hit 10 million coronavirus cases. They also show the current situation in the United States. The number of reported infections in the US has now surpassed 2.5 million. Over 125,000 Covid-19-related deaths have been confirmed nationwide - more than in any other country.  You might remember our report a few weeks ago on the coronavirus contact tracer in the UK who told us they werepaid to sit around and watch Netflix. It seems they weren't alone. Thousands of workers in the government's new test and trace call centre failed to trace a single contact of a coronavirus case in the first three weeks of operation. BBC Panorama has discovered that the government's so-called ""army"" of 25,000 call handlers contacted a total of only 15,812 people, to tell them to isolate, in the first three weeks of the operation. The Department of Health says call handlers phone people 10 times before giving up on trying to make contact. It says the test and trace system has been built to have sufficient capacity for the future, so having an overcapacity is a real success. But call handlers say they feel ""guilty for being paid to do nothing"" and that it is ""not true"" that things are going well. Read our full story here. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist A misleading post claiming âsuicide
figures are up 200% since lockdownâ went viral on Twitter in the UK today. The post, which also features a
number for the charity Samaritans, asks users to âcopy and repost this tweetâ.
It has since been shared more than 31,000 times. But we can find no evidence to
support the claim. âThere is currently no evidence of
a rise in suicide rates, with no system yet for national real-time monitoring
of rates,â a Samaritans spokesperson told the BBC. The
Office for National Statistics releases suicide statistics annually. The last
release was in September 2019. The
person who first tweeted the claim has been contacted and has posted a link to
an ITV report from May about a mental health charity, Sane, warning thatcalls
to its helpline had increased by 200%,externalsince
lockdown began. But this is obviously not the same as actual suicide figures
rising by 200%. Pubs and bars that serve food have reopened today in Ireland Ireland's chief medical officer says there's a ""worrying trend"" of increasing numbers of cases of coronavirus in the country. The country has driven down the number of infections in recent weeks andpubs and bars serving food reopened today. But Dr Tony Holohan says there have been some new clusters. As of midnight last night, public health chiefs reported 24 more confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total to 25,462. The number of Covid-19 related deaths has not increased today - remaining at 1,735. Dr Holohan said: ""As restrictions are lifted and people move about more, it is important that we use the tools that have helped us suppress the virus to date."" He called on the public to wash their hands, maintain social distancing and wear face coverings to help ""avoid contracting the virus and spreading it to those we love"". At least six of the new cases were associated with international travel. Irish ministers had been intending to put in place air bridges with countries with low coronavirus infection rates by 9 July, in an effort to boost tourism. But Dr Holohan has expressed concern at the plan and said many of the most popular European holiday spots did not have low enough disease rates to encourage travel to there. Members of two households of any size can meet each other - either inside or outside - from this Saturday in England. You can meet different households at different times, and overnight stays are allowed - but no more than two households should meet at any one time. Social distancing between people not in your household will still have to be observed - ideally at 2m (6ft), but at 1m if that's not possible. From rearranging your living room to resisting the urge to sing,here are a range of tips on how to make home visits as safe as possible. And remember - rules are different for each of the four UK nations. Photographs of healthcare staff and their storiesfrom the pandemic are being recorded to document their ""remarkable dedication"". The#WeCareTogether campaign,externalaims to celebrate the work of staff in hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries, as well as those working from home. Norfolk and Waveney Health and Care Partnership, which created the project, described it as ""powerful and moving"". Jodie Bond, a newly qualified nurse, said she had sleep deprivation and found work ""frightening"" Rachel Brice worked on hospital wards and lived alone while her husband and children moved in with his parents Emmie Yvon N Mwembo says it was ""emotionally draining"" to work in critical care Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Next week, between 7 and 8 July, more than 10 million students at Chinese high schools will take their annual Gaokao final year exams. Xinhua news agency calls this two-day event, similar to A-Levels, âthe largest organised gathering event in China since the start of the Covid-19 outbreakâ. Given that students must attend these exams in person â even in areas where the virus is still high-risk, like Beijing â schools are going to great lengths to ensure that students sitting the exams are safe. The National Health Commission said two weeks ago that all final year students and monitors needed to undergo 14 days of health monitoring and temperature checks before sitting exams. Students will also be tested for the virus on arrival. In most areas, special quarantine centres have been arranged to isolate a maximum of four students with high temperatures, at each corner of a room. However, the Global Times newspaper says that âonly healthy students are able to attend the 2020 Gaokaoâ meaning students with a high temperature will not be able to take their exams. Schools and test centres have been ordered to conduct strict sanitation and sterilisation tests. Students across the country have been told they can wear masks in the examination rooms. For people from medium and high-risk areas, this is mandatory. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics As we've been reporting,pubs and restaurants in Leicester may stay closedfor two weeks longer than the rest of England, due to a surge in coronavirus cases. But if you look at the UK governmentâs main coronavirus data site, you would think thereâs no problem in the city. The site describes about 1,000 cases in Leicester, a figure that has risen by 8% over the last fortnight. But yesterday, the local council released figures, given to them by Public Health England, that count nearly 3,000 cases and a jump in the past fortnight of well over 35%. The reason for this difference is that the main government site doesnât publish figures on positive tests from private laboratories for local authorities in England. They do have those figures â theyâre included in national figures, shared with councils and used in PHEâs weekly map of coronavirus hotspots - but theyâre not published in England. These figures are published in Wales and, as of last week, in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, a health think-tank, has called on the government to publish better data in order to
build the public confidence needed to loosen the lockdown and protect against a
second wave of the virus. Iain CarterBBC Sport commentator The Ryder Cup traditionally attracts some of the most vocal support in golf The Ryder Cup, golf's premier team competition in which Europe and the USA compete over a three-day tournament every two years, is likely to be postponed a year. Europe were due to defend their crown in Whistling Straits, Wisconsin, from 25 to 27 September. However few major in the sport are keen about the prospect of the event being contested in front of empty galleries. Top stars, led by world number one Rory McIlroy, have said the matchshould not be played without fans present. The American Brooks Koepka has said he would ""possibly"" choose to miss the event in the event it were to be staged behind closed doors. Support for the
governmentâs plans to ease the lockdown in England has fallen noticeably over
the past week, a poll suggests, amid rising concern over a second wave of the
coronavirus outbreak. The reopening of
restaurants, pubs, hairdressers and cinemas was backed by 55% of people
questioned by YouGov over the weekend. But support has
fallen by nine points when compared to a poll that asked the same question on
Monday last week. A total of 38% of people
said they opposed the relaxation â a rise of nine points on the previous poll. YouGovâs research
manager Chris Curtis said: âItâs likely that the shift in support was sparked
by images of packed beaches and parks over the hot weekend. âPolling already
shows a large majority of the public (74%) are worried about a second wave of coronavirus, so photos and rolling news footage of busy public areas will only
reignite those concerns.â YouGov questioned
1,626 adults in England, Wales and Scotland online between 26 and 28 June. When Mohammed Azeem arrived in Bradford Royal Infirmary he was in a critical state, with far too little oxygen in his blood - at one point his oxygen levels were ""not compatible with life"" according to the intensive care specialist treating him. But incredibly he survived, writes Dr John Wright. Once his breathing problems began, he was reluctant to call the NHS for help, because of themyth then circulatingin parts of the Asian community that people admitted to hospital were never discharged alive. It was his friend, Haleem, who insisted on calling an ambulance and even helped to carry him into it, as by this stage he was unable to walk. When Mohammed arrived in A&E it was clear that his life was in immediate danger. He was whisked straight to the Intensive Care Unit. It was touch and go from his first day and his perilous journey was only just beginning. He ended up in a coma in ICU for 48 days, and in hospital for 68.

Broadway is normally a focal point for New York's entertainment industry The curtains won't be opening across New York's iconic Broadway theatre district until at least early 2021, according to the AFP news agency. The Broadway League, the representative body for the theatres, is making the announcement now that there will be no stage performances for the rest of 2020, due to the unpredictability of the coronavirus pandemic. It has not set a date for performances to resume, but is offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for all shows until 3 January. The entertainment industry has been particularly hard hit by the effects of coronavirus. Concert halls, music venues and theatres are likely to be some of the last institutions to reopen in the UK, though there is more positive news in Italy: Milan's famous La Scala theatre will stage four concerts next week as it begins to open up after lockdown.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent People who were seriously ill in hospital with coronavirus need to be urgently screened for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), leading doctors in the UK say. The Covid Trauma Response Working Group, led by University College London and involving experts from south-east England, said those who had been in intensive care were most at risk and regular check-ups should last at least a year. More than 100,000 people have been treated in hospital for the virus across the UK. The experts say tens of thousands of these would have been seriously ill enough to be at risk of PTSD. The working group highlighted research which showed 30% of patients who had suffered severe illnesses in infectious disease outbreaks in the past had gone on to develop PTSD, while depression and anxiety problems were also common.

Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The UK has suffered worse than any other G7 nation on excess deaths stats The UK was the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations in the weeks leading up to early June, according to BBC analysis of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Analysis also showed that England fared the worst in Europe, just above Spain. The research compared 11-week periods for each nation as the virus hit its peak in each country. The analysis of Covid-19 deaths and excess deaths - which compared countries in three different ways - showed the UK worse off than the USA, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, and Japan. A separate analysis of European nations, by Oxford University economists, has England just above Spain in terms of the proportion of deaths over and above what would be normal. Read Faisal Islam's report in full.  Milan's La Scala theatre is reopening next week with a series of four concerts, according to news agency Associated Press, following a four-month shutdown during Italy's coronavirus outbreak. Concerts by a small number of artists will be held on on 6, 8, 13 and 15 July, in front of a reduced audience of 600 people. The 13 July concert will feature recent graduates of La Scalaâs academy, while its final event will host the La Scala Philharmonic orchestra. âI think for many music lovers, the time has come to return to hearing live music, even if the means are reduced,â said general manager Dominique Meyer. Concert-goers will have to wear protective masks while entering and exiting the historic theatre, but can take them off once seated. No intermissions are planned for the events, and snack bars will be closed to prevent people from forming queues. The concerts and other future events will be streamed online. Plans for full-scale operas are currently on hold due to public health measures in Italy. But in September, La Scala has arranged for a performance of Verdi's Requiem in Milans Duomo theatre to commemorate those who've died from coronavirus. It will also host a recital of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on 5 September. A couple in Madrid getting married in early June The government has published new guidance on weddings in England, allowing ceremonies of up to 30 people but advising against large receptions. From 4 July, wedding and civil partnerships can go ahead but with only 30 people including the couple, witnesses, and anyone working at the ceremony - like photographers. Alengthy guidance document,externalreleased by the government says people should socially distance, singing should not take place and hands must be washed before exchanging rings. Loud music is also advised against, as it could encourage people to raise their voices - which increases the likelihood of transmission. Read our full story here. The UK's list of countries that people will be able to travel to and from without going into quarantine will be published this week, Transport Secretary Grant
Shapps has confirmed. In a written statement, Mr Shapps adds that travel corridors being considered are based on things such as the prevalence of the virus and the trajectory of new cases in different countries. The transport secretary says the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will also soon be giving details on a review of its travel advice to UK citizens. Since March, that advice has been to avoid all non-essential travel abroad. As wereported over the weekend, it is thought that the list of travel corridors
with the UK will include Spain, France,
Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Turkey, Germany and Norway -
but not Portugal or Sweden. The government previously said
the new rules will give people the opportunity of a foreign summer holiday, while also boosting the UK economy - but the relaxation
depends on risks staying low. For more on this,read our holidays explaineror watchwhat itâs like to fly in the ""new normal"". The cakes (one shown here from a previous new year celebration) can feed 50 people Costco has announced that it has stopped selling its enormously popular half-sheet cakes, which are commonly served at large gatherings such as birthdays, graduations and even weddings. The ban on the custom-decorated cakes, which can feed nearly 50 people for $20 (Â£16), come as most state health agencies warn against large groups due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. âTo help limit personal contact and create more space for social distancing, Costco has reduced service in some departments... At this time, we are not making sheet cakes for special order,â the company said on Facebook earlier this month. The decision prompted an outcry from loyal customers, who took to social media to share stories of the milestones that had led to a sweet treat. Other joked that you don't really need a large gathering to ""demolish"" an entire cake. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Shopping returns to Scotland's streets Shoppers queued early as non-essential retailers across Scotland prepared to reopen their doors. Shops with on-street access and some workplaces such as factories are reopening following further easing of lockdown. Small weddings and civil partnerships can be held outdoors and zoos can reopen, but only to local visitors. However the first minister urged people to act responsibly and ""not to squander"" Scotland's progress. The resumption of non-essential retail is one of the biggest changes to restrictions to date. Live: Coronavirus in Scotland - shops and workplaces reopen Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? It is the first time many stores will have had customers since the Scottish government lockdown came into effect on 23 March. A queue formed outside Glasgow's Primark store on Argyle Street at about 05:50 even though it was not due to open its doors until 08:00. Lines in the capital ran along Princes Street, with police there to manage the queues BBC Scotland News reporter Graham Stewart said there were about 100 people there. He said: ""The line stretched from the entrance on Argyle Street all the way round the corner into Miller Street and half way up that road. ""Many customers said they were shopping for essentials like underwear and socks - others were just happy to get out the house and back to some normality. ""No-one I have spoken to has health concerns although a small number are wearing masks."" Marks had been placed on the pavements to ensure customers were distanced two metres apart and the shop was letting in customers in batches of around 10 people, leaving the store by a different exit. There were also queues outside Primark in Edinburgh's Princes Street and in Aberdeen's Union Street. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ahead of opening time,Nicola Sturgeon tweeted,externalto remind people to observe the rules. She said: ""If you plan on visiting shops today, please do so responsibly. Maintain physical distancing, follow hygiene advice, wear a face covering and respect staff who may be asking you to shop differently. ""We've made so much progress against the virus - let's not squander it."" Monday's easing of the rules forms part of phase two of the Scottish government's""route map"" out of lockdown,external. Shoppers are being urged to wear face masks in stores Further restrictions are due to be lifted later this week. Indoor shopping centres must remain closed for now, except where they contain essential shops. But outdoor markets are also able to open. Scotland's national clinical director Prof Leitch said he was looking forward to people going to the shops and supporting local businesses but he warned: ""It is not back to normal. ""This is not the Boxing Day sales."" Being forced to close its doors in March had pushed Blair Drummond Safari Park ""towards a financial cliff"" Healthcare premises such as optometry practices are also now able to see patients face-to-face for emergency and essential eye care. Many practices have continued to provide remote support for patients during lockdown and throughout phase one, but will now be able to start seeing patients again in person. Factories, warehouses, laboratories and research facilities are among workplaces that can reopen, provided guidance on social distancing measures are in place. But non-essential offices and call centres have to wait until phase three before they can reopen to staff. Playparks have been closed since the end of March It is now also possible to go to outdoor sports courts and children's playgrounds. Outdoor visitor attractions such as zoos and safari parks, along with gardens can reopen, but for local access only - ""broadly within five miles"" - until a further easing of restrictions expected in early July. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), which owns Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park, along with the owners of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling, had been calling for a reopening date before the end of June. The safari park said the months-long closure had""pushed it towards a financial cliff"". RZSS had warned that missing the start of the summer season could see it lose a total of Â£500,000 in funding for its sites within five weeks - Â£400,000 at Edinburgh Zoo and Â£100,000 for the Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore in the Cairngorms. David Field, RZSS chief executive, said the society was ""thrilled"" to be able to reopen its attractions. He said: ""Safety comes first and it is important everyone follows the government guidance to protect themselves and others. ""At the moment, current guidance asks everyone to stay within their local area and defines this as broadly within five miles. ""We are pleased to hear that from 3 July the travel guidelines may be relaxed to allow people from further afield to visit too."" People can get married outdoors and move house Marriages and civil partnerships are now allowed outdoors, with limited numbers. Registration offices can open for high priority tasks. And restrictions on moving house have also been relaxed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations Face-to-face negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU have begun in Brussels, after the teams pledged to ""intensify"" talks. It will be the first time the UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, have met in person since talks began in March, due to the coronavirus outbreak. Negotiations have continued through the pandemic, but took place virtually. Boris Johnson has saida deal could be reached this month with ""new momentum"". The PM met EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen virtually earlier this month and said there was a ""very good"" chance of getting a trade deal by December. A No 10 spokesman also said on Monday the talks ""can't go into the Autumn"", and they need ""make progress as soon as possible"". This latest round of talks will go on all week, with Mr Frost and Mr Barnier expected to meet on Friday. New momentum needed in trade talks, say UK and EU What are the sticking points in the trade talks? Brexit: What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Mr Johnson has refused to extend thetransition period- where the UK continues to follow some EU rules while a trade deal is negotiated - past the end of 2020 if an agreement has not been reached. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove formally confirmed to the bloc two weeks ago that there would be no extension, tweeting: ""On 1 January 2021, we will take back control and regain our political and economic independence."" Both sides have accepted a deal would need to be in place by October to be ratified by the end of the year. If not, the UK would go on totrade with the bloc on World Trade Organisation rules- which critics say could damage the economy. This video can not be played Speaking earlier this month, the PM said the EU and UK were ânot actually that far apartâ After the last round of talks in early June, Mr Barnier said there had been ""no significant areas of progress"" on issues between the two sides - a sentiment echoed by Mr Frost. Sticking points between the two sidesinclude the so-called ""level-playing field"" - to ensure businesses on one side don't have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other - fishing rules and the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ahead of the latest round of talks, Mr Frost said the EU's ""unrealistic positions"" would need to change if there was to be any progress. Speaking as the talks began, European Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie said: ""Our overall message this week, but also for the coming weeks and coming months, is to intensify our negotiations in order to make progress in order to get a deal."" Despite the rhetoric about racing for a summer deal, an autumn timeline may be more comfortable for Boris Johnson. He might feel full freedom to manoeuvre, considering his 80-seat parliamentary majority. But compromises may be easier for the PM to make in the autumn, with the clock ticking down to a potential no-deal - which much of UK industry and many MPs would oppose. One thing for London to remember though - an EU divided over concessions would not be something to celebrate. Every EU country and the European parliament will need to give the nod to a future relations agreement. Or there will be no deal at all. Read more from Katya here. The chairman of the European Research Group - a backbench group of pro-Brexit Tory MPs - has written to Mr Barnier ""to encourage the development of a sense of urgency in the negotiations"". Entitling the letter as a ""missive from a free country"", Mark Francois says he has always believed the UK and EU should be ""firm friends and sovereign equals"", but criticised the bloc's ""unreasonable demands"" around the level playing field, fisheries and the role of the European Court of Justice. He added: ""All I and my colleagues in the ERG have ever really wanted is to live in a free country, which elects its own government and makes its own laws and then lives under them in peace. ""We have come a very long way in securing this objective and we have no intention of abandoning it, either now or in the future"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Frost will continue to lead on the negotiations for the UK though, saying the talks will ""remain my top single priority until those negotiations have concluded, one way or another"". Mr Ferrie said he had ""no particular comments to make"" about the appointment, but added: ""From our side at least we are fully concentrated on the negotiations.""

"Byron Burger has filed a notice to appoint administrators, as it tries to protect the restaurant chain from creditors while it seeks a rescue deal. The chain has 1,200 staff and 52 restaurants across the UK. Sources confirmed that the Byron Burger board still remain hopeful that it can be sold as a ""going concern"". The chain is believed to be in talks with three potential buyers, who could buy the firm or parts of it, in a so-called ""pre-pack"" administration deal. This is where a firm sells all or some of its assets to a pre-determined buyer, and appoints administrators to do so. If the chain does go formally into administration in the coming days, KPMG is set to deal with the process. The accountancy firm has been trying to sell Byron since early May. The notice to appoint administratorswas first reported by Sky news.,external Coronavirus: Restaurants are 'hurting', says Deliveroo boss Coronavirus lockdown: Why can't some businesses reopen in England yet? Coronavirus lockdown: Pubs, restaurants and barbers reopen in Ireland A source close to the company said that an investor could buy the brand and parts of the business, but reduce the size of the firm. That could potentially mean job losses and restaurant closures. The filing of the notice to appoint administrators gives legal protection from creditors while a sale or pre-pack administration is prepared. Discussions are currently taking place with creditors about debts, the source said. The company is aiming for a phased re-opening from mid-July, but it will probably be a smaller company, the source added. Byron has been struggling for a number of years. In 2018 itagreed a rescue planand restructuring which was handled by KPMG. As part of that deal, investment house Three Hills Capital Partners became the biggest shareholder. On Monday, The Restaurant Group said its own rescue deal had been approved by creditors, meaning 160 outlets would remain open. As announced on 10 June,up to 3,000 jobs are to goas the group closes 125 restaurants, mainly at its Frankie & Benny's chain. That's out of about 7,000 jobs in that division of the group. The restaurants that will not reopen are located across the UK, but mainly in England. Many of them are located in out-of-town retail parks, which have been hit by lower footfall as consumers increasingly shop online. The coronavirus crisis accelerated a process of permanently closing those restaurants that was already happening, a spokesman for the firm said. The Restaurant Group started a consultation process with staff after the June announcement, and those that have not already been made redundant remain on furlough. Restaurant chains, which were already under pressure before the coronavirus crisis, have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.

"Noah had been missing for almost a week A woman who found missing teenager Noah Donahoe's bicycle in her garden has spoken about her heartbreak when she realised it was his. A body believed to be that of the missing Belfast teenager was found in a storm drain on Saturday, almost a week after the 14-year-old was last seen near the Shore Road in north Belfast. Noah, from south Belfast, left his home on his bicycle on Sunday 21 June. His disappearance led to widespread searches and an outpouring of grief. Belfast Lord Mayor Frank McCoubrey has opened an online book of condolence in Noah's memory. Mr McCoubrey said he hoped the outpouring of public support would bring some comfort to his family. Karen Crooks told BBC News NI she found Noah's bicycle at her Northwood Road home in north Belfast on the Sunday evening at about 20:00 BST. The storm drain where Noah's body was found lies behind her garden. Ms Crooks thought the bicycle had been left behind by local boys. This video can not be played 'My heart sank when I realised it was his bike' ""I went out and lifted it off the ground because it was just lying at the back of my car. I didn't think any more of it. I thought the mummy will come up for it, the wee boy will come up for it. I went to work the next morning, it was still there. ""I came home and then started to look on social media and saw the missing boy. Something alerted me to make me read into it a wee bit more, and I saw it was on the Shore Road, and I saw the black Apollo mountain bike."" Ms Crooks said her heart sank and she rang the police. ""I stood in this garden on the mornings of last week and just went to myself 'Noah where are you? Noah where did you go?' ""Trying to rack my brain, as a child growing up here, where would I have gone? What would I have done? I just couldn't, I couldn't work it out, I couldn't put the pieces together."" Hundreds of people attended vigils for the teenager on Sunday evening Ms Crooks said she was glad that she was able to bring the search teams to find Noah. ""They may never have found him, so I do take comfort in that,"" she said. She also reached out to his family, telling them they were welcome to come to her garden, where Noah had been, at any time. ""I don't know if his mother, whether you would take comfort from being here, or you wouldn't take comfort from being here. But I just want his family and his mother to know that they can come here if they feel they need to come here. My door is opened and they can be here with their thoughts."" Meanwhile,, at Monday's Stormont meeting, the first and deputy first ministers Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill offered their sympathy to Noah's mother, Fiona, and the whole family circle. ""Noah was a talented and loving child and it's clear he was deeply loved,"" said Mrs Foster. She said his family and friends had been robbed of ""a young man who had a bright future ahead of him"". Mrs O'Neill said news of Noah's death had been ""devastating"". The teenager's teammates paid tribute to Noah at Sunday's vigil ""We had all hoped and prayed for a very different outcome and our hearts are broken for Noah's mummy Fiona, for all his family and friends at St Malachy's and beyond."" Michael Calo, Noah's basketball coach said: ""Noah was just such a nice young man, everybody loved him. ""He was a lovely kid, a good athlete, a good musician, quite good at the cello, and just a really lovely young person."" Mr Calo's twin sons, classmates of Noah's at St Malachy's College, played rugby and basketball and sang in the school choir with him. ""They are devastated, like most of the kids Noah would have grown up with,"" he said. He coached Noah when he played for Belfast Phoenix Basketball team. Noah Donohoe's mother, Fiona, said she shared a ""special bond"" with her son A memorial basketball tournament in Noah's memory is now being discussed, Mr Calo said. On Sunday,Noah's family issued a statement thanking the community for ""the support, outpouring of love, and empathy we have received"". His family said: ""He was very special. It is very hard to do justice or honour the extraordinary relationship Noah and his mummy shared."" Their statement added: ""In his 14 years his mummy got so much from their special bond, he taught his mummy so much. They were each other's world."" People showed their appreciation for the search teams who looked for Noah The family said details of Noah's funeral will follow. Also on Sunday, hundreds of people, including members of Noah's family and many of the volunteers who took part in searches, attended vigils for the teenager. Sean McCarry, from Community Search and Rescue, told the BBC on Monday he had never experienced anything like it before. ""It was one of the most moving and humbling experiences that I have had,"" he said. Pastor Brian Madden said Sunday's vigil in north Belfast had allowed a grieving community to pay their respects ""We were welcomed to the services, as Noah's family was, exactly as we were welcomed in throughout the five or six days of the search, with open arms from everybody"". ""It was obvious to see that everybody there was there united together, completely united right across the whole of north Belfast"". Fourteen blue balloons were released in memory of Noah Pastor Brian Madden, who spoke at a vigil, urged Noah's teenage friends to ""let their emotions out"". ""Don't bottle it up, don't hold it in, talk to someone, and be real, let it out, someone will listen to you,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. A vigil was also held in Strabane, where the Donohoe family are originally from, on Sunday Pastor Madden said the vigil had allowed a grieving community to come together and to pay their respects. ""Every single person that knew him spoke so very highly of this young man. It was incredible,"" he said. Police said on Saturday that they did not believe there was any foul play involved in the death.

"Lockdown restrictions in Leicester could be extended for two weeks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson promises 'whack-a-mole' strategy to deal with localised Covid-19 flare-ups. Government promises to rebuild England's schools as part of plans designed to kick-start the economy after coronavirus lockdown. People who were seriously ill in hospital with coronavirus need to be urgently screened for post-traumatic stress disorder, leading doctors say. Updates on Monday 29 June Rob England and Jay Vydelingum Rob EnglandBBC News Thank you for joining us for our live coverage today. We'll be back tomorrow morning at 09:00 with the latest news of the coronavirus pandemic from across England. Until then, stay safe. BBC Sport Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers says his side ""will react accordingly"" if lockdown measures are extended locally. The city's mayor has saidcoronavirus restrictions in Leicester could go on for longerbecause of a surge in cases. The Foxes have three home games left to play this season on 4, 15 and 26 July. ""Nothing has changed in terms of how we have been working thus far in this situation, but I've always said we will react accordingly,"" said Rodgers. ""We have to have agility in this period,"" he added. Amy WoodfieldBBC News The Unite trade union is in favour of targeted lockdowns across Leicester. Regional secretary for the East Midlands, Paresh Patel, said: ""This spike in coronavirus cases across the city is extremely worrying. ""Everyone needs to now play their part in getting this under control as rapidly as possible with localised lockdowns as necessary. ""Everything that can be done must be done to protect the public's health and to avoid layoffs and even more damage to an already badly damaged regional economy."" A couple in Madrid getting married in early June The government has published new guidance on weddings in England, allowing ceremonies of up to 30 people but advising against receptions. From 4 July, wedding and civil partnerships can go ahead but with only 30 people including the couple, staff such as a photographer and witnesses. People should socially distance, singing should not take place and hands must be washed before exchanging rings. Receptions should be small, with only two households able to meet indoors. Newcastle has published a City COVID Control Plan, which is aimed at minimising further outbreaks and
responding quickly if there are positive cases in places like schools or care homes. Newcastleâs
Director of Public Health, Professor Eugene Milne said: âWe
have robust measures to respond quickly to any outbreaks, but the ideal is that
we donât have to use them. Our focus should be to continue preventing the
spread of the virus through good hygiene, hand washing, wearing face coverings
when possible and continuing to stick to social distancing guidelines."" The
plan outlines how Newcastle will ramp up national testing programmes, using localised and mobile testing and ensure residents understand the symptoms, how to get tested and how to isolate. A key element is responding to outbreaks, which will fall into one of four response categories â Green, Amber, Red, Red Plus - with an appropriate level of action and support behind each category. Rob SissonsEast Midlands Today Reporter A video conference call is taking place right now between Leicester mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, Health Secretary Matt Hancock and health officials. They are discussing the way forward and the possible extension of local lockdown restrictions in Leicester. This is uncharted territory. Local lockdowns are part of the government strategy for putting out the fires, if you like, of a rise in local coronavirus cases but with pubs and hairdressers getting ready to reopen next weekend, that's not very far away. It's still not definite whether this extension will go ahead or not but there has been a lot of mixed messages and people have been very confused here in Leicester. Jay VydelingumBBC News Online The prime minister has said âlocal lockdowns and local whack-a-mole strategiesâ will be used to deal with coronavirus outbreaks. He was asked about talk of an extended localised lockdown after rising cases of the virus in a Leicester suburb. Boris Johnson said: ""We are not out of the woods yetâ. This video can not be played Margaret Barton, owner of Cafe Mbriki, says only being able to serve takeaways is hardly worth staying open for Just as the rest of England prepares for the welcome easing of lockdown restrictions at the weekend, people in Leicester are reacting to the news that they may have to carry on as they are. The city's mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has said the government has recommended current restrictions are maintained for another two weeks due to a surge in coronavirus cases. That means pubs, restaurants and hairdressers could have to keep their doors closed for a further fortnight. Amy WoodfieldBBC News An academic fears prolonging the lockdown in Leicester could result in more coronavirus cases on the outskirts of the city. Dr Duncan Robertson, from the School of Business and Economics in Loughborough, said: ""Pubs might not open in Leicester but if you're desperate to go to the pub, what do you do? You just go to 'not-Leicester' just on the boundary. ""Of course that raises the prospect of it potentially spreading even further."" Sean CoughlanBBC News, family and education correspondent Parents in England who do not send their children back to school in September will face fines,says the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. ""Unless there's a good reason for absenceâ¦ we'd be imposing fines on families,"" he said. But head teachers said fining parents was not the ""right approach"" at first. ""There will be many frightened and anxious parents out there,"" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. Head teachers, who decide whether to apply fines, are more likely to want to build up parents' trust in a safe return, said Mr Barton. Neil HeathBBC News Online Soldiers from the Royal Logistics Corps (RLC) have been pictured at a mobile coronavirus testing site at Evington Leisure Centre in Leicester this morning. Neil Hamilton-Brown, from Leicester City Council, said the military have been ""supporting the national effort"". There has been a surge in Covid-19 cases in the city which led to Home Secretary Priti Patel confirming the government was considering a local lockdown. However, Sir Peter Soulsby, the city's mayor, said government advice was ""very different"" to this overnight, but he added the city's pubs and restaurants could stay closed for two more weeks. Soldiers have also been helping the running of a testing centre at Spinney Hill Park. Sandish ShokerBBC News Sir Peter Soulsby said that during a meeting with health secretary Matt Hancock this afternoon he will tell him ""there is no reason to pick on Leicester"". The Leicester mayor said any delay to the relaxation of lockdown in the city would have an impact on the economy and businesses. ""I would hope that he will recognise that it's not a case that has been made for imposing restrictions on Leicester where other places are allowed to begin to get back and up and operating,"" he said. Asked if there was a specific area of Leicester the report had identified as having a higher number of cases, the Labour mayor said: ""It certainly suggests there are some wards in Leicester that have higher rates than others. ""But I've said to them on a number of occasions that actually the wards of Leicester don't tell you very much about the neighbourhoods and communities in Leicester, and I have said to them surely they have the data at street level and neighbourhood level and community level but as yet that's not the way that they've been looking at it or presenting it to us."" The mayor and health secretary are due to meet this afternoon, with Mr Hancock expected to address MPs later today. We've been talking about Leicester being the first city to be kept back in the current lockdown, compared to the rest of the country. But what measures are due to ease across the rest of England from the 4 July? Neil HeathBBC News Online An academic clinician from the University of Leicester says the factors which led to the surge in Covid-19 cases is a ""perfect storm"" for the virus to spread. Dr Manish Pareek, a consultant at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said many of the recent cases were from ""inner-city areas... which have high levels of ethnic diversity, pockets of deprivation but also quite crowded housing with inter-generational and multi-occupancy households"". ""It brings together a number of factors which are almost like a perfect storm for a virus to be spread within,"" he added. In April, Dr Pareekraised concernsover the lack of recorded data on the number of Covid-19 deaths of people from BAME backgrounds. There have been 2,987 positive cases in Leicester since the pandemic began, with 866 of those - 29% - reported in the two weeks to 23 June. MOT testing is set to resume from 1 August for car, motorcycle and van owners in England. The Department for Transport granted drivers a six month exemption in March due to lockdown restrictions. Those with an MOT due date before 1 August will still be exempt, but vehicles must be properly maintained. Roads Minister Baroness Vere said: âGarages across the country are open and I urge drivers who are
due for their MOT to book a test as soon they can.â The government added that some exemptions were still available. Alex SmithBBC News Online Leicester's mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has questioned the effectiveness of a local lockdownamid talksrestrictions may have to stay in place for another two weeks following a surge in Covid-19 cases. On extending the current measures, he says: ""What we still don't have - whether it's lockdown or restrictions - is any explanation as to why on Earth you would do it and why you would do it here in Leicester."" Asked to outline the businesses that would not be able to reopen on Saturday if the recommendations were implemented, Sir Peter said: ""I think it's very unclear as to what difference it would make if they continue the regulations in Leicester and why you would do it. ""How can it possibly make any difference? If the virus is out of control and spreading in Leicester with the restrictions, I can't understand how extending them for a further two weeks would make any difference to that. ""Frankly, we need to have an explanation - but more importantly we need some collaboration with the government so that we don't hear about these proposals either through announcements briefed to the media over the weekend or emails that come in at one o'clock in the morning."" Andrew SegalBBC South West With just five days to go before large numbers of holidaymakers could arrive in Cornwall and Devon, the counties' police commissioner is urging people to behave responsibly. Alison Hernandez said she was concerned people would begin to relax their lockdown well before the official date of 4 July. But she added that officers would not be enforcing social distancing - people must do that themselves and officers had to get back to dealing with everyday crime. Policing cannot enforce social distancing. The reality is now, especially as we move into everything unlocking next weekend, we're back into normal policing. Officers are out and about dealing with ordinary crimes that are happening every day in our patch. We may be the second lowest crime area in the country, but we still have those crimes to deal with."" Alison Hernandez, Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Rob EnglandBBC News The main story we've seen develop so far today has been the discussions around the current national lockdown being extended in Leicester. If you're just joining us, here are some key points: You can follow the latest coronavirus news from across England here until 17:00. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent We should get used to these local flare-ups - they are going to become a way of life over the coming months. Given the amount of virus still around - there are still around 1,000 positive tests every day across the UK on average - there will be clusters developing as people return to something near normal life. What's important is that they are brought under control quickly and don't spread. The fact a local outbreak has been identified in one part of Leicester suggests the system is working to some extent - although it's fair to ask whether it could have been spotted more quickly given cases have been growing for a number of weeks. Shoppers in Leicester queue outside Primark With extra testing facilities parachuted in, officials will be desperately trying to get a clear idea of just how far it has spread so delaying the further easing of restrictions is the logical step. If more cases keep emerging, a local lockdown will be on the cards. Should it be like this? Some argue we should have suppressed the virus further before easing - essentially going for elimination like New Zealand. But for a country like the UK where the virus had spread further before lockdown and with its size of population and packed cities that is somewhat harder. BBC Breakfast A virologist, also well-known as one of theNaked Scientistsbroadcasters, said history could tell us a lot about how to deal with unexpected Covid-19 hotspots
like the one in Leicester where anew lockdown is being considered. Dr Chris Smith, ofCambridge University,externaland a frequent broadcaster in the region, said: ""We can fall back on history because we have got a track record of having dealt with dread diseases all over the world in years gone by. ""Under certain circumstances lockdowns are necessary, but under other circumstances you do things like - when we were dealing with Ebola - a cordon sanitaire. ""What you do is you go in and act decisively in one particular area. You find out where the cases are. ""You isolate the cases and you break the train of transmission,"" Dr Smith added that lockdown was one end of the spectrum, but information-gathering was the most important thing. ""That would help to find out where the cases are, what caused the outbreak, who is giving it to whom, who is most at risk and then where to focus attention,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Dawn Guilfoyle worries her frozen funds will mean no hot water Dawn Guilfoyle is one of thousands who have been barred from using their cash cards because of the failure of huge German payments firm Wirecard. ""It's really bad. I'm left with nothing,"" she says. ""Once the gas goes off, I'll have none for cooking or hot water."" Ms Guilfoyle's card, from the online firm Pockit, has been frozen because the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants to make sure the money is safe. It is one of dozens of payment cards and foreign currency cards which have been blocked, because they used a payment processing service owned by Wirecard. Wirecard's UK arm insisted the problem was ""temporary"" and progress was being made. Many of Pockit's hundreds of thousands of customers have their benefits paid into the card account, which is easier to open than a bank account. Ms Guilfoyle, a single mother from Poplar, in London, is being barred from using Â£500 of child benefit and other benefits which should be in her hands this week. ""I am going to have to see if I can go to a food bank,"" she adds, ""I have bills to pay and I am already in debt management."" Tim Potter is fighting cancer and his frozen money is causing him worry Pockit has apologised, telling customers: ""We are working with the Financial Conduct Authority to reactivate all accounts as quickly as we can and reunite you with your money. ""Unfortunately, we cannot give a timeframe for the resolution of this issue, but we are working round the clock."" Tim Potter is battling cancer and having to look after his elderly mother, at Sherborne, in Dorset, so the failure of his card has been a serious worry. ""I am suffering extreme anxiety - Pockit is used by many highly vulnerable people,"" he says, ""The FCA have failed to look after us with their heavy-handed, inept approach."" Mr Potter sent Â£400 from Pockit to his bank account at RBS, but is concerned that the funds have not arrived yet. Nor has a phone bill been paid. ""Fortunately I managed to pay my rent early in the morning before the freeze,"" Tim adds, ""The DWP were meant to run a support service for this problem but I have no idea how to access this help."" UK cardholders' money locked amid Wirecard fallout Tech giant collapses after German accounts scandal In the FCA's statement announcing the freeze, benefit recipients were advised to contact the Department for Work and Pensions for assistance. A DWP spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are contacting the small number of claimants who we believe have been affected to make sure they have the support they need and can access their money as quickly as possible."" Wirecard disclosed a â¬1.9bn (Â£1.7bn) hole in its accounts Izabelle Butterworth, who works part-time in a shop at Dewsbury, in West Yorkshire, saw her pay go into her Pockit account last week. But she is unable to draw her money out. ""I think it is absolutely ridiculous,"" she complains, ""I am in a really sticky situation. I can't transfer the money or get cashback, and I can't borrow."" Izabelle is concerned that she may not get her money back. ""I've checked and it's there. But is it going to disappear? I don't know."" Funds held by e-money firms like Pockit are not guaranteed up to Â£85,000 as bank deposits are, although they are held in banks and should be safeguarded. Pockit has told customers: ""Your funds are being held by Wirecard in a ring-fenced designated account with Barclays. This means in the event of a Wirecard going bust you are protected."" Even so, the FCA is anxious to make sure no money is siphoned off because of Wirecard's collapse in Germany. ""Following last week's news of â¬1.9bn missing from the accounts of the German company, Wirecard, we placed requirements on the firm's UK business so that it should stop carrying out regulated activities and not pay out or reduce any money it holds,"" the regulator said. ""Our primary objective all along has been to protect the interests and money of consumers who use Wirecard."" The FCA said it was working with the firm, and other international and UK authorities, and is making good progress. ""We are maintaining pressure on the firm to resolve these issues which would allow it to operate under certain conditions,"" the FCA said, adding: ""However, we cannot lift the restrictions without reassuring ourselves that the firm has been able to satisfy all our concerns for example that all clients' money is safe."" A spokesperson for Wirecard said: ""We fully understand the inconvenience the temporary suspension of our services has caused for our valued customers. We are in constant dialogue with the FCA and are working hard with them and our advisors to have the steps in place which will enable the suspension to be lifted so business can resume. ""The FCA has announced today that it has seen good progress from the firm in meeting the conditions that they set. We will provide further updates on our website as soon as we can.""

Tim Potter is battling cancer and having to look after his elderly mother, at Sherborne, in Dorset, so the failure of his card has been a serious worry. ""I am suffering extreme anxiety - Pockit is used by many highly vulnerable people,"" he says, ""The FCA have failed to look after us with their heavy-handed, inept approach."" Mr Potter sent Â£400 from Pockit to his bank account at RBS, but is concerned that the funds have not arrived yet. Nor has a phone bill been paid. ""Fortunately I managed to pay my rent early in the morning before the freeze,"" Tim adds, ""The DWP were meant to run a support service for this problem but I have no idea how to access this help."" UK cardholders' money locked amid Wirecard fallout Tech giant collapses after German accounts scandal In the FCA's statement announcing the freeze, benefit recipients were advised to contact the Department for Work and Pensions for assistance. A DWP spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are contacting the small number of claimants who we believe have been affected to make sure they have the support they need and can access their money as quickly as possible."" Wirecard disclosed a â¬1.9bn (Â£1.7bn) hole in its accounts Izabelle Butterworth, who works part-time in a shop at Dewsbury, in West Yorkshire, saw her pay go into her Pockit account last week. But she is unable to draw her money out. ""I think it is absolutely ridiculous,"" she complains, ""I am in a really sticky situation. I can't transfer the money or get cashback, and I can't borrow."" Izabelle is concerned that she may not get her money back. ""I've checked and it's there. But is it going to disappear? I don't know."" Funds held by e-money firms like Pockit are not guaranteed up to Â£85,000 as bank deposits are, although they are held in banks and should be safeguarded. Pockit has told customers: ""Your funds are being held by Wirecard in a ring-fenced designated account with Barclays. This means in the event of a Wirecard going bust you are protected."" Even so, the FCA is anxious to make sure no money is siphoned off because of Wirecard's collapse in Germany. ""Following last week's news of â¬1.9bn missing from the accounts of the German company, Wirecard, we placed requirements on the firm's UK business so that it should stop carrying out regulated activities and not pay out or reduce any money it holds,"" the regulator said. ""Our primary objective all along has been to protect the interests and money of consumers who use Wirecard."" The FCA said it was working with the firm, and other international and UK authorities, and is making good progress. ""We are maintaining pressure on the firm to resolve these issues which would allow it to operate under certain conditions,"" the FCA said, adding: ""However, we cannot lift the restrictions without reassuring ourselves that the firm has been able to satisfy all our concerns for example that all clients' money is safe."" A spokesperson for Wirecard said: ""We fully understand the inconvenience the temporary suspension of our services has caused for our valued customers. We are in constant dialogue with the FCA and are working hard with them and our advisors to have the steps in place which will enable the suspension to be lifted so business can resume. ""The FCA has announced today that it has seen good progress from the firm in meeting the conditions that they set. We will provide further updates on our website as soon as we can.""

"This video can not be played The wounded were taken to hospital after gunmen stormed the stock exchange Four gunmen attacked the Pakistani stock exchange in Karachi, killing two guards and a policeman and wounding seven others before being shot dead. The assailants launched a grenade attack at the main gate to the building and opened fire but police say they failed to make it to the trading floor. Staff took refuge in locked rooms and many were evacuated as security forces put an end to the assault. Militants from the Baloch Liberation Army say they were behind the attack. Ethnic Baloch groups have fought a long-running insurgency for a separate homeland and a greater share of resources in Pakistan's Balochistan province. The gunmen stormed a security post at the gate and fought their way into the car park The director-general of the paramilitary Sindh Rangers force, Omer Ahmed Bukhari, said all the attackers had been killed within eight minutes. ""They had come to carry out an attack inside the building and take hostages inside,"" he told a news conference. He said the gunmen had brought supplies of food as well as weaponry, suggesting they were prepared for a siege. Pakistan has suffered years of militant violence, mostly by Islamist groups, but attacks such as this one have become rare in recent years. Monday's attack began when the militants armed with automatic rifles threw a grenade and then began firing at a security post outside the stock exchange. ""The attackers came in a silver Corolla and were stopped by police at the gate outside where the exchange of fire took place,"" Sindh police additional inspector general Ghulam Nabi Memon told BBC Urdu. The covered body of one of the suspected gunmen is removed from the site of the attack Guards fought back, killing all four heavily armed attackers, the authorities say. Three police officials are among the seven wounded receiving treatment in hospital. Mr Memon said the attackers did not manage to enter the main building and grenades, explosives and other weapons were recovered from them. The Pakistan Stock Exchange confirmed that no militants made it into the building. Its director, Abid Ali Habib, said the gunmen made their way from the car park and ""opened fire on everyone"". Images from the scene show the bodies of at least two men on the ground next to large amounts of ammunition and weapons. It was not immediately clear if more assailants were involved, prompting an extensive search of the premises by security forces. The other Balochistan: Life in a conflict zone Balochistan war: Pakistan accused over 1,000 dumped bodies The untold story of Pakistan's other war Reports say most people at the stock exchange managed to escape or hide in locked rooms.Those inside the building were evacuated,externalfrom the back door, Geo TV reported. Trading continued without interruption. ""We locked ourselves in our offices,"" Asad Javed, an employee at a brokerage in the building, told Reuters news agency. The exchange is situated in a high security zone along with head offices of banks and other businesses. It has offices for hundreds of financial institutions and says up to 8,000 people work there on a normal day - but numbers were down because of home working during the coronavirus pandemic. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) is one of half a dozen armed resistance groups in Balochistan and has launched previous attacks in Pakistan. In 2018 its members tried to storm the Chinese consulate in Karachi, killing at least four people. All staff inside the building were unharmed. Last year the BLA attacked a five-star hotel in the port city of Gwadar in Balochistan. The hotel is the centrepiece of a multi-billion-dollar Chinese project and was selected in order to target Chinese and other investors. Separatist militants in Balochistan oppose Chinese investment, saying it is of little benefit to local people. The BLA originally sought political autonomy for the province but has gradually evolved into a violent armed separatist movement and is listed as a terrorist organisation by Pakistan, the UK and the US. Widescale abuses and repression by the Pakistani military have been documented over decades in the province, which is difficult to access by journalists and human rights groups. Balochistan is a sparsely populated region, and the BLA and other militants have sanctuaries there and in adjoining areas in Pakistan. They also are believed to have hideouts in south-eastern Afghanistan. The province remains Pakistan's most impoverished area despite being rich in gas and coal reserves, as well as copper and gold. Baloch nationalists have long accused the central government of exploitation, and denying the province its due rights.

"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says the changes will support those caring for others Two households in Wales will be able to form one ""extended household"" to meet indoors and stay overnight from next Monday, the Welsh Government has said. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it means grandparents ""will be able to see and hold their grandchildren again"". People can only be in one extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Travel restrictions are due to be lifted the same day. It follows similar ""support bubble"" arrangements elsewhere in the UK. Can I be in a coronavirus 'social bubble'? Covid 'support bubbles' begin in England and NI What is a support bubble? The changes will mean people can have physical contact, exercise, cook and eat together, and also stay in each other's homes. There is no limit to the number of people that can be in the two households. But, under the rules, if anyone in an extended household develops symptoms the entire household will need to self-isolate. The Welsh Government has asked people to keep records to help with contact tracing if that happens. Two households will be able meet indoors from Monday People shielding can also be included but the first minister warned that if they join an extended household it ""will increase their risk of being exposed"" to coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Creating extended households will enable many families to be reunited for the first time since March. ""Grandparents will be able to see and hold their grandchildren again. ""It will help support many working parents with informal childcare over the summer months and it will also support those who are caring for others."" Jan Maddox in Newport has been apart from Nigel Swaby in Tamworth since the day before lockdown. Jan Maddox, 71, has been living alone in Newport since March and has not been able to see her partner Nigel Swaby, who lives in a village near Tamworth. ""Virtually for the last three months I've been walking up and down the road,"" she said. ""It's the same houses, its the same hedgerows, it's the same everything."" Ms Maddox said the changes will be a ""game-changer"" for her, and if the travel restrictions end on 6 July she said her partner would ""pick me up and he's going to take me back to the Midlands"". This video can not be played Two homes in Wales will be able to link up from Monday Mr Drakeford said extended households means that in some cases ""especially in larger families, this may mean making some difficult choices."" The first minister asked viewers of the daily Welsh Government press conference to ""think about the risks"". ""Think about the consequences - if anyone in the extended household becomes ill, everyone will have to isolate for 14 days,"" he said. ""For some people this will have a greater impact than for others, and needs to be thought about carefully."" The moves coincide with plans to end Wales' stay local rules on 6 July if cases continue to fall, and follows the opening of non-essential retail last week. The moves come into force next week If the changes result in any ""flare ups"" the Welsh Government will be able to ""make a connection between cause and effect"", Mr Drakeford said. ""We make the changes on the basis of advice and the advice is always that these steps are proportionate and shouldn't lead to a further acceleration in the spread of coronavirus."" The first minister said he did not have the ""detail in front"" of him when he was asked how it would impact people in houses of multiple occupation. Mr Drakeford said further guidance will to be published later this week. The Welsh Conservatives welcomed the news but questioned why it could not have been announced last Friday ""to prevent another lost weekend"". Angela Burns, health spokeswoman, said: ""So many families in Wales need such a boost after so long apart, and so if there is science behind why the decision could not have been announced on Friday, then the First Minister should put it into the public domain."" Every time there's an announcement on lifting a lockdown restriction, it's accompanied at some point with guidance notes explaining the finer details. On extended households, those guidance notes will be awaited more keenly than usual because there's a lot we still don't know. The first minister said that extended households would be required to keep records to help track and trace contacts in the event that a member develops Covid. It's not clear what the nature of those records will be. Will extended households have to register and provide contact information? Will they have to keep records of meetings? What happens if they don't? Another big question is what happens to people who rent rooms in shared houses or older people in care homes. Will they be allowed to participate in the extended household scheme and if so how will that work? In Englandhouseholds of any sizewill be able to meet indoors or outside from 4 July. It does not need to be the same set of households. The groups are expected to maintain social distancing, unless they are part of the same support bubble. That is where people living alone can stay with other households -measures also in place in Northern Ireland. The Welsh Government has not used the word bubbles, instead using the term ""extended households"" also seen inScotland. There, extended households are limited to a household meeting another which has just one person alone, or only with children under 18. Who can you have in your bubble?

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Shopping returns to Scotland's streets Shoppers queued early as non-essential retailers across Scotland prepared to reopen their doors. Shops with on-street access and some workplaces such as factories are reopening following further easing of lockdown. Small weddings and civil partnerships can be held outdoors and zoos can reopen, but only to local visitors. However the first minister urged people to act responsibly and ""not to squander"" Scotland's progress. The resumption of non-essential retail is one of the biggest changes to restrictions to date. Live: Coronavirus in Scotland - shops and workplaces reopen Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? It is the first time many stores will have had customers since the Scottish government lockdown came into effect on 23 March. A queue formed outside Glasgow's Primark store on Argyle Street at about 05:50 even though it was not due to open its doors until 08:00. Lines in the capital ran along Princes Street, with police there to manage the queues BBC Scotland News reporter Graham Stewart said there were about 100 people there. He said: ""The line stretched from the entrance on Argyle Street all the way round the corner into Miller Street and half way up that road. ""Many customers said they were shopping for essentials like underwear and socks - others were just happy to get out the house and back to some normality. ""No-one I have spoken to has health concerns although a small number are wearing masks."" Marks had been placed on the pavements to ensure customers were distanced two metres apart and the shop was letting in customers in batches of around 10 people, leaving the store by a different exit. There were also queues outside Primark in Edinburgh's Princes Street and in Aberdeen's Union Street. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ahead of opening time,Nicola Sturgeon tweeted,externalto remind people to observe the rules. She said: ""If you plan on visiting shops today, please do so responsibly. Maintain physical distancing, follow hygiene advice, wear a face covering and respect staff who may be asking you to shop differently. ""We've made so much progress against the virus - let's not squander it."" Monday's easing of the rules forms part of phase two of the Scottish government's""route map"" out of lockdown,external. Shoppers are being urged to wear face masks in stores Further restrictions are due to be lifted later this week. Indoor shopping centres must remain closed for now, except where they contain essential shops. But outdoor markets are also able to open. Scotland's national clinical director Prof Leitch said he was looking forward to people going to the shops and supporting local businesses but he warned: ""It is not back to normal. ""This is not the Boxing Day sales."" Being forced to close its doors in March had pushed Blair Drummond Safari Park ""towards a financial cliff"" Healthcare premises such as optometry practices are also now able to see patients face-to-face for emergency and essential eye care. Many practices have continued to provide remote support for patients during lockdown and throughout phase one, but will now be able to start seeing patients again in person. Factories, warehouses, laboratories and research facilities are among workplaces that can reopen, provided guidance on social distancing measures are in place. But non-essential offices and call centres have to wait until phase three before they can reopen to staff. Playparks have been closed since the end of March It is now also possible to go to outdoor sports courts and children's playgrounds. Outdoor visitor attractions such as zoos and safari parks, along with gardens can reopen, but for local access only - ""broadly within five miles"" - until a further easing of restrictions expected in early July. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), which owns Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park, along with the owners of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling, had been calling for a reopening date before the end of June. The safari park said the months-long closure had""pushed it towards a financial cliff"". RZSS had warned that missing the start of the summer season could see it lose a total of Â£500,000 in funding for its sites within five weeks - Â£400,000 at Edinburgh Zoo and Â£100,000 for the Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore in the Cairngorms. David Field, RZSS chief executive, said the society was ""thrilled"" to be able to reopen its attractions. He said: ""Safety comes first and it is important everyone follows the government guidance to protect themselves and others. ""At the moment, current guidance asks everyone to stay within their local area and defines this as broadly within five miles. ""We are pleased to hear that from 3 July the travel guidelines may be relaxed to allow people from further afield to visit too."" People can get married outdoors and move house Marriages and civil partnerships are now allowed outdoors, with limited numbers. Registration offices can open for high priority tasks. And restrictions on moving house have also been relaxed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

"China fears a possible second wave China has reinstated a strict lockdown near Beijing, affecting around 400,000 people, after a small surge in cases. The restrictions have come into force in Anxin county in Hebei province near the capital. After the pandemic emerged in China at the end of last year, the country has managed to get new infections to a consistently low level. To avoid a second wave, even small surges are taken very seriously by the country's health authorities. Officials announced on Sunday that Anxin would be ""fully enclosed and controlled"". Only essential workers are allowed to leave their homes, while one member of a household is allowed to go out once a day to shop for necessities. No non-residents residents will be allowed to enter buildings, communities or villages. Authorities have warned anyone violating the rules will be punished by police. Anxin is around 150km (90 miles) south of Beijing. Chinese media say there have been 18 cases in the county since the beginning of the recent surge in Beijing two weeks ago. The area is not nearly as densely populated as China's large urban centres, and local health experts said they were optimistic the spread could be stopped. China's recent numbers remain the envy of most other countries hit by the virus. Yet a recent spike in Beijing has authorities fearing a possible second wave. Over the past 24 hours, Beijing reported 14 new cases of the virus, taking the total since a mid-June outbreak in a food market to 311. While this is a small numbercompared with the thousands of daily cases in the US or South America, China reacted quickly to contain any spread. Several neighbourhoods in Beijing were put under restrictions, travel was limited,and a massive wave of fresh testing was rolled out. Before the recent spike, the Chinese capital had gone 57 days without a locally-transmitted case. This video can not be played Is China being bolder in the wake of the pandemic? In general, China has successfully ""flattened the curve"" in recent months. After passing 80,000 confirmed cases at the start of March,it has added only around 4,700 since then,external. Since mid-June, new infections have been mostly limited to Beijing with some spill over into neighbouring Hebei. The rest of China has seen only a small trickle of single-digit infections, most of which were imported cases, which means travellers returning from abroad.

"Restaurants ""are hurting"" due to the coronavirus pandemic, the boss of food courier Deliveroo has told the BBC. ""Even if restrictions are lifted soon, there's going to be a long period of socially-distanced dining,"" said Will Shu. Deliveroo has expanded its UK customer base, with coronavirus accelerating the adoption of delivery apps, he said. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Shu said that ""Covid-19 really has marked a new era of delivery."" ""Since we started Deliveroo, there's been this incredible adoption towards online and apps. But I think Covid-19 has brought forward this consumer behaviour by about one to three years."" ""On the other hand, our restaurant partners are hurting,"" he said. Although restaurants will be allowed to reopen in England on 4 July with social distancing measures in place, Mr Shu said that he believed that ""there's going to be an increased demand for delivery and collection."" Will Shu co-founded Deliveroo in 2013 Technology firms like Deliveroo ""need to develop better tools for restaurants to operate safely and profitably,"" Mr Shu said. It comes as Deliveroo launches a new feature called ""Table Service"". From 15 July UK users will be able to order food and pay through the Deliveroo app when they have a sit-in meal at participating restaurants, cafes or pubs. The firm says it's aimed at making social distancing easier when eating out. ""This is an important safety feature to give consumers confidence they can return to restaurants safely, and for restaurant staff, who will be able to work while minimising in-person contact,"" Deliveroo said in a statement. The firm has previously spoken out about the problems the hospitality sector faces during the pandemic. In June Deliveroo organised a letter,signed by its partner restaurants including Itsu and Pret A Manger, warning that the sector faces mass job cuts without more help. The action called for included slashing VAT on restaurant food and maintaining the Job Retention Scheme for restaurants while social distancing measures are in place. The government has issued advice for pubs, restaurants and cafes in England set to reopen from 4 July.

"People who were seriously ill in hospital with coronavirus need to be urgently screened for post-traumatic stress disorder, leading doctors say. The Covid Trauma Response Working Group, led by University College London and involving experts from south-east England, said those who had been in intensive care were most at risk. The experts said regular check ups should last at least a year. More than 100,000 people have been treated in hospital for the virus. The experts say tens of thousands of these would have been seriously ill enough to be at risk of PTSD. The working group highlighted research which showed 30% of patients who had suffered severe illnesses in infectious disease outbreaks in the past had gone on to develop PTSD, while depression and anxiety problems were also common. Tracy is just one of many people who has been left with psychological scars from her coronavirus experience. She was admitted to Whittington Hospital in north London in March and spent more than three weeks there - one of which was in intensive care. ""It was like being in hell. I saw people dying, people with the life being sucked from them. The staff all have masks on and all you saw was eyes - it was so lonely and frightening."" Since being discharged in April the 59-year-old has been struggling to sleep because of the thought she will die and she has constantly suffered flashbacks. She is now receiving counselling. ""It has been really difficult. Physically I have been so tired. I'm beginning to recover, but the mental side of it is very hard to deal with. ""I have a good support network of family and friends and I'm a positive person - and I am struggling. I think there will be plenty of people who are in a similar situation, if not worse."" Where are coronavirus cases rising and falling? How long will it take me to recover? UCL psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield, who is on the Covid working group, said those patients who have ended up in hospital will have faced a ""very frightening and invasive"" experience and coupled with the long-term complications they would be at risk of stress-related mental health difficulties. He said the unique nature of the pandemic, which meant patients were isolated from their family while in hospital, could also make the problems worse. ""We need to make sure we support these patients. Services in place are very variable. Failure to do more could have long-term consequences."" A spokesman for NHS England said it was clear the pandemic had ""turned lives upside down"". He said all Covid survivors who stayed in hospital will have a follow up appointment with either their GP or hospital team where their mental health would be assessed. They were also able to refer themselves for psychological support, he added. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"Head teachers have warned that funding for school repairs is long overdue Funding of Â£1bn for 50 major school building projects in England is being promised by the prime minister. There will also be a further Â£560m for repairs to crumbling school buildings. ""It's important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed,"" said Boris Johnson. But head teachers said the National Audit Office had identified a backlog of Â£6.7bn repairs needed across England's 21,000 schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson also addressed whether there would be social distancing when all pupils return to school full time in the autumn. The school with 300 holes in the roof Â£6.7bn needed to tackle school repairs, says spending watchdog Extra Â£7.1bn school funding 'enough to reverse cuts' ""It's not about 1 metre, it's not about 2 metres,"" he told BBC Breakfast, saying that safety was based on ""reducing the number of transmission points"" within schools for Covid-19 infections. This would mean whole classes becoming ""bubbles"" separated from other pupils, he suggested, with a promise to address the more ""complex"" arrangements needed for secondary school, where pupils ""criss-cross"" between different sets and subjects. He also promised there would be ""comprehensive plans in terms of both testing and tracing."" That could mean local closures of schools or sending home individual year groups in response to Covid-19 infections, Mr Williamson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The school rebuilding programme, launched by the prime minister on Monday, will tackle the problems of ageing, dilapidated school buildings and also the need to create extra spaces for rising numbers of secondary age pupils. The 50 school building projects, which will be identified later in the year, will have Â£1bn in funding - the first phase of what is planned as a 10-year programme. The first of the 50 school projects will begin construction in September 2021 - but without any specified time frame for when they might all start or be completed. There will be an extra Â£560m for upgrades and repairs to schools for the next academic year - and Â£200m for improving further education colleges, which was previously announced, will be brought forward. There have been warnings that many school buildings are reaching ""the end of their useful lives"" ""This major new investment will make sure our schools and colleges are fit for the future, with better facilities and brand new buildings,"" said Mr Johnson. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, welcomed a ""significant step in the right direction"" - but said ""far too many children are studying in buildings that are not fit for purpose"". He warned that repairs were ""desperately needed and long overdue"" - and highlighted the concerns raised three years ago by the public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, - saying that the problems would have ""worsened"" since then. In a report from 2017, the NAO warned of deteriorating school buildings - and said it would cost Â£6.7bn to bring buildings to a ""satisfactory"" level and a further Â£7.1bn to bring them up to a ""good condition"". It reported that many school buildings were ""near the end of their useful lives"" - and that major defects were likely to increase. Following that 2017 NAO warning, the government announcedÂ£2.4bn for school repairs and extra places. Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers backed the extra funding after a ""decade of underinvestment"" and warned that school funding must ""never be allowed to fall into such a perilous state again"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Conservatives' ""record on building and investment has been a lost decade"". The party said all regions of England had seen a fall in the amount of education investment per person since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Layla Moran, Lib Dem education spokeswoman, said the promises were ""spin over substance"" and that schools needed ""urgent investment"" rather than ""vague numbers pulled out of thin air"". The Department for Education says the funding for improving buildings is part of a wider investment in schools - including Â£650m for catch-up funding after the coronavirus and Â£350m for a tutoring service. There has also been a commitment to increase school spending by Â£7.1bn by 2022-23 - which the Institute for Fiscal Studies says will reverse previous cuts to school budgets.

"Restaurants ""are hurting"" due to the coronavirus pandemic, the boss of food courier Deliveroo has told the BBC. ""Even if restrictions are lifted soon, there's going to be a long period of socially-distanced dining,"" said Will Shu. Deliveroo has expanded its UK customer base, with coronavirus accelerating the adoption of delivery apps, he said. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Shu said that ""Covid-19 really has marked a new era of delivery."" ""Since we started Deliveroo, there's been this incredible adoption towards online and apps. But I think Covid-19 has brought forward this consumer behaviour by about one to three years."" ""On the other hand, our restaurant partners are hurting,"" he said. Although restaurants will be allowed to reopen in England on 4 July with social distancing measures in place, Mr Shu said that he believed that ""there's going to be an increased demand for delivery and collection."" Will Shu co-founded Deliveroo in 2013 Technology firms like Deliveroo ""need to develop better tools for restaurants to operate safely and profitably,"" Mr Shu said. It comes as Deliveroo launches a new feature called ""Table Service"". From 15 July UK users will be able to order food and pay through the Deliveroo app when they have a sit-in meal at participating restaurants, cafes or pubs. The firm says it's aimed at making social distancing easier when eating out. ""This is an important safety feature to give consumers confidence they can return to restaurants safely, and for restaurant staff, who will be able to work while minimising in-person contact,"" Deliveroo said in a statement. The firm has previously spoken out about the problems the hospitality sector faces during the pandemic. In June Deliveroo organised a letter,signed by its partner restaurants including Itsu and Pret A Manger, warning that the sector faces mass job cuts without more help. The action called for included slashing VAT on restaurant food and maintaining the Job Retention Scheme for restaurants while social distancing measures are in place. The government has issued advice for pubs, restaurants and cafes in England set to reopen from 4 July. They have been encouraged to keep a register of customer details to help track and trace the spread of Covid-19 infections. Diners will also be encouraged to book in advance, as well as ordering food and drink direct to their tables through apps.

"Lockdown restrictions in Leicester could be extended for two weeks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson promises 'whack-a-mole' strategy to deal with localised Covid-19 flare-ups. Government promises to rebuild England's schools as part of plans designed to kick-start the economy after coronavirus lockdown. People who were seriously ill in hospital with coronavirus need to be urgently screened for post-traumatic stress disorder, leading doctors say. Updates on Monday 29 June Rob England and Jay Vydelingum Rob EnglandBBC News Thank you for joining us for our live coverage today. We'll be back tomorrow morning at 09:00 with the latest news of the coronavirus pandemic from across England. Until then, stay safe. BBC Sport Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers says his side ""will react accordingly"" if lockdown measures are extended locally. The city's mayor has saidcoronavirus restrictions in Leicester could go on for longerbecause of a surge in cases. The Foxes have three home games left to play this season on 4, 15 and 26 July. ""Nothing has changed in terms of how we have been working thus far in this situation, but I've always said we will react accordingly,"" said Rodgers. ""We have to have agility in this period,"" he added. Amy WoodfieldBBC News The Unite trade union is in favour of targeted lockdowns across Leicester. Regional secretary for the East Midlands, Paresh Patel, said: ""This spike in coronavirus cases across the city is extremely worrying. ""Everyone needs to now play their part in getting this under control as rapidly as possible with localised lockdowns as necessary. ""Everything that can be done must be done to protect the public's health and to avoid layoffs and even more damage to an already badly damaged regional economy."" A couple in Madrid getting married in early June The government has published new guidance on weddings in England, allowing ceremonies of up to 30 people but advising against receptions. From 4 July, wedding and civil partnerships can go ahead but with only 30 people including the couple, staff such as a photographer and witnesses. People should socially distance, singing should not take place and hands must be washed before exchanging rings. Receptions should be small, with only two households able to meet indoors. Newcastle has published a City COVID Control Plan, which is aimed at minimising further outbreaks and
responding quickly if there are positive cases in places like schools or care homes. Newcastleâs
Director of Public Health, Professor Eugene Milne said: âWe
have robust measures to respond quickly to any outbreaks, but the ideal is that
we donât have to use them. Our focus should be to continue preventing the
spread of the virus through good hygiene, hand washing, wearing face coverings
when possible and continuing to stick to social distancing guidelines."" The
plan outlines how Newcastle will ramp up national testing programmes, using localised and mobile testing and ensure residents understand the symptoms, how to get tested and how to isolate. A key element is responding to outbreaks, which will fall into one of four response categories â Green, Amber, Red, Red Plus - with an appropriate level of action and support behind each category. Rob SissonsEast Midlands Today Reporter A video conference call is taking place right now between Leicester mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, Health Secretary Matt Hancock and health officials. They are discussing the way forward and the possible extension of local lockdown restrictions in Leicester. This is uncharted territory. Local lockdowns are part of the government strategy for putting out the fires, if you like, of a rise in local coronavirus cases but with pubs and hairdressers getting ready to reopen next weekend, that's not very far away. It's still not definite whether this extension will go ahead or not but there has been a lot of mixed messages and people have been very confused here in Leicester. Jay VydelingumBBC News Online The prime minister has said âlocal lockdowns and local whack-a-mole strategiesâ will be used to deal with coronavirus outbreaks. He was asked about talk of an extended localised lockdown after rising cases of the virus in a Leicester suburb. Boris Johnson said: ""We are not out of the woods yetâ. This video can not be played Margaret Barton, owner of Cafe Mbriki, says only being able to serve takeaways is hardly worth staying open for Just as the rest of England prepares for the welcome easing of lockdown restrictions at the weekend, people in Leicester are reacting to the news that they may have to carry on as they are. The city's mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has said the government has recommended current restrictions are maintained for another two weeks due to a surge in coronavirus cases. That means pubs, restaurants and hairdressers could have to keep their doors closed for a further fortnight. Amy WoodfieldBBC News An academic fears prolonging the lockdown in Leicester could result in more coronavirus cases on the outskirts of the city. Dr Duncan Robertson, from the School of Business and Economics in Loughborough, said: ""Pubs might not open in Leicester but if you're desperate to go to the pub, what do you do? You just go to 'not-Leicester' just on the boundary. ""Of course that raises the prospect of it potentially spreading even further."" Sean CoughlanBBC News, family and education correspondent Parents in England who do not send their children back to school in September will face fines,says the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. ""Unless there's a good reason for absenceâ¦ we'd be imposing fines on families,"" he said. But head teachers said fining parents was not the ""right approach"" at first. ""There will be many frightened and anxious parents out there,"" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. Head teachers, who decide whether to apply fines, are more likely to want to build up parents' trust in a safe return, said Mr Barton. Neil HeathBBC News Online Soldiers from the Royal Logistics Corps (RLC) have been pictured at a mobile coronavirus testing site at Evington Leisure Centre in Leicester this morning. Neil Hamilton-Brown, from Leicester City Council, said the military have been ""supporting the national effort"". There has been a surge in Covid-19 cases in the city which led to Home Secretary Priti Patel confirming the government was considering a local lockdown. However, Sir Peter Soulsby, the city's mayor, said government advice was ""very different"" to this overnight, but he added the city's pubs and restaurants could stay closed for two more weeks. Soldiers have also been helping the running of a testing centre at Spinney Hill Park. Sandish ShokerBBC News Sir Peter Soulsby said that during a meeting with health secretary Matt Hancock this afternoon he will tell him ""there is no reason to pick on Leicester"". The Leicester mayor said any delay to the relaxation of lockdown in the city would have an impact on the economy and businesses. ""I would hope that he will recognise that it's not a case that has been made for imposing restrictions on Leicester where other places are allowed to begin to get back and up and operating,"" he said. Asked if there was a specific area of Leicester the report had identified as having a higher number of cases, the Labour mayor said: ""It certainly suggests there are some wards in Leicester that have higher rates than others. ""But I've said to them on a number of occasions that actually the wards of Leicester don't tell you very much about the neighbourhoods and communities in Leicester, and I have said to them surely they have the data at street level and neighbourhood level and community level but as yet that's not the way that they've been looking at it or presenting it to us."" The mayor and health secretary are due to meet this afternoon, with Mr Hancock expected to address MPs later today. We've been talking about Leicester being the first city to be kept back in the current lockdown, compared to the rest of the country. But what measures are due to ease across the rest of England from the 4 July? Neil HeathBBC News Online An academic clinician from the University of Leicester says the factors which led to the surge in Covid-19 cases is a ""perfect storm"" for the virus to spread. Dr Manish Pareek, a consultant at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said many of the recent cases were from ""inner-city areas... which have high levels of ethnic diversity, pockets of deprivation but also quite crowded housing with inter-generational and multi-occupancy households"". ""It brings together a number of factors which are almost like a perfect storm for a virus to be spread within,"" he added. In April, Dr Pareekraised concernsover the lack of recorded data on the number of Covid-19 deaths of people from BAME backgrounds. There have been 2,987 positive cases in Leicester since the pandemic began, with 866 of those - 29% - reported in the two weeks to 23 June. MOT testing is set to resume from 1 August for car, motorcycle and van owners in England. The Department for Transport granted drivers a six month exemption in March due to lockdown restrictions. Those with an MOT due date before 1 August will still be exempt, but vehicles must be properly maintained. Roads Minister Baroness Vere said: âGarages across the country are open and I urge drivers who are
due for their MOT to book a test as soon they can.â The government added that some exemptions were still available. Alex SmithBBC News Online Leicester's mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has questioned the effectiveness of a local lockdownamid talksrestrictions may have to stay in place for another two weeks following a surge in Covid-19 cases. On extending the current measures, he says: ""What we still don't have - whether it's lockdown or restrictions - is any explanation as to why on Earth you would do it and why you would do it here in Leicester."" Asked to outline the businesses that would not be able to reopen on Saturday if the recommendations were implemented, Sir Peter said: ""I think it's very unclear as to what difference it would make if they continue the regulations in Leicester and why you would do it. ""How can it possibly make any difference? If the virus is out of control and spreading in Leicester with the restrictions, I can't understand how extending them for a further two weeks would make any difference to that. ""Frankly, we need to have an explanation - but more importantly we need some collaboration with the government so that we don't hear about these proposals either through announcements briefed to the media over the weekend or emails that come in at one o'clock in the morning."" Andrew SegalBBC South West With just five days to go before large numbers of holidaymakers could arrive in Cornwall and Devon, the counties' police commissioner is urging people to behave responsibly. Alison Hernandez said she was concerned people would begin to relax their lockdown well before the official date of 4 July. But she added that officers would not be enforcing social distancing - people must do that themselves and officers had to get back to dealing with everyday crime. Policing cannot enforce social distancing. The reality is now, especially as we move into everything unlocking next weekend, we're back into normal policing. Officers are out and about dealing with ordinary crimes that are happening every day in our patch. We may be the second lowest crime area in the country, but we still have those crimes to deal with."" Alison Hernandez, Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Rob EnglandBBC News The main story we've seen develop so far today has been the discussions around the current national lockdown being extended in Leicester. If you're just joining us, here are some key points: You can follow the latest coronavirus news from across England here until 17:00. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent We should get used to these local flare-ups - they are going to become a way of life over the coming months. Given the amount of virus still around - there are still around 1,000 positive tests every day across the UK on average - there will be clusters developing as people return to something near normal life. What's important is that they are brought under control quickly and don't spread. The fact a local outbreak has been identified in one part of Leicester suggests the system is working to some extent - although it's fair to ask whether it could have been spotted more quickly given cases have been growing for a number of weeks. Shoppers in Leicester queue outside Primark With extra testing facilities parachuted in, officials will be desperately trying to get a clear idea of just how far it has spread so delaying the further easing of restrictions is the logical step. If more cases keep emerging, a local lockdown will be on the cards. Should it be like this? Some argue we should have suppressed the virus further before easing - essentially going for elimination like New Zealand. But for a country like the UK where the virus had spread further before lockdown and with its size of population and packed cities that is somewhat harder. BBC Breakfast A virologist, also well-known as one of theNaked Scientistsbroadcasters, said history could tell us a lot about how to deal with unexpected Covid-19 hotspots
like the one in Leicester where anew lockdown is being considered. Dr Chris Smith, ofCambridge University,externaland a frequent broadcaster in the region, said: ""We can fall back on history because we have got a track record of having dealt with dread diseases all over the world in years gone by. ""Under certain circumstances lockdowns are necessary, but under other circumstances you do things like - when we were dealing with Ebola - a cordon sanitaire. ""What you do is you go in and act decisively in one particular area. You find out where the cases are. ""You isolate the cases and you break the train of transmission,"" Dr Smith added that lockdown was one end of the spectrum, but information-gathering was the most important thing. ""That would help to find out where the cases are, what caused the outbreak, who is giving it to whom, who is most at risk and then where to focus attention,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"With the coronavirus pandemic reachinga global total of 10m cases,external, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of a dangerous new phase in the crisis. While many countries in western Europe and Asia have the virus under some degree of control, other regions of the world are now seeing the disease spread at an accelerating rate. It took three months for the first one million people to become infected, but just eight days to clock up the most recent million. And because these numbers only reflect who has tested positive, they're likely to be ""the tip of the iceberg"", according to one senior Latin American official. The graphs are moving in completely the wrong direction in parts of the Americas, south Asia and Africa. The US, already recording the most infections and most deaths from Covid-19 anywhere in the world, is seeing further startling increases. The number of positive tests recorded in the past few days has reached a daily record total of 40,000, and it's still climbing, fuelled by an explosion of clusters in Arizona, Texas and Florida. This is not a ""second wave"" of infections.Instead, it's a resurgence of the disease, often in states which decided to relax their lockdown restrictions, arguably too early. Brazil,the second country after the US to pass 1m cases, is also experiencing dangerous rises. Its biggest cities, SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, are the hardest hit but many other areas of the country are doing little testing, and the real numbers are bound to be far higher. Something similar is happening in India. It recently recorded its greatest number of new cases on a single day - 15,000. But because there's relatively little testing in some of the most heavily populated states, the true scale of the crisis is inevitably larger. Why is this happening? Deprived and crowded communities in developing countries are vulnerable. Coronavirus has become ""a disease of poor people"", according to David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy for Covid-19. When whole families are crammed into single-room homes, social distancing is impossible, and without running water, regular hand-washing isn't easy. Where people have to earn a living day-by-day to survive, interactions on streets and in markets are unavoidable. For indigenous groups in the Amazon rainforest and other remote areas, healthcare can be limited or even non-existent. GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the coronavirus pandemic EUROPE:How are lockdowns being lifted? SYMPTOMS:What are the symptoms of the coronavirus? TRACKER:Coronavirus cases in Africa UNITED STATES:How the Najavo Nation is battling America's worst outbreak And the rate of infection itself is often worryingly high: of everyone tested in Mexico, just over half are turning out to be positive. That's a far higher proportion than was found in hotspots like New York City or northern Italy even at their worst moments. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline medical staff are far more severe where budgets are small. In Ecuador, where at one stage bodies were being dumped in the streets because the authorities could not cope, a key laboratory ran out of the chemicals needed to test for coronavirus. And where economies are already weak, imposing a lockdown to curb the virus potentially carries far greater risks than in a developed nation. Dr Nabarro says there is a still a chance to slow the spread of infections but only with urgent international support. ""I don't like giving a depressing message,"" he says, ""but I am worried about supplies and finance getting through to those who need them."" But these are not the only things driving the rise. Many politicians have chosen for their own reasons not to follow the advice of their health experts. The president of Tanzania took the bold step of declaring that his country had largely defeated the virus. Since early May he has blocked the release of proper data about it, though the signs are that Covid-19 is still very much a threat. In the US, President Trump has either played down the disease or blamed China and the WHO for it, and urged a rapid re-opening of the American economy. He praised the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, for being among the first to bring his state out of lockdown, a move now being reversed as cases rise. Even the wearing of masks in public, which has been an official US government recommendation since early April, has become a symbol of political division. Mr Abbott has refused to allow Texan mayors to insist on them so that, as he put it, ""individual liberty is not infringed"". By contrast the governor of California, a Democrat, says the ""science shows that face coverings and masks work"". Mr Trump, meanwhile, has refused to wear one. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has been caught up in the same kind of argument. Having dismissed the coronavirus as ""a little cold"", he's repeatedly tried to stop officials from doing anything that might disrupt the economy. And after regularly appearing in public without a mask, he's now been ordered by a court to wear one. It's attitudes like this that prompted the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to warn that the greatest threat is not the virus itself but ""the lack of global solidarity and global leadership"". As a remote set of islands in the Pacific, New Zealand is able to isolate easily, and the government of Jacinda Ardern has been widely praised for an aggressive response which recently led to a 24-day period with no new cases. That came to an end as citizens started to return from abroad, some of them infected, and further measures have been needed to monitor people on arrival. But rather than this being a blow to New Zealand's hopes of becoming Covid-free, many experts see it as evidence of a surveillance system that generally works effectively. Similarly, South Korea is lauded for using technology and contact tracing to drive down infections to extremely low numbers and had three days in a row with no new cases. Its officials now say they are seeing a second wave, with clusters centred on nightclubs in the capital Seoul, though the numbers are relatively small. The mayor of Seoul has warned that if cases go above 30 for three days, social distancing measures will be re-imposed. By contrast, the UK has roughly 1,000 new cases a day. Proudest of all is Vietnam, which claims to have had no deaths from Covid-19 at all. A rapid lockdown and strict border controls combined to keep the numbers of infections low. What's next? A big unknown is what happens in most of the countries of Africa, which in many cases have not seen the scale of disease than some feared. One view is that a lack of infrastructure for mass testing is obscuring the true spread of the virus. Another is that with relatively young populations, the numbers becoming afflicted are likely to be lower. A third perspective is that communities with fewer connections to the outside world will be among the last to be touched by the pandemic. In countries that have most successfully controlled the virus, the challenge is remaining vigilant while trying to allow some normality to resume. But the reality for many of the rest is Dr Nabarro's grim forecast of ""continued increases in the numbers of people with coronavirus and the associated suffering"". Which is why he and many others are hoping that developing countries will get the help they need, before the crisis escalates any further.

"When Mohammed Azeem arrived in Bradford Royal Infirmary he was in critical state, with far too little oxygen in his blood - at one point his oxygen levels were ""not compatible with life"" according to the intensive care specialist treating him. But incredibly he survived, writes Dr John Wright. Mohammed's story is a miraculous one. This 35-year-old taxi driver loved working out and lifting weights and never thought he would be at risk from the brutal effects of Covid-19. Once his breathing problems began, he was reluctant to call the NHS for help, because of themyth then circulatingin parts of the Asian community that people admitted to hospital were never discharged alive. It was his friend, Haleem, who insisted on calling an ambulance and even helped to carry him into it, as by this stage he was unable to walk. When Mohammed arrived in A&E it was clear that his life was in immediate danger. This was a young man who was dying in front of us and he was whisked straight to the Intensive Care Unit. It was touch and go from his first day and his perilous journey was only just beginning. He ended up in a coma in ICU for 48 days, and in hospital for 68. The doctor treating him throughout was ICU consultant Dr Michael McCooe, who describes him as the sickest young man he has ever seen. A healthy person has blood oxygen saturation levels of 95% or higher - in other words their red blood cells are carrying almost as much oxygen as possible (100%). Mohammed's saturation levels were 60% to 70%, and that was after ventilation with undiluted oxygen. Even when he was intubated in ICU it was a struggle to keep his oxygen levels above 80%, the point below which there is a risk of damage to organs such as the heart and brain. Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Listen to the next episode of The NHS Front Lineon BBC Soundsorthe BBC World Service Or read the previous online diary entry:'People think it's over but it's not' Check out all the diary entries on the BBC Radio 4 website In fact, over the coming weeks Mohammed kept drifting away from his precious life. Several times his oxygen saturation dropped to a level that Dr McCooe describes as ""incompatible with life"". The ICU team had numerous heart-breaking conversations with his family, preparing them for the worst, but Mohammed had other ideas. Deep within his comatose body there was an ember of vitality that kept glowing. Each time it looked as though it was about to extinguished it flickered back into flame. ""We had a number of conversations with his family, almost daily conversations, where we were talking about the futility of what we were doing,"" says Michael McCooe. ""We weren't saying we were giving up on him, but we just wanted them to know that we didn't hold up any hope that he was going to survive. And then to our utter shock and amazement - and it was a real moment of hope for lots of people who looked after him, and for people who looked after Covid patients in general - he just started to turn around. ""His blood gases got better, his oxygen requirements reduced and we were able to permanently keep him on his back. ""We then had the concern about what he'd be like when we woke him because he'd had such low oxygen levels and the brain is susceptible to that. But when we woke him he was neurologically fine. He was OK - his strength was surprisingly good for what he'd been through. Remarkably, he was able to engage with physio pretty quickly and from that point he just raced to recovery."" So when we cheered him off the ward after 10 gruelling weeks there was great celebration and joy. As clinicians we are caring but rational scientists, so when small miracles happen it is hard not to be amazed. Covid-19 has shown each of us great pain and suffering, but also instances of remarkable resilience. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Like another Covid patient I have written about, Mohammed Hussain - whoimagined that he was caught up in a terrorist incidentwhile being treated in intensive care - Mohammed Azeem had troubling dreams while sedated, and thought he had been shot three times with a Glock pistol. When he came round, medical staff had to give him the tragic news that his mother, who had been brought into intensive care three days after him, had died. ""I was pinching myself thinking it was a nightmare,"" Mohammed says. ""I rang my dad straight away and my dad told me that it was true, my mum had died. I thought this recovery will be 10 times harder now. I've lost everything."" At that point he hadn't seen his wife and three children for seven weeks, so despite grieving for his mother he had that joyful reunion to look forward to. And also the reunion with his friend, Haleem, a shopkeeper, whom he credits with saving his life, along with the staff in ICU. Haleem in white (second left), Mohammed in the hoodie (second right) with friends in Haleem's family's shop The two men are close - their grandfathers shared a house when they first arrived in Bradford from Pakistan, and they have known each other all their lives - so Mohammed's ordeal in hospital was an emotional ride for Haleem too, until he finally saw him on WhatsApp, not long before he was discharged. ""For such a big stocky man who is so strong - we call him The Beast because he's that strong - we couldn't believe how ill he was. It just broke my heart,"" Haleem says, recalling the day his friend was taken away in the ambulance. ""That evening we got a call at 10pm to say he had an hour to live, and we were just praying for him, everyone came on to the street. ""Every other week they were saying they were taking him off the machine, that he wouldn't survive this. But he is so strongâ¦ his body has used every bit of strength to keep him alive."" Ramadan was difficult under lockdown, Haleem says, and Eid was very difficult. ""Today seems like a green light to life resuming."" Follow@docjohnwright,externaland radio producer@SueM1tchell,externalon Twitter Many Covid-19 patients continue to need care at home, once they leave hospital. The story of Mary Blessington illustrates how the path to recovery can involve U-turns.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock first mentioned an ""outbreak"" in Leicester on 18 June Pubs and restaurants in Leicester may stay closed for two more weeks due to a surge in coronavirus cases, the city's mayor has said. Sir Peter Soulsby said the government had recommended current restrictions are maintained for a further fortnight. He told the Today programme the city could ""remain restricted for two weeks longer than the rest of the country"". The prime minister said Public Health England and local authorities had the power to bring in a local lockdown. There have been 2,987 positive cases in Leicester since the pandemic began, with 866 of those - 29% - reported in the two weeks to 23 June. Businesses left 'in limbo' by proposed extension Coronavirus restrictions across Englandare due to be eased from 4 July, with pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and hotels allowed to reopen. But Sir Peter said he had received an email from the government overnight and ""it seems they're suggesting we continue the present level of restriction for a further two weeks beyond 4 July"". Sir Peter Soulsby has expressed scepticism about extending restrictions Sir Peter criticised the analysis as ""superficial"" and said he did not know whether the government had the power to impose an extension if council officials concluded it was not necessary. ""I think it's very unclear as to what difference it would make if they continue the regulations in Leicester and why you would do it,"" he said. ""Frankly, if the virus is out of control and spreading in Leicester with the restrictions, I can't understand how extending them for a further two weeks would make any difference to that."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are concerned about Leicester"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to make a statement on whether coronavirus restrictions will be extended in the city at 21:15 BST. The prime minister's official spokesman said Public Health England (PHE) and councils had the power to impose a local lockdown by temporarily closing public spaces, businesses and venues. He said local health authorities could also halt admissions to hospitals. Boris Johnson said a local ""whack-a-mole"" strategy used to deal with outbreaks in Weston-super-Mare and around GP surgeries in London would be ""brought to bear in Leicester as well"". ""We are concerned about Leicester, we are concerned about any local outbreak. I want to stress to people that we are not out of the woods yet,"" he added. We should get used to these local flare-ups - they are going to become a way of life over the coming months. The virus, while at low levels, is still here. There are around 1,000 positive tests every day across the UK on average - and then there are the unknown number of silent spreaders, those who do not show symptoms and hence do not get tested. What's important is that these clusters are brought under control quickly and don't spread. The fact a local outbreak has been identified in one part of Leicester suggests the system is working to some extent - although it's fair to ask whether it could have been spotted more quickly given cases have been growing for a number of weeks. With extra testing facilities parachuted in officials will be desperately trying to get a clear idea of just how far it has spread so delaying the further easing of restrictions is the logical step. If more cases keep emerging a local lockdown will be on the cards. Should it be like this? Some argue we should have suppressed the virus further before easing - essentially going for elimination like New Zealand. But for a country like the UK where the virus had spread further before lockdown and with its size of population and packed cities that is somewhat harder. Sohail Ali (right) said further uncertainty was unwelcome Business owners in the city who had been preparing to reopen on 4 July saidthey were dismayed at the prospect of having to wait a further two weeks. Restaurant owner Sohail Ali said the uncertainty had made him ""very nervous"". ""Everyone has got bills to pay, mouths to feed, so we need to make sure that we can get our businesses back open,"" he said. Blake Edwards, owner of the Flappers and Gentlemen salon, said continuing restrictions would be ""heartbreaking"". Lyndsey Portas said she could not believe Leicester was worse than any other big cities Lyndsey Portas, who owns a fruit and veg stall at the city market, said she ""can't believe"" Leicester is ""worse than more heavily populated cities"". ""It would have been nice to have felt it was a bit back to normal, but if it's spreading through the community, it does need to be stopped,"" she said. How can family and friends visit my home safely? What could local lockdowns look like?,external How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Jo Collins, who works in a city centre pub, wants to get back to work to provide for her children. The 30-year-old said: ""I've got kids and I was off sick before this started for three months so I couldn't get furlough, so I've been on universal credit instead. ""It's unfair on Leicester and I'd be gutted if this carries on. We can definitely open safely."" Pub worker Jo Collins wants to return to work after spending three months on universal credit Ivan Browne, Leicester's director of public health, said local cases were ""very much around the younger working-age population and predominately towards the east part of our city"" and ""likely [due to] a combination of factors"". Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe previously called for local lockdown due to a ""perfect storm"" of poverty, positive tests and higher ethnic diversity. About 28% of Leicester's population is of Indian heritage, and a further 21% are from black or Asian backgrounds. By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit The figure for confirmed cases in Leicester is almost three times thatpublished by the government,external. This is because the government's published data for local cases only cover tests carried out in hospitals and for health workers - known as Pillar 1. Tests outside of hospitals, known as Pillar 2, are not broken down by local authority but PHE has started publishing a weekly round-up by region. In the week of 18 to 24 June the East Midlands went from 18,516 confirmed cases to 19,861, equivalent to 28 new confirmed cases for every 100,000 people. PHE does not provide figures down to a local authority area, but a map in its report showed Barnsley, Bradford and Rochdale all recorded at least 45 new cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 21 June. In its weekly report PHE said case detections were highest in the north of England and there had been increases outside of hospital testing in Yorkshire and the Humber over the previous two weeks. ""At a local authority level, activity was highest in parts of West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and in Leicester,"" it added. Dr Manish Pareek, a consultant at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said recent cases of Covid-19 he had seen were from ""inner-city areas which have high levels of ethnic diversity, pockets of deprivation but also quite crowded housing with inter-generational and multi-occupancy households"". These factors ""are almost like a perfect storm for a virus to be spread within,"" he added. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working with PHE, the city council and local partners ""to help prevent further transmission of the virus"".

But Sir Peter said he had received an email from the government overnight and ""it seems they're suggesting we continue the present level of restriction for a further two weeks beyond 4 July"". Sir Peter Soulsby has expressed scepticism about extending restrictions Sir Peter criticised the analysis as ""superficial"" and said he did not know whether the government had the power to impose an extension if council officials concluded it was not necessary. ""I think it's very unclear as to what difference it would make if they continue the regulations in Leicester and why you would do it,"" he said. ""Frankly, if the virus is out of control and spreading in Leicester with the restrictions, I can't understand how extending them for a further two weeks would make any difference to that."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are concerned about Leicester"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to make a statement on whether coronavirus restrictions will be extended in the city at 21:15 BST. The prime minister's official spokesman said Public Health England (PHE) and councils had the power to impose a local lockdown by temporarily closing public spaces, businesses and venues. He said local health authorities could also halt admissions to hospitals. Boris Johnson said a local ""whack-a-mole"" strategy used to deal with outbreaks in Weston-super-Mare and around GP surgeries in London would be ""brought to bear in Leicester as well"". ""We are concerned about Leicester, we are concerned about any local outbreak. I want to stress to people that we are not out of the woods yet,"" he added. We should get used to these local flare-ups - they are going to become a way of life over the coming months. The virus, while at low levels, is still here. There are around 1,000 positive tests every day across the UK on average - and then there are the unknown number of silent spreaders, those who do not show symptoms and hence do not get tested. What's important is that these clusters are brought under control quickly and don't spread. The fact a local outbreak has been identified in one part of Leicester suggests the system is working to some extent - although it's fair to ask whether it could have been spotted more quickly given cases have been growing for a number of weeks. With extra testing facilities parachuted in officials will be desperately trying to get a clear idea of just how far it has spread so delaying the further easing of restrictions is the logical step. If more cases keep emerging a local lockdown will be on the cards. Should it be like this? Some argue we should have suppressed the virus further before easing - essentially going for elimination like New Zealand. But for a country like the UK where the virus had spread further before lockdown and with its size of population and packed cities that is somewhat harder. Sohail Ali (right) said further uncertainty was unwelcome Business owners in the city who had been preparing to reopen on 4 July saidthey were dismayed at the prospect of having to wait a further two weeks. Restaurant owner Sohail Ali said the uncertainty had made him ""very nervous"". ""Everyone has got bills to pay, mouths to feed, so we need to make sure that we can get our businesses back open,"" he said. Blake Edwards, owner of the Flappers and Gentlemen salon, said continuing restrictions would be ""heartbreaking"". Lyndsey Portas said she could not believe Leicester was worse than any other big cities Lyndsey Portas, who owns a fruit and veg stall at the city market, said she ""can't believe"" Leicester is ""worse than more heavily populated cities"". ""It would have been nice to have felt it was a bit back to normal, but if it's spreading through the community, it does need to be stopped,"" she said. How can family and friends visit my home safely? What could local lockdowns look like?,external How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Jo Collins, who works in a city centre pub, wants to get back to work to provide for her children. The 30-year-old said: ""I've got kids and I was off sick before this started for three months so I couldn't get furlough, so I've been on universal credit instead. ""It's unfair on Leicester and I'd be gutted if this carries on. We can definitely open safely."" Pub worker Jo Collins wants to return to work after spending three months on universal credit Ivan Browne, Leicester's director of public health, said local cases were ""very much around the younger working-age population and predominately towards the east part of our city"" and ""likely [due to] a combination of factors"". Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe previously called for local lockdown due to a ""perfect storm"" of poverty, positive tests and higher ethnic diversity. About 28% of Leicester's population is of Indian heritage, and a further 21% are from black or Asian backgrounds. By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit The figure for confirmed cases in Leicester is almost three times thatpublished by the government,external. This is because the government's published data for local cases only cover tests carried out in hospitals and for health workers - known as Pillar 1. Tests outside of hospitals, known as Pillar 2, are not broken down by local authority but PHE has started publishing a weekly round-up by region. In the week of 18 to 24 June the East Midlands went from 18,516 confirmed cases to 19,861, equivalent to 28 new confirmed cases for every 100,000 people. PHE does not provide figures down to a local authority area, but a map in its report showed Barnsley, Bradford and Rochdale all recorded at least 45 new cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 21 June. In its weekly report PHE said case detections were highest in the north of England and there had been increases outside of hospital testing in Yorkshire and the Humber over the previous two weeks. ""At a local authority level, activity was highest in parts of West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and in Leicester,"" it added. Dr Manish Pareek, a consultant at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said recent cases of Covid-19 he had seen were from ""inner-city areas which have high levels of ethnic diversity, pockets of deprivation but also quite crowded housing with inter-generational and multi-occupancy households"". These factors ""are almost like a perfect storm for a virus to be spread within,"" he added. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working with PHE, the city council and local partners ""to help prevent further transmission of the virus"". Four mobile testing sites and thousands of home testing kits have been sent to Leicester, a spokesperson added.

"China fears a possible second wave China has reinstated a strict lockdown near Beijing, affecting around 400,000 people, after a small surge in cases. The restrictions have come into force in Anxin county in Hebei province near the capital. After the pandemic emerged in China at the end of last year, the country has managed to get new infections to a consistently low level. To avoid a second wave, even small surges are taken very seriously by the country's health authorities. Officials announced on Sunday that Anxin would be ""fully enclosed and controlled"". Only essential workers are allowed to leave their homes, while one member of a household is allowed to go out once a day to shop for necessities. No non-residents residents will be allowed to enter buildings, communities or villages. Authorities have warned anyone violating the rules will be punished by police. Anxin is around 150km (90 miles) south of Beijing. Chinese media say there have been 18 cases in the county since the beginning of the recent surge in Beijing two weeks ago. The area is not nearly as densely populated as China's large urban centres, and local health experts said they were optimistic the spread could be stopped. China's recent numbers remain the envy of most other countries hit by the virus. Yet a recent spike in Beijing has authorities fearing a possible second wave. Over the past 24 hours, Beijing reported 14 new cases of the virus, taking the total since a mid-June outbreak in a food market to 311. While this is a small numbercompared with the thousands of daily cases in the US or South America, China reacted quickly to contain any spread. Several neighbourhoods in Beijing were put under restrictions, travel was limited,and a massive wave of fresh testing was rolled out. Before the recent spike, the Chinese capital had gone 57 days without a locally-transmitted case. This video can not be played Is China being bolder in the wake of the pandemic? In general, China has successfully ""flattened the curve"" in recent months. After passing 80,000 confirmed cases at the start of March,it has added only around 4,700 since then,external. Since mid-June, new infections have been mostly limited to Beijing with some spill over into neighbouring Hebei. The rest of China has seen only a small trickle of single-digit infections, most of which were imported cases, which means travellers returning from abroad.

"Leicester's rise in cases has drawn attention in the highest circles of government The city of Leicester may be facing a localised lockdown after a rise in coronavirus cases, Home Secretary Priti Patel has confirmed. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, she said it was ""correct"" that the government was considering the move, reported in the Sunday Times. Figures on June 16 showed about 25% of the city's 2,494 cases so far were reported in the previous two weeks. Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said there was ""no immediate prospect"" of a lockdown. Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said more analysis of data was needed Speaking on BBC Breakfast before Ms Patel was interviewed, he said data from testing was still being analysed and ""hopefully early next week we will know whether we have a problem and if we have, where it is"". Asked about restrictions, he said: ""I don't think that is an immediate prospect."" Coronavirus: What could local lockdowns look like in England? Sir Peter said he had been in constant contact with the chief medical officer, and said it would have been ""far better"" if the level of testing in the city had been greater. He said: ""It's only really if we know whether there is an issue, and where it might be, we can decide what, if anything, we need to do."" Ms Patel said she had spoken to Health Secretary Matt Hancock about a possible local lockdown, and said ""extra support"" would be going into the area. ""With local flare-ups, it is right we have a local solution,"" she said. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""It is right we have a local solution"" Leicester South MP and shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the BBC's The World This Weekend he felt there was ""no suggestion"" a lockdown was about to happen. ""I received a briefing from the health secretary yesterday and yes, we have a spike in infections in Leicester and yes, we have to respond to that with extra testing capacity and extra support for the local authority,"" he said. ""But nobody is proposing a local lockdown in the way in which it appears to have been presented in some of the media today and me and Matt Hancock were at one with that."" Leicester City Council's public health director said on 16 June the new cases - 658 - were ""relatively small"" but of concern. Local health experts confirmed they were involved in planning the next steps in tackling the virus, with attention focussed on the North Evington area. The Department of Health said four mobile testing sites and thousands of home testing kits had already been sent to Leicester. Public Health England said it was ""concerned"" by the increase in cases in the city and urged residents to follow advice on hygiene, social distancing and testing. It also said any tightening of restrictions locally, while such measures were eased elsewhere, would be ""difficult"" for the city. Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe has called for a lockdown Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe has called for a lockdown due to a ""perfect storm"" of poverty, positive tests and higher ethnic diversity. She said: ""I don't know why they're not enforcing a lockdown - the evidence suggests there should be one."" Tony Roe, BBC East Midlands political correspondent Just over a week ago, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed what he called an ""outbreak"" of Covid-19 In Leicester. In the first fortnight of June, 658 people had tested positive. With 2,500 cases in the city since March it's certainly a worrying statistical spike. North Evington was identified as an area of the city with a surge in cases - it's a community of tightly-packed terraces, mixed in with old industrial buildings and places of worship for many faiths. It's a good representation of Leicester as a multicultural city. A mobile centre has been set up this week in Spinney Hill Park so people can now walk to get a test. But the council says it needs the data from positive tests quickly if it is to react. It says it didn't get the data from the first fortnight of June until Thursday, so only this weekend has been able to plot where the Covid-19 cases are. The data also doesn't give an ethnicity breakdown, which mayor Sir Peter Soulsby says would be vital in helping understand which parts of the community are being affected by the virus - he's asked the health secretary for this data. Leicester has seen a number of Covid-19 cases in recent days. Several schools have been affected. Herrick Primary in Rushey Mead; Moat Community College in Highfields; Whitehall Primary in Rowlatts Hill; and Humberstone Junior and Humberstone Infant academies have all closed for a number of days. Business has been hit too, with three people testing positive at Sainsbury's supermarket in Melton Road, food manufacturer Samworth Brothers confirming a ""handful"" of cases at its Beaumont Leys sites and an unconfirmed number at the Pladis factory in South Wigston. By BBC Reality Check A spike in coronavirus cases has led to fears Leicester could face a local lockdown. However, it is not sure exactly what that would look like. Currently, councils do not feel like they have the powers to effectively shut off a city in the way you might expect. Rather, places where an outbreak has occurred - such as meat-processing plants - could temporarily shut and workers asked to be tested and self-isolate. Increased testing in an area would also likely play a part. This morning, the Mayor of Leicester Pete Soulsby said they were looking at neighbourhood-level data to assess what ""extra support"" might be needed in those areas.

"An ambulance outside Royal Glamorgan A&E - which opened in 1999 Campaigners had a ""powerful role"" in persuading health bosses to keep open a 24-hour accident and emergency unit at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, says a senior health official. There were plans to either close the A&E at night or completely, replacing it with a minor injuries unit. Serious staff shortages have been tackled and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health boardhas backed saving it. Medical director Dr Nick Lyons said community concerns had a big influence. ""It was a humbling and an incredible journey with a local community, not always an easy one -  it was quite a bumpy ride at times,"" he said. ""For me, perhaps the most powerful were some of the illustrations that individual parents, patients and carers gave us, and driving the mountain road, driving around the community, trying to put ourselves in their shoes, thinking how would this would work."" A GP by background, Dr Lyons said it was ""incredibly emotional"" to listen to people's stories and come up with a recommendation which responded to them. Modelling showed replacing the Royal Glamorgan's A&E - which sees an average of 5,300 patients a month - with a minor injuries unit would have put ""huge pressures"" on the region's other A&Es at Prince Charles in Merthyr Tydfil and Princess of Wales in Bridgend. Those hospitals, he says, would have ""struggled to cope"" had the unit closed Staff recruitment - the Royal Glamorgan was still in trouble without what has been called an ""imaginative and aggressive"" recruitment campaign. A full-time consultant had left but now there is the equivalent of 2.4 in post, while more doctors have also been hired full time from the locum pool The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated how important the department was in meeting local needs and how the NHS could quickly develop new ways of working and overcome challenges The A&E unit near Llantrisant was so reliant on single-shift locum doctors late last year that it had to close twice at short notice over the Christmas period due to a lack of cover. Ambulances had to be re-directed to the region's other hospitals. Dr Lyons insists the department is now in a much more stable position, with staffing numbers up to a more typical number and no more ""Friday afternoon panic"" that they wouldn't have enough cover for the weekend. Coronavirus: Royal Glamorgan Hospital staff on life on front line Patient safety at Royal Glamorgan A&E 'precarious' A&E set-up 'increasingly unsustainable' Medical staff at the hospital also say they now recognise familiar faces on shift and management say this continuity is a big contributor to patient safety. The complexities around coronavirus and the need for social distancing also means that keeping three A&E units up and running was a factor. But the response too of staff showed what was possible. ""We've seen teams work in ways that in my 30-odd years in the NHS I've never seen,"" said Dr Lyons. ""The agility and the imagination and the 'can do' ability and seeing the team support the A&E and work together for our patients has been has been again humbling."" A protest in February before a health board meeting Campaigners organised several protests to argue their case that lives would be put at risk if the department was downgraded. They were worried about poor transport links between some valleys communities and that other hospitals had been prioritised for investment instead of Royal Glamorgan. When one health official admitted to Senedd members that no ""substantive effort"" was made to recruit A&E consultants for five years, they reacted angrily. Last Thursday, campaigners handed over a 25,000 name petition at the health board's offices in Abercynonin advance of Monday's meeting, when a final decision was made to keep A&E in its current form.,external Len Arthur, chairman of the action group, said it was almost ""beyond belief"" that people power had won but he gave credit for the way thinking had shifted and their arguments had been listened to and now adopted. ""The A&E department has taken a larger role in people's lives over the last 10 years and that's why there's been huge community support,"" he added. Sarah Davies, of the Unison union's Cwm Taf branch, said it had ""campaigned vigorously"" to show the harm and risk of reducing services as well as the negative effect it would have on  Prince Charles and Princess of Wales hospitals. Sara has recently retired as a table tennis player Sara Head, from Beddau, near Pontypridd is a recently retired Paralympian table tennis player. The 40-year-old competed at London 2012, winning a team bronze, and represented Wales at two Commonwealth Games. ""It's incredibly important to me - I've had some really severe infections and staff have got me well, and it was due to them I got to the Rio Paralympics,"" she said. ""I was close to having sepsis and at times I was in hospital for six weeks. It was the quick treatment. I feel I'm pretty fit but I'd struggle to reach Merthyr if I couldn't drive. ""They've listened - we hope they'll continue to have that communication with the community because together it can be an amazing place."" Sara went to various meetings to raise concerns In 2014, five south Wales health boards looked to address concerns that maternity care, baby care, children's hospital care and emergency medicine were spread too thinly across too many hospitals. After a public consultation, health boards and community health councils finally agreed on a series of recommendations. These included closing A&E at the Royal Glamorgan, but in the intervening period there was little change. In the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area, consultant-led maternity care has now been centralised at Prince Charles Hospital. But changes to children's hospital care have been repeatedly postponed. The health board says ""further work"" will still be needed to develop appropriate models of care and ""mitigate the risks"" of ongoing doctor shortages. It is focusing on a pool of 80 emergency medicine trainees in Wales for further consultant recruitment and aims to bring in five junior clinical fellows by August.

"This video can not be played The wounded were taken to hospital after gunmen stormed the stock exchange Four gunmen attacked the Pakistani stock exchange in Karachi, killing two guards and a policeman and wounding seven others before being shot dead. The assailants launched a grenade attack at the main gate to the building and opened fire but police say they failed to make it to the trading floor. Staff took refuge in locked rooms and many were evacuated as security forces put an end to the assault. Militants from the Baloch Liberation Army say they were behind the attack. Ethnic Baloch groups have fought a long-running insurgency for a separate homeland and a greater share of resources in Pakistan's Balochistan province. The gunmen stormed a security post at the gate and fought their way into the car park The director-general of the paramilitary Sindh Rangers force, Omer Ahmed Bukhari, said all the attackers had been killed within eight minutes. ""They had come to carry out an attack inside the building and take hostages inside,"" he told a news conference. He said the gunmen had brought supplies of food as well as weaponry, suggesting they were prepared for a siege. Pakistan has suffered years of militant violence, mostly by Islamist groups, but attacks such as this one have become rare in recent years. Monday's attack began when the militants armed with automatic rifles threw a grenade and then began firing at a security post outside the stock exchange. ""The attackers came in a silver Corolla and were stopped by police at the gate outside where the exchange of fire took place,"" Sindh police additional inspector general Ghulam Nabi Memon told BBC Urdu. The covered body of one of the suspected gunmen is removed from the site of the attack Guards fought back, killing all four heavily armed attackers, the authorities say. Three police officials are among the seven wounded receiving treatment in hospital. Mr Memon said the attackers did not manage to enter the main building and grenades, explosives and other weapons were recovered from them. The Pakistan Stock Exchange confirmed that no militants made it into the building. Its director, Abid Ali Habib, said the gunmen made their way from the car park and ""opened fire on everyone"". Images from the scene show the bodies of at least two men on the ground next to large amounts of ammunition and weapons. It was not immediately clear if more assailants were involved, prompting an extensive search of the premises by security forces. The other Balochistan: Life in a conflict zone Balochistan war: Pakistan accused over 1,000 dumped bodies The untold story of Pakistan's other war Reports say most people at the stock exchange managed to escape or hide in locked rooms.Those inside the building were evacuated,externalfrom the back door, Geo TV reported. Trading continued without interruption. ""We locked ourselves in our offices,"" Asad Javed, an employee at a brokerage in the building, told Reuters news agency. The exchange is situated in a high security zone along with head offices of banks and other businesses. It has offices for hundreds of financial institutions and says up to 8,000 people work there on a normal day - but numbers were down because of home working during the coronavirus pandemic. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) is one of half a dozen armed resistance groups in Balochistan and has launched previous attacks in Pakistan. In 2018 its members tried to storm the Chinese consulate in Karachi, killing at least four people. All staff inside the building were unharmed. Last year the BLA attacked a five-star hotel in the port city of Gwadar in Balochistan. The hotel is the centrepiece of a multi-billion-dollar Chinese project and was selected in order to target Chinese and other investors. Separatist militants in Balochistan oppose Chinese investment, saying it is of little benefit to local people. The BLA originally sought political autonomy for the province but has gradually evolved into a violent armed separatist movement and is listed as a terrorist organisation by Pakistan, the UK and the US. Widescale abuses and repression by the Pakistani military have been documented over decades in the province, which is difficult to access by journalists and human rights groups. Balochistan is a sparsely populated region, and the BLA and other militants have sanctuaries there and in adjoining areas in Pakistan. They also are believed to have hideouts in south-eastern Afghanistan. The province remains Pakistan's most impoverished area despite being rich in gas and coal reserves, as well as copper and gold. Baloch nationalists have long accused the central government of exploitation, and denying the province its due rights.

"An extra Â£14bn is needed each year to help the UK meet its climate commitments, a new think tank report suggests. Green Alliance says the cash is needed for clean transport, nature restoration, and low-carbon buildings. Over the past three years, it says that Â£9bn has been spent on projects that actually increase CO2, like roads. It comes as large UK firms make a promise to ""kick-start a new approach"" and ""put the environment first"". The Green Alliance think tank insists though that the funding issue must be solved in the prime ministerâs economic recovery speech expected on Tuesday. Its calculations are based on the governmentâs own assessment of major projects in the pipelinereleased on 16 June,external. The government said it is determined to meet carbon targets, but the report draws attention to ministers' plans to spend Â£28bn on roads. The authors cast doubt on whether the government should spend any more money at all on projects that increase CO2 emissions. UK warned to avoid climate change crisis Increase car taxes to help climate, advisers say Chris Venables, head of politics at Green Alliance, said of Tuesday's expected speech: ""This is a once in a generation opportunity for the prime minister to create the foundations of a healthier, more resilient economy. ""For âProject Speedâ (the prime minister's infrastructure review) to be successful, it must be the most ambitious climate infrastructure project ever, creating jobs in every corner of the UK. ""It canât mean a bonfire of regulations locking in polluting activities for decades to come.â The report supports analysis by the the Trades Union Congress defining the best value for money from job-creating schemes. Road-building was judged poorly. The calculations judge projects based on jobs created per pound of public investment. Best value are said to be: retrofitting buildings and creating cycle lanes, which are given a score of 20. Electric ferries, battery factories and reforestation score 19; decarbonising industry, new electric UK buses, 18; and upgrading railways, installing electric vehicle chargers, and environmental restoration, 17. Broadband expansion scores 15, but road-building, by comparison, scores just 10. In a previous interview for BBC News,AA President Edmund King endorsed the role of broadband. He told BBC News: ""Arguably in future, we should invest more in broadband (than new roads), because what this crisis has shown is that the majority of companies can continue working from home, and it can be more efficient."" Meanwhile, the government is facing legal action from a groupcomplaining that road plans are incompatible with climate objectives. Andrew Adonis, former head of the National Infrastructure Commission told BBC News: âWe need to tackle bottlenecks in the road system but it is vital we promote a long-term shift to low carbon transport. ""The coalition agreement for the new Irish government includes a 2-1 split for all future transport capital spending to be on public transport and cycling rather than roads. We should consider doing the same in the UK.â A government spokesperson said: âThe prime minister has been clear that the UK should have the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth. âThe actions we are taking to achieve our zero emissions target will help to deliver a stronger, cleaner, more sustainable and more resilient economy after this pandemic â and already there are over 460,000 UK jobs in low carbon businesses and their supply chains.â On Monday, more than 200 business leaders will meet with Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Environment Secretary George Eustice at a Council for Sustainable Business event. FTSE 100 firms including Unilever, Standard Chartered and Direct Line will discuss measures that business can take to cut carbon emissions with ministers as they also try to deal with the fallout of the coronavirus crisis. Attendees will be asked to show government that they are are keen to work with them on a ""cleaner, greener, more resilient economic recovery post Covid-19"".

"This video can not be played The wounded were taken to hospital after gunmen stormed the stock exchange Four gunmen attacked the Pakistani stock exchange in Karachi, killing two guards and a policeman and wounding seven others before being shot dead. The assailants launched a grenade attack at the main gate to the building and opened fire but police say they failed to make it to the trading floor. Staff took refuge in locked rooms and many were evacuated as security forces put an end to the assault. Militants from the Baloch Liberation Army say they were behind the attack. Ethnic Baloch groups have fought a long-running insurgency for a separate homeland and a greater share of resources in Pakistan's Balochistan province. The gunmen stormed a security post at the gate and fought their way into the car park The director-general of the paramilitary Sindh Rangers force, Omer Ahmed Bukhari, said all the attackers had been killed within eight minutes. ""They had come to carry out an attack inside the building and take hostages inside,"" he told a news conference. He said the gunmen had brought supplies of food as well as weaponry, suggesting they were prepared for a siege. Pakistan has suffered years of militant violence, mostly by Islamist groups, but attacks such as this one have become rare in recent years. Monday's attack began when the militants armed with automatic rifles threw a grenade and then began firing at a security post outside the stock exchange. ""The attackers came in a silver Corolla and were stopped by police at the gate outside where the exchange of fire took place,"" Sindh police additional inspector general Ghulam Nabi Memon told BBC Urdu. The covered body of one of the suspected gunmen is removed from the site of the attack Guards fought back, killing all four heavily armed attackers, the authorities say. Three police officials are among the seven wounded receiving treatment in hospital. Mr Memon said the attackers did not manage to enter the main building and grenades, explosives and other weapons were recovered from them. The Pakistan Stock Exchange confirmed that no militants made it into the building. Its director, Abid Ali Habib, said the gunmen made their way from the car park and ""opened fire on everyone"". Images from the scene show the bodies of at least two men on the ground next to large amounts of ammunition and weapons. It was not immediately clear if more assailants were involved, prompting an extensive search of the premises by security forces. The other Balochistan: Life in a conflict zone Balochistan war: Pakistan accused over 1,000 dumped bodies The untold story of Pakistan's other war Reports say most people at the stock exchange managed to escape or hide in locked rooms.Those inside the building were evacuated,externalfrom the back door, Geo TV reported. Trading continued without interruption. ""We locked ourselves in our offices,"" Asad Javed, an employee at a brokerage in the building, told Reuters news agency. The exchange is situated in a high security zone along with head offices of banks and other businesses. It has offices for hundreds of financial institutions and says up to 8,000 people work there on a normal day - but numbers were down because of home working during the coronavirus pandemic. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) is one of half a dozen armed resistance groups in Balochistan and has launched previous attacks in Pakistan. In 2018 its members tried to storm the Chinese consulate in Karachi, killing at least four people. All staff inside the building were unharmed. Last year the BLA attacked a five-star hotel in the port city of Gwadar in Balochistan. The hotel is the centrepiece of a multi-billion-dollar Chinese project and was selected in order to target Chinese and other investors. Separatist militants in Balochistan oppose Chinese investment, saying it is of little benefit to local people. The BLA originally sought political autonomy for the province but has gradually evolved into a violent armed separatist movement and is listed as a terrorist organisation by Pakistan, the UK and the US. Widescale abuses and repression by the Pakistani military have been documented over decades in the province, which is difficult to access by journalists and human rights groups. Balochistan is a sparsely populated region, and the BLA and other militants have sanctuaries there and in adjoining areas in Pakistan. They also are believed to have hideouts in south-eastern Afghanistan. The province remains Pakistan's most impoverished area despite being rich in gas and coal reserves, as well as copper and gold. Baloch nationalists have long accused the central government of exploitation, and denying the province its due rights.

"The WHO warns that the ""worst is yet to come"" for the coronavirus pandemic The number of people to die with Covid-19 worldwide passes half a million Since the outbreak began, there have been more than 10 million cases With cases rising in 30 US states, the Texas governor speaks of ""a swift and very dangerous turn"" The EU says from 1 July it will allow travellers in from an initial list of ""safe"" non-EU countries Iran reports its highest single-day death toll since its outbreak began in February, with 162 fatalities In the UK, school pupils return in Wales, while more shops reopen in Scotland UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""concerned"" about a rise in coronavirus cases in Leicester Edited by Lauren Turner There are rising fears in Leicester as the city sees a spike in cases We're pausing the coronavirus live page for now but will be back tomorrow morning. We leave you with a round-up of today's biggest developments from around the globe.  Many thanks for joining us.     We will be wrapping up today's live page shortly. The coverage has been brought to you by: Owen Amos, Oliver Brett, Joshua Cheetham, Alice Evans, Paulin Kola, Max Matza, Ashitha Nagesh, Krutika Pathi, Yvette Tan, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and George Wright. Here are some of the latest graphics showing how the world hit 10 million coronavirus cases. They also show the current situation in the United States. The number of reported infections in the US has now surpassed 2.5 million. Over 125,000 Covid-19-related deaths have been confirmed nationwide - more than in any other country.  You might remember our report a few weeks ago on the coronavirus contact tracer in the UK who told us they werepaid to sit around and watch Netflix. It seems they weren't alone. Thousands of workers in the government's new test and trace call centre failed to trace a single contact of a coronavirus case in the first three weeks of operation. BBC Panorama has discovered that the government's so-called ""army"" of 25,000 call handlers contacted a total of only 15,812 people, to tell them to isolate, in the first three weeks of the operation. The Department of Health says call handlers phone people 10 times before giving up on trying to make contact. It says the test and trace system has been built to have sufficient capacity for the future, so having an overcapacity is a real success. But call handlers say they feel ""guilty for being paid to do nothing"" and that it is ""not true"" that things are going well. Read our full story here. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist A misleading post claiming âsuicide
figures are up 200% since lockdownâ went viral on Twitter in the UK today. The post, which also features a
number for the charity Samaritans, asks users to âcopy and repost this tweetâ.
It has since been shared more than 31,000 times. But we can find no evidence to
support the claim. âThere is currently no evidence of
a rise in suicide rates, with no system yet for national real-time monitoring
of rates,â a Samaritans spokesperson told the BBC. The
Office for National Statistics releases suicide statistics annually. The last
release was in September 2019. The
person who first tweeted the claim has been contacted and has posted a link to
an ITV report from May about a mental health charity, Sane, warning thatcalls
to its helpline had increased by 200%,externalsince
lockdown began. But this is obviously not the same as actual suicide figures
rising by 200%. Pubs and bars that serve food have reopened today in Ireland Ireland's chief medical officer says there's a ""worrying trend"" of increasing numbers of cases of coronavirus in the country. The country has driven down the number of infections in recent weeks andpubs and bars serving food reopened today. But Dr Tony Holohan says there have been some new clusters. As of midnight last night, public health chiefs reported 24 more confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total to 25,462. The number of Covid-19 related deaths has not increased today - remaining at 1,735. Dr Holohan said: ""As restrictions are lifted and people move about more, it is important that we use the tools that have helped us suppress the virus to date."" He called on the public to wash their hands, maintain social distancing and wear face coverings to help ""avoid contracting the virus and spreading it to those we love"". At least six of the new cases were associated with international travel. Irish ministers had been intending to put in place air bridges with countries with low coronavirus infection rates by 9 July, in an effort to boost tourism. But Dr Holohan has expressed concern at the plan and said many of the most popular European holiday spots did not have low enough disease rates to encourage travel to there. Members of two households of any size can meet each other - either inside or outside - from this Saturday in England. You can meet different households at different times, and overnight stays are allowed - but no more than two households should meet at any one time. Social distancing between people not in your household will still have to be observed - ideally at 2m (6ft), but at 1m if that's not possible. From rearranging your living room to resisting the urge to sing,here are a range of tips on how to make home visits as safe as possible. And remember - rules are different for each of the four UK nations. Photographs of healthcare staff and their storiesfrom the pandemic are being recorded to document their ""remarkable dedication"". The#WeCareTogether campaign,externalaims to celebrate the work of staff in hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries, as well as those working from home. Norfolk and Waveney Health and Care Partnership, which created the project, described it as ""powerful and moving"". Jodie Bond, a newly qualified nurse, said she had sleep deprivation and found work ""frightening"" Rachel Brice worked on hospital wards and lived alone while her husband and children moved in with his parents Emmie Yvon N Mwembo says it was ""emotionally draining"" to work in critical care Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Next week, between 7 and 8 July, more than 10 million students at Chinese high schools will take their annual Gaokao final year exams. Xinhua news agency calls this two-day event, similar to A-Levels, âthe largest organised gathering event in China since the start of the Covid-19 outbreakâ. Given that students must attend these exams in person â even in areas where the virus is still high-risk, like Beijing â schools are going to great lengths to ensure that students sitting the exams are safe. The National Health Commission said two weeks ago that all final year students and monitors needed to undergo 14 days of health monitoring and temperature checks before sitting exams. Students will also be tested for the virus on arrival. In most areas, special quarantine centres have been arranged to isolate a maximum of four students with high temperatures, at each corner of a room. However, the Global Times newspaper says that âonly healthy students are able to attend the 2020 Gaokaoâ meaning students with a high temperature will not be able to take their exams. Schools and test centres have been ordered to conduct strict sanitation and sterilisation tests. Students across the country have been told they can wear masks in the examination rooms. For people from medium and high-risk areas, this is mandatory. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics As we've been reporting,pubs and restaurants in Leicester may stay closedfor two weeks longer than the rest of England, due to a surge in coronavirus cases. But if you look at the UK governmentâs main coronavirus data site, you would think thereâs no problem in the city. The site describes about 1,000 cases in Leicester, a figure that has risen by 8% over the last fortnight. But yesterday, the local council released figures, given to them by Public Health England, that count nearly 3,000 cases and a jump in the past fortnight of well over 35%. The reason for this difference is that the main government site doesnât publish figures on positive tests from private laboratories for local authorities in England. They do have those figures â theyâre included in national figures, shared with councils and used in PHEâs weekly map of coronavirus hotspots - but theyâre not published in England. These figures are published in Wales and, as of last week, in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, a health think-tank, has called on the government to publish better data in order to
build the public confidence needed to loosen the lockdown and protect against a
second wave of the virus. Iain CarterBBC Sport commentator The Ryder Cup traditionally attracts some of the most vocal support in golf The Ryder Cup, golf's premier team competition in which Europe and the USA compete over a three-day tournament every two years, is likely to be postponed a year. Europe were due to defend their crown in Whistling Straits, Wisconsin, from 25 to 27 September. However few major in the sport are keen about the prospect of the event being contested in front of empty galleries. Top stars, led by world number one Rory McIlroy, have said the matchshould not be played without fans present. The American Brooks Koepka has said he would ""possibly"" choose to miss the event in the event it were to be staged behind closed doors. Support for the
governmentâs plans to ease the lockdown in England has fallen noticeably over
the past week, a poll suggests, amid rising concern over a second wave of the
coronavirus outbreak. The reopening of
restaurants, pubs, hairdressers and cinemas was backed by 55% of people
questioned by YouGov over the weekend. But support has
fallen by nine points when compared to a poll that asked the same question on
Monday last week. A total of 38% of people
said they opposed the relaxation â a rise of nine points on the previous poll. YouGovâs research
manager Chris Curtis said: âItâs likely that the shift in support was sparked
by images of packed beaches and parks over the hot weekend. âPolling already
shows a large majority of the public (74%) are worried about a second wave of coronavirus, so photos and rolling news footage of busy public areas will only
reignite those concerns.â YouGov questioned
1,626 adults in England, Wales and Scotland online between 26 and 28 June. When Mohammed Azeem arrived in Bradford Royal Infirmary he was in a critical state, with far too little oxygen in his blood - at one point his oxygen levels were ""not compatible with life"" according to the intensive care specialist treating him. But incredibly he survived, writes Dr John Wright. Once his breathing problems began, he was reluctant to call the NHS for help, because of themyth then circulatingin parts of the Asian community that people admitted to hospital were never discharged alive. It was his friend, Haleem, who insisted on calling an ambulance and even helped to carry him into it, as by this stage he was unable to walk. When Mohammed arrived in A&E it was clear that his life was in immediate danger. He was whisked straight to the Intensive Care Unit. It was touch and go from his first day and his perilous journey was only just beginning. He ended up in a coma in ICU for 48 days, and in hospital for 68.

Broadway is normally a focal point for New York's entertainment industry The curtains won't be opening across New York's iconic Broadway theatre district until at least early 2021, according to the AFP news agency. The Broadway League, the representative body for the theatres, is making the announcement now that there will be no stage performances for the rest of 2020, due to the unpredictability of the coronavirus pandemic. It has not set a date for performances to resume, but is offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for all shows until 3 January. The entertainment industry has been particularly hard hit by the effects of coronavirus. Concert halls, music venues and theatres are likely to be some of the last institutions to reopen in the UK, though there is more positive news in Italy: Milan's famous La Scala theatre will stage four concerts next week as it begins to open up after lockdown.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent People who were seriously ill in hospital with coronavirus need to be urgently screened for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), leading doctors in the UK say. The Covid Trauma Response Working Group, led by University College London and involving experts from south-east England, said those who had been in intensive care were most at risk and regular check-ups should last at least a year. More than 100,000 people have been treated in hospital for the virus across the UK. The experts say tens of thousands of these would have been seriously ill enough to be at risk of PTSD. The working group highlighted research which showed 30% of patients who had suffered severe illnesses in infectious disease outbreaks in the past had gone on to develop PTSD, while depression and anxiety problems were also common.

Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The UK has suffered worse than any other G7 nation on excess deaths stats The UK was the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations in the weeks leading up to early June, according to BBC analysis of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Analysis also showed that England fared the worst in Europe, just above Spain. The research compared 11-week periods for each nation as the virus hit its peak in each country. The analysis of Covid-19 deaths and excess deaths - which compared countries in three different ways - showed the UK worse off than the USA, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, and Japan. A separate analysis of European nations, by Oxford University economists, has England just above Spain in terms of the proportion of deaths over and above what would be normal. Read Faisal Islam's report in full.  Milan's La Scala theatre is reopening next week with a series of four concerts, according to news agency Associated Press, following a four-month shutdown during Italy's coronavirus outbreak. Concerts by a small number of artists will be held on on 6, 8, 13 and 15 July, in front of a reduced audience of 600 people. The 13 July concert will feature recent graduates of La Scalaâs academy, while its final event will host the La Scala Philharmonic orchestra. âI think for many music lovers, the time has come to return to hearing live music, even if the means are reduced,â said general manager Dominique Meyer. Concert-goers will have to wear protective masks while entering and exiting the historic theatre, but can take them off once seated. No intermissions are planned for the events, and snack bars will be closed to prevent people from forming queues. The concerts and other future events will be streamed online. Plans for full-scale operas are currently on hold due to public health measures in Italy. But in September, La Scala has arranged for a performance of Verdi's Requiem in Milans Duomo theatre to commemorate those who've died from coronavirus. It will also host a recital of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on 5 September. A couple in Madrid getting married in early June The government has published new guidance on weddings in England, allowing ceremonies of up to 30 people but advising against large receptions. From 4 July, wedding and civil partnerships can go ahead but with only 30 people including the couple, witnesses, and anyone working at the ceremony - like photographers. Alengthy guidance document,externalreleased by the government says people should socially distance, singing should not take place and hands must be washed before exchanging rings. Loud music is also advised against, as it could encourage people to raise their voices - which increases the likelihood of transmission. Read our full story here. The UK's list of countries that people will be able to travel to and from without going into quarantine will be published this week, Transport Secretary Grant
Shapps has confirmed. In a written statement, Mr Shapps adds that travel corridors being considered are based on things such as the prevalence of the virus and the trajectory of new cases in different countries. The transport secretary says the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will also soon be giving details on a review of its travel advice to UK citizens. Since March, that advice has been to avoid all non-essential travel abroad. As wereported over the weekend, it is thought that the list of travel corridors
with the UK will include Spain, France,
Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Turkey, Germany and Norway -
but not Portugal or Sweden. The government previously said
the new rules will give people the opportunity of a foreign summer holiday, while also boosting the UK economy - but the relaxation
depends on risks staying low. For more on this,read our holidays explaineror watchwhat itâs like to fly in the ""new normal"". The cakes (one shown here from a previous new year celebration) can feed 50 people Costco has announced that it has stopped selling its enormously popular half-sheet cakes, which are commonly served at large gatherings such as birthdays, graduations and even weddings. The ban on the custom-decorated cakes, which can feed nearly 50 people for $20 (Â£16), come as most state health agencies warn against large groups due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. âTo help limit personal contact and create more space for social distancing, Costco has reduced service in some departments... At this time, we are not making sheet cakes for special order,â the company said on Facebook earlier this month. The decision prompted an outcry from loyal customers, who took to social media to share stories of the milestones that had led to a sweet treat. Other joked that you don't really need a large gathering to ""demolish"" an entire cake. Â© 2025 BBC.

"An ambulance outside Royal Glamorgan A&E - which opened in 1999 Campaigners had a ""powerful role"" in persuading health bosses to keep open a 24-hour accident and emergency unit at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, says a senior health official. There were plans to either close the A&E at night or completely, replacing it with a minor injuries unit. Serious staff shortages have been tackled and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health boardhas backed saving it. Medical director Dr Nick Lyons said community concerns had a big influence. ""It was a humbling and an incredible journey with a local community, not always an easy one -  it was quite a bumpy ride at times,"" he said. ""For me, perhaps the most powerful were some of the illustrations that individual parents, patients and carers gave us, and driving the mountain road, driving around the community, trying to put ourselves in their shoes, thinking how would this would work."" A GP by background, Dr Lyons said it was ""incredibly emotional"" to listen to people's stories and come up with a recommendation which responded to them. Modelling showed replacing the Royal Glamorgan's A&E - which sees an average of 5,300 patients a month - with a minor injuries unit would have put ""huge pressures"" on the region's other A&Es at Prince Charles in Merthyr Tydfil and Princess of Wales in Bridgend. Those hospitals, he says, would have ""struggled to cope"" had the unit closed Staff recruitment - the Royal Glamorgan was still in trouble without what has been called an ""imaginative and aggressive"" recruitment campaign. A full-time consultant had left but now there is the equivalent of 2.4 in post, while more doctors have also been hired full time from the locum pool The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated how important the department was in meeting local needs and how the NHS could quickly develop new ways of working and overcome challenges The A&E unit near Llantrisant was so reliant on single-shift locum doctors late last year that it had to close twice at short notice over the Christmas period due to a lack of cover. Ambulances had to be re-directed to the region's other hospitals. Dr Lyons insists the department is now in a much more stable position, with staffing numbers up to a more typical number and no more ""Friday afternoon panic"" that they wouldn't have enough cover for the weekend. Coronavirus: Royal Glamorgan Hospital staff on life on front line Patient safety at Royal Glamorgan A&E 'precarious' A&E set-up 'increasingly unsustainable' Medical staff at the hospital also say they now recognise familiar faces on shift and management say this continuity is a big contributor to patient safety. The complexities around coronavirus and the need for social distancing also means that keeping three A&E units up and running was a factor. But the response too of staff showed what was possible. ""We've seen teams work in ways that in my 30-odd years in the NHS I've never seen,"" said Dr Lyons. ""The agility and the imagination and the 'can do' ability and seeing the team support the A&E and work together for our patients has been has been again humbling."" A protest in February before a health board meeting Campaigners organised several protests to argue their case that lives would be put at risk if the department was downgraded. They were worried about poor transport links between some valleys communities and that other hospitals had been prioritised for investment instead of Royal Glamorgan. When one health official admitted to Senedd members that no ""substantive effort"" was made to recruit A&E consultants for five years, they reacted angrily. Last Thursday, campaigners handed over a 25,000 name petition at the health board's offices in Abercynonin advance of Monday's meeting, when a final decision was made to keep A&E in its current form.,external Len Arthur, chairman of the action group, said it was almost ""beyond belief"" that people power had won but he gave credit for the way thinking had shifted and their arguments had been listened to and now adopted. ""The A&E department has taken a larger role in people's lives over the last 10 years and that's why there's been huge community support,"" he added. Sarah Davies, of the Unison union's Cwm Taf branch, said it had ""campaigned vigorously"" to show the harm and risk of reducing services as well as the negative effect it would have on  Prince Charles and Princess of Wales hospitals. Sara has recently retired as a table tennis player Sara Head, from Beddau, near Pontypridd is a recently retired Paralympian table tennis player. The 40-year-old competed at London 2012, winning a team bronze, and represented Wales at two Commonwealth Games. ""It's incredibly important to me - I've had some really severe infections and staff have got me well, and it was due to them I got to the Rio Paralympics,"" she said. ""I was close to having sepsis and at times I was in hospital for six weeks. It was the quick treatment. I feel I'm pretty fit but I'd struggle to reach Merthyr if I couldn't drive. ""They've listened - we hope they'll continue to have that communication with the community because together it can be an amazing place."" Sara went to various meetings to raise concerns In 2014, five south Wales health boards looked to address concerns that maternity care, baby care, children's hospital care and emergency medicine were spread too thinly across too many hospitals. After a public consultation, health boards and community health councils finally agreed on a series of recommendations. These included closing A&E at the Royal Glamorgan, but in the intervening period there was little change. In the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area, consultant-led maternity care has now been centralised at Prince Charles Hospital. But changes to children's hospital care have been repeatedly postponed. The health board says ""further work"" will still be needed to develop appropriate models of care and ""mitigate the risks"" of ongoing doctor shortages. It is focusing on a pool of 80 emergency medicine trainees in Wales for further consultant recruitment and aims to bring in five junior clinical fellows by August.

"An extra Â£14bn is needed each year to help the UK meet its climate commitments, a new think tank report suggests. Green Alliance says the cash is needed for clean transport, nature restoration, and low-carbon buildings. Over the past three years, it says that Â£9bn has been spent on projects that actually increase CO2, like roads. It comes as large UK firms make a promise to ""kick-start a new approach"" and ""put the environment first"". The Green Alliance think tank insists though that the funding issue must be solved in the prime ministerâs economic recovery speech expected on Tuesday. Its calculations are based on the governmentâs own assessment of major projects in the pipelinereleased on 16 June,external. The government said it is determined to meet carbon targets, but the report draws attention to ministers' plans to spend Â£28bn on roads. The authors cast doubt on whether the government should spend any more money at all on projects that increase CO2 emissions. UK warned to avoid climate change crisis Increase car taxes to help climate, advisers say Chris Venables, head of politics at Green Alliance, said of Tuesday's expected speech: ""This is a once in a generation opportunity for the prime minister to create the foundations of a healthier, more resilient economy. ""For âProject Speedâ (the prime minister's infrastructure review) to be successful, it must be the most ambitious climate infrastructure project ever, creating jobs in every corner of the UK. ""It canât mean a bonfire of regulations locking in polluting activities for decades to come.â The report supports analysis by the the Trades Union Congress defining the best value for money from job-creating schemes. Road-building was judged poorly. The calculations judge projects based on jobs created per pound of public investment. Best value are said to be: retrofitting buildings and creating cycle lanes, which are given a score of 20. Electric ferries, battery factories and reforestation score 19; decarbonising industry, new electric UK buses, 18; and upgrading railways, installing electric vehicle chargers, and environmental restoration, 17. Broadband expansion scores 15, but road-building, by comparison, scores just 10. In a previous interview for BBC News,AA President Edmund King endorsed the role of broadband. He told BBC News: ""Arguably in future, we should invest more in broadband (than new roads), because what this crisis has shown is that the majority of companies can continue working from home, and it can be more efficient."" Meanwhile, the government is facing legal action from a groupcomplaining that road plans are incompatible with climate objectives. Andrew Adonis, former head of the National Infrastructure Commission told BBC News: âWe need to tackle bottlenecks in the road system but it is vital we promote a long-term shift to low carbon transport. ""The coalition agreement for the new Irish government includes a 2-1 split for all future transport capital spending to be on public transport and cycling rather than roads. We should consider doing the same in the UK.â A government spokesperson said: âThe prime minister has been clear that the UK should have the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth. âThe actions we are taking to achieve our zero emissions target will help to deliver a stronger, cleaner, more sustainable and more resilient economy after this pandemic â and already there are over 460,000 UK jobs in low carbon businesses and their supply chains.â On Monday, more than 200 business leaders will meet with Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Environment Secretary George Eustice at a Council for Sustainable Business event. FTSE 100 firms including Unilever, Standard Chartered and Direct Line will discuss measures that business can take to cut carbon emissions with ministers as they also try to deal with the fallout of the coronavirus crisis. Attendees will be asked to show government that they are are keen to work with them on a ""cleaner, greener, more resilient economic recovery post Covid-19"".
