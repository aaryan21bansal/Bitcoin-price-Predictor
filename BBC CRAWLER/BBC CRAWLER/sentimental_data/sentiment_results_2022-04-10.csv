"Energy firm Ineos says it wants to build a fracking test site to show the process can be performed safely. The company claimed extracting shale gas in the UK could make the country ""self-sufficient in 10 years"". The firm has written to the government asking to develop a site, with its boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe saying such a move would ""reduce the cost of energy"" and ensure ""long-term energy independence"". The offer comes after thegovernment ordered a new report into fracking. Last week, it announced the UK's new energy strategy, whichincluded plans to have more nuclear reactors, wind farms and solar energy production. However, the government's strategy made no mention of fracking, a method of extracting gas and oil from shale rock. Fracking involves drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals at a rock layer in order to release the gas inside. What is fracking and why is it controversial? Minister orders review of fracking impact How high could my energy bills go? The technique was halted in the UK in 2019 amid opposition from green groups and concerns over earth tremors, but there have been calls to rethink the ban, given the recent rise in the cost of energy. Sir Jim, the founder and chairman of Ineos, said that with the UK in the ""midst of an energy crisis"", it was a ""ridiculous situation with so much gas under our feet"". He said extracting shale gas would allow ""the UK to benefit from its own resources, massively reduce the cost of energy and ensure our long-term energy independence"". ""We are today offering to drill a shale test site to show that a competent operator can be trusted to develop the technology safely,"" he added. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is one of the UK's richest men Ineos said while it was invested in what it called the ""growing renewables revolution"", the technology was not yet reliable enough to take over. The company said the UK would need gas for three decades as it moves completely away from burning fossil fuels. ""Fracking has been safely used in the oil and gas industry for over 50 years. In the US, over one million wells have been safely used and have transformed the energy security of the country,"" Ineos said. The UK met48% of its gas demand from domestic supplies in 2020,,externaland bought the rest on international markets, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to many countries, particularly European Union members who rely heavily on Russian gas and oil, considering where they get their supplies of energy from. Ineos's call for a fracking test site comes after the boss of British Gas owner Centrica said the process could boost UK energy supplies and reduce bills. Chris O'Shea said there needed to be an""informed debate"" about it. Some senior Conservatives have also called for a rethink on fracking amid concerns over security of access and rising energy prices. However, environmental group Greenpeace has said there has been ""a decade of hype and bluster"" around shale gas. The fracking site owned by Cuadrilla Resources in Lancashire had to halt activities in 2019 following concerns about small earth tremors Previously, Greenpeace said that fracking would not improve energy security, because any gas extracted would belong to the gas firm doing the drilling, not to Britain, and it would be sold on international markets. Many environmental groups have said they are concerned about the potential for fracking to cause earthquakes. At Cuadrilla's site in Lancashire,more than 120 small tremors were recorded while it was drilling.,external Sir Jim said Ineos would invite government inspectors to monitor any potential test site. ""If at any stage the science shows there are problems, we will stop and make good the site,"" he said. ""But if, as we believe, the opposite is true, we would ask that the government looks again at shale gas which would allow the UK to benefit from its own resources, massively reduce the cost of energy and ensure our long-term energy independence.""

"A 3.1% rise in the state pension and various benefits has now taken effect but charities have warned it fails to tackle cost of living pressures. Official figures show that prices are rising twice as fast, and they are expected accelerate further. The government said it recognised people's difficulties and was helping. Late last year, ministers decided to temporarily cut the state pension's link to average earnings, which would have led to an 8% rise now. They have pledged to reinstate the so-called pension ""triple lock"" in future years. Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, with costs going up across a variety of sectors of the economy. This increase in the cost of living is measured by the rate of inflation, which official forecasters expect to peak at close to 9% later this year owing mostly to more expensive gas and electricity bills. Official statisticians and a range of economists have said that those on the lowest incomes are likely to be most stretched by the rising cost of living. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Those affected include Collette, a mother-of-two, whose income is from universal credit - one of the benefits that has now risen by 3.1% for the year. ""Gas and electricity is eating into everything,"" she told the BBC. ""Food bills are going up as well. We have got into debt this year. This is all going to burst at some point."" Five reasons why prices and bills are going up Warning of fresh energy bill shock in October She said she wished she could work, but was unable to due to ill health. People she knew who were doing two jobs - as she used to - were still struggling to cope financially, she added. The extra government household support grant she received had been spent on gas bills, she said. Long-standing policy links the rise in a series of benefits and tax credits each April to the rate of inflation the previous September. That is why means-tested benefits such as universal credit, as well as disability and carer's allowances, have now gone up by 3.1%. The actual amounts individuals receive depends on their circumstances. Child benefit has also gone up by 3.1% to Â£21.80 a week for the eldest child, and Â£14.45 a week for other children. Once a week Andrew gets a free meal from a local charity and says he likes to make an effort to look smart Andrew McIntyre owes his energy supplier Â£1,200, and his monthly bill is about to go up from Â£75 to Â£120 a month. The 57-year-old lives off universal credit, and already regularly faces a shortfall between what he has got coming in and what he needs to pay on bills. As he gets ready to go to a local food charity for a free meal - something he does one day a week and likes to get dressed up smartly for - he explains that it means he has had to choose between paying his rent and heating his flat. ""Every month I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" he says. Andrew gets Â£325 a month in universal credit, and Â£351 a month in housing benefit. He has no savings. He pays Â£400 for rent, leaving him with Â£276 for food and bills. ""If I can eat late in the morning then I don't have to eat again until my evening meal,"" he says. Read more about how people are coping with the rising cost of living Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: ""We've heard stories of families resorting to heating up tins of beans over a tealight, or choosing between giving their kids a hot bath at bedtime and putting on the heating for an hour while they dress for school. With energy bills rocketing this month, things will only get worse. ""At the bare minimum, the government should reconsider and increase benefits by the current inflation rate to help people keep up with the rapidly rising cost of living. And as costs continue to soar, they must bring in further support to stop more households being pushed into hardship."" A government spokesman said: ""We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we're providing support worth Â£22bn across the next financial year and benefits are being uprated by the usual measure, September's inflation figure."" He added that support also included cutting fuel duty and money to help pay for energy bills. The minimum wage had also been increased. If the rate of inflation is high in September, then benefits could rise significantly in April 2023, when the rate of price increases is forecast to slow. The uprating of some social security benefits is devolved, with the Scottish government setting a 6% increase in eight of them from 1 April. The move affected the Job Start Payment, Young Carer's Grant, Funeral Support, three Best Start Grants and Carer's Allowance Supplement - which had all been due to increase by 3.1%. It also covered Child Winter Heating Assistance, which was to rise by 5%. Ministers said it was an ""urgent"" response to growing pressures on the cost of living. Normally under the triple lock formula, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5% - whichever is highest. Ministers said last September that the figures had been ""skewed and distorted"" by the average earnings rise, which was ""statistical anomaly"", owing to the impact of Covid and the withdrawal of furlough. The House of Commons Library said that would have been about 8% and cost an extra Â£4bn to Â£5bn. So the government decided to limit this April's rise to the greater of the inflation rate last autumn or 2.5%, hence the 3.1% increase now. It means: The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is Â£185.15 a week, a rise of Â£5.50 a week The full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is Â£141.85 a week, a rise of Â£4.25 a week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has committed to reinstating the triple lock from now on, telling the Commons: ""I am again happy to put on record that the triple lock will be honoured in the future."" Jonathan Cribb, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that had the government considered making a change to next year's triple lock promise, it would be a much worse policy that the current temporary suspension. He added that there was a ""good case"" to smooth out pensions and benefits rises but government policy - which included some help with energy bills - should be considered as a whole.

"This video can not be played 'A joy to watch' - action and reaction from Shearer Manchester City retained their slender one-point advantage at the top of the Premier League as they fought out a classic draw with closest rivals Liverpool at Etihad Stadium. The meeting between the country's two outstanding sides lived up to its pre-match billing and in the end there was nothing to separate them, with the destination of the title still hanging in the balance with seven games remaining. City flew out of the blocks to take an early lead through Kevin de Bruyne's deflected strike but Liverpool were quickly on terms when Diogo Jota turned home Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass. Pep Guardiola's side dominated a magnificent first 45 minutes but failed to convert a host of chances before Gabriel Jesus stole in behind Alexander-Arnold to restore their lead from Joao Cancelo's cross nine minutes before the break. Liverpool had been strangely nervous but came out rejuvenated after the re-start, equalising when Sadio Mane celebrated his 30th birthday by scoring from Mohamed Salah's perfect pass in the 47th minute. Raheem Sterling had a goal ruled out for offside as both sides pressed for a winner in this superb match, with City substitute Riyad Mahrez wasting a chance to win it in the dying seconds as he lifted his finish over the top. 'Neither of top two deserve to finish second' - Shearer column on title race 'Title rivals deliver classic that lives up to the hype' 'A result we have to live with' - Klopp Where do teams' quadruple and Treble bids stand? The two sides drew 2-2 at Anfield in October in their last meeting in the Premier League Manchester City and manager Pep Guardiola may regret their failure to turn first-half superiority into a more meaningful advantage but they will not be wholly dissatisfied with the outcome. There will certainly be no dissatisfaction with City's level of performance, which was outstanding apart from a sloppy first 15 minutes at the start of the second half, during which Liverpool equalised and the reigning Premier League champions were on the back foot. City's supporters seemed happy enough with the final outcome, clearly living on their nerves in the closing stages knowing Liverpool's threat and their capacity to strike at any time. De Bruyne was at his imperious best, although Sterling struggled against his former club, his day summed up when arguably his most composed piece of play in a frenetic afternoon saw a low finish past Alisson ruled out for offside, while Liverpool's keeper also denied him in the opening moments of the game. City's advantage at the top of the table is just that one point but knowing how formidable Liverpool's challenge can be, you suspect Guardiola will settle for it with only seven games left and a fixture list that looks manageable. He would have preferred the victory that would have opened up a crucial gap but City have survived their toughest fixture of the season against their most dangerous opponents largely unscathed. This video can not be played City were better than Liverpool â Guardiola Man City's De Bruyne wins your player of the match Reaction to the draw at Etihad Stadium Liverpool's Sadio Mane scored 46 seconds into the second half to make it 2-2 This was never going to be the so-called title decider, no matter what the outcome. There is still the capacity for too many potential twists and turns to call it so soon. Liverpool came into the game in outstanding form, on the back of 10 straight league wins and a club record eight successive away wins in all competitions. And yet, they started with uncharacteristic unease and hesitancy, especially at the back where there were several nervous moments. Even when they are off their best, Liverpool still possess ever-present menace and the poacher supreme Jota settled Jurgen Klopp's side with a trademark finish for his 15th Premier League goal of the season. Liverpool were fortunate to be only 2-1 down at half-time, although City keeper Ederson sent palpitations around Etihad Stadium when he lost control of the ball on his goal-line with Jota in close attendance, recovering to show nerves of steel and regain his poise. Klopp clearly delivered some stern messages to his players at the break and Liverpool were much more themselves in the second half, Mane striking almost immediately and their pressing game finally rushing City into mistakes. Liverpool may still be in second place but they are right in this title hunt.

The European Causeway was detained in Larne almost two weeks ago due to inspectors' concerns Another P&O vessel, the European Highlander, remained docked in Larne on Saturday awaiting a full Port State Control Inspection. The ferry operator has been strongly criticised by politicians and unions following the sacking of workers. However, P&O says its business ""would not be viable"" without changes to staffing.

"""Peek a Boop"" was broken of its pedestal at Victoria Park in Cardiff Four Snoopy sculptures forming part of a trail have had to be withdrawn after just two days because they were smashed by vandals, the organisers have said. The sculptures had been placed at landmarks around south Wales on Friday, as part of an exhibition to raise awareness and funds for the Dogs Trust. It was ""devastating"" for the creators and sponsors, the organisers said. But they added they hoped to repair the broken sculptures and called on the public to protect those that remain.

"Ronaldo appeared to knock a young fan's phone to the ground as he walked down the tunnel at Goodison Merseyside Police are investigating an alleged assault after Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to break a fan's phone. Footage was shared on social media alongside comments claiming he smashed the device as he left the pitch after his side's1-0 loss at Everton. Ronaldo, 37, later apologised on social media. Merseyside Police said they were investigating ""reports of an alleged assault"" at Goodison Park on Saturday. A spokesperson said they were liaising with both Manchester United and Everton. ""As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch,"" they added.

"Emmanuel Macron has limited his public appearances ahead of the first round to one big campaign rally Twelve candidates are running for the French presidency, as incumbent Emmanuel Macron stakes his claim for a second term. Voters go to the polls in the first round on Sunday and, assuming no-one wins a majority, the top two candidates will take part in a run-off on 24 April. The winner, to be chosen from four women and eight men, will have the power to shape France and its key role in Europe for the next five years. Although the race has been overshadowed by Russia's war in Ukraine, for most voters, the main issue is the cost of living. When he became France's youngest ever president in 2017, it sealed a meteoric rise that came less than a year after he launched a centrist political movement calledLa RÃ©publique En Marche!to challenge the traditional parties. Five years on, aged 44, he continues to dominate French politics, but faces a strong challenge from Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate he easily defeated in the second-round run-off in 2017. He entered the ÃlysÃ©e an unknown quantity, a former economy minister who had never run for elected office before. A protÃ©gÃ© of Socialist President FranÃ§ois Hollande, he swept away old political loyalties and, to many voters, that set him apart from the ruling class. He has had to navigate choppy political waters to push through controversial reforms. He made it easier for companies to fire workers, cut taxes and introduced tough security laws to tackle terrorism. But he was forced to scrap a proposed fuel tax in 2018 after weeks of unrest stoked by yellow-vest protesters, known asgilets jaunes. Other reforms, including a promise to bring the jobless rate down from more than 10% to 7% by 2022, were hit by the Covid pandemic, although unemployment is currently down to 7.4%. He is now proposing full employment within five years, cutting taxes by â¬15bn (Â£12.5bn) a year for households and businesses, and paying for his programme by gradually raising the retirement age from 62 to 65. Increasing the pension age is unpopular with voters already facing a cost of living crunch. His opponents have also accused him of relying on expensive advice from US consultancy firm McKinsey. He has had to rethink a controversial plan to make a back-to-work benefit for the unemployed called RSA conditional on 15-20 hours of work a week. Mr Macron also wants to invest in the armed forces, doubling France's reserve force. What are his chances? Mr Macron has long been favourite to win the vote, but opinion polls suggest his main rival, Marine Le Pen, has narrowed his lead and would give him a strong challenge in the 24 April run-off. His poll ratings were initially boosted by his diplomatic efforts during Russia's war in Ukraine, but voters are more exercised by increasing bills. Macron gets election boost from Putin's war Background: The meteoric rise of Macron Marine Le Pen was runner-up to Emmanuel Macron's in 2017 and this time, she is once again his closest rival. Her family has been synonymous with the far right in France for decades. She can no longer claim the hard-right vote to herself because of fierce rival Eric Zemmour. Although some of her team have defected to his camp, including her own niece, his more extreme views on Islam and immigration have made her approach appear more moderate. A political player in France for years, Marine Le Pen became a Euro MP before acting on her presidential ambitions. After her presidential defeat in 2017, she rebranded her National Front party asRassemblement National,or National Rally. She has since crafted a consistent anti-immigration, anti-EU message that has resonated with disaffected voters. She has in the past expressed her admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin and relied on a Russian bank loan for her 2017 presidential campaign. She condemns his invasion of Ukraine, while warning of the risk of sanctions to the French economy. Now 53, she has promised to halt abuse of the right to asylum, with a referendum on restricting immigration. And she wants to ban the Islamic hijab being worn in public areas. She also seeks to turn the European Union into an alliance of nations unchallenged by EU laws. Marine Le Pen wants to waive income tax for those under 30 and exempt companies from tax contributions if they raise minimum wages by 10% for many of their staff. What are her chances? This is her third bid for the presidency (she came third in the 2012 election). If she makes it to the run-off, as the polls suggest, Marine Le Pen could give Emmanuel Macron a real fight for the presidency. Who is Marine Le Pen? The strongest candidate on the left is veteran agitator Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, a staunch critic of Emmanuel Macron's economic policies and a prominent supporter of the yellow-vest protests. Though few believe he could go all the way to the presidency, he has led a strong campaign and sees himself as a ""shrewd tortoise"", overtaking some of the hares in the race. His outdoor rallies can attract upwards of 20,000 supporters. Mr MÃ©lenchon dropped a career in teaching and journalism for left-wing politics in the 1970s. He served briefly as junior education minister under Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin but - by the early 2000s - became disillusioned with the Socialist party's rightward drift. After setting up a new left-wing party, he became a Euro MP and is standing for the presidency for a third time under the banner ofLa France Insoumise- France Unbowed. In 2017, he attracted 19.6% of the vote. His programme is one of high spending and sweeping constitutional reform, to revive democratic life under a Sixth French Republic. He promises to lower the retirement by two years to 60, while Mr Macron aims to raise it, and he wants to raise the minimum wage, known as the Smic, by 10% to â¬1,400 (Â£1,175)  a month. His critics have accused him of being too lenient on President Putin - he wants France to be non-aligned and out of Nato. What are his chances? He is by far the strongest among an array of left-wing candidates, but his soft stance on the war in Ukraine could turn potential voters off. Divided French left fight doomed race of their own ""I am ready to be the first woman president of the Republic,"" said ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse on declaring her candidacy in July last year. When France's right-wingLes RÃ©publicains(Republicans) chose her to be their first-ever female presidential candidate, she climbed quickly in the polls, but her star has fallen since amid accusations of a shambolic campaign and defections in her party. Since 2015, she has served as the first female leader of the Ãle-de-France regional council, which covers Paris. She has described herself as ""one-third Margaret Thatcher and two-thirds Angela Merkel"". A speaker of four languages, including Russian, she entered politics as part of President Jacques Chirac's team, but made her political reputation as a higher education minister from 2007-11 under Nicolas Sarkozy. His refusal to back her campaign has also harmed her chances. Ms PÃ©cresse spearheaded reforms to higher education that were met with a wave of strikes. Considered pro-European and moderate, she has staked out some of Mr Macron's centrist territory, while taking a hard line on typically right-wing issues such as immigration, integration and Islam. She has been criticised for appearing to embrace an anti-Muslim conspiracy theory. Her campaign has accused the Macron camp of copying her policies on raising the retirement age and requiring people on income support to do 15 hours' training or work every week. Her main response to help voters fight inflation is a 10% increase in monthly salaries under â¬2,800, paid for by savings made through reforms as well as cuts in pension contributions. Part-Thatcher, part-Merkel and wants to run France What are her chances? Initially seen as the main obstacle to a Macron victory, ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse then struggled to find her voice and is fighting for fourth place in the polls. A speech to supporters early in the campaign was mocked as wooden and she has little hope of reaching the run-off. A journalist, author and TV commentator with no election experience and a conviction for inciting racial hatred would not typically be considered presidential material in French politics. But far-right challenger Ãric Zemmour, 63, has built a career on positioning himself against what he calls a ""politically correct consensus"" and now offers a ""reconquest"" -ReconquÃªte- of France. He burst on to the political scene in 2021 during a national tour to promote a book lamenting the perceived decline of France, which he mostly blames on immigration and Islam. Initially he surged in the polls, offering a nationalism seen as tougher than Marine Le Pen's. But he has since fallen back as his proposals have hardened. His plan for a ministry of re-immigration, to deport 100,000 immigrants each year, particularly to Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, has been condemned by Ms Le Pen as deeply unfair and ""anti-republican"". Mr Zemmour courted controversy for minimising the guilt of Philippe PÃ©tain, the head of France's collaborationist government, in the Nazi deportations of Jews in World War Two. And his record on Russia is embarrassing too: back in 2018 he said he was ""dreaming of having a French Putin"". He called for a ban on first names that he saw as un-French, telling one woman on live TV her parents had no right to call her Zina. He also wants dual-national repeat offenders to be stripped of French citizenship, as well as a ban on wearing the hijab in public. He has modelled his campaign on that of former US President Donald Trump and railed against political elites. He also has the dubious honour of being the first candidate in the race to get hit on the head by an egg. What are his chances? He has little chance of reaching the second round, as far-right voters see Marine Le Pen as a more viable candidate. Far-right journalist poses new threat to Macron A former Greenpeace militant and an MEP since 2009, Yannick Jadot was picked by the Greens via an online primary. He has accused Emmanuel Macron of presiding over five years of climate denial and wants France to ditch nuclear power within 20 years. He also wants solar panels installed on most buildings. Mr Macron has just backed plans for another six nuclear reactors to be built. As well as pushing for a big change in income tax, with additional levels for higher earners, Mr Jadot, 54, would like to see a â¬1,500 minimum wage, a citizen's income guaranteed for all over-18s and a â¬400 (Â£335) handout for families hit hardest by inflation. He has been vying with ex-Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo to be the champion of the mainstream left and could influence how leftist supporters vote in the presidential election. Fabien Roussel:The first Communist candidate for 15 years, his charismatic approach has had some success. Mr Roussel, 52, has called for France's big banks to be nationalised and for pay rises for public servants including nurses and teachers. He wants investment in renewable and nuclear energy and minimum wages to rise to â¬1,500 a month. Anne Hidalgo:Chosen as candidate for the Socialists, her struggle in getting voter support reflects the deep decline of a party that ran the country only five years ago, under President FranÃ§ois Hollande. She wants a big rise in the minimum wage, higher salaries for teachers and 15,000 new doctors. Nathalie Arthaud:A schoolteacher from outside Paris, she is now challenging for the presidency for a third time for the far-leftLutte OuvriÃ¨re(Workers' struggle) party, but has not yet attracted more than 1% of the vote. While opposed to Russia's ""monstrous"" invasion of Ukraine, she has little time for Nato either. Philippe Poutou:The former car factory worker is standing for the New Anti-Capitalist party and advocates redistribution of wealth. Jean Lassalle:Closer to the centre of French politics than other candidates but by no means a moderate, he came from a family of shepherds in the Pyrenees mountains to become France's youngest mayor in 1977. He once went on hunger strike to protest against a factory closure and later walked more than 6,000km (3,700 miles) around France to meet the people. As leader ofRÃ©sistons!(Resist), he has championed France's yellow-vest anti-Macron protesters by wearing agilet jaunein parliament and he has called for citizens' initiative referendums, renegotiating the EU treaties and pulling out of Nato. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan:A libertarian who left the mainstream right to found the Debout la France (France Arise) party, he has put freedom for France at the heart of his campaign - his third run for the presidency. He sees Emmanuel Macron as a ""public danger"" to France, opposes the EU and campaigned against Covid restrictions. He also wants wages to be increased and linked to inflation. He has in the past backed alliance with Russia and objects to sending weapons to Ukraine. Hard election lessons for French leadership rivals Who ran in 2017?

"Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murthy in 2009, after meeting her as a student in California A Whitehall inquiry is under way into how the tax affairs of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife were leaked to the media, the BBC has been told. Akshata Murtyhas said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income, following a row over her non-domicile status. She owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her father - from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. Labour has said the row raises questions about Mr Sunak's judgement. Sunak held US green card until last year Smearing my wife to get at me is awful, says Sunak Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? As a non-domiciled (non-dom) UK resident, Ms Murty is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. The BBC estimates this would have saved her Â£2.1m a year in UK tax. After details of her non-dom status appeared in the press on Wednesday evening, Mr Sunak said his wife had not ""done anything wrong"" and it was unfair to attack her as a ""private citizen"". But on Friday, Ms Murty announced she would change her tax arrangements, telling the BBC she did not want to be a ""distraction"" for her husband. Asked about the U-turn on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the couple had recognised the situation ""offended against a British sense of fair play"". ""They recognise that there was a disconnect perhaps in the British public's understanding of what was appropriate, and they've corrected that situation now for the future,"" he added. No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff leaked damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. Elsewhere,Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Sunday Times,externalhe had claimed non-domicile status for six years when he was a banker, between 2000 and 2006. Anon-domis someone who lives in the UK but declares their permanent home to be in another country. It has been a bruising week for the chancellor, leading to him asking senior civil servants for a full investigation to establish who divulged his wife's tax status. His allies say very few people had access to the personal information, which Mr Sunak declared to Whitehall officials when he became a minister in 2018. Some Conservative MPs say he was naive to think the details would remain private, and that he should have predicted that the tax arrangements would be criticised as inappropriate, despite being legal. Mr Sunak's team has dismissed suggestions of a rift with Downing Street and say the prime minister has been ""incredibly supportive"". But Mr Sunak's brand - vigorously promoted since he came to office - has been damaged, with some Tories questioning his judgement. Friends have also confirmed to the BBCreports in the Sunday Mirror,externalthat the chancellor's wife and daughters are moving out of Downing Street and back to the family home in west London. Mr Sunak will join them at weekends. The decision is said to have been made well before this row hit the headlines. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said there remained a ""series of questions"" for the chancellor to answer - including whether he had declared his wife's tax status when taking ""policy decisions"" affecting non-dom households. She told the Sunday Morning programme: ""The lack of transparency does raise questions about conflict of interest. ""But it's also about basic fairness - and I don't think the chancellor still gets that, and that raises real questions about his judgement. ""The fact that they have changed their tax arrangements now shows that they do recognise it's a problem - but they wouldn't have done that if this hadn't been public."" The Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". Labour has previously advocated scrapping non-dom status entirely, under previous leaders Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn. Asked whether her party still held that position, Ms Cooper said its policy on non-doms was subject to a wider review of tax policy being undertaken by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read morehere.

"Rishi Sunak has referred himself to Boris Johnson's ethics watchdog as he continues to face questions about his family's financial affairs. The chancellor wants Lord Geidt - the PM's adviser on ministers' interests - to check if he followed the rules. Mr Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, last week announced she would start paying UK tax on her overseas earnings. But Labour says he still has questions to answer about transparency and whether he has used tax havens. No 10 has confirmed the prime minister accepted Mr Sunak's request for a review by Lord Geidt. The spokeswoman also said Boris Johnson had full confidence in his chancellor. Mr Sunaksaid,externalhe was ""confident"" Lord Geidt - who alsoinvestigated allegations about Mr Johnson's refurbishmentof his Downing Street flat - would find he had appropriately declared all his interests. What we know about the Sunak familyâs wealth Sunak held US green card until last year Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? Ms Murty owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her father - from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. The BBC estimates she would have avoided Â£2.1m a year in UK tax through her non-domicile (non-dom) status. She will now pay tax on her overseas earnings, but her domicile remains India, where she has said she intends to eventually return. Mr Sunak said he had made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's non-dom status when he first became a government minister in 2018. He has ordereda leak inquiryinto how that information came to be reported in the media. Downing Street has rejected newspaper reports that its staff leaked damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. Rishi Sunak's reputation has gone from golden to tinfoil. His personal ratings have plummeted and his leader-in-waiting status has been dented, if not destroyed. But his job as chancellor looks safe for now. He has the backing of the prime minister so won't get fired. The number of Conservative backbenchers grumbling about his handling of this appears to be outweighed by the number of colleagues who think he's a good operator so they won't get rid of him. And the review into his declarations of interests isn't likely to cause him too many problems either. But all of that could change under pressure from the opposition, the media and any further revelations, or if he becomes a threat to the reputation of the government. What will be fascinating to see is whether this changes the approach Rishi Sunak takes to the rising cost of living. Will the chancellor accused of being too rich feel he has to do more to help people who are getting poorer? It feels like Rishi Sunak has gained a lifetime's-worth of baggage in a fortnight. Most politicians have it - what matters is how much it weighs them down. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said questions faced by Mr Sunak include whether he had declared his wife's tax status when taking ""policy decisions"" affecting non-dom households. ""The lack of transparency does raise questions about conflict of interest,"" she told BBC. ""The fact that they have changed their tax arrangements now shows that they do recognise it's a problem - but they wouldn't have done that if this hadn't been public."" It has also been revealed that Mr Sunak held a US green card until last year, entitling him to permanent residence, a path to citizenship, in that country. It also means he filed US tax returns, prompting opposition questions about whether he gained a financial advantage from this. Labour also says the public need to know if Mr Sunak has ever benefitted from tax havens. It follows a report inthe Independent,externalwhich said Ms Murty had received income from companies based in tax havens. Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murty in 2009, after meeting her as a student in California A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read morehere.

"Ronaldo appeared to knock a young fan's phone to the ground as he walked down the tunnel at Goodison Merseyside Police are investigating an alleged assault after Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to break a fan's phone. Footage was shared on social media alongside comments claiming he smashed the device as he left the pitch after his side's1-0 loss at Everton. Ronaldo, 37, later apologised on social media. Merseyside Police said they were investigating ""reports of an alleged assault"" at Goodison Park on Saturday. A spokesperson said they were liaising with both Manchester United and Everton. ""As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch,"" they added. ""Inquiries are under way and officers are currently working with Everton to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness enquiries to establish if an offence has taken place. ""Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police contact centre quoting reference number 228 of 9 April 2022."" Manchester United said they were aware of ""an alleged incident"" and would ""co-operate with any police inquiries"". The result damaged United's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League and came against an Everton side who had been one point above the relegation zone before kick-off.

"Opinion polls for both rounds put Marine Le Pen narrowly behind Mr Macron French voters are casting their ballots in the opening round of a presidential race that could become a cliffhanger. Emmanuel Macron has a fight on his hands from far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who has been galvanised by a slick election campaign. Forty-nine million people are eligible to decide which two of 12 candidates should take part in the run-off vote. But after four hours of voting, only a quarter of voters had turned out - the lowest for 20 years. The campaign has been overshadowed first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then Russia's invasion. The president has spent little time on the race, focusing instead on Europe's reaction to the war in Ukraine. However, one issue more than any other has predominated the election: the spiralling cost of living in energy bills and shopping baskets. When he came to power with a new party in 2017, Emmanuel Macron swept away the old allegiances, and the two big parties are still nursing their wounds. Socialist candidate Anne Hidalgo has struggled to be heard, while on the right ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse has failed to excite the Republicans. Now, the main challenge to Mr Macron, 44, is coming from Ms Le Pen on the far right and Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon on the far left. Some are even predicting the president could lose. Voting began at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) in mainland France and ends in the big cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille at 20:00 local time. What adds to the uncertainty is that days before the vote, one Ipsos opinion poll suggested 37% of people were still undecided. ""The campaign's been going on for two months and there hasn't been much debate,"" complains Ourdia, a cafÃ© owner in north-west Paris. ""I still don't know who to vote for."" The old tribal tradition of voting either for the left or right has gone. One market trader in Paris said he was yet to decide whether to vote for Marine Le Pen, 53, or 70-year-old Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. Parisian voter ChloÃ© said her biggest fear was that voters would choose to stay at home After voting at a Paris polling station, ChloÃ© told the BBC the candidates had spent too much time focusing on international affairs, but now was not the time: ""They're not talking about the biggest subjects for us and our everyday lives."" Malika said she was voting for Eric Zemmour on the far right because ""I want to vote for France, not party politics"". Andy said he was worried Marine Le Pen would win but he was not a fan of Emmanuel Macron either: ""So many crises have happened, and for me as a student there's been a lot of reform that's not good for us."" Andy is unhappy with Mr Macron's handling of yellow-vest protests and Covid-19 For many voters, there is no longer a stigma about voting for the far right. Philippe Bridou, a former Socialist voter in south-western city of Perpignan, told the BBC he had switched to the far right because ""security is important, immigration is important too because it's a subject now - and the left wing doesn't discuss it"". After she was trounced by Mr Macron in 2017, Ms Le Pen rebranded her National Front as National Rally, even if many of her policies have hardly changed. She has also come across as more moderate than far-right rival candidate Eric Zemmour. ""The election race isn't over at all,"" said Brice Teinturier of polling institute Ipsos. Turnout is key because the pollsters suggest as many as 28% of voters may not show - a level not seen for 20 years - and the least likely to bother are 25-34 year-olds. By midday turnout was three points down on five years ago, at 25.48%, but far higher than in 2002. Then there are the so-calledvotes blancs- the ballots left blank as a protest. Tactical voting may also play a part, if voters decide to back one of the favourites because they have more of a chance of winning than, for example, Greens candidate Yannick Jadot. The French economy is in decent shape and unemployment has fallen to 7.4%, but voters are not feeling the benefit. That's because prices are going up across the board, at the shops, the market, the petrol pump and in domestic energy bills. The phrase you hear everywhere ispouvoir d'achat- which translates as spending power but is better known in English as the cost of living. Market-seller Thierry has seen a dramatic increase in prices Thierry, who lives outside Paris and runs a shoe stall, says prices have gone through the roof. ""The cost of shoes has gone up by 20% to 30% and all the taxes have gone up too,"" he points out. That is why many of the candidates are promising to boost the minimum wage, in some cases by hundreds of euros. It's due to go up at the start of May to about â¬1,300 (Â£1,100; $1,430) a month after tax. CANDIDATES:Who's in the race? TIGHT RACE:Far-right Le Pen closes in on Macron SIMPLE GUIDE:How it works For Marine Le Pen, the spending crunch is also a big opportunity. She has spent less time talking about nationalism and focused more on low wages, saying she'll waive income tax for under-30s. But she still wants a referendum on restricting immigration, she wants to ban the Islamic hijab in public areas and wants radical change to the European Union. She has distanced herself from Russia's Vladimir Putin, even though she went to see him in 2017, used to admire him and her party is still paying back a Russian loan. By contrast, voters have been unimpressed with revelations that the Macron government has spent increasing amounts of taxpayers' money on consultants such as US firm McKinsey. ""People are a bit disgusted who gets the money,"" said Thierry. Mr Macron entered the campaign late, with a rousing rally eight days before the vote. While his adversaries were criss-crossing France, he was focusing on diplomacy in Russia's war in Ukraine. He only got going on his main adversary shortly before campaigning ended, condemning her policies as racist and ""very brutal"". The first round will only decide the top two candidates, but already the race is tight.

"The war in Ukraine could be ended if western countries stopped buying Russian oil and gas, says President Putin's former chief economic adviser A ""real embargo"" on Russian energy by Western countries could stop war in Ukraine, President Putin's former chief economic adviser has suggested. Dr Andrei Illarionov said Russia ""did not take seriously"" other countries' threats to reduce their energy usage. Despitetrying to reduceits reliance on Russian sources, Europe is continuing tobuy oil and gas. Last year, soaring prices meant oil and gas revenues accounted for 36% of Russia's government spending. Much of that income comes from the European Union, which imports about 40% of its gas and 27% of its oil from Russia. This week, its top diplomat Josep Borrell said ""a billion [euros] is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he supplies us"". EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas West hits Russia with oil bans and gas curbs Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Dr Illarionov said if Western countries ""would try to implement a real embargo on oil and gas exports from Russia... I would bet that probably within a month or two, Russian military operations in Ukraine, probably will be ceased, will be stopped"". ""It's one of the very effective instruments still in the possession of the Western countries,"" he added. Dr Andrei Illarionov, President Putin's chief economic adviser from 2000 to 2005, says a total energy embargo would be ""very effective"". While the oil and gas trade has continued during the conflict, widespread sanctions mean that a lot of other economic activity has stopped,many foreign companies have pulled outand exports have been disrupted. One recent survey by Russia's own central bank even forecasts the economy will shrink by 8% this year, while the International Institute of Finance says it could fall by as much as 15%. Dr Illarionov suggested that President Putin was prepared to endure a hit to the economy that shows where his priorities lie. ""His territorial ambitions, his imperial ambitions, are much more important than anything else, including the livelihood of the Russian population and of the financial situation in the country... even the financial state of the his government,"" he said. Prices are rising for many food items in Russia as the country feels the impact of international sanctions. Last week, amid tensions with Europe over how gas would be paid for, President Putin said that ""key indicators"" of the health of the Russian economy include the ""creation of jobs, the reduction of poverty and inequality, the improvement of the quality of life of people, the availability of goods and services"". World Bank figures suggest that almost 20 million Russians live in poverty. President Putin has, in recent years, pledged to halve that number. Now Dr Illarionov said ""we'll see probably doubling the number of those people, maybe even tripling"" as the economy struggles. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on...Russian gas and oil The Moscow-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic Research,estimated two million jobs,externalcould be lost this year as the unemployment rate rises from a record low. Those concerns are shared by Vladimir Milov, who is a former Russian deputy energy minister, but is now part ofAlexei Navalny'sRussia of the Future opposition party. ""Many people are concerned about losing their jobs, I think it's just that the majority does not really realise the severity of the economic situation,"" he said. Inflation, which has already risen to 15.7% because of the war, means people might stop spending money on things such as gyms and meals in restaurants and ""that's bad news for a lot of small businesses"", said Mr Milov. Some basic food items such as sugar, onions and cabbages have risen in price by more than 40% since the start of this year. Mr Milov said any noticeable falls in living standards would help his party's cause as an opposition. ""We have been explaining to people all along [that] Putin's policy would lead Russia into a catastrophe, including a complete social and economic catastrophe, including [a] deterioration of living standards that we haven't seen in decades,"" he said. ""I have to say that comes at an extremely high price. We would prefer not to see what is happening today."" Will Russia be able to pay its debts? Canada pledges to help states stop using Russian oil Ukraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank However Mr Milov, who fled to Lithuania last year, thinks it will take time for falling living standards to translate to political change. ""Russia is a country with big inertia in society, and a lot of fear instigated by the authorities. Specifically people really are very much afraid of protesting because right now they can end up in jail for a long, long time for doing that"". He added: ""But I would say [that within a] few months [of] real deep economic trouble, that we haven't seen in 30 years, it will change the mood of the society. More people will start to speak out loudly."" Dr Andrei Illarionov is seen here watching President Putin give a speech in 2004. President Putin's former adviser Dr Andrei Illarionov, who now lives in the United States, said a change of government is inevitable ""sooner or later"". He said ""it is absolutely impossible to have any positive future for Russia, with the current political regime"". Under President Putin, he suggested, ""there is no way that country might be integrated back into the international relations, in the world economy"".

"Firm projections suggest Emmanuel Macron will face a run-off against Marine Le Pen in the second round of France's presidential election Macron has come in first place with 28.4% of the vote while far-right leader Le Pen received 23.4%, according to national broadcaster France TÃ©lÃ©visions Left-wing leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon comes in third place with about 20% of the votes Macron, a centrist, has been addressing supporters in Paris. Le Pen earlier vowed to put France ""in order"" Macron is vying to become the first French president to be re-elected in 20 years but faces a strong challenge from Le Pen Turnout was down compared to the last presidential election in 2017 Edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Our live coverage of the first round of France's presidential election is ending. The two candidates expected to go through - Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen - have done just that. The race now enters a new phase and some polls suggest the second round result could be very tight. You can readthe full story of today's vote here. We will be back in two weeks' time, on Sunday 24 April, to report on what happens next as French voters return to the polls. Today's live page writers were Paul Kirby, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, George Wright and Alexandra FouchÃ©. The page was edited by Tom Spender. Jessica ParkerReporting from Macron's HQ The cheers were loud. The
flag waving full of enthusiasm. The room was relieved. But while their man may
have managed a bigger lead than many expected given recent polls, Marine Le
Penâs campaign has still given them a scare. Nothing is decided, insisted Emmanuel
Macron tonight. Itâs the exactly the kind of message youâd expect from an
incumbent whoâs ahead; desperate to avoid complacency or any sense that victory
is secure. And of course, with a fortnight to run, it isnât. They say a week is
a long time in politics. Try two. Anna HolliganReporting from Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon's campaign HQ ""We are here, we are hereâ¦ââ The chants resounded inside
the circus that's been transformed into Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchonâs HQ. The oldest candidate, whose messages of social justice
and climate consciousness resonated the most with young voters, was on
typically fiery form. Addressing supporters from the stage, he compelled them
not give a single vote to his far-right rival Marine Le Pen, but stopped short
of suggesting they lend their loyalty to Emmanuel Macron. He said his defeat meant France was now faced with a
choice between two evils. Some pollsters say MÃ©lenchon was the favourite candidate
among the 18-24 demographic with approximately 34% of young people who turned
out investing their faith in him. Who wins the battle for these young Melenchon voters
could prove pivotal in determining who enters the ElysÃ©e. According to some projections, the gap between Le Pen and MÃ©lenchon may be narrowing, with the far-right leader only 0.8 points ahead of her far-left rival in some cases. ""The two qualified are indeed Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, but Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon is very close, and the gap has narrowed,"" says Brice Teinturier, director of the Ipsos-Sopra Steria polling firm. There's no suggestion that the result will change as a result or that the MÃ©lenchon camp is calling for anything specific in view of the figures. Official results are due to be published overnight at around 01:00 local time (midnight BST). Nick BeakeAt Le Pen HQ Marine Le Pen arrived on stage earlier this evening and called on all those who didnât vote for her or Macron to join her campaign. She said she would be president for all of France - a country she said should be making its
own decisions. Cue huge applause and chants of âPresident, Presidentâ. Champagne and singing soon followed the exit polls here at Le Pen HQ. Among the
smartly-dressed party officials there was initial joy at her highest first-round showing, although some were hoping it would higher. Now that the obligatory
selfies  have been taken, party officials will look to maintain their momentum and prepare for two weeks ahead. This video can not be played French election: We can create a sovereign France - Marine Le Pen The far-right leader calls on those who did not vote for Macron to back her in the second round. Both candidates are now competing for the votes of the 10 candidates who did not make it through to the second round in two weeks. If you're just joining or if you need a recap on events, here is a summary of the latest developments: Round one results:Emmanuel Macron is set to face the far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a run-off for the French presidency after the two came top in the first round. Macron secured about 28% of the vote compared with about 23% for Le Pen, vote projections suggest Speeches:The candidates took turns to thank their supporters at their respective campaign HQs.

One pollster has predicted 51% for Macron and 49% for Le Pen. In 2017, he won with 66.1% of the votes Still pivotal:Far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon may have come third with about 20% of the vote, but his supporters could still play an important role in deciding the final winner This video can not be played Macron called on the supporters of his defeated presidential election rivals to back him in a run-off contest against Marine Le Pen. Pledging to unify France, he said he would reflect ""all the different convictions and beliefs"" if he beats his far-right rival on 24 April. Hugh SchofieldReporting from Paris It is to be a re-run of the 2017 second round, where Emmanuel Macron pulverised Marine Le Pen. But this time around, let no-one be under any illusion that it will be so easy. Estimations from round one show how tactical voting rewrote the electoral map. Voters gathered into three broad camps: Macron, the far-right and the far-left. In the last days of campaigning, many people who were considering other candidates finally decided that they would rather back a frontrunner. There was thus a big transfer of votes from Zemmour - the hard-right nationalist pundit - to the camp of Le Pen. Some right-wingers in the conservative Republicans party may have done the same. On the left, voters decided that neither the Socialist Hidalgo nor the Green Jadot could ever make it into round two. So they shifted massively to MÃ©lenchon, simply to keep a leftist in the race. This despite many Socialists and Greens actively disliking the man. And in the centre, many who would normally have chosen the Republicans' PÃ©cresse will have plumped instead for the incumbent. Why? Because they were genuinely afraid that Le Pen and/or MÃ©lenchon were coming up too strong from behind. But what this also shows is that the so-called ""irresponsible"" forces of the extremes - Macron's opposition - are all the time getting stronger. Read more of Hugh's analysis of the results here ""Beaver voters"" are those who traditionally vote in favour of a candidate in order to ""create a barrage against the extreme right"", the BBC's Helene Daouphars explains. Macron has urged them to build their dam and prevent Le Pen from taking the presidency - so have all the other candidates apart from Zemmour. But will they? Our correspondent says things might not be so straightforward this time around. ""People are not so ready any more to always vote against the extreme right and they are fed up with this situation we end up with,"" Daouphars says. Macron will need to be ""more convincing to rural France"", she adds. He goes on to address the cost of living - a major campaign theme of his second-round opponent Le Pen. The only way to address this, he insists, is by moving forward with his party's political programme. ""The debate that we are going to have over the next fortnight will be decisive for our country and Europe,"" he tells his supporters at his campaign headquarters, urging them to ""spare no effort"" to win over voters to his side. He adds: ""I believe in us all, regardless of origins, beliefs."" He ends his short address to his supporters by saying: ""I am counting on you. Nothing is decided. [Let's move] forward."" Macron takes to the stage greeted by supporters chanting ""and one and two and five more [years]"" and ""Macron President"". He thanked those who voted for him, as well as the candidates who stood against him, and those who asked for their supporters to back him. He asks French voters to vote for him to block the far right from taking power. ""I invite all including those who did not vote for me in the first round to rally behind us."" He says he hopes to convince those who did not vote or who voted for extreme candidates. Nothing has been decided yet, he says. ""Pandering to populism and xenophobia - that's not France,"" he says. Macron has arrived at his campaign HQ and has taken to the stage, ready to address supporters. He may have won the first round by as much as five points, but this opinion poll that's been broadcast by one of two big TV networks shows this race is not over. That's why Macron and Le Pen will now have to fight for every vote. James ShieldsHonorary Professor in French Studies, University of Warwick Emmanuel Macron
has won this first round with 28% - but as an embattled incumbent, no longer the
candidate of hope and change. He is well placed in the centre to build a
winning majority; but how far will leftist voters
disappointed with the rightward bias of Macronâs first term rally this time to
see him over the line? Far-right
candidates have secured their highest ever first-round aggregate (33%), leaving
Macronâs promise to reduce the far right ringing hollow. Marine Le Pen (23%)
has raised her first-round score from 21% in 2017. How far can she raise her
then second-round score (34%), and where will her wider reserves of support
lie? The traditional
parties of government have suffered a historic, humiliating defeat (Socialists
2%; Republicans 5%). Both are in existential crisis. Will these once hegemonic
parties perish or can they find redemption in the June parliamentary elections? At 26%, abstention
was close to a presidential record. Following record abstention across all
mid-term elections, this confirms a disengagement within French politics that
has worsened under Macronâs presidency. How will abstention impact the second
round and, if high, could it raise questions over democratic legitimacy by
depriving the winner of a strong mandate? Macron supporters are waiting for the president to speak Our colleagues at Macron's HQ in Paris have been speaking to some of the president's supporters ahead of his much-awaited speech. ""Every other candidate who lost tonight should call for a Macron vote,"" said one woman. ""It's only common sense, we can't be ruled by the extreme in our country, it'd be catastrophic."" Another young woman defended the president for launching his campaign late, because she said it was important he had focused on diplomacy over the war in Ukraine. ""He has heavy responsibilities and that's what he prioritised: being a president until the last moment, and I think it's a wise decision,"" she said. French far-right candidate Eric Zemmour has now, as expected, urged his supporters to vote for far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the second round of the presidential election. He said however that his party would continue to fight for its ideas, saying its position was unique and not represented elsewhere. If electorally nothing changes, politically everything has changed because we arrived.  Paul KirbyReporting from Paris We now know who will go into the second round - but the question for voters who didn't back either Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen is which of the two will they support on 24 April. Marine Le Pen has already called on all French voters to join her. Republicans candidate ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse has already thrown her weight behind the incumbent president, although she has a paltry 5% of the vote. Greens candidate Eric Jadot has backed Macron too. You would expect Eric Zemmour's supporters to choose fellow far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, but he only secured marginally greater support than PÃ©cresse with around 7%. But the big question is where will the supporters of far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon take their votes? He has polled around 20% of the vote and he told his supporters three times: ""You must not give a single vote to Marine Le Pen."" He's not backing Macron, and many of his supporters may choose not to vote at all. MÃ©lenchon didn't use the word abstain but he didn't have to. It all goes to show that this race isn't over just yet. Far left-winger Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon has now joined the other candidates - apart from Zemmour - in urging supporters not to vote for Le Pen in the second round to keep the far right out of power. Speaking to supporters after coming third in the vote, he said the results do not correctly reflect the exasperation of people  around France. He admitted disappointment but vowed to keep up his political struggle. To cheers he told supporters: ""There must not be one single vote for Le Pen in the second round."" Marine Le Pen has in turn been speaking, calling for those who hadn't voted Macron to vote for her in the second round. She said she would be the ""president of all French people"" if elected in the second round and touched on all the familiar themes she campaigned on ahead of the polls, including reasserting French values, controlling immigration and ensuring security for all. To the sounds of her supporters chanting ""we're going to win"", she vowed to ""put France in order within five years"".  ""I intend without waiting to sew back up the tears that a torn-apart France suffers from which now power has been able to do until now.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Woman surveys wreckage of Bucha near Kyiv Nato ministers have been meeting in Brussels this past week to discuss how far they should go in providing military equipment to Ukraine. The challenge for Nato throughout this war has been how to give its ally Ukraine enough military support to defend itself without getting drawn into the conflict and finding itself at war with Russia. The Ukrainian government has been explicit in its calls for help. If it is to have any chance of fending off the coming Russian assault on the Donbas region in the east of the country, it says, then it urgently needs a resupply of the West's Javelin, NLAW (next-generation light anti-tank weapon), Stinger and Starstreak anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles that its forces have already been using to such effect in this war. That much is coming. But Ukraine wants more. It wants tanks, warplanes, drones and advanced missile air defence systems to counter Russia's increasing use of air strikes and long-range missiles that are steadily depleting Ukraine's strategic stores of fuel and other essentials. What weapons will US give Ukraine? Has Putin's plan failed? Watch on BBC iPlayer So what exactly, many people may ask, is holding Nato back? The answer is escalation. The risk of Russia resorting to using tactical (ie short range) nuclear weapons or of the conflict spreading beyond Ukraine's borders into a wider European war is constantly in the backs of western leaders' minds and here the stakes are dangerously high. over 30 countries have provided military aid to Ukraine including â¬1bn (Â£800m) from EU and $1.7bn (Â£1.3bn) from US supplies so far limited to arms, ammunition, and defensive equipment like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems they includeJavelinswhich are shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets andStingerswhich are man-portable anti-aircraft weapons most famously used in Afghanistan against Soviet aircraft theStarstreakis a UK-made portable air defence system Nato members fear supplying heavier offensive equipment like tanks and fighter jets could lead to direct open conflict with Russia That hasn't prevented the Czechs from givingT72 tanks President Putin reminded the world early on in this war that Russia is a nuclear weapons power and that he was moving its strategic nuclear deterrent up to a higher degree of readiness. The US did not follow suit as it detected no movement of Russian nuclear warheads out of their secure storage bunkers. But Putin's point was made. He was effectively saying: ""Russia has a massive nuclear arsenal so don't think you can push us around."" Russian military doctrine allows for the early use of low-yield, tactical nuclear warheads on the battlefield, knowing that the West has an abhorrence for nuclear weapons that have not been used in anger for 77 years. Nato strategic planners worry that once the nuclear taboo is broken, even if the damage is limited to a localised target on the Ukrainian battlefield, then the risk of escalation to a catastrophic nuclear exchange between Russia and the West inevitably goes up a notch.  $800min new military assistance, including... 800Stinger anti-aircraft systems that can shoot down planes 2,000Javelins, shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets 6,000AT-4 anti-armor systems, a Swedish-produced, single-use, unguided anti-tank weapon And yet, with every atrocity apparently committed by Russian soldiers, Nato's resolve stiffens and its inhibitions melt away. The Czech Republic has already sent tanks, admittedly outdated Soviet-era T72s, but they are the first Nato country to do so. Slovakia is sending its S300 air defence missile systems. Both such moves would have seemed improbably risky when this war began. Tobias Ellwood MP, who chairs Parliament's Defence Committee, is one of those who believes Putin is bluffing when he raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and that Nato should be doing more. 'We have been over-cautious in the weapons systems we have been willing to provide,"" he says. ""We need a more robust attitude. We're giving the Ukrainians enough to survive but not to win and that must change."" So how exactly could this Russia-Ukraine war escalate into a wider pan-European conflict that drags in Nato? There are a number of potential scenarios which will doubtless be occupying minds in Western defence ministries. Here are just three of them: 1.A Nato-supplied anti-ship missile fired by Ukrainian forces in Odesa hits and sinks a Russian warship offshore in the Black Sea with the loss of nearly 100 sailors and dozens of marines. A death toll of this magnitude in a single strike would be unprecedented and Putin would be under pressure to respond in some form. 2.A Russian strategic missile strike targets a supply convoy of military hardware crossing from a Nato country, like Poland or Slovakia, into Ukraine. If casualties were sustained on Nato's side of the border that could potentially trigger Article 5 of Nato's constitution, bringing the entire alliance to the defence of the country attacked. 3.Amidst fierce fighting in the Donbas an explosion occurs at an industrial facility resulting in the release of toxic chemical gases. While this has already occurred, there were no deaths reported. But were it to result in the sort of mass casualties seen in Syria's use of poison gas at Ghouta and if it were found to have been deliberately caused by Russian forces, then Nato would be obliged to respond. It is perfectly possible that none of these scenarios will materialise. But while Western nations have displayed a rare degree of unity in the strength of their reaction to Russia's invasion, there are suggestions that they are being merely reactive and not thinking through what the endgame should be. This video can not be played This video, shared by Ukrainian armed forces, shows a Russian helicopter being shot down by a missile ""The bigger strategic question,"" says one of Britain's most experienced military officers who asks not to be named, ""is whether our government is engaged in crisis management or actual strategy."" That would require thinking this through to the finish, he adds. ""What we are trying to achieve here is to give Ukraine every bit of help we can, short of World War Three. The problem is, Putin is a better poker player than we are."" Tobias Ellwood MP agrees. ""Russia does this [the threat of escalation] very effectively. And we are spooked. We have lost the ability to control the escalatory ladder.""

"There have been urgent calls for investigations into allegations of war crimes in previously Russian-held areas of Ukraine after shocking footage of murdered civilians. But there are wider questions over whether widespread Russian attacks on civilian targets amount to war crimes. We've been looking at a series of attacks in one city - Chernihiv - to see whether they are consistent with Russian tactics across Ukraine and reveal something of their strategy. The following report contains some graphic details. ""They were shooting at us with everything they had,"" says Diana, 20. Within minutes of encountering the Russian tank, half her family would be dead. Diana, her mother Irina, her partner Sasha and his little brother Maxim were fleeing Chernihiv on 9 March after weeks of shelling. They had one simple aim - to reach safety in the west of the country, where relatives were waiting for them. But within minutes of leaving the city heading south they were plunged into danger. As their Volkswagen Golf passed the village of Kolychivka, Sasha saw Russian tanks ahead. One fired at them immediately. He put his foot down, hoping to accelerate through the danger zone - and then the car stalled. Sasha, Diana and Maxim, and Diana with her mother Irina The firing continued, and Sasha shouted for them get out - but 15-year-old Maxim had already been hit. There was a hole in his chest and blood coming from his mouth. Diana, Sasha and Irina crawled into bushes - but soldiers were approaching, shouting to each other, asking where the family were hiding. Bullets cracked towards them. Diana's foot was seriously injured. Sasha tried to bandage it, but then as he turned to help Irina, the horror worsened. ""Irina opened her jacket and we realised that there was nothing to bandage,"" Diana told BBC News. ""A part of her abdomen and intestines had been shot through."" They heard more shooting and Diana turned to Sasha believing these were their final minutes. ""We had time to say that we loved each other,"" she said. ""I asked Sasha, 'Are we going to die here?' He said, 'Probably'. ""My mum crawled with us a little more. I kept turning and saying, 'Mum, crawl, please, please'. She said, 'Yes, yes'. And then she [lay] down on the ground. She died there."" Diana kept crawling, following Sasha as he broke a path for her through the thicket. They went past a burning field and through the forest. Diana and Sasha survived and she made it to a hospital. She has lost four toes from her left foot. Diana has no doubt the attackers were Russian because of their accents, uniforms and the Z symbol daubed on one of the tanks. The BBC's verification team has found no evidence of any legitimate military targets near the site of the attack. Attacks on civilians in cars elsewhere Regional authorities say at least 25 civilians, including six children, have been killed in attacks on cars trying to flee Chernihiv, or attacked in public places, since the start of the conflict Footage filmed by a Ukrainian drone in the Kyiv regionshowed the killing of a man who had raised his armsin the air as he got out of a car. His wife was shot dead inside the vehicle In the Kherson region of southern Ukraine a family of five waskilled by Russian soldiers at a checkpoint, according to relatives Water is the most basic of human necessities and there is evidence of deliberate Russian targeting of the supply in Chernihiv. A pumping station on the outskirts of the city was hit on 14 March. The attack badly damaged a water reservoir and destroyed a control room, according to the head of the water company in Chernihiv, Serhiy Malyavko, who said a worker at the plant - along with three family members - were killed. The family was sheltering there after their home was destroyed by shelling. Satellite imagery shows the damage to the plant, located by Twitter user @obretix in a forested area far away from other buildings. Photos released by the water companyshowed a severely damaged treatment tank,externalwith small craters in the ground. Damage that looks like shrapnel holes pepper the buildings. The sequence of craters visible in a satellite image suggests ground-launched strikes, says Wim Zwijnenburg, an arms researcher at Pax, a Dutch peace organisation. ""The shrapnel impact and blast direction seem to indicate the missiles were fired from the west of the water facility, [which] corresponds with the presence of Russian troop movements located to the west, according to public data on their locations."" Without access to the site itself, the experts we've spoken to say it's not possible to be precise about the weapons used. Rather than missiles, the damage may have been caused by heavy guns or mortars. The Chernihiv Water Company released pictures of other sites that had been attacked The head of the water company says the site was struck three days in a row. ""There was no military target. I'm 100% sure that the Russian troops have been destroying the city's infrastructure so that there would be no gas, no electricity or water supply in the city,"" Mr Malyavko told BBC News. He said two other facilities elsewhere were also destroyed, cutting off water to most of the city's population. The rules of war ban premeditated attacks on targets indispensable to civilian life, such as water supplies. ""This has been done to make the population panic,"" says Mr Malyavko. ""And Russia is probably hoping that if there's a humanitarian catastrophe, the local authorities will agree to start negotiations - and that the city will surrender."" Attacks on water elsewhere Mariupol City Council says Russian forces intentionally targeted pumping stations and the main water pipeline from a reservoir there The Ukrainian government has reported severe damage to several other water utilities and waste-treatment plants across the country It was the morning of 16 March, and Ukrainian journalist Alina Klimenko received news of a much-needed bread delivery to the city. Her father, Vitalii, dashed to join the queue. But after a short while he moved away as a nearby house came under fire. Others, now used to the sound of shelling in the city, stayed. And then the queue itself was hit. Alina ran out to film the aftermath. Her footage showed bodies on the ground and an ambulance racing to the scene. At least 14 civilians died, according to Ukrainian authorities. We have confirmed the authenticity of Alina's video and located it to a residential area in the city. Alina's father, who has a military background, says the incoming fire was from the north-east, consistent with the attack being launched by Russian units operating several kilometres to the north of Chernihiv, according to the mapping team at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Weapons expert Mark Cancian looked at the BBC's research. He said the damage was consistent with the impact of a missile with a range of up to 30km (19 miles). A satellite image from 16 March shows Russian forces with this kind of weaponry 14km north-east of the city. The US Embassy in Kyiv initially wrongly reported that Russian forces in the city had shot dead the civilians. This was quickly denied by Moscow who said no Russian troops were present in the city. But the Russians went further, saying the event had either been staged, or that those killed were victims of ""Ukrainian nationalists"". There have been numerous examples of this type of denial from the Russian government. Russian denial of responsibility elsewhere Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew. Satellite images contradicted this andthe BBC debunked various other claimsmade by Russian officials The Russian embassy in London falsely claimed that the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol in March was staged.The BBC found evidence to disprove their claims An estimated 300 people were killed in an attack on a theatre sheltering civilians in  Mariupol. Russia has denied carrying out the attack, which has been widely condemned A critical factor in any prosecution for war crimes is obtaining clear evidence of a deliberate intent to target civilians. Images and eye-witness statements can be the starting point, says Prof Alex Whiting, a former investigations co-ordinator at the International Criminal Court. But investigators would then need to tackle a series of basic questions: Is there any way these targets could have been perceived to be military? Were there any military targets in the area? Could the targeting have been based on faulty intelligence or even down to a weapons mistake? A hotel and a football stadium in Chernihiv were hit Throughout the conflict, the Ukrainian intelligence services have been releasing allegedly intercepted communications between Russian forces. In one, a man with a Russian accent can be heard being ordered to shoot at a civilian car. The authenticity of these conversations has not been verified by the BBC. But by building a picture of consistent patterns of behaviour, the case for prosecution becomes stronger. Sareta Ashraph, an expert in human-rights law, says investigators would be looking to establish these patterns of behaviour across the country - whether water facilities, hospitals or supermarkets had been regularly hit - in order to build up a picture of military strategy. ""This can show evidence of deliberate targeting, where the intent to bring the civilian population to its knees becomes much clearer,"" she says. As the war continues, Ms Ashraph says she's reminded of Russian tactics in previous conflicts. ""I would say that Russia's actions in Ukraine contain some quite dark echoes of actions in Syria,"" she said. We contacted the Russian defence ministry about all of the cases documented in this article. We have not yet received a response.

"Firm projections suggest Emmanuel Macron will face a run-off against Marine Le Pen in the second round of France's presidential election Macron has come in first place with 28.4% of the vote while far-right leader Le Pen received 23.4%, according to national broadcaster France TÃ©lÃ©visions Left-wing leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon comes in third place with about 20% of the votes Macron, a centrist, has been addressing supporters in Paris. Le Pen earlier vowed to put France ""in order"" Macron is vying to become the first French president to be re-elected in 20 years but faces a strong challenge from Le Pen Turnout was down compared to the last presidential election in 2017 Edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Our live coverage of the first round of France's presidential election is ending. The two candidates expected to go through - Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen - have done just that. The race now enters a new phase and some polls suggest the second round result could be very tight. You can readthe full story of today's vote here. We will be back in two weeks' time, on Sunday 24 April, to report on what happens next as French voters return to the polls. Today's live page writers were Paul Kirby, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, George Wright and Alexandra FouchÃ©. The page was edited by Tom Spender. Jessica ParkerReporting from Macron's HQ The cheers were loud. The
flag waving full of enthusiasm. The room was relieved. But while their man may
have managed a bigger lead than many expected given recent polls, Marine Le
Penâs campaign has still given them a scare. Nothing is decided, insisted Emmanuel
Macron tonight. Itâs the exactly the kind of message youâd expect from an
incumbent whoâs ahead; desperate to avoid complacency or any sense that victory
is secure. And of course, with a fortnight to run, it isnât. They say a week is
a long time in politics. Try two. Anna HolliganReporting from Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon's campaign HQ ""We are here, we are hereâ¦ââ The chants resounded inside
the circus that's been transformed into Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchonâs HQ. The oldest candidate, whose messages of social justice
and climate consciousness resonated the most with young voters, was on
typically fiery form. Addressing supporters from the stage, he compelled them
not give a single vote to his far-right rival Marine Le Pen, but stopped short
of suggesting they lend their loyalty to Emmanuel Macron. He said his defeat meant France was now faced with a
choice between two evils. Some pollsters say MÃ©lenchon was the favourite candidate
among the 18-24 demographic with approximately 34% of young people who turned
out investing their faith in him. Who wins the battle for these young Melenchon voters
could prove pivotal in determining who enters the ElysÃ©e. According to some projections, the gap between Le Pen and MÃ©lenchon may be narrowing, with the far-right leader only 0.8 points ahead of her far-left rival in some cases. ""The two qualified are indeed Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, but Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon is very close, and the gap has narrowed,"" says Brice Teinturier, director of the Ipsos-Sopra Steria polling firm. There's no suggestion that the result will change as a result or that the MÃ©lenchon camp is calling for anything specific in view of the figures. Official results are due to be published overnight at around 01:00 local time (midnight BST). Nick BeakeAt Le Pen HQ Marine Le Pen arrived on stage earlier this evening and called on all those who didnât vote for her or Macron to join her campaign. She said she would be president for all of France - a country she said should be making its
own decisions. Cue huge applause and chants of âPresident, Presidentâ. Champagne and singing soon followed the exit polls here at Le Pen HQ. Among the
smartly-dressed party officials there was initial joy at her highest first-round showing, although some were hoping it would higher. Now that the obligatory
selfies  have been taken, party officials will look to maintain their momentum and prepare for two weeks ahead. This video can not be played French election: We can create a sovereign France - Marine Le Pen The far-right leader calls on those who did not vote for Macron to back her in the second round.

If you're just joining or if you need a recap on events, here is a summary of the latest developments: Round one results:Emmanuel Macron is set to face the far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a run-off for the French presidency after the two came top in the first round.

Macron has urged them to build their dam and prevent Le Pen from taking the presidency - so have all the other candidates apart from Zemmour. But will they? Our correspondent says things might not be so straightforward this time around. ""People are not so ready any more to always vote against the extreme right and they are fed up with this situation we end up with,"" Daouphars says. Macron will need to be ""more convincing to rural France"", she adds. He goes on to address the cost of living - a major campaign theme of his second-round opponent Le Pen. The only way to address this, he insists, is by moving forward with his party's political programme. ""The debate that we are going to have over the next fortnight will be decisive for our country and Europe,"" he tells his supporters at his campaign headquarters, urging them to ""spare no effort"" to win over voters to his side. He adds: ""I believe in us all, regardless of origins, beliefs."" He ends his short address to his supporters by saying: ""I am counting on you. Nothing is decided. [Let's move] forward."" Macron takes to the stage greeted by supporters chanting ""and one and two and five more [years]"" and ""Macron President"". He thanked those who voted for him, as well as the candidates who stood against him, and those who asked for their supporters to back him. He asks French voters to vote for him to block the far right from taking power. ""I invite all including those who did not vote for me in the first round to rally behind us."" He says he hopes to convince those who did not vote or who voted for extreme candidates. Nothing has been decided yet, he says. ""Pandering to populism and xenophobia - that's not France,"" he says. Macron has arrived at his campaign HQ and has taken to the stage, ready to address supporters. He may have won the first round by as much as five points, but this opinion poll that's been broadcast by one of two big TV networks shows this race is not over. That's why Macron and Le Pen will now have to fight for every vote. James ShieldsHonorary Professor in French Studies, University of Warwick Emmanuel Macron
has won this first round with 28% - but as an embattled incumbent, no longer the
candidate of hope and change. He is well placed in the centre to build a
winning majority; but how far will leftist voters
disappointed with the rightward bias of Macronâs first term rally this time to
see him over the line? Far-right
candidates have secured their highest ever first-round aggregate (33%), leaving
Macronâs promise to reduce the far right ringing hollow. Marine Le Pen (23%)
has raised her first-round score from 21% in 2017. How far can she raise her
then second-round score (34%), and where will her wider reserves of support
lie? The traditional
parties of government have suffered a historic, humiliating defeat (Socialists
2%; Republicans 5%). Both are in existential crisis. Will these once hegemonic
parties perish or can they find redemption in the June parliamentary elections? At 26%, abstention
was close to a presidential record. Following record abstention across all
mid-term elections, this confirms a disengagement within French politics that
has worsened under Macronâs presidency. How will abstention impact the second
round and, if high, could it raise questions over democratic legitimacy by
depriving the winner of a strong mandate? Macron supporters are waiting for the president to speak Our colleagues at Macron's HQ in Paris have been speaking to some of the president's supporters ahead of his much-awaited speech. ""Every other candidate who lost tonight should call for a Macron vote,"" said one woman. ""It's only common sense, we can't be ruled by the extreme in our country, it'd be catastrophic."" Another young woman defended the president for launching his campaign late, because she said it was important he had focused on diplomacy over the war in Ukraine. ""He has heavy responsibilities and that's what he prioritised: being a president until the last moment, and I think it's a wise decision,"" she said. French far-right candidate Eric Zemmour has now, as expected, urged his supporters to vote for far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the second round of the presidential election. He said however that his party would continue to fight for its ideas, saying its position was unique and not represented elsewhere. If electorally nothing changes, politically everything has changed because we arrived.  Paul KirbyReporting from Paris We now know who will go into the second round - but the question for voters who didn't back either Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen is which of the two will they support on 24 April. Marine Le Pen has already called on all French voters to join her. Republicans candidate ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse has already thrown her weight behind the incumbent president, although she has a paltry 5% of the vote. Greens candidate Eric Jadot has backed Macron too. You would expect Eric Zemmour's supporters to choose fellow far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, but he only secured marginally greater support than PÃ©cresse with around 7%. But the big question is where will the supporters of far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon take their votes? He has polled around 20% of the vote and he told his supporters three times: ""You must not give a single vote to Marine Le Pen."" He's not backing Macron, and many of his supporters may choose not to vote at all. MÃ©lenchon didn't use the word abstain but he didn't have to. It all goes to show that this race isn't over just yet. Far left-winger Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon has now joined the other candidates - apart from Zemmour - in urging supporters not to vote for Le Pen in the second round to keep the far right out of power. Speaking to supporters after coming third in the vote, he said the results do not correctly reflect the exasperation of people  around France. He admitted disappointment but vowed to keep up his political struggle. To cheers he told supporters: ""There must not be one single vote for Le Pen in the second round."" Marine Le Pen has in turn been speaking, calling for those who hadn't voted Macron to vote for her in the second round. She said she would be the ""president of all French people"" if elected in the second round and touched on all the familiar themes she campaigned on ahead of the polls, including reasserting French values, controlling immigration and ensuring security for all. To the sounds of her supporters chanting ""we're going to win"", she vowed to ""put France in order within five years"".  ""I intend without waiting to sew back up the tears that a torn-apart France suffers from which now power has been able to do until now.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murthy in 2009, after meeting her as a student in California A Whitehall inquiry is under way into how the tax affairs of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife were leaked to the media, the BBC has been told. Akshata Murtyhas said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income, following a row over her non-domicile status. She owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her father - from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. Labour has said the row raises questions about Mr Sunak's judgement. Sunak held US green card until last year Smearing my wife to get at me is awful, says Sunak Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? As a non-domiciled (non-dom) UK resident, Ms Murty is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. The BBC estimates this would have saved her Â£2.1m a year in UK tax. After details of her non-dom status appeared in the press on Wednesday evening, Mr Sunak said his wife had not ""done anything wrong"" and it was unfair to attack her as a ""private citizen"". But on Friday, Ms Murty announced she would change her tax arrangements, telling the BBC she did not want to be a ""distraction"" for her husband. Asked about the U-turn on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the couple had recognised the situation ""offended against a British sense of fair play"". ""They recognise that there was a disconnect perhaps in the British public's understanding of what was appropriate, and they've corrected that situation now for the future,"" he added. No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff leaked damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. Elsewhere,Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Sunday Times,externalhe had claimed non-domicile status for six years when he was a banker, between 2000 and 2006. Anon-domis someone who lives in the UK but declares their permanent home to be in another country. It has been a bruising week for the chancellor, leading to him asking senior civil servants for a full investigation to establish who divulged his wife's tax status. His allies say very few people had access to the personal information, which Mr Sunak declared to Whitehall officials when he became a minister in 2018. Some Conservative MPs say he was naive to think the details would remain private, and that he should have predicted that the tax arrangements would be criticised as inappropriate, despite being legal. Mr Sunak's team has dismissed suggestions of a rift with Downing Street and say the prime minister has been ""incredibly supportive"". But Mr Sunak's brand - vigorously promoted since he came to office - has been damaged, with some Tories questioning his judgement. Friends have also confirmed to the BBCreports in the Sunday Mirror,externalthat the chancellor's wife and daughters are moving out of Downing Street and back to the family home in west London. Mr Sunak will join them at weekends. The decision is said to have been made well before this row hit the headlines. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said there remained a ""series of questions"" for the chancellor to answer - including whether he had declared his wife's tax status when taking ""policy decisions"" affecting non-dom households. She told the Sunday Morning programme: ""The lack of transparency does raise questions about conflict of interest. ""But it's also about basic fairness - and I don't think the chancellor still gets that, and that raises real questions about his judgement. ""The fact that they have changed their tax arrangements now shows that they do recognise it's a problem - but they wouldn't have done that if this hadn't been public."" The Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". Labour has previously advocated scrapping non-dom status entirely, under previous leaders Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn. Asked whether her party still held that position, Ms Cooper said its policy on non-doms was subject to a wider review of tax policy being undertaken by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read morehere.

"UK hauliers carrying perishable goods say products are losing quality and value as they are forced to sit in long queues to cross into Europe at Dover. Bad weather, Easter holidays and P&O Ferries routes being suspended have all led to congestion around the port. The queues eased on Sunday, but the British Meat Processors Association said some of its members had waited for 24 hours or more to cross. The government said traffic management measures were under regular review. However, a Department for Transport spokesperson gave no indication that there would be a change made for those transporting perishable items. As well as the other factors causing congestion, which have led to the traffic management system Operation Brock being put in place, there have also been problems with a key IT system for custom checks at the UK's busiest port after Brexit. Lockerbie-based Eardley International takes fresh meat from the UK into continental Europe, operating 25 trucks at any one time. ""Our products have a very short shelf life,"" company director Graham Eardley told the BBC. ""If we load lamb in the UK on a Monday, we'd expect to deliver that product to Germany on a Tuesday. Now we are seeing delays of 20 to 25 hours to cross the Channel, and the quality and the sale value of that product falls by every hour it is delayed."" Furthermore, haulier regulations mean drivers need to take an 11-hour break when they get to Calais, as they cannot rest while they are in the traffic jam in case they need to move their vehicle. This just adds to the problem. P&O routes are still being suspended due to a shortage of ferry services following itsdismissal of almost 800 staff last month without notice.The company says it plans to resume its operationson the Dover-Calais route next week if it gets regulatory approval. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, said the delays meant that the UK was losing business, as customers were turning to other countries to source goods at a time when their members' products were in hot demand. ""We are told to expect disruption well into next week. With Easter weekend approaching and a very busy time for exporting fresh meat, this is really bad timing."" Graham Eardley says his company's produce loses value for every hour it is delayed For Mr Eardley, the delays mean losing up to Â£800 per truck. He says the abattoirs who use his services are also getting claims for late delivery and loss in value. ""We are paying for the driver to be sitting in the truck not being productive and seeing the loss of the revenue that the vehicle could be making."" Many in the industry argue that hauliers carrying fresh produce should be prioritised for boarding,as they have been before. The Kent Resilience Forum, which manages emergency planning for the county, said they were waiting for the government to advise them of who and what would be allowed to jump the queue. This is causing huge frustration to Mr Eardley, who says that as hauliers register customs forms listing the contents of their lorries, it should be a straightforward process to put in place. Toby Howe, the tactical lead for the forum, explained: ""It is not as simple as saying we will just fast-track meat or anything perishable. ""In 2015 we were given very general guidance and drivers got clever by putting a small amount in the lorry. For EU exit planning, Defra came up with specifics which we were then able to prioritise."" Others believe you cannot retrofit a priority system. In response, the Department for Transport (DfT) said the traffic management measures were regularly reviewed but did not say whether any changes would be made with regard to the transportation of perishable items. It said: ""P&O's unacceptable actions have resulted in its vessels being detained, causing backlogs and traffic jams which would be substantially alleviated if its fleet was operating normally. We are receiving real-time updates as the Kent Resilience Forum, police and regional leaders work around-the-clock to ease disruption and support those affected."" Trade body Logistics UK said it supported prioritising perishable goods, but said the practicalities of facilitating such a policy were currently unclear. Mags Simpson, Logistics UK's head of policy engagement, said: ""The delays are frustrating for industry and Logistics UK is working with DfT and the ports to identify effective solutions that can be introduced as soon as possible."" Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation - the trade association that represents businesses which store and move frozen and chilled food - said the poor conditions caused by Operation Brock were fanning the flames of driver shortages, in an already overstretched industry. ""The UK is getting a growing reputation for being a hassle to serve, and that creates problems for my members who can't find the hauliers to take their business because they don't want to take the risk of sitting in traffic on the M20."" Part of the frustration is that hauliers feel like tourist traffic in Dover is being prioritised over freight traffic. Mr Eardley says this further undermines morale. ""Are we saying that it's not fair to have Jimmy and Jonny delayed in their car going on holiday, but that it's acceptable to ask drivers to wait 20 hours or more in their cab? Until there is more understanding of drivers and their experience, we are on the road to ruin."" From July this year, the UK will start imposing Brexit controls on meat and dairy goods coming in from the EU. Industry leaders are concerned that this will be yet another crunch time for Dover.

Jessica ParkerReporting from Macron's HQ The cheers were loud. The
flag waving full of enthusiasm. The room was relieved. But while their man may
have managed a bigger lead than many expected given recent polls, Marine Le
Penâs campaign has still given them a scare. Nothing is decided, insisted Emmanuel
Macron tonight. Itâs the exactly the kind of message youâd expect from an
incumbent whoâs ahead; desperate to avoid complacency or any sense that victory
is secure. And of course, with a fortnight to run, it isnât. They say a week is
a long time in politics. Try two. Anna HolliganReporting from Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon's campaign HQ ""We are here, we are hereâ¦ââ The chants resounded inside
the circus that's been transformed into Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchonâs HQ. The oldest candidate, whose messages of social justice
and climate consciousness resonated the most with young voters, was on
typically fiery form. Addressing supporters from the stage, he compelled them
not give a single vote to his far-right rival Marine Le Pen, but stopped short
of suggesting they lend their loyalty to Emmanuel Macron. He said his defeat meant France was now faced with a
choice between two evils. Some pollsters say MÃ©lenchon was the favourite candidate
among the 18-24 demographic with approximately 34% of young people who turned
out investing their faith in him. Who wins the battle for these young Melenchon voters
could prove pivotal in determining who enters the ElysÃ©e. According to some projections, the gap between Le Pen and MÃ©lenchon may be narrowing, with the far-right leader only 0.8 points ahead of her far-left rival in some cases. ""The two qualified are indeed Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, but Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon is very close, and the gap has narrowed,"" says Brice Teinturier, director of the Ipsos-Sopra Steria polling firm. There's no suggestion that the result will change as a result or that the MÃ©lenchon camp is calling for anything specific in view of the figures. Official results are due to be published overnight at around 01:00 local time (midnight BST). Nick BeakeAt Le Pen HQ Marine Le Pen arrived on stage earlier this evening and called on all those who didnât vote for her or Macron to join her campaign. She said she would be president for all of France - a country she said should be making its
own decisions. Cue huge applause and chants of âPresident, Presidentâ. Champagne and singing soon followed the exit polls here at Le Pen HQ. Among the
smartly-dressed party officials there was initial joy at her highest first-round showing, although some were hoping it would higher. Now that the obligatory
selfies  have been taken, party officials will look to maintain their momentum and prepare for two weeks ahead. This video can not be played French election: We can create a sovereign France - Marine Le Pen The far-right leader calls on those who did not vote for Macron to back her in the second round. Both candidates are now competing for the votes of the 10 candidates who did not make it through to the second round in two weeks. If you're just joining or if you need a recap on events, here is a summary of the latest developments: Round one results:Emmanuel Macron is set to face the far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a run-off for the French presidency after the two came top in the first round. Macron secured about 28% of the vote compared with about 23% for Le Pen, vote projections suggest Speeches:The candidates took turns to thank their supporters at their respective campaign HQs. Le Pen promised to put France ""in order"" if she won, while Macron said he would unite the country Close race to come:The incumbent president looks set to face a very tight contest with Le Pen in the second round on 24 April. One pollster has predicted 51% for Macron and 49% for Le Pen. In 2017, he won with 66.1% of the votes Still pivotal:Far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon may have come third with about 20% of the vote, but his supporters could still play an important role in deciding the final winner This video can not be played Macron called on the supporters of his defeated presidential election rivals to back him in a run-off contest against Marine Le Pen. Pledging to unify France, he said he would reflect ""all the different convictions and beliefs"" if he beats his far-right rival on 24 April. Hugh SchofieldReporting from Paris It is to be a re-run of the 2017 second round, where Emmanuel Macron pulverised Marine Le Pen. But this time around, let no-one be under any illusion that it will be so easy. Estimations from round one show how tactical voting rewrote the electoral map. Voters gathered into three broad camps: Macron, the far-right and the far-left. In the last days of campaigning, many people who were considering other candidates finally decided that they would rather back a frontrunner. There was thus a big transfer of votes from Zemmour - the hard-right nationalist pundit - to the camp of Le Pen. Some right-wingers in the conservative Republicans party may have done the same. On the left, voters decided that neither the Socialist Hidalgo nor the Green Jadot could ever make it into round two. So they shifted massively to MÃ©lenchon, simply to keep a leftist in the race. This despite many Socialists and Greens actively disliking the man. And in the centre, many who would normally have chosen the Republicans' PÃ©cresse will have plumped instead for the incumbent. Why? Because they were genuinely afraid that Le Pen and/or MÃ©lenchon were coming up too strong from behind. But what this also shows is that the so-called ""irresponsible"" forces of the extremes - Macron's opposition - are all the time getting stronger. Read more of Hugh's analysis of the results here ""Beaver voters"" are those who traditionally vote in favour of a candidate in order to ""create a barrage against the extreme right"", the BBC's Helene Daouphars explains. Macron has urged them to build their dam and prevent Le Pen from taking the presidency - so have all the other candidates apart from Zemmour. But will they? Our correspondent says things might not be so straightforward this time around. ""People are not so ready any more to always vote against the extreme right and they are fed up with this situation we end up with,"" Daouphars says. Macron will need to be ""more convincing to rural France"", she adds. He goes on to address the cost of living - a major campaign theme of his second-round opponent Le Pen. The only way to address this, he insists, is by moving forward with his party's political programme. ""The debate that we are going to have over the next fortnight will be decisive for our country and Europe,"" he tells his supporters at his campaign headquarters, urging them to ""spare no effort"" to win over voters to his side. He adds: ""I believe in us all, regardless of origins, beliefs."" He ends his short address to his supporters by saying: ""I am counting on you. Nothing is decided. [Let's move] forward."" Macron takes to the stage greeted by supporters chanting ""and one and two and five more [years]"" and ""Macron President"". He thanked those who voted for him, as well as the candidates who stood against him, and those who asked for their supporters to back him. He asks French voters to vote for him to block the far right from taking power. ""I invite all including those who did not vote for me in the first round to rally behind us."" He says he hopes to convince those who did not vote or who voted for extreme candidates. Nothing has been decided yet, he says. ""Pandering to populism and xenophobia - that's not France,"" he says. Macron has arrived at his campaign HQ and has taken to the stage, ready to address supporters. He may have won the first round by as much as five points, but this opinion poll that's been broadcast by one of two big TV networks shows this race is not over. That's why Macron and Le Pen will now have to fight for every vote. James ShieldsHonorary Professor in French Studies, University of Warwick Emmanuel Macron
has won this first round with 28% - but as an embattled incumbent, no longer the
candidate of hope and change. He is well placed in the centre to build a
winning majority; but how far will leftist voters
disappointed with the rightward bias of Macronâs first term rally this time to
see him over the line? Far-right
candidates have secured their highest ever first-round aggregate (33%), leaving
Macronâs promise to reduce the far right ringing hollow. Marine Le Pen (23%)
has raised her first-round score from 21% in 2017. How far can she raise her
then second-round score (34%), and where will her wider reserves of support
lie? The traditional
parties of government have suffered a historic, humiliating defeat (Socialists
2%; Republicans 5%). Both are in existential crisis. Will these once hegemonic
parties perish or can they find redemption in the June parliamentary elections? At 26%, abstention
was close to a presidential record. Following record abstention across all
mid-term elections, this confirms a disengagement within French politics that
has worsened under Macronâs presidency. How will abstention impact the second
round and, if high, could it raise questions over democratic legitimacy by
depriving the winner of a strong mandate? Macron supporters are waiting for the president to speak Our colleagues at Macron's HQ in Paris have been speaking to some of the president's supporters ahead of his much-awaited speech. ""Every other candidate who lost tonight should call for a Macron vote,"" said one woman. ""It's only common sense, we can't be ruled by the extreme in our country, it'd be catastrophic."" Another young woman defended the president for launching his campaign late, because she said it was important he had focused on diplomacy over the war in Ukraine. ""He has heavy responsibilities and that's what he prioritised: being a president until the last moment, and I think it's a wise decision,"" she said. French far-right candidate Eric Zemmour has now, as expected, urged his supporters to vote for far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the second round of the presidential election. He said however that his party would continue to fight for its ideas, saying its position was unique and not represented elsewhere. If electorally nothing changes, politically everything has changed because we arrived.  Paul KirbyReporting from Paris We now know who will go into the second round - but the question for voters who didn't back either Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen is which of the two will they support on 24 April. Marine Le Pen has already called on all French voters to join her. Republicans candidate ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse has already thrown her weight behind the incumbent president, although she has a paltry 5% of the vote. Greens candidate Eric Jadot has backed Macron too. You would expect Eric Zemmour's supporters to choose fellow far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, but he only secured marginally greater support than PÃ©cresse with around 7%. But the big question is where will the supporters of far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon take their votes? He has polled around 20% of the vote and he told his supporters three times: ""You must not give a single vote to Marine Le Pen."" He's not backing Macron, and many of his supporters may choose not to vote at all. MÃ©lenchon didn't use the word abstain but he didn't have to. It all goes to show that this race isn't over just yet. Far left-winger Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon has now joined the other candidates - apart from Zemmour - in urging supporters not to vote for Le Pen in the second round to keep the far right out of power. Speaking to supporters after coming third in the vote, he said the results do not correctly reflect the exasperation of people  around France. He admitted disappointment but vowed to keep up his political struggle. To cheers he told supporters: ""There must not be one single vote for Le Pen in the second round."" Marine Le Pen has in turn been speaking, calling for those who hadn't voted Macron to vote for her in the second round. She said she would be the ""president of all French people"" if elected in the second round and touched on all the familiar themes she campaigned on ahead of the polls, including reasserting French values, controlling immigration and ensuring security for all. To the sounds of her supporters chanting ""we're going to win"", she vowed to ""put France in order within five years"".  ""I intend without waiting to sew back up the tears that a torn-apart France suffers from which now power has been able to do until now.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Scott Morrison has been Australia's prime minister since 2018 Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called a federal election for 21 May. Mr Morrison's ruling coalition holds 76 seats in the House of Representatives - the minimum needed to retain power. Polls suggest there will be a change of government, with the opposition Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese, tipped to take office. However, in the last election, the centre-right Mr Morrison won despite most polls predicting otherwise. Mr Morrison announced the date after talks with the Governor General in the capital, Canberra. ""It's a choice between a strong future and an uncertain one. It's a choice between a government you know and a Labor opposition that you don't,"" the prime minister said on Sunday. But Mr Albanese - pointing outMr Morrison's own deputy prime minister called him ""a hypocrite and a liar""- argued that ""we can and must do better"". ""The pandemic has given us the opportunity to imagine a better future and Labor has the policies and plans to shape that future,"" he said on Sunday. Is Australian democracy in good health? Mr Morrison is the first leader to serve a full term in office since John Howard, who won four elections before losing to Labor's Kevin Rudd in 2007. Since then, what observers call the ""coup culture"" of Australian politics has led to a series of short-lived premierships. Mr Morrison's Liberal-led coalition is defending a one-seat majority. Even though it has won seven of the past nine federal elections, it may be hard-pressed to do so again, say political analysts. In recent weeks,the prime minister has faced accusations of being a bullyand once sabotaging a rival's career by suggesting the man's Lebanese heritage made him less electable. Mr Morrison has denied the allegations. But despite the most recent polling putting Labor ahead, Mr Albanese has called his opponents the ""favourites"", noting his party has only won government from opposition three times since World War Two. by Phil Mercer in Sydney A ""complete blank page"" or ""a bully with no moral compass""? On 21 May, Australians will choose between an opposition leader accused by opponents of being clueless and inexperienced, or an incumbent prime minister who's fending off allegations of racism and an intimidatory style of leadership. Scott Morrison's centre-right government is under pressure, but it's led by a former marketing executive who's become a political survivor and defied the polls to win the so-called ""miracle"" election in 2019. Remarkably, Mr Morrison is the first Australian prime minister to serve a full term since John Howard. His Labor challenger, Anthony Albanese, presents himself as a measured, gently progressive alternative. The handling of the pandemic and natural disasters, as well as national security and the environment, will sway voters, but as the cost of living rises, the 21 May poll will ultimately be decided by one dominant issue - the economy.

"Ronaldo appeared to knock a young fan's phone to the ground as he walked down the tunnel at Goodison Merseyside Police are investigating an alleged assault after Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to break a fan's phone. Footage was shared on social media alongside comments claiming he smashed the device as he left the pitch after his side's1-0 loss at Everton. Ronaldo, 37, later apologised on social media. Merseyside Police said they were investigating ""reports of an alleged assault"" at Goodison Park on Saturday. A spokesperson said they were liaising with both Manchester United and Everton. ""As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch,"" they added. ""Inquiries are under way and officers are currently working with Everton to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness enquiries to establish if an offence has taken place. ""Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police contact centre quoting reference number 228 of 9 April 2022."" Manchester United said they were aware of ""an alleged incident"" and would ""co-operate with any police inquiries"". The result damaged United's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League and came against an Everton side who had been one point above the relegation zone before kick-off.

"Opinion polls for both rounds put Marine Le Pen narrowly behind Mr Macron French voters are casting their ballots in the opening round of a presidential race that could become a cliffhanger. Emmanuel Macron has a fight on his hands from far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who has been galvanised by a slick election campaign. Forty-nine million people are eligible to decide which two of 12 candidates should take part in the run-off vote. But after four hours of voting, only a quarter of voters had turned out - the lowest for 20 years. The campaign has been overshadowed first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then Russia's invasion. The president has spent little time on the race, focusing instead on Europe's reaction to the war in Ukraine. However, one issue more than any other has predominated the election: the spiralling cost of living in energy bills and shopping baskets. When he came to power with a new party in 2017, Emmanuel Macron swept away the old allegiances, and the two big parties are still nursing their wounds. Socialist candidate Anne Hidalgo has struggled to be heard, while on the right ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse has failed to excite the Republicans. Now, the main challenge to Mr Macron, 44, is coming from Ms Le Pen on the far right and Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon on the far left. Some are even predicting the president could lose. Voting began at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) in mainland France and ends in the big cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille at 20:00 local time. What adds to the uncertainty is that days before the vote, one Ipsos opinion poll suggested 37% of people were still undecided. ""The campaign's been going on for two months and there hasn't been much debate,"" complains Ourdia, a cafÃ© owner in north-west Paris. ""I still don't know who to vote for."" The old tribal tradition of voting either for the left or right has gone. One market trader in Paris said he was yet to decide whether to vote for Marine Le Pen, 53, or 70-year-old Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. Parisian voter ChloÃ© said her biggest fear was that voters would choose to stay at home After voting at a Paris polling station, ChloÃ© told the BBC the candidates had spent too much time focusing on international affairs, but now was not the time: ""They're not talking about the biggest subjects for us and our everyday lives."" Malika said she was voting for Eric Zemmour on the far right because ""I want to vote for France, not party politics"". Andy said he was worried Marine Le Pen would win but he was not a fan of Emmanuel Macron either: ""So many crises have happened, and for me as a student there's been a lot of reform that's not good for us."" Andy is unhappy with Mr Macron's handling of yellow-vest protests and Covid-19 For many voters, there is no longer a stigma about voting for the far right. Philippe Bridou, a former Socialist voter in south-western city of Perpignan, told the BBC he had switched to the far right because ""security is important, immigration is important too because it's a subject now - and the left wing doesn't discuss it"". After she was trounced by Mr Macron in 2017, Ms Le Pen rebranded her National Front as National Rally, even if many of her policies have hardly changed. She has also come across as more moderate than far-right rival candidate Eric Zemmour. ""The election race isn't over at all,"" said Brice Teinturier of polling institute Ipsos. Turnout is key because the pollsters suggest as many as 28% of voters may not show - a level not seen for 20 years - and the least likely to bother are 25-34 year-olds. By midday turnout was three points down on five years ago, at 25.48%, but far higher than in 2002. Then there are the so-calledvotes blancs- the ballots left blank as a protest. Tactical voting may also play a part, if voters decide to back one of the favourites because they have more of a chance of winning than, for example, Greens candidate Yannick Jadot. The French economy is in decent shape and unemployment has fallen to 7.4%, but voters are not feeling the benefit. That's because prices are going up across the board, at the shops, the market, the petrol pump and in domestic energy bills. The phrase you hear everywhere ispouvoir d'achat- which translates as spending power but is better known in English as the cost of living. Market-seller Thierry has seen a dramatic increase in prices Thierry, who lives outside Paris and runs a shoe stall, says prices have gone through the roof. ""The cost of shoes has gone up by 20% to 30% and all the taxes have gone up too,"" he points out. That is why many of the candidates are promising to boost the minimum wage, in some cases by hundreds of euros. It's due to go up at the start of May to about â¬1,300 (Â£1,100; $1,430) a month after tax. CANDIDATES:Who's in the race? TIGHT RACE:Far-right Le Pen closes in on Macron SIMPLE GUIDE:How it works For Marine Le Pen, the spending crunch is also a big opportunity. She has spent less time talking about nationalism and focused more on low wages, saying she'll waive income tax for under-30s. But she still wants a referendum on restricting immigration, she wants to ban the Islamic hijab in public areas and wants radical change to the European Union. She has distanced herself from Russia's Vladimir Putin, even though she went to see him in 2017, used to admire him and her party is still paying back a Russian loan. By contrast, voters have been unimpressed with revelations that the Macron government has spent increasing amounts of taxpayers' money on consultants such as US firm McKinsey. ""People are a bit disgusted who gets the money,"" said Thierry. Mr Macron entered the campaign late, with a rousing rally eight days before the vote. While his adversaries were criss-crossing France, he was focusing on diplomacy in Russia's war in Ukraine. He only got going on his main adversary shortly before campaigning ended, condemning her policies as racist and ""very brutal"". The first round will only decide the top two candidates, but already the race is tight.

The president has spent little time on the race, focusing instead on Europe's reaction to the war in Ukraine. However, one issue more than any other has predominated the election: the spiralling cost of living in energy bills and shopping baskets. When he came to power with a new party in 2017, Emmanuel Macron swept away the old allegiances, and the two big parties are still nursing their wounds. Socialist candidate Anne Hidalgo has struggled to be heard, while on the right ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse has failed to excite the Republicans. Now, the main challenge to Mr Macron, 44, is coming from Ms Le Pen on the far right and Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon on the far left. Some are even predicting the president could lose. Voting began at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) in mainland France and ends in the big cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille at 20:00 local time. What adds to the uncertainty is that days before the vote, one Ipsos opinion poll suggested 37% of people were still undecided. ""The campaign's been going on for two months and there hasn't been much debate,"" complains Ourdia, a cafÃ© owner in north-west Paris. ""I still don't know who to vote for."" The old tribal tradition of voting either for the left or right has gone. One market trader in Paris said he was yet to decide whether to vote for Marine Le Pen, 53, or 70-year-old Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. Parisian voter ChloÃ© said her biggest fear was that voters would choose to stay at home After voting at a Paris polling station, ChloÃ© told the BBC the candidates had spent too much time focusing on international affairs, but now was not the time: ""They're not talking about the biggest subjects for us and our everyday lives."" Malika said she was voting for Eric Zemmour on the far right because ""I want to vote for France, not party politics"". Andy said he was worried Marine Le Pen would win but he was not a fan of Emmanuel Macron either: ""So many crises have happened, and for me as a student there's been a lot of reform that's not good for us."" Andy is unhappy with Mr Macron's handling of yellow-vest protests and Covid-19 For many voters, there is no longer a stigma about voting for the far right. Philippe Bridou, a former Socialist voter in south-western city of Perpignan, told the BBC he had switched to the far right because ""security is important, immigration is important too because it's a subject now - and the left wing doesn't discuss it"". After she was trounced by Mr Macron in 2017, Ms Le Pen rebranded her National Front as National Rally, even if many of her policies have hardly changed. She has also come across as more moderate than far-right rival candidate Eric Zemmour. ""The election race isn't over at all,"" said Brice Teinturier of polling institute Ipsos. Turnout is key because the pollsters suggest as many as 28% of voters may not show - a level not seen for 20 years - and the least likely to bother are 25-34 year-olds. By midday turnout was three points down on five years ago, at 25.48%, but far higher than in 2002. Then there are the so-calledvotes blancs- the ballots left blank as a protest. Tactical voting may also play a part, if voters decide to back one of the favourites because they have more of a chance of winning than, for example, Greens candidate Yannick Jadot. The French economy is in decent shape and unemployment has fallen to 7.4%, but voters are not feeling the benefit. That's because prices are going up across the board, at the shops, the market, the petrol pump and in domestic energy bills. The phrase you hear everywhere ispouvoir d'achat- which translates as spending power but is better known in English as the cost of living. Market-seller Thierry has seen a dramatic increase in prices Thierry, who lives outside Paris and runs a shoe stall, says prices have gone through the roof. ""The cost of shoes has gone up by 20% to 30% and all the taxes have gone up too,"" he points out. That is why many of the candidates are promising to boost the minimum wage, in some cases by hundreds of euros. It's due to go up at the start of May to about â¬1,300 (Â£1,100; $1,430) a month after tax. CANDIDATES:Who's in the race? TIGHT RACE:Far-right Le Pen closes in on Macron SIMPLE GUIDE:How it works For Marine Le Pen, the spending crunch is also a big opportunity. She has spent less time talking about nationalism and focused more on low wages, saying she'll waive income tax for under-30s. But she still wants a referendum on restricting immigration, she wants to ban the Islamic hijab in public areas and wants radical change to the European Union. She has distanced herself from Russia's Vladimir Putin, even though she went to see him in 2017, used to admire him and her party is still paying back a Russian loan. By contrast, voters have been unimpressed with revelations that the Macron government has spent increasing amounts of taxpayers' money on consultants such as US firm McKinsey. ""People are a bit disgusted who gets the money,"" said Thierry. Mr Macron entered the campaign late, with a rousing rally eight days before the vote. While his adversaries were criss-crossing France, he was focusing on diplomacy in Russia's war in Ukraine. He only got going on his main adversary shortly before campaigning ended, condemning her policies as racist and ""very brutal"". The first round will only decide the top two candidates, but already the race is tight.

"Ferrari's Charles Leclerc wins his second race of season to extend championship lead to 34 points Red Bull's Sergio Perez P2, George Russell of Mercedes completes podium with team-mate Lewis Hamilton P4 Red Bull's Max Verstappen retires from second place Sebastian Vettel spins Aston Martin into wall to bring out safety car Ferrari's Carlos Sainz retires on lap two after high-speed spin Follow BBC Radio 5 Live commentary via tab at top of page Get involved via #bbcf1 Matthew Henry Andrew BensonBBC Sportâs chief F1 writer Charles Leclerc took a dominant victory in the Australian Grand Prix to move into a commanding position in the World Championship. The Ferrari driver was in total control of the race when his main rival Max Verstappen retired with a technical failure on his Red Bull at two-thirds distance. Verstappen is 46 points - almost two clear wins - behind Leclerc after just three races of the season, in two of which the Red Bull has failed to finish. Red Bull's Sergio Perez was second after winning battles with Mercedes drivers George Russell and Lewis Hamilton. Remarkably, in the context of Mercedes' disappointing start to the season, Russell is second in the drivers' championship at this early stage and Mercedes second in the constructors' chase. Full report That's all from us on this page today. In the end it was a dominant win for Charles Leclerc and Ferrari. They are looking very strong. Scroll down for all of the reaction or headhereto read Andrew Benson's report. Keep an eye out for the Chequered Flag podcast too. Melbourne, it was good to be back. F1 has a week off now before attention turns to the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola from Friday 22 April. That GP is the closest on the calendar Ferrari HQ. It could be lively. Jennie GowBBC Radio 5 live pit-lane reporter Red Bull are still trying to get to the bottom of their problems. Helmut Marko, the professor who helps to run the team has been quoted by the Orf TV channel as saying that there was a fuel issue and maybe the fuel tank broke. They will need to get the car back to Milton Keynes to do some forensic analysis on it but we know Max Verstappen complained of smelling something funny, which is never a good sign when you are a Formula One driver hurtling around Albert Park at 200 mph. Huge disappointment for Red Bull - they know they have a very fast car but reliability is a real problem for them. Verstappen has now lost 36 points due to failing to finish a race.

"UK hauliers carrying perishable goods say products are losing quality and value as they are forced to sit in long queues to cross into Europe at Dover. Bad weather, Easter holidays and P&O Ferries routes being suspended have all led to congestion around the port. The queues eased on Sunday, but the British Meat Processors Association said some of its members had waited for 24 hours or more to cross. The government said traffic management measures were under regular review. However, a Department for Transport spokesperson gave no indication that there would be a change made for those transporting perishable items. As well as the other factors causing congestion, which have led to the traffic management system Operation Brock being put in place, there have also been problems with a key IT system for custom checks at the UK's busiest port after Brexit. Lockerbie-based Eardley International takes fresh meat from the UK into continental Europe, operating 25 trucks at any one time. ""Our products have a very short shelf life,"" company director Graham Eardley told the BBC. ""If we load lamb in the UK on a Monday, we'd expect to deliver that product to Germany on a Tuesday. Now we are seeing delays of 20 to 25 hours to cross the Channel, and the quality and the sale value of that product falls by every hour it is delayed."" Furthermore, haulier regulations mean drivers need to take an 11-hour break when they get to Calais, as they cannot rest while they are in the traffic jam in case they need to move their vehicle. This just adds to the problem. P&O routes are still being suspended due to a shortage of ferry services following itsdismissal of almost 800 staff last month without notice.The company says it plans to resume its operationson the Dover-Calais route next week if it gets regulatory approval. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, said the delays meant that the UK was losing business, as customers were turning to other countries to source goods at a time when their members' products were in hot demand. ""We are told to expect disruption well into next week. With Easter weekend approaching and a very busy time for exporting fresh meat, this is really bad timing."" Graham Eardley says his company's produce loses value for every hour it is delayed For Mr Eardley, the delays mean losing up to Â£800 per truck. He says the abattoirs who use his services are also getting claims for late delivery and loss in value. ""We are paying for the driver to be sitting in the truck not being productive and seeing the loss of the revenue that the vehicle could be making."" Many in the industry argue that hauliers carrying fresh produce should be prioritised for boarding,as they have been before. The Kent Resilience Forum, which manages emergency planning for the county, said they were waiting for the government to advise them of who and what would be allowed to jump the queue. This is causing huge frustration to Mr Eardley, who says that as hauliers register customs forms listing the contents of their lorries, it should be a straightforward process to put in place. Toby Howe, the tactical lead for the forum, explained: ""It is not as simple as saying we will just fast-track meat or anything perishable. ""In 2015 we were given very general guidance and drivers got clever by putting a small amount in the lorry. For EU exit planning, Defra came up with specifics which we were then able to prioritise."" Others believe you cannot retrofit a priority system. In response, the Department for Transport (DfT) said the traffic management measures were regularly reviewed but did not say whether any changes would be made with regard to the transportation of perishable items. It said: ""P&O's unacceptable actions have resulted in its vessels being detained, causing backlogs and traffic jams which would be substantially alleviated if its fleet was operating normally. We are receiving real-time updates as the Kent Resilience Forum, police and regional leaders work around-the-clock to ease disruption and support those affected."" Trade body Logistics UK said it supported prioritising perishable goods, but said the practicalities of facilitating such a policy were currently unclear. Mags Simpson, Logistics UK's head of policy engagement, said: ""The delays are frustrating for industry and Logistics UK is working with DfT and the ports to identify effective solutions that can be introduced as soon as possible."" Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation - the trade association that represents businesses which store and move frozen and chilled food - said the poor conditions caused by Operation Brock were fanning the flames of driver shortages, in an already overstretched industry. ""The UK is getting a growing reputation for being a hassle to serve, and that creates problems for my members who can't find the hauliers to take their business because they don't want to take the risk of sitting in traffic on the M20."" Part of the frustration is that hauliers feel like tourist traffic in Dover is being prioritised over freight traffic. Mr Eardley says this further undermines morale. ""Are we saying that it's not fair to have Jimmy and Jonny delayed in their car going on holiday, but that it's acceptable to ask drivers to wait 20 hours or more in their cab? Until there is more understanding of drivers and their experience, we are on the road to ruin."" From July this year, the UK will start imposing Brexit controls on meat and dairy goods coming in from the EU. Industry leaders are concerned that this will be yet another crunch time for Dover.

"The war in Ukraine could be ended if western countries stopped buying Russian oil and gas, says President Putin's former chief economic adviser A ""real embargo"" on Russian energy by Western countries could stop war in Ukraine, President Putin's former chief economic adviser has suggested. Dr Andrei Illarionov said Russia ""did not take seriously"" other countries' threats to reduce their energy usage. Despitetrying to reduceits reliance on Russian sources, Europe is continuing tobuy oil and gas. Last year, soaring prices meant oil and gas revenues accounted for 36% of Russia's government spending. Much of that income comes from the European Union, which imports about 40% of its gas and 27% of its oil from Russia. This week, its top diplomat Josep Borrell said ""a billion [euros] is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he supplies us"". EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas West hits Russia with oil bans and gas curbs Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Dr Illarionov said if Western countries ""would try to implement a real embargo on oil and gas exports from Russia... I would bet that probably within a month or two, Russian military operations in Ukraine, probably will be ceased, will be stopped"". ""It's one of the very effective instruments still in the possession of the Western countries,"" he added. Dr Andrei Illarionov, President Putin's chief economic adviser from 2000 to 2005, says a total energy embargo would be ""very effective"". While the oil and gas trade has continued during the conflict, widespread sanctions mean that a lot of other economic activity has stopped,many foreign companies have pulled outand exports have been disrupted. One recent survey by Russia's own central bank even forecasts the economy will shrink by 8% this year, while the International Institute of Finance says it could fall by as much as 15%. Dr Illarionov suggested that President Putin was prepared to endure a hit to the economy that shows where his priorities lie. ""His territorial ambitions, his imperial ambitions, are much more important than anything else, including the livelihood of the Russian population and of the financial situation in the country... even the financial state of the his government,"" he said. Prices are rising for many food items in Russia as the country feels the impact of international sanctions. Last week, amid tensions with Europe over how gas would be paid for, President Putin said that ""key indicators"" of the health of the Russian economy include the ""creation of jobs, the reduction of poverty and inequality, the improvement of the quality of life of people, the availability of goods and services"". World Bank figures suggest that almost 20 million Russians live in poverty. President Putin has, in recent years, pledged to halve that number. Now Dr Illarionov said ""we'll see probably doubling the number of those people, maybe even tripling"" as the economy struggles. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on...Russian gas and oil The Moscow-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic Research,estimated two million jobs,externalcould be lost this year as the unemployment rate rises from a record low. Those concerns are shared by Vladimir Milov, who is a former Russian deputy energy minister, but is now part ofAlexei Navalny'sRussia of the Future opposition party. ""Many people are concerned about losing their jobs, I think it's just that the majority does not really realise the severity of the economic situation,"" he said. Inflation, which has already risen to 15.7% because of the war, means people might stop spending money on things such as gyms and meals in restaurants and ""that's bad news for a lot of small businesses"", said Mr Milov. Some basic food items such as sugar, onions and cabbages have risen in price by more than 40% since the start of this year. Mr Milov said any noticeable falls in living standards would help his party's cause as an opposition. ""We have been explaining to people all along [that] Putin's policy would lead Russia into a catastrophe, including a complete social and economic catastrophe, including [a] deterioration of living standards that we haven't seen in decades,"" he said. ""I have to say that comes at an extremely high price. We would prefer not to see what is happening today."" Will Russia be able to pay its debts? Canada pledges to help states stop using Russian oil Ukraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank However Mr Milov, who fled to Lithuania last year, thinks it will take time for falling living standards to translate to political change. ""Russia is a country with big inertia in society, and a lot of fear instigated by the authorities. Specifically people really are very much afraid of protesting because right now they can end up in jail for a long, long time for doing that"". He added: ""But I would say [that within a] few months [of] real deep economic trouble, that we haven't seen in 30 years, it will change the mood of the society. More people will start to speak out loudly."" Dr Andrei Illarionov is seen here watching President Putin give a speech in 2004. President Putin's former adviser Dr Andrei Illarionov, who now lives in the United States, said a change of government is inevitable ""sooner or later"". He said ""it is absolutely impossible to have any positive future for Russia, with the current political regime"". Under President Putin, he suggested, ""there is no way that country might be integrated back into the international relations, in the world economy"".

"Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murthy in 2009, after meeting her as a student in California A Whitehall inquiry is under way into how the tax affairs of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife were leaked to the media, the BBC has been told. Akshata Murtyhas said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income, following a row over her non-domicile status. She owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her father - from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. Labour has said the row raises questions about Mr Sunak's judgement. Sunak held US green card until last year Smearing my wife to get at me is awful, says Sunak Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? As a non-domiciled (non-dom) UK resident, Ms Murty is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. The BBC estimates this would have saved her Â£2.1m a year in UK tax. After details of her non-dom status appeared in the press on Wednesday evening, Mr Sunak said his wife had not ""done anything wrong"" and it was unfair to attack her as a ""private citizen"". But on Friday, Ms Murty announced she would change her tax arrangements, telling the BBC she did not want to be a ""distraction"" for her husband. Asked about the U-turn on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the couple had recognised the situation ""offended against a British sense of fair play"". ""They recognise that there was a disconnect perhaps in the British public's understanding of what was appropriate, and they've corrected that situation now for the future,"" he added. No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff leaked damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. Elsewhere,Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Sunday Times,externalhe had claimed non-domicile status for six years when he was a banker, between 2000 and 2006. Anon-domis someone who lives in the UK but declares their permanent home to be in another country. It has been a bruising week for the chancellor, leading to him asking senior civil servants for a full investigation to establish who divulged his wife's tax status. His allies say very few people had access to the personal information, which Mr Sunak declared to Whitehall officials when he became a minister in 2018. Some Conservative MPs say he was naive to think the details would remain private, and that he should have predicted that the tax arrangements would be criticised as inappropriate, despite being legal. Mr Sunak's team has dismissed suggestions of a rift with Downing Street and say the prime minister has been ""incredibly supportive"". But Mr Sunak's brand - vigorously promoted since he came to office - has been damaged, with some Tories questioning his judgement. Friends have also confirmed to the BBCreports in the Sunday Mirror,externalthat the chancellor's wife and daughters are moving out of Downing Street and back to the family home in west London. Mr Sunak will join them at weekends. The decision is said to have been made well before this row hit the headlines. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said there remained a ""series of questions"" for the chancellor to answer - including whether he had declared his wife's tax status when taking ""policy decisions"" affecting non-dom households. She told the Sunday Morning programme: ""The lack of transparency does raise questions about conflict of interest. ""But it's also about basic fairness - and I don't think the chancellor still gets that, and that raises real questions about his judgement. ""The fact that they have changed their tax arrangements now shows that they do recognise it's a problem - but they wouldn't have done that if this hadn't been public."" The Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". Labour has previously advocated scrapping non-dom status entirely, under previous leaders Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn. Asked whether her party still held that position, Ms Cooper said its policy on non-doms was subject to a wider review of tax policy being undertaken by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read morehere.

"Mykola was forced into a school basement with dozens of others taken from their homes at gunpoint On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north of Kyiv and just outside the city of Chernihiv which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. When they entered, they took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. As we climbed down a short flight of stairs, we began to smell the stench of disease and decay. The room was dirty - some mattresses, clothes, shoes and books were strewn on the floor, there were four small cots in the centre and a stash of utensils in one corner. Mykola took us straight to the far end of the room. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" This video can not be played Watch: Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up Mykola said you couldn't move at all for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive, including babies. The youngest was just two months old. Russian forces were quick to reach villages such as Yahidne as they launched their assault on Chernihiv. For weeks the city of about 300,000 people was cut off as Russian forces surrounded and bombed it, having met resistance. They also destroyed a bridge on the road to the capital Kyiv, leaving residents with nowhere to flee. Now the Russians have withdrawn following their failure to take Kyiv. The BBC is one of the first news organisations to reach the area and the horror of what happened under both occupation and bombardment can be revealed. So close to the border, people worry too that the Russians could soon return. About 130 people spent four weeks here Fifteen-year-old Anastasiia was in the Yahidne basement along with her father and grandmother. ""There was barely any room. We were living sitting up. We were sleeping sitting up. Not that we slept at all. It was impossible. So many shells were landing around here. It was unbearable,"" she said. The room had no ventilation. Its two windows were boarded up. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most of them were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. Russian soldiers would not allow it every day. And because of the constant fighting outside - mortar shelling, explosions and gunfire - it was dangerous as well. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Anastasiia is scared and clearly suffering from the stress of weeks under siege ""It was very scary. I knew the people who died,"" says Anastasiia. ""They treated us very kindly. I felt so sad, they just died here for no reason."" ""In normal conditions, they would not have died. Putin is a war criminal,"" said Mykola. ""My feet had begun to swell up. But I kept thinking to myself, I have to survive. I have to, for my daughter and two granddaughters."" Most of the time people were not allowed to go out even to use a toilet. They were made to use buckets instead. ""Sometimes the soldiers took people out to use them as shields,"" Mykola said. They were allowed to cook on open fires outside twice a day. The village had enough food stocks and a well for water. One of the Russian soldiers told Mykola they had been told they would be in Ukraine for just four days, which would be enough to take over Kyiv. On 3 April, the Russians withdrew from Yahidne. Ukrainian soldiers are now in the village, and most of those who were trapped have been evacuated to areas nearby. ""I wake up many times every night. I feel like I can hear the sound of shooting. I run to my parents, scared,"" says Anastasiia. The Russians occupied villages like Yahidne around Chernihiv in a bid to lay siege to the city and eventually take control of it. They weren't able to enter the city, but there's been extensive destruction to many parts of it and officials say around 350 civilians have been killed. Air strikes destroyed Chernihiv apartment blocks Since Russia's withdrawal from around Chernihiv, volunteers have been burying the dead. One part of the local graveyard is now entirely full of fresh graves, with a placard stuck in each, for the purpose of identification. Families who have been separated have been coming to see if they can find the grave of their loved ones. A local football stadium was bombed, Ukrainian officials say by Russian aircraft. A giant crater can be seen in the centre of the field where one bomb fell. Another destroyed a part of the stands, now a mangled mess of broken plastic seats and metal railings. Next to the stadium, a children's library housed in a historic building has also been badly damaged. As we drove through the city, we passed several residential neighbourhoods which have been almost flattened. Some Chernihiv neighbourhoods have been flattened At Novoselivka, in the north of Chernihiv, destruction is visible as far as the eye can see. Piles of stones and bricks lie where homes must have stood. We saw a child's pink winter jacket, a teddy bear, a stuffed elephant and pieces of Lego on one of the paths going into the residential area. Along the way, we saw more bomb craters. A woman and child on bicycles gestured to us to follow them. Sixty-two-year-old Nina Vynnyk and her grandson, 10-year-old Danylo, wanted to show us their home -  only a shell now, everything in and around it has been destroyed. ""There is nothing left,"" says Nina Nina's daughter and Danylo's mother, 39-year-old Ludmyla, has lost her leg and is in hospital. When Nina's home began to be shelled, they ran to another person's house hoping to seek shelter in their basement. But that was bombed too. ""We were knocked out by the explosion. Someone got a concussion, someone was injured. When we came to our senses, I saw that my daughter was screaming, 'Mummy, mummy I don't have a leg'. It was horrible,"" she said. Ludmyla crawled to safety and was taken to a hospital. ""I feel like this is a terrible nightmare. It can't be true. Why didn't our government warn us? Why didn't they evacuate us,"" said Nina. Four generations of her family lived in the home. ""In one moment, there is nothing left. I don't know where I will live in the winter,"" she said. She can't afford to pay for prosthetics for her daughter. On Russian statements that they have not targeted civilians, she says, ""He [Putin] is full of lies. There is a woman in a hospital without a leg. That is the truth. ""Let Putin pay for her surgery. Let Putin build this house. He wanted it so much, didn't he? Let him pay for all of it now.""

"Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murthy in 2009, after meeting her as a student in California A Whitehall inquiry is under way into how the tax affairs of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife were leaked to the media, the BBC has been told. Akshata Murtyhas said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income, following a row over her non-domicile status. She owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her father - from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. Labour has said the row raises questions about Mr Sunak's judgement. Sunak held US green card until last year Smearing my wife to get at me is awful, says Sunak Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? As a non-domiciled (non-dom) UK resident, Ms Murty is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. The BBC estimates this would have saved her Â£2.1m a year in UK tax. After details of her non-dom status appeared in the press on Wednesday evening, Mr Sunak said his wife had not ""done anything wrong"" and it was unfair to attack her as a ""private citizen"". But on Friday, Ms Murty announced she would change her tax arrangements, telling the BBC she did not want to be a ""distraction"" for her husband. Asked about the U-turn on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the couple had recognised the situation ""offended against a British sense of fair play"". ""They recognise that there was a disconnect perhaps in the British public's understanding of what was appropriate, and they've corrected that situation now for the future,"" he added. No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff leaked damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. Elsewhere,Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Sunday Times,externalhe had claimed non-domicile status for six years when he was a banker, between 2000 and 2006. Anon-domis someone who lives in the UK but declares their permanent home to be in another country. It has been a bruising week for the chancellor, leading to him asking senior civil servants for a full investigation to establish who divulged his wife's tax status. His allies say very few people had access to the personal information, which Mr Sunak declared to Whitehall officials when he became a minister in 2018. Some Conservative MPs say he was naive to think the details would remain private, and that he should have predicted that the tax arrangements would be criticised as inappropriate, despite being legal. Mr Sunak's team has dismissed suggestions of a rift with Downing Street and say the prime minister has been ""incredibly supportive"". But Mr Sunak's brand - vigorously promoted since he came to office - has been damaged, with some Tories questioning his judgement. Friends have also confirmed to the BBCreports in the Sunday Mirror,externalthat the chancellor's wife and daughters are moving out of Downing Street and back to the family home in west London. Mr Sunak will join them at weekends. The decision is said to have been made well before this row hit the headlines. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said there remained a ""series of questions"" for the chancellor to answer - including whether he had declared his wife's tax status when taking ""policy decisions"" affecting non-dom households. She told the Sunday Morning programme: ""The lack of transparency does raise questions about conflict of interest. ""But it's also about basic fairness - and I don't think the chancellor still gets that, and that raises real questions about his judgement. ""The fact that they have changed their tax arrangements now shows that they do recognise it's a problem - but they wouldn't have done that if this hadn't been public."" The Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". Labour has previously advocated scrapping non-dom status entirely, under previous leaders Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn. Asked whether her party still held that position, Ms Cooper said its policy on non-doms was subject to a wider review of tax policy being undertaken by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read morehere.

The Ferrari driver was in total control of the race when his main rival Max Verstappen retired with a technical failure on his Red Bull at two-thirds distance. Verstappen is 46 points - almost two clear wins - behind Leclerc after just three races of the season, in two of which the Red Bull has failed to finish. Red Bull's Sergio Perez was second after winning battles with Mercedes drivers George Russell and Lewis Hamilton. Remarkably, in the context of Mercedes' disappointing start to the season, Russell is second in the drivers' championship at this early stage and Mercedes second in the constructors' chase.

"Scott Morrison has been Australia's prime minister since 2018 Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called a federal election for 21 May. Mr Morrison's ruling coalition holds 76 seats in the House of Representatives - the minimum needed to retain power. Polls suggest there will be a change of government, with the opposition Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese, tipped to take office. However, in the last election, the centre-right Mr Morrison won despite most polls predicting otherwise. Mr Morrison announced the date after talks with the Governor General in the capital, Canberra. ""It's a choice between a strong future and an uncertain one. It's a choice between a government you know and a Labor opposition that you don't,"" the prime minister said on Sunday. But Mr Albanese - pointing outMr Morrison's own deputy prime minister called him ""a hypocrite and a liar""- argued that ""we can and must do better"". ""The pandemic has given us the opportunity to imagine a better future and Labor has the policies and plans to shape that future,"" he said on Sunday. Is Australian democracy in good health? Mr Morrison is the first leader to serve a full term in office since John Howard, who won four elections before losing to Labor's Kevin Rudd in 2007. Since then, what observers call the ""coup culture"" of Australian politics has led to a series of short-lived premierships. Mr Morrison's Liberal-led coalition is defending a one-seat majority. Even though it has won seven of the past nine federal elections, it may be hard-pressed to do so again, say political analysts. In recent weeks,the prime minister has faced accusations of being a bullyand once sabotaging a rival's career by suggesting the man's Lebanese heritage made him less electable. Mr Morrison has denied the allegations. But despite the most recent polling putting Labor ahead, Mr Albanese has called his opponents the ""favourites"", noting his party has only won government from opposition three times since World War Two. by Phil Mercer in Sydney A ""complete blank page"" or ""a bully with no moral compass""? On 21 May, Australians will choose between an opposition leader accused by opponents of being clueless and inexperienced, or an incumbent prime minister who's fending off allegations of racism and an intimidatory style of leadership. Scott Morrison's centre-right government is under pressure, but it's led by a former marketing executive who's become a political survivor and defied the polls to win the so-called ""miracle"" election in 2019. Remarkably, Mr Morrison is the first Australian prime minister to serve a full term since John Howard. His Labor challenger, Anthony Albanese, presents himself as a measured, gently progressive alternative. The handling of the pandemic and natural disasters, as well as national security and the environment, will sway voters, but as the cost of living rises, the 21 May poll will ultimately be decided by one dominant issue - the economy.
