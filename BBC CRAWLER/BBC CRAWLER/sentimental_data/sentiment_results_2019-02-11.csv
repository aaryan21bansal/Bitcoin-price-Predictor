"The net independence plan is seen as a way for Russia's government to get more control over online life Russia is considering whether to disconnect from the global internet briefly, as part of a test of its cyber-defences. The test will mean data passing between Russian citizens and organisations stays inside the nation rather than being routed internationally. A draft law mandating technical changes needed to operate independently was introduced to its parliament last year. The test is expected to happen before 1 April but no exact date has been set. The draft law, called the Digital Economy National Program, requires Russia's ISPs to ensure that it can operate in the event of foreign powers acting to isolate the country online. Nato and its allies have threatened to sanction Russia over the cyber-attacks and other online interference which it is regularly accused of instigating. The measures outlined in the law include Russia building its own version of the net's address system, known as DNS, so it can operate if links to these internationally-located servers are cut. Currently, 12 organisations oversee the root servers for DNS and none of them are in Russia. However many copies of the net's core address book do already exist inside Russia suggesting its net systems could keep working even if punitive action was taken to cut it off. The test is also expected to involve ISPs demonstrating that they can direct data to government-controlled routing points. These will filter traffic so that data sent between Russians reaches its destination, but any destined for foreign computers is discarded. Eventually the Russian government wants all domestic traffic to pass through these routing points. This is believed to be part of an effort to set up a mass censorship system akin to that seen in China, which tries to scrub out prohibited traffic. Russian news organisations reported that the nation's ISPs are broadly backing the aims of the draft law but are divided on how to do it. They believe the test will cause ""major disruption"" to Russian internet traffic,reports tech news website ZDNet.,external The Russian government is providing cash for ISPs to modify their infrastructure so the redirection effort can be properly tested. How does an entire country ""unplug"" itself from the internet? It's important to understand a little about how the internet works. It is essentially a series of thousands of digital networks along which information travels. These networks are connected by router points - and they are notoriously the weakest link in the chain. What Russia wants to do is to bring those router points that handle data entering or exiting the country within its borders and under its control- so that it can then pull up the drawbridge, as it were, to external traffic if it's under threat - or if it decides to censor what outside information people can access. China's firewall is probably the world's best known censorship tool and it has become a sophisticated operation. It also polices its router points, using filters and blocks on keywords and certain websites and redirecting web traffic so that computers cannot connect to sites the state does not wish Chinese citizens to see. It is possible to get around some firewalls using virtual private networks (VPNs) - which disguise the location of a computer so the filters do not kick in - but some regimes are more tolerant of them than others.China cracks down on them from time to timeand the punishment for providing or using illegal VPNs can be a prison sentence. Occasionally countries disconnect themselves by accident - Mauritania was left offline for two days in 2018 after the undersea fibre cable that supplied its internet was cut, possibly by a trawler.

"This video can not be played Dame Frances Cairncross explains the findings of her review into the future of the UK news industry A regulator should oversee tech giants like Google and Facebook to ensure their news content is trustworthy, a government-backed report has suggested. The Cairncross Review into the future of UK news said such sites should help users identify fake news and ""nudge people towards news of high quality"". The review also said Ofcom should assess the BBC's impact on online news on other providers. In addition, the report called for a new Institute for Public Interest News. Such a body, it said, could work in a similar way to the Arts Council, channelling public and private funding to ""those parts of the industry it deemed most worthy of support"". Last local paper closes, so ring MP for news Amol Rajan's media predictions for 2019 Governments v social media The report said Facebook and Google need to give more prominence to public interest news The independent review, undertaken by former journalist Dame Frances Cairncross, was tasked with investigating the sustainability of high-quality journalism. Its recommendations include measures to tackle ""the uneven balance of power"" between news publishers and online platforms that distribute their content. Services such as Facebook, Google and Apple should continue their attempts to help readers understand how reliable a story is, and the process that decides which stories are shown should be more transparent, it says. ""Their efforts should be placed under regulatory scrutiny - this task is too important to leave entirely to the judgment of commercial entities,"" according to the report. Could a digital regulator stop the spread of so-called 'fake news'? A regulator would initially only assess how well these sites are performing - but if this doesn't work, the report warns ""it may be necessary to impose stricter provisions"". Yet the report falls short of requiring Facebook, Google and other tech giants to pay for the news they distribute via their platforms. Dame Frances told the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan that ""draconian and risky"" measures could result in firms such as Google withdrawing their news services altogether. ""There are a number of ways we have suggested technology companies could behave differently and could be made to behave differently,"" she said. ""But they are mostly ways that don't immediately involve legislation."" The review was not asked to comment specifically on the BBC but concluded that curtailing the corporation's news offering would be counter-productive after hearing arguments from other publishers that the BBC reporting on so-called ""soft content"" online was crowding out other news providers. The review noted that the BBC Charter states the corporation should endeavour to reach all demographics, and that stories of this type are essential to appeal to an increasingly elusive younger audience. The BBC also argues that ""soft content"" stories may attract users who might then click onwards to a public-interest news story. The review said the BBC was delivering high quality journalism but suggested it ""could do more and think more carefully about how its news provision can act as a complement, rather than a substitute, for private news provision"". Dame Frances also recommended an exploration of the market impact of BBC News, conducted by broadcasting regulator Ofcom, to find whether it is 'striking the right balance' and driving traffic to other, commercial providers. The BBC should do more to share its technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers, the report concluded. The review suggests it would 'make little sense to curtail the BBC' Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson urged the government to tackle Google and Facebook's ""duopoly"" in the digital advertising market, and said Dame Frances was ""barking up the wrong tree"" in recommending an inquiry into the BBC's online news output. Meanwhile, former director general of the BBC Greg Dyke defended the role of the corporation. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It seems to me that at a time when large American media companies - the likes of Netflix and the rest of it - are going to come to dominate in the world, for the BBC to be cutting back on anything will be a mistake. ""The importance of the BBC is going to grow in the next 10 years, not decline."" Frances Cairncross earned widespread respect as a journalist for her hard-headed and pragmatic approach to economics. That pragmatism is the very reason the government commissioned her to look at the future of high-quality news - and also the reason many in local and regional media will be disappointed by her recommendations. What is most notable about her review is what it doesn't do. It doesn't suggest all social media should be regulated in the UK It doesn't suggest social media companies pay for the privilege of using news content It doesn't suggest social media companies be treated as publishers, with legal liability for all that appears on their platform This is because the practicalities of doing these things are difficult, and experience shows that the likes of Google will simply pull out of markets that don't suit them. There are concrete measures that could boost local news, from tax relief to an extension of the Local Democracy Reporting Service. And Dame Frances certainly seemed cognisant of the argument that BBC News has over-reached, to the extent that it is harming the commercial sector. But this is a matter for Ofcom. Ultimately, as this report acknowledges, when it comes to news, convenience is king. The speed, versatility and zero cost of so much news now means that, even if it is of poor quality, a generation of consumers has fallen out of the habit of paying for news. But quality costs. If quality news has a future, consumers will have to pay. That's the main lesson of this report. The report recommends ""new codes of conduct"" whose implementation would be supervised by a regulator ""with powers to insist on compliance"". Other recommendations included: Tax relief to encourage the provision of local journalism Expanding financial support for local news by extending the BBC'sLocal Democracy Reporting Service An investigation of the online advertising market, conducted by the Competition and Markets Authority, to ensure fair competition The Barnsley Chronicle goes to press in September 2017 One local newspaper editor welcomed the report's recommendations but said it ""comes too late for so many once proud and important community newspapers"". The Yorkshire Post's James Mitchinson said: ""The various fiscal reviews and recommendations... must come quickly... if we are to turn the Cairncross Review into something which we look back upon as being instrumental in preserving what we do for generations to come."" Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said some of its suggestions could be acted upon ""immediately"", while others would need ""further careful consideration"".

"Horses at Simon Crisford's Newmarket stables - one of two yards with infected animals Horse racing in Britain will resume on Wednesday after a six-day shutdown following an outbreak of equine flu. Two scheduled jump racing fixtures will go ahead at Musselburgh and Plumpton, alongside the all-weather fixtures at Southwell and Kempton. Racing was suspended after three cases of equine flu at Donald McCain's Cheshire stables. Three further cases were later reported at his yard. A total of 174 racing stables had been placed in lockdown. Trainers will be assessed before they are given the all-clear to have runners, while five races called off during the shutdown have been rescheduled and Ascot will stage a bumper nine-race card on Saturday. The Denman Chase, which had been due to feature last year's Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Native River, and the Betfair Hurdle will be staged at Ascot after Newbury's meeting on 9 February was cancelled. How the equine flu outbreak hit racing A decision to resume racing in a ""controlled, risk-managed manner"" was unanimously supported by an industry veterinary committee, said the British Horseracing Authority (BHA). The committee felt there had been ""an unprecedented amount"" of the highly contagious virus in Europe, and it was essential precautions were taken to protect horses. ""Clearly there is some risk associated with returning to racing,"" said the BHA's chief regulatory officer Brant Dunshea. ""This risk has been assessed and, based on the evidence - and ensuring biosecurity measures are in place - the level of risk is viewed as acceptable."" This video can not be played Equine flu: Inside the Newmarket laboratory that detected the outbreak Fears there would be an extended suspension of racing, and a potential impact on next month's Cheltenham Festival, were raised when a second outbreak, involving four vaccinated horses, was confirmed late on Sunday at trainer Simon Crisford's Newmarket yard. But no further positive results were found after thousands of samples were analysed. While equine influenza is not unlike human flu - with typical symptoms including a cough and high temperature - it limits the competitive capability of racehorses. All racing in Britain has been suspended since 7 February, with 23 meetings lost during the shutdown. Jump racing's showpiece Cheltenham Festival is scheduled to take place from 12 to 15 March. ""Our approach since hearing about the first positive results last Wednesday has been based on accumulating as much information as we could as quickly as possible so we could properly understand the risks of this virulent strain of flu spreading to more horses,"" said Dunshea. ""That would be harmful to them and damaging to any trainers' yards that became infected. ""It has also been our intention to ensure that we avoid an issue that could result in a long-term disruption to racing with the risk of many of our major events being unduly impacted."" Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent The top line of this story, that racing's unscheduled hibernation is over, is clearly a good one for the sport. However, it's not all sweetness and light. I'm hearing from stables around the country that the six-month vaccination requirement - down from a year - will hold things up as trainers give their horses a day or two off after the jab. We await detail of what restrictions are to be placed on stables that are considered to have been more at risk to exposure to the virus than others, and just what the criteria are. So racing will be back on Wednesday but maybe with a few holes in the programme.

"The body of Alesha MacPhail was discovered in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year A boy accused of abducting, raping and murdering a six year-old girl is blaming someone else for the crime. The 16-year-old went on trial charged with killing Alesha MacPhail on the Isle of Bute in July last year. The teenager - who cannot be named because of his age - pleaded not guilty when he appeared in court. Brian McConnachie QC lodged a special defence on behalf of his client claiming the crime was committed by a woman called Toni Louise McLachlan. At a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow, prosecutors allege the boy accused was armed with a knife when he took Alesha from her bed at a house in Ardbeg Road in Rothesay, Bute. It is claimed he then carried the schoolgirl to the site of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel on the island. The indictment states he took off Alesha's clothes, shook her violently before placing his hands over her nose, mouth and around her neck. The boy is said to have ""applied pressure"" to her face, inflicted injuries by ""means unknown"" with prosecutors alleging he went on to rape and murder Alesha. The teenager faces a separate charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. It is alleged he went to another house in Ardbeg Road before disposing of the clothes he had worn and then taking a shower to remove blood from his body. This is said to have been done in a bid to ""destroy or conceal evidence"". No evidence was heard on Monday. Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC instead read out two joint minutes of evidence agreed between the Crown and the boy's lawyers. Jurors were told Alesha's naked body was found by a man at 08:54 on 2 July in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel. The child was pronounced dead around 30 minutes later at 09:23. Mr McSporran said: ""She had been murdered. Following a post mortem examination of her remains, the cause of death was established as 'pressure to neck and face'."" The court also heard it was Alesha's gran Angela King who had reported the girl missing at 06:23 on 2 July. Lord Matthews told jurors the case was likely to ""arouse strong emotion"" but that they were to adopt a ""professional detachment"" to the evidence. The trial continues.

"(L-R) Keegan, Tilly Rose, Olly and Riley died in the blaze in the early hours of 5 February A house fire which killed four children was not caused by cannabis growth or a boiler exploding, police have said. Riley Holt, eight, Keegan Unitt, six, Tilly Rose Unitt, four, and Olly Unitt, three, died in the blaze in Highfields in Stafford last Tuesday. Staffordshire Police said they had ruled out both as possible causes of the fire amid speculation online. A woman, 24, and a man, 28, arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence, have been bailed. A spokesman for the force told the BBC they could ""rule out cannabis growth [sic] and also do not believe the boiler is involved"" after social media speculation mounted over the cause of the fire. They said investigative work was ongoing. The woman and man are currently living at an address out of the area. They were detained by officers at about 13:30 GMT on Friday and have been bailed until March. The family are being supported by specialist police officers The children's 24-year-old mother, Natalie Unitt, and her 28-year-old partner, Chris Moulton,leapt from a first-floor window with the siblings' two-year-old brother, Jack, during the fire. They did not sustain life-threatening injuries. A fundraising page for the family has since raised over Â£30,000 - with more than 1,900 people donating.

"Debenhams has secured a cash injection of Â£40m to buy it extra time as it battles to secure a longer-term deal with lenders. The struggling department store chaincalled it a ""first step"",externaltowards a sustainable future. The firm - which issued three profit warnings last year - is in talks with lenders over renegotiating its debts. It is alsotrying to accelerate plans to close storesand is expected to close around 20 outlets this year. The extra money will extend the retailer's current Â£520m borrowing facilities with banks for 12 months and enable it to continue talks over a longer-term refinancing. News of the funding sent the retailer's shares surging almost 40% in early trade. Debenhams chief executive Sergio Bucher said: ""Today's announcement represents the first step in our refinancing process. ""The support of our lenders for our turnaround plan is important to underpin a comprehensive solution that will take account of the interests of all stakeholders and deliver a sustainable and profitable future."" Debenhams may close stores this year Debenhams closure plan threatens 4,000 jobs Christmas retail winners and losers Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""This debt agreement is a lifeline for Debenhams, but isn't going to solve its fundamental problems. ""Trading conditions remain extremely challenging and the business has a tightrope to walk between cutting costs and investing in improvements."" High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less. Debenhams - which has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people - reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m last year and said more recently that sales had fallen sharply over Christmas. It also announced last year that it would close up to 50 storeswithin three to five years, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The chain has not yet named which stores it plans to close. However, it is nowtrying to secure an insolvency dealthat would enable it to bring forward the closure of around 20 department store chains to this year. The deal - known as a company voluntary arrangement - would also allow the chain to renegotiate its rents with landlords. The chain has not yet named which stores it plans to close. Debenhams has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people. Mr Khalaf said: ""Debenhams' longer term prospects are still in the balance, and recent data showing a deterioration in the UK economy isn't exactly going to help matters. ""For now, Debenhams has kicked the can down the road, but will have to come back for some tough negotiations with quite a lot of internal dissent amongst its stakeholders."" Last year, rival department store chain House of Fraser fell into administration before Mike Ashley, the billionaire Sports Direct founder, bought the department store's assets for Â£90m. Mr Ashley is also a major shareholder in Debenhams, with a 29% stake, and he recently joined together with investor Landmark Groupto vote the retailer's chairman and chief executive off the board. Mr Bucher is continuing as chief executive of Debenhams but no longer sits on the board, while Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down immediately as chairman.

"The UK food industry has threatened to stop co-operating with government policy consultations, saying it is busy trying to stave off the ""catastrophic impact"" of a no-deal Brexit. The warning came in a letter to Environment Secretary Michael Gove from more than 30 business leaders. They said it looked ""ever more the likeliest outcome"" that the UK would leave the EU without an agreement. The government said leaving the EU with a deal remained its ""top priority"". ""We are meeting weekly with representatives from our food and drink industry to help prepare for all scenarios,"" said a spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. But the food industry said the current situation was a ""moment of potential crisis"" for their industry. Those signing the letter included the heads of the Food and Drink Federation, the National Farmers' Union and UK Hospitality. Members of the various trade bodies include Mondelez subsidiary Cadbury; KP Snacks, which makes Hula Hoops; and Butterkist popcorn, as well as consumer goods giant Nestle. ""Neither we nor our members have the physical resources nor organisational bandwidth to engage with and properly respond to non-Brexit related policy consultations or initiatives at this time,"" they wrote. ""Government has recruited many extra staff; we cannot."" Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: A really simple guide What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy? The firms urge the government to place a range of current and planned industry consultations on ""pause"" until the Brexit uncertainty is over. The consultations the firms cite include one relating to further curbs on the advertising of sugary foods, a national recycling collection strategy and proposals for a tax on plastic items with less than 30% recycled content. The letter,first reported by Sky,,externalis further evidence of the industry's frustration at the continuing lack of certainty over the Brexit process. ""Businesses throughout the UK food chain - and their trade associations - are now totally focused on working to mitigate the catastrophic impact of a no-deal Brexit,"" says the letter, which was sent last Friday. ""Large amounts of time, money, people and effort are being diverted to that end."" The letter comes just two weeksafter major retailers warned MPsthat a no-deal Brexit would cause huge disruption to the industry, leading to higher prices and empty shelves in the short-term.

"The squadron of drones would have an expected cost of Â£7m ""Swarm squadrons"" of drones are to be deployed by British armed forces to overwhelm enemy air defences, the defence secretary has said. Gavin Williamson said the specially-adapted drones could be in operation by the end of 2019. He also warned in a speech that the UK needs a bolder and stronger armed forces prepared to use ""hard power"". Labour has said the military's role on the international stage had been ""completely undermined"" by Tory cuts. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute, Mr Williamson said Britain must stand up to those who ""flout international law"". There was an extra Â£1.8bn for defence in the last budget and Mr Williamson said Brexit had brought the UK its ""greatest opportunity"" to strengthen its global presence. He said the military's cyber capabilities will be reinforced to defend and launch attacks. The squadrons of ""network enabled"" drones would cost around Â£7m, he added. Mr Williamson says the UK needs a bigger and bolder armed forces By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Gavin Williamson will struggle to match his global ambitions with the realities of an already overstretched defence budget and a smaller British armed forces. MPs say there is already a growing black hole in the MoD's Â£180bn equipment plan. But instead of making cuts, Mr Williamson is adding more to his shopping list. He wants two new ""multi-role vessels"" to support Royal Marines in a range of operations from humanitarian support to war-fighting. This he believes could be done cheaply by converting civilian cargo ships but there is still no costs or mention of who will crew them - the Royal Navy certainly does not have the manpower. Mr Williamson talks of introducing swarm squadrons of drones to overcome an enemy's air defences. The MoD believes the technology could be bought ""off the shelf"" but, in truth, the concept is still untried and untested. The MoD still insists these plans have all been costed but its past financial record will give many a reason to doubt. Detailing plans to modernise the armed forces, he said it must increase its ""mass and lethality"" - revealing plans for two ships that could be deployed for crisis support as well as military operations. He said they would be able to respond ""at a moment's notice"" to support the Royal Marines. According to the MoD, the UK could purchase and adapt cargo ships or ferries with existing hulls to create the new vessels. The defence secretary also confirmed the Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is being deployed to the Pacific region, where China has been involved in adispute over territorial claims in the South China Sea. The carrier will take part in the mission along with F-35 jets from the UK and US. The Royal Navy's HMS Queen Elizabeth is being deployed to the Pacific region Mr Williamson said Britain and its allies had to be ready ""to use hard power to support our interests"". He told those gathered for his speech that ""state-on-state competition was reviving"". The defence secretary said Russia is ""resurgent"" and rebuilding its military arsenal, adding that China is also developing its modern capability and commercial power. He said: ""We have to be ready to show the high price of aggressive behaviour. Ready to strengthen our resilience."" Defending interventionist policy, he said the cost of failing to act in global crises had often been ""unacceptably high"", and that Western powers cannot ""walk on by when others are in need"". ""To talk but fail to act risks our nation being seen as little more than a paper tiger,"" he added. Mr Williamson said Brexit brought an ""unparalleled opportunity"" to consider how the UK could maximise its influence around the world. He said the UK would build new alliances and rekindle old ones, and shared his belief that Britain ""should be the nation that people turn to when the world needs leadership"". But shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said the UK's ability to play such a role had been ""completely undermined by eight years of Tory defence cuts"". ""The Conservatives have slashed the defence budget by over Â£9bn in real terms since 2010 and they are cutting armed forces numbers year after year. ""Instead of simply engaging in yet more sabre-rattling, Gavin Williamson should get to grips with the crisis in defence funding that is happening on his watch,"" she said.

"Amber went missing from her home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on 30 May 2015 and was found hanged in bushes three days later The mother and stepfather of a girl found hanged in bushes have told an inquest she lied about being given punishments and chores to do at home. Amber Peat, 13, told a teacher her stepfatherwoke her up in the night to finish choresand forced her to wear baggy grey jogging bottoms to school. However, Kelly and Daniel Peat both said these allegations were untrue. In fact, Mrs Peat said her daughter had chosen to wear the grey jogging bottoms to school herself. Mr Peat said he was not even there when his stepdaughter left for school wearing the jogging bottoms. This video can not be played The couple appeared at a press conference in the days following Amber's disappearance ""Nobody made her wear them,"" Mr Peat said. ""I had nothing to do with it."" Mrs Peat said Amber had been ""adamant she wanted to wear them"", but the coroner Laurinda Bower pointed out Amber had arrived at school ""sobbing"". She asked Mrs Peat: ""Do you have any idea why Amber, having chosen to wear this outfit, a short time later attended her form and told her form tutor she had been made to wear this ridiculous outfit by her stepfather as punishment?"" Mrs Peat replied: ""I don't know why she would have said that."" Amber went missing from her home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on 30 May 2015 and wasfound hanged in bushes three days later. Amber had a door ""shut in her face"" before going to hang herself Amber told the same form tutor that Mr Peat forced her to carry her belongings to school in a plastic bag as punishment, but Mr and Mrs Peat said this was a lie too. ""We bought her a school bag that came back broken,"" said Mrs Peat. ""I told her to grab anything, she needed something."" Amber's stepfather said: ""There were several occasions Amber came home without her school bag. I wasn't aware of somebody saying 'you must take the carrier bag'."" When asked about Amber apparently being woken up at night to finish chores, Mr and Mrs Peat both said this was not true either. Mr Peat said Amber was made to do chores as punishment, but it was usually just ""to wash the pots"". The inquest previously heard that Amber complained to her teacher about being punished and made to do chores Mr and Mrs Peat told the inquest about the last moments they saw Amber alive, in which she had a door ""shut in her face"" as the coroner described it. The inquest previously heard Amber was upset after being asked to clean a cool box. Mr and Mrs Peat both said they were sitting in the living room while Amber was in the hallway. Their accounts of what happened next differed after this point. Amber's mother told the inquest: ""She was stood in the hallway with the cool box in her hand and she was just staring at me. I asked her what was going on but she was just staring at me. ""I kept asking her 'What's wrong? What's going on?' ""She stood there and she was just staring so I shut the door to."" Amber's body was found in Westfield Lane, about a mile from her home in Bosworth Street The coroner pointed out this account differed from her police statement, in which she said Amber had repeated ""Mum, Mum, Mum"", before her mother apparently said she did not want to talk to her. ""Was Amber saying 'Mum, Mum, Mum?"" asked the coroner. Mrs Peat replied: ""I don't remember."" Recalling the same incident, Mr Peat said Amber was saying: ""You are my mum and I want to talk to you. Mum, Mum, Mum."" Mr and Mrs Peat agreed Amber had been left alone in the hallway after Mrs Peat shut the door. They then remained sitting in the living room, they said, and heard the door slam as Amber left the house. This was at about 17:15 or 17:30 BST. Amber was reported missing almost eight hours later, by which time she had died. Mr and Mrs Peat both told the inquest they went looking for Amber, but said they also did some shopping at Tesco, got the car washed and had a meal before calling police. They said this was because Amber had gone missing before but usually returned home. Amber's biological father Adrian Cook asked Mr Peat if he considered going to Tesco and having the car washed when his stepdaughter was missing as ""neglecting her well-being"", to which he replied ""no"". Earlier, Mrs Peat told the inquest Amber and Mr Peat would sometimes ""butt heads"" over chores. She said: ""He would say, 'do this' and she would say no - and Danny got to the point where he wasn't getting anywhere and he would say, 'you talk to her'."" Mrs Peat also said Amber had not run away while Mr Peat had been serving time in prison for tax fraud. The inquest continues.

"This video can not be played Nick Kwek toured the border dividing the US state of Arizona and Mexico's Sonora Democratic and Republican negotiators are working into the night to try to reach a deal on border security and avoid another government shutdown. They remain divided on the detention of undocumented immigrants and on funding for President Donald Trump's promised border wall with Mexico. Mr Trump said on Monday ""it is up Democrats"" to make a deal or take the blame for a renewed shutdown. The previous shutdown lasted 35 days and was the longest in US history. Congress has until Friday to pass legislation before the current federal funding agreement runs out. The previous shutdown ended on 25 January as lawmakers agreed to negotiate. If a new agreement is not reached by both the House of Representatives and the Senate - and signed by the president - a partial government shutdown will begin again on Saturday. What is a government shutdown? How the last US shutdown hurt Trump's wall: How tech fills the gaps During the last shutdown, hundreds of thousands of workers were furloughed (put on unpaid leave) in December and January while others in essential services, such as hospital care, air traffic control and law enforcement, worked without pay. Mr Trump approved a congressional measure to pay back federal workers last month, but many say they have yet to receive their paycheques, according to US media. It remains unclear whether contracted workers will get any such payments. The shutdown's cost to the US economy wasestimated at $11bn (Â£8.5bn).,external The talks are taking place in Washington, just as President Trump is about to hold a rally in the border city of El Paso, in Texas, aimed at gathering support for the border wall. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy and Republican Senator Richard Shelby said they hoped to strike a deal on Monday. Sen Leahy said the goal was to ""wrap this up tonight, do it tonight and not tomorrow"". Some 17 Republican and Democratic negotiators from the Senate and the House have been holding talks to try to reach a border security agreement that can be accepted by Congress. The latest impasse seems to be centred on a Democratic demand to limit the number of undocumented migrants already in the US who can be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Democrats want to cap the number of beds at detention centres reserved for those cases at 16,500. By doing that, they hope to force ICE to focus on detaining irregular migrants with criminal records instead of those who have overstayed their visas and, Democrats say, are productive and offer no threat. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? ICE Deputy Director Matt Albence said on Monday that the proposal would be ""damaging to public safety"". ""This is a crucial public safety issueâ¦ There really shouldn't be a debate about us taking dangerous criminals and immigration violators off the street and out of our communities,"" he said during a White House conference call with reporters. On Monday, Mr Trump tweeted that the ""Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy!."" During a later White House event before his departure for Texas Mr Trump continued the attack: ""Not only don't they want to give us the money for the wall, they don't want to give us the space to detain murderers, criminals, drug dealers, human smugglers."" The Democrats are also looking at between $1.3bn and $2bn in funding for Mr Trump's proposed border wall, a long way off the $5.7bn the president has been demanding. President Trump tweeted that ""angry"" Democratsneeded to ""loosen up and have some fun"",external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The president had earliersaid that Democrats were ""behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally"",external. As wall discussions labour on, Mr Trump plans on sending more than 3,700 active troops to the US-Mexico border to help agents with security efforts this month. With more than 2,000 troops already at the border, the new deployment would top November's mid-term election-time numbers of 5,900. Meanwhile, pushing back against the Trump administration's call for border states to help with security, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has recalled hundreds of the state's national guard from the border. Gov Newsom's move follows that of his Democratic colleague, Gov Michelle Grisham of New Mexico, who pulled her state's troops from the border last week. Both governors have cited the withdrawal as retaliation against Mr Trump's ""fear-mongering"". On 25 January, President Trump agreed to a three-week spending deal to end the shutdown and allow Congress to reach an agreement. That funding ends at midnight on Friday.Another short-term deal could prevent a new shutdown,external, according to the New York Times. Mr Trump made building a wall on the border with Mexico one of his key promises in the 2016 campaign. The effects of an immigration raid on one tiny town Trump's border wall in seven charts The president has backed away from calls to make Mexico pay for a concrete wall but during his State of the Union speech last Tuesday - delayed because of the previous shutdown - he insisted on a ""smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier"". This video can not be played Just why did the US government partially shut down? He has previously threatened to declare a national emergency and fund the wall without Congress. But this idea is disliked even by some fellow Republicans, and Democrats are likely to challenge it in the courts.

"Robert Barnes was jailed for two years and four months A rail enthusiast and his wife tackled a butter knife-wielding burglar who tried to steal a prized collection of model trains, a court heard. John Headington, 85, and his 57-year-old wife Susan sat on Robert Barnes to restrain him after the break-in. Lincoln Crown Court heard Barnes used a brick to smash his way into the house while the couple slept on 20 November. Barnes, 28, admitted burglary and possession of a bladed article and was jailed for two years and four months. The court heard Mrs Headington was woken by the sound of Barnes, of no fixed address, breaking in through the kitchen door of the Lincolnshire home. Andrew Scott, prosecuting, said she saw a light on in an upstairs room where her husband kept his model railway collection and decided to ring the police. Former railway worker Mr Headington, who has had two hip replacements, managed to get Barnes in a bear hug as he emerged from the room carrying some of his most valuable model trains. Latest news from across Lincolnshire Mr Scott said: ""Barnes barged past Mr Headington who fell backwards against the landing wall.

"Michael Jackson, pictured in 1999, died in 2009 at the age of 50 Channel 4 is to air a controversial documentary about Michael Jackson, despite receiving a letter of complaint from the late singer's estate. Leaving Neverland focuses on two men who claim the pop superstar abused them when they were children. The family of the late singer have asked the broadcaster not to show it, saying the film-makers did not ask them for a response to the allegations. In a statement, Channel 4 said it had followed the right response procedure. ""Channel 4 viewers will make their own judgement about the testimony of the two victims interviewed in the film,"" it said. Michael Jackson documentary 'disturbing' Jackson estate attacks 'lurid' documentary Jermaine Jackson: 'Michael is innocent' In the letter, which was released to the Associated Press, the Jackson estate claimed the documentary's makers broke programming guidelines by failing to get a response from the singer's family and friends. ""I think we can all agree that the false allegations being made in your 'documentary' are 'significant allegations',"" the letter said. ""It is hard to imagine more significant accusations that can possibly be made against anyone."" A similar letter was also sent to US broadcaster HBO, which co-produced the documentary. Leaving Neverland will be broadcast on Channel 4 on 6 and 7 March. It includes interviews with Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who were aged seven and 10 when the singer befriended them and their families. Mr Robson acted as a main witness for Michael Jackson at his 2005 trial, but has now changed his story. Channel 4 said the film does include a response to the allegations in the form of footage of Jackson's own denials. ""The documentary deals with the criminal trials and civil court cases and any involvement our principal interviewees had in those,"" the broadcaster's statement said. ""It is not unusual for victims of child sex abuse to only feel able to disclose what happened to them in later life."" The documentary, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month, has also been defended by its director, Dan Reed. ""Anyone who sees the film will know it is solely about hearing the stories of two specific individuals and their families in their own words, and that is a focus we are very proud of,"" he said.

"Labour members have been protesting against anti-Semitism in the party The Labour Party has received 673 complaints in 10 months alleging acts of anti-Semitism by its members. A letter from the party's general secretary, Jennie Formby, revealed the figures after she was pushed by MPs for specific details. She said 96 members were immediately suspended from the party for their conduct between April 2018 and January 2019, and 12 were expelled. But in a letter, a group of MPs said there was still a lack of information. Labour has struggled to contain a long-running row over anti-Semitism. At a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) last week, MPs unanimously passed a motion urging the leadership to do more to tackle it. They also called for specific details about how many people were being investigated, how many letters had been written to those accused telling to them to desist and what punishments had been given. Ms Formby said: ""I totally reject the suggestion that the existence of anti-Semitism in our party is a smear. I have seen hard evidence of it and that is why I have been so determined to do whatever is possible to eliminate it from the party."" But Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge tweeted a warning not to trust the figures and said she was not convinced the party's leadership were ""serious on rooting out anti-Semitism"". Labour MPs urge more action on anti-Semitism A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Labour adopts anti-Semitism definition Ahead of Monday's PLP meeting, Ms Formby, who did not attend, wrote to MPs to provide more detail. She said the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) previously believed that statistics on disciplinary matters should remain confidential and not be published. But after MPs rejected her proposal of having three elected members monitoring the figures regularly, she said she ""pushed hard"" to get the NEC to agree to publish them. The data published revealed: 673 complaints of anti-Semitism by Labour Party members were received - a Labour spokesman said this represented about 0.1% of the membership 96 members were immediately suspended after complaints were made and a further 211 were told they would be investigated 146 members received a first warning, and 220 cases did not have sufficient evidence of a breach of party rules for an investigation Of the 307 who were suspended or notified of an investigation, 44 members left the party Another 96 were referred to the party's anti-Semitism Disputes Panel Of the 96, 16 members were issued with a formal warning from the National Executive Committee, six members' cases were referred for further investigation, 25 members were issued with reminder of conduct (a first written warning), and seven members' cases were closed as the full evidence suggested no further action should be taken The panel decided to refer the other 42 members to Labour's National Constitutional Committee (NCC), with five members leaving before their cases were reviewed Of the 37 cases referred to the NCC, 12 members were expelled and six received sanctions, while the rest await their outcome The other members who were suspended or notified of an investigation are either still under investigation or are cases where the investigation revealed evidence that meant the case could not be pursued further The party received a further 433 complaints which were not about Labour party members By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent If the Labour leadership believed that producing statistics on anti-Semitism cases would quell internal criticism, then they called it wrong. Labour MPs who had pushed for the figures to be made public, then questioned their veracity. And some criticised the party hierarchy for expelling so few members - 12 - who had breached the rules. The Labour leader was also criticised for not being present at tonight's parliamentary party meeting to discuss the issue. So flames of discontent have been fanned not extinguished. Party spokespeople point out only 0.1% of a mass membership have been accused of anti-Semitism. But one veteran MP, who has spent many years on the front bench, thinks all this won't end well. He told me: ""The whiff of a breakaway is in the air"". Dame Margaret, who has been outspoken on the party's handling of the issue, raised concerns on Twitter about the figures.

Following Monday's meeting of the PLP, a letter addressed to Jeremy Corbyn and signed by seven Labour MPs, including Dame Margaret, Luciana Berger and John Mann, accused the leadership of not respecting the PLP motion for more information on anti-Semitism cases. The letter called for a vote on it at Tuesday's shadow cabinet meeting, as ""no-one from the leadership presented the information requested"", saying: ""The party should respect the mandate of the PLP's resolution"". It lists eight points where the MPs believe there to be a lack of information, including the amount spent on legal counsel and the fact that only nine months' worth of data was released. Questioning the figures provided, Dame Margaret told the BBC if she had submitted 200 complaints alone, the official figure of 673 complaints against party members suffered from ""a total lack of credibility"". She said she was ""depressed"" and ""genuinely upset"". Labour MP Catherine McKinnell said there was a question mark over the ""inability to produce data that predates 2018"". ""The data we have does reveal the use of 'reminders of conduct' as a way of resolving a complaint without an investigation - it's not clear what criteria is being used,"" she said. ""Somebody from the leadership needs to come so we can ask the questions and get some answers. We have ongoing concerns."" Labour MP Ruth Smeeth - who has suffered anti-Semitic abuse - added: ""This is not over."" BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that during the private PLP meeting, Louise Ellman - president of the Jewish Labour Movement - raised the details of a specific case where she believed insufficient action had been taken. The former party general secretary Iain McNicol defended his record in tackling anti-Semitism before Ms Formby took over, our correspondent added. A party spokeswoman said that Ms Formby would attend a future meeting when available.

"Michael Jackson, pictured in 1999, died in 2009 at the age of 50 Channel 4 is to air a controversial documentary about Michael Jackson, despite receiving a letter of complaint from the late singer's estate. Leaving Neverland focuses on two men who claim the pop superstar abused them when they were children. The family of the late singer have asked the broadcaster not to show it, saying the film-makers did not ask them for a response to the allegations. In a statement, Channel 4 said it had followed the right response procedure. ""Channel 4 viewers will make their own judgement about the testimony of the two victims interviewed in the film,"" it said. Michael Jackson documentary 'disturbing' Jackson estate attacks 'lurid' documentary Jermaine Jackson: 'Michael is innocent' In the letter, which was released to the Associated Press, the Jackson estate claimed the documentary's makers broke programming guidelines by failing to get a response from the singer's family and friends. ""I think we can all agree that the false allegations being made in your 'documentary' are 'significant allegations',"" the letter said. ""It is hard to imagine more significant accusations that can possibly be made against anyone."" A similar letter was also sent to US broadcaster HBO, which co-produced the documentary. Leaving Neverland will be broadcast on Channel 4 on 6 and 7 March. It includes interviews with Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who were aged seven and 10 when the singer befriended them and their families. Mr Robson acted as a main witness for Michael Jackson at his 2005 trial, but has now changed his story. Channel 4 said the film does include a response to the allegations in the form of footage of Jackson's own denials. ""The documentary deals with the criminal trials and civil court cases and any involvement our principal interviewees had in those,"" the broadcaster's statement said. ""It is not unusual for victims of child sex abuse to only feel able to disclose what happened to them in later life."" The documentary, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month, has also been defended by its director, Dan Reed. ""Anyone who sees the film will know it is solely about hearing the stories of two specific individuals and their families in their own words, and that is a focus we are very proud of,"" he said.

"Robert Barnes was jailed for two years and four months A rail enthusiast and his wife tackled a butter knife-wielding burglar who tried to steal a prized collection of model trains, a court heard. John Headington, 85, and his 57-year-old wife Susan sat on Robert Barnes to restrain him after the break-in. Lincoln Crown Court heard Barnes used a brick to smash his way into the house while the couple slept on 20 November. Barnes, 28, admitted burglary and possession of a bladed article and was jailed for two years and four months. The court heard Mrs Headington was woken by the sound of Barnes, of no fixed address, breaking in through the kitchen door of the Lincolnshire home. Andrew Scott, prosecuting, said she saw a light on in an upstairs room where her husband kept his model railway collection and decided to ring the police. Former railway worker Mr Headington, who has had two hip replacements, managed to get Barnes in a bear hug as he emerged from the room carrying some of his most valuable model trains. Latest news from across Lincolnshire Mr Scott said: ""Barnes barged past Mr Headington who fell backwards against the landing wall. ""As Barnes continued down the stairs he ripped the phone from Mrs Headington but then fell down and rolled on to the floor. ""Mrs Headington sat on Barnes and was joined by her husband."" Judge Simon Hirst described the couple's bravery as ""remarkable"", while the court heard Barnes had no memory of events after drinking heavily. The judge said Barnes ""took highly sentimental items and damaged them beyond repair"", and condemned him for ""barging past an 85-year-old man"".

"Many people receiving universal credit (UC) will now have to work longer hours, as part of government plans to encourage people into employment. However, the Turn2Us charity warned of a ""drastic impact"" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or irregular incomes. Universal credit isa single benefit payment for working-age people,external. It was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people. There were 6.4 million people on UC in January in England, Scotland and Wales, according toofficial government statistics.,externalNearly 40% of claimants have jobs. The government is expected to spend Â£90bn on UC in 2024-25. That compares with Â£153bn on state pensions and other benefits for pensioners, Â£40bn on disability benefits and Â£14bn on child benefit. For UC claimants required to work, the minimum number of hours was increased from 15 to 18, on Monday 13 May. The rule change means180,000 people will have to work more or risk losing their benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions says. The 18-hour minimum applies to people earning the National Living Wage (Â£11.44 for those aged 21 or over). Someone earning more per hour can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet a level called the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET). The AET now stands at Â£892, which is what you would earn in a month if you worked for 18 hours a week at the minimum wage. Universal credit claimants must seek 18 hours work Sunak sets out plans to tackle 'sick note culture' If a couple is earning less than Â£1,437 between them, they will be expected to try to increase their earnings. Claimants already risk having their benefits reduced if they don't take steps to earn more and meet regularly with a work coach. Certain groups will remain exempt from sanctions - including people who can't work because of long-term sickness, or a disability. Turn2Us has claimed government plans to speed up the roll-out of UC - and bring down spending on welfare - could affect vulnerable people disproportionately. The government says its plans are necessary to get more people back in work and boost the economy, as levels of long-term sickness have increased. It claims that changes it is phasing in for the welfare system as a whole could save Â£4bn a year. Labour, however, says the Conservatives' failure to tackle problems facing the NHS, such as long waiting lists, should be prioritised instead. The amount you get depends on whether you are single, or claiming as a couple, and your age. There is one standard allowance per household: Single claimant under 25: Â£311.68 a month Single claimant 25 or over: Â£393.45 a month Joint claimants both under 25: Â£489.23 a month Joint claimants either aged 25 or over: Â£617.60 a month You may be entitled to extra money if, for example, you have children. Extra money may also be available for rent payments, which works in different ways across the UK. You may also be able to claima reduction in council tax,externalwhile on UC, orassistance to pay your mortgage,external, although you would need to meet strict criteria. Under the UC taper, payments are reduced as claimants earn more. The current taper ""rate"" is 55%. This means thatfor every additional Â£1 earned over the work allowance,external, UC payments are reduced by 55p. It is complicated to work out exactly how much UC you might receive. Some people have found they are entitled to less money under UC than they would have been under the previous benefit arrangements. Those with Â£16,000 or more in savings are not eligible. It usually takes about five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible. An application for UCmay put a stop to any tax credits you receive,even if it proves to be unsuccessful. 'One click and I was worse off' from benefit claim The main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work isnew-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).,external This is worth Â£71.70 a week if you are under 25, or Â£90.50 a week if you are 25 or over. You can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike UC, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim, although you may get less if you have part-time earnings or a pension. You may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.

"Lauri Love outside Hendon Magistrates' Court ahead of the hearing An alleged hacker whose computers were seized more than five years ago has begun a legal bid to get them back. Lauri Love, 34, is using thePolice (Property) Act of 1897,externalto seek their return, a year after top judges blocked his extradition to the United States. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said a UK investigation into Mr Love, from Suffolk, was ongoing. At Hendon Magistrates' Court, district judge Margot Coleman ruled that limited details of the case could be published. Mr Love, who has Asperger's syndrome, is alleged to have stolen data from American agencies including Nasa and the FBI in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013. The court heard he wanted the NCA to return four computers and an SD card that were seized in 2013. Mr Love was first arrested in October 2013 In a skeleton argument presented to the court, Mr Love said the Police and Criminal Evidence Act highlights ""the right to privacy and respect for private property"".

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond says the UK economy put in a ""robust performance"" The UK economy expanded at its slowest annual rate in six years in 2018 after a sharp contraction in December. Growth in the year was 1.4%, down from 1.8% in 2017 and the slowest rate since 2012,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external The ONS blamed falls in factory output and car production for the slowdown, among other factors. It follows forecasts of slower growth in 2019 due to Brexit uncertainty and a weaker global economy. According to the ONS, quarterly growth also slowed, falling to 0.2% in the three months to December - down from 0.6% in the three months to September. However, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the data showed the economy remained ""fundamentally strong"" and that he did not foresee a recession. Bank forecasts worst UK growth since 2009 'Austerity continues unless Hammond spends' The pound fell by a third of a cent to below $1.29 following the news. Head of GDP at the ONS Rob Kent-Smith said: ""GDP slowed in the last three months of the year with the manufacturing of cars and steel products seeing steep falls and construction also declining. ""However, services continued to grow with the health sector, management consultants and IT all doing well."" By Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent A slowdown was expected. But the economy has hit the brakes harder than economists thought it would. Growth over the quarter was weaker than the 0.3% anticipated. And over the month the numbers look positively worrying. According to the ONS estimates, gross domestic product fell in December by 0.4%. That included a drop in services activity (restaurants and retail etc), which is estimated to have fallen by 0.2% on the month. This is the only time since 2012 that services, construction and production all fell. While that chimes in with the gloomy picture painted by, for example, retailers' company results, it's not by any means a certain sign we are entering a new recession. This is only the first estimate by the ONS; the figures are provisional and are often revised when the second and third, more accurate figures arrive. You can't be sure you should worry about the state of economic growth. But then again, you can't be sure you shouldn't. The ONS said the figures reflected a slowdown across a number of industries, as Brexit-related concerns weighed on business spending decisions. In the final quarter of last year, it found car manufacturing declined at its steepest rate in just under a decade, slipping 4.9%. Construction fell 0.3% while business investment dropped 1.4%. While Britain's dominant services sector continued to expand, growth slowed to 0.4% following a strong performance during the summer. The 1.4% growth figure for 2018 was the lowest since 2012, when the economy also grew by 1.4%. The last time the economy performed worse than this was in 2009, when it contracted by 4.2%. Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said the continuing uncertainty around Brexit was the ""prime suspect"" behind weaker economic activity. ""There is currently a drag on growth as some businesses are forced to hold back on major investments and engage in cautionary stockpiling."" Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There's little doubt Brexit uncertainty is responsible for the disappointing numbers, though concerns over global trade will also have played a part."" Last week, the Bank of England forecast growth this year will be 1.2% - the slowest since 2009 when the economy was in recession. It blamed Brexit concerns as well as slower-than-expected growth in the eurozone and China. It even sees a one-in-four chance of the economy slipping into recession in the second half of this year. But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said an impending downturn was unlikely. ""On the face of it, the sharp fall in GDP in December looks alarming, but it isn't unprecedented... and it was driven by sectors which have historically been volatile."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""There's little hope of a rebound early this year. But if there's a silver lining, it's that a lot of the activity put on hold ahead of Brexit could be released once - or if - a deal is done."" Separately,the ONS published figures,externalshowing the UK's trade deficit, including goods and services, widened slightly in the last three months of the year by Â£900m to Â£10.4bn. It blamed a rise in goods imports including cars and chemicals. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said it was further evidence that ""slowing global growth and continued uncertainty over Brexit are making trading conditions for UK exporters more challenging"".

"Amber Rudd took over the Department for Work and Pensions in November 2018 Amber Rudd says the increased use of food banks is partly down to problems in rolling out universal credit. The work and pensions secretary said she was ""absolutely clear there were challenges with the initial roll-out"" of the benefit and that the difficulty in accessing money was ""one of the causes"" of the rise. But she said the government had made changes to help tackle food insecurity. Food bank operator Trussell Trust said it was a ""promising"" acknowledgement. Universal credit has been plagued with problems since its inception in 2010. The monthly payment merges six different benefits for working age people into one and has been subject to a gradual roll-out across the UK. The system was supposed to be up and running by April 2017, but it has faced numerous delays and is now not expected to be fully operational until December 2023. Research released by the Trussell Trust charity this month showedthe use of food banks had increased by 52% in areas where universal credit had been in place for a year or more,external- compared with 13% in areas where it had not been. What is universal credit? Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Vote on big universal credit rollout delayed Speaking in the Commons, Ms Rudd said the government was ""committed to a strong safety net where people need it"". ""It is absolutely clear that there were challenges with the initial roll-out of universal credit,"" she added. ""The main issue which led to an increase in food bank use could have been the fact that people had difficulty accessing their money early enough. ""We have made changes to accessing universal credit so that people can have advances, so that there is a legacy run-on after two weeks of housing benefit, and we believe that will help with food and security."" This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? Pushed again on the cause of the issue by Labour's Stephen Timms, Ms Rudd added: ""I have acknowledged that people having difficulty accessing the money on time as one of the causes of the growth in food banks, but we have tried to address that."" The Department for Work and Pensions has said that, under universal credit, people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer. According to the Resolution Foundation think tank, 2.2 million families are expected to gain under the system, with an average increase in income of Â£41 a week. However, 3.2 million families are also expected to be worse off, with an average loss of Â£48 a week. Labour has called for ministers to halt the roll-out ""as a matter of urgency"". Natalie Williams, from King's Church food bank in Hastings, East Sussex, which is in Ms Rudd's constituency, told BBC Radio 5 Live she was ""really pleased"" to hear the secretary of state's comments, but it was ""long overdue"". She said her food bank had seen a 106% increase in referrals in the last two years. ""People are struggling with the wait from when they claim to when they get money,"" she said. ""People don't want to take the advance because they don't want to get into debt. ""There is a lot that needs to be fixed about Universal Credit."" Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: ""It's promising to see the secretary of state is listening to the evidence of food banks across the UK. ""We're a country that prides itself on making sure proper support is in place for each other when help is most needed - our benefits system was created to do exactly this. But Universal Credit isn't the poverty-fighting reform that was promised."" Ms Revie called for action to address why the new welfare system has forced some people to food banks.

"Chancellor Philip Hammond is due to unveil his Spring Statement next month Philip Hammond must spend billions extra to end austerity, says think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). To maintain per capita spending across government departments that do not have ring-fenced budgets, he must find an extra Â£5bn a year by 2023, it adds. And maintaining spending on unprotected services as a share of national income would require Â£11bn on top of spending plans set out in the 2018 Budget. The Treasury says long-term funding decisions will be made later this year. In its analysis, the IFS said spending increases already promised by the chancellor would be swallowed up by commitments to fund the NHS, defence and international aid. That could mean cuts in other areas, IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme. ""[Unless he finds the money] we will continue to see cuts in some departments at least as a fraction of national income, and don't forget the scale of the cuts up to now really has been extraordinary historically. ""We've had Â£40bn of cuts to department spending and cuts of 30% and 40% to some budget items. So even if he even if he stops cutting, it's still not going to feel great in a lot of areas."" The Treasury says health is the ""number one spending priority"" But a Treasury spokesman said public investment would hit peaks not seen since 1979. ""The chancellor has said that the Spending Review will take place in 2019, and that is the right moment for government to make long term funding decisions,"" he said. ""We have made clear that health is our number one spending priority by announcing a five-year settlement which will provide an extra Â£34bn a year for the NHS by 2023-24. ""Outside the NHS, total day-to-day departmental spending is now set to grow in line with inflation, and public investment will reach levels not sustained in 40 years in this parliament. "" Meanwhile, the IFS said a no-deal Brexit would mean lower growth, requiring either spending cuts or higher taxes. And it said in the short term the government might need to borrow more to fund a stimulus package to mitigate the impacts for the hardest-hit areas of the economy. But Mr Johnson said any spending boost to spending would be temporary. ""Obviously if there is some kind of no-deal Brexit that is going to be bad for the economy both in the short run and in the long run, there will be less money around. ""[The chancellor] can probably put a bit more money in [in the short run], but in the long run that is going to mean several more years of austerity to row back from that initial expansion."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The evidence is mounting that despite Theresa May's rhetoric, austerity is not over. ""Unless Philip Hammond, at the very least, finds another Â£5bn at the Spring Statement, departments will be planning for yet more cuts next year. ""Nine years of brutal Tory austerity have wounded our public services and the whole country which relies on them."" What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy?

"Between 1672 and 1689, Edward Colston's ships are believed to have transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas The head teacher of a secondary school says it will remove Colston as a house name for the next school year. The names of the five houses at St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School in Bristol are all linked to white males, but will now be changed to ""reflect diversity"". Edward Colston made his fortune through slave trading, as well as bequeathing thousands to charitable causes. Head teacher Elisabeth Gilpin said: ""We cannot change the past, but we can change the future."" The city divided by a slave trader's legacy In a newsletter to parents and pupils, she wrote: ""Role models matter to people when they are growing up. ""We want every young person, whatever their gender, ethnic background and family income, to know that they can aspire to any number of careers and roles in society."" The changes mean that Colston House becomes Johnson House after Katherine Johnson, who worked for NASA as a mathematician. St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School The other houses will be named after George MÃ¼ller, who was famous for setting up orphanages in Bristol; Eric Liddell, the Scottish 400m Olympic champion featured in Chariots of Fire; Olaudah Equiano, who played a major role in the anti-slavery movement; and Rosalind Franklin who took the key X-ray crystallography photo that established the structure of DNA. Mrs Gilpin added: ""This has not come from a position of 'political correctness gone mad', but from a genuine desire to have role models with interesting stories which demonstrate our values.""

"The net independence plan is seen as a way for Russia's government to get more control over online life Russia is considering whether to disconnect from the global internet briefly, as part of a test of its cyber-defences. The test will mean data passing between Russian citizens and organisations stays inside the nation rather than being routed internationally. A draft law mandating technical changes needed to operate independently was introduced to its parliament last year. The test is expected to happen before 1 April but no exact date has been set. The draft law, called the Digital Economy National Program, requires Russia's ISPs to ensure that it can operate in the event of foreign powers acting to isolate the country online. Nato and its allies have threatened to sanction Russia over the cyber-attacks and other online interference which it is regularly accused of instigating. The measures outlined in the law include Russia building its own version of the net's address system, known as DNS, so it can operate if links to these internationally-located servers are cut. Currently, 12 organisations oversee the root servers for DNS and none of them are in Russia. However many copies of the net's core address book do already exist inside Russia suggesting its net systems could keep working even if punitive action was taken to cut it off. The test is also expected to involve ISPs demonstrating that they can direct data to government-controlled routing points. These will filter traffic so that data sent between Russians reaches its destination, but any destined for foreign computers is discarded. Eventually the Russian government wants all domestic traffic to pass through these routing points. This is believed to be part of an effort to set up a mass censorship system akin to that seen in China, which tries to scrub out prohibited traffic. Russian news organisations reported that the nation's ISPs are broadly backing the aims of the draft law but are divided on how to do it. They believe the test will cause ""major disruption"" to Russian internet traffic,reports tech news website ZDNet.,external The Russian government is providing cash for ISPs to modify their infrastructure so the redirection effort can be properly tested. How does an entire country ""unplug"" itself from the internet? It's important to understand a little about how the internet works. It is essentially a series of thousands of digital networks along which information travels. These networks are connected by router points - and they are notoriously the weakest link in the chain. What Russia wants to do is to bring those router points that handle data entering or exiting the country within its borders and under its control- so that it can then pull up the drawbridge, as it were, to external traffic if it's under threat - or if it decides to censor what outside information people can access. China's firewall is probably the world's best known censorship tool and it has become a sophisticated operation. It also polices its router points, using filters and blocks on keywords and certain websites and redirecting web traffic so that computers cannot connect to sites the state does not wish Chinese citizens to see. It is possible to get around some firewalls using virtual private networks (VPNs) - which disguise the location of a computer so the filters do not kick in - but some regimes are more tolerant of them than others.China cracks down on them from time to timeand the punishment for providing or using illegal VPNs can be a prison sentence. Occasionally countries disconnect themselves by accident - Mauritania was left offline for two days in 2018 after the undersea fibre cable that supplied its internet was cut, possibly by a trawler.

"Childish Gambino performing at last year's Grammys ceremony Childish Gambino has made Grammy Awards history by winning both song and record of the year for This Is America. It's the first time a rap song has won both categories - although Gambino did not attend or perform at the event. He was the first artist to be absent from collecting one of the ""big four"" Grammys since Amy Winehouse in 2008. Gambino - aka actor Donald Glover - beat competition from Drake, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in both categories.

"Many species of butterfly are in retreat according to the review A scientific review of insect numbers suggests that 40% of species are undergoing ""dramatic rates of decline"" around the world. The study says that bees, ants and beetles are disappearing eight times faster than mammals, birds or reptiles. But researchers say that some species, such as houseflies and cockroaches, are likely to boom. The general insect decline is being caused by intensive agriculture, pesticides and climate change. Valentine roach revenge for spurned lovers Mosquitoes 'put off biting' by diet drugs Edible insects: A BBC reporter's verdict Insects make up the majority of creatures that live on land, and provide key benefits to many other species, including humans. They provide food for birds, bats and small mammals; they pollinate around 75% of the crops in the world; they replenish soils and keep pest numbers in check. Manyother studiesin recent years have shown that individual species of insects, such as bees, have suffered huge declines, particularly in developed economies. Butthis new paper takes a broader look,external. Published in the journal Biological Conservation, it reviews 73 existing studies from around the world published over the past13 years. The researchers found that declines in almost all regions may lead to the extinction of 40% of insects over the next few decades. One-third of insect species are classed as Endangered. ""The main factor is the loss of habitat, due to agricultural practices, urbanisation and deforestation,"" lead author Dr Francisco SÃ¡nchez-Bayo, from the University of Sydney, told BBC News. ""Second is the increasing use of fertilisers and pesticides in agriculture worldwide and contamination with chemical pollutants of all kinds. Thirdly, we have biological factors, such as invasive species and pathogens; and fourthly, we have climate change, particularly in tropical areas where it is known to have a big impact."" Dung beetles are on the retreat according to the new review Some of the highlights of study include the recent,rapid decline of flying insects in Germany, and themassive drop in numbers,externalin tropical forests in Puerto Rico, linked to rising global temperatures. Other experts say the findings are ""gravely sobering"". ""It's not just about bees, or even about pollination and feeding ourselves - the declines also include dung beetles that recycle waste and insects like dragonflies that start life in rivers and ponds,"" said Matt Shardlow from UK campaigners Buglife. ""It is becoming increasingly obvious our planet's ecology is breaking and there is a need for an intense and global effort to halt and reverse these dreadful trends. Allowing the slow eradication of insect life to continue is not a rational option."" The authors are concerned about the impact of insect decline up along the food chain. With many species of birds, reptiles and fish depending on insects as their main food source, it's likely that these species may also be wiped out as a result. Cockroaches and houseflies may thrive while others decline, say experts While some of our most important insect species are in retreat, the review also finds that a small number of species are likely to be able to adapt to changing conditions and do well. ""Fast-breeding pest insects will probably thrive because of the warmer conditions, because many of their natural enemies, which breed more slowly, will disappear, "" said Prof Dave Goulson from the University of Sussex who was not involved in the review. ""It's quite plausible that we might end up with plagues of small numbers of pest insects, but we will lose all the wonderful ones that we want, like bees and hoverflies and butterflies and dung beetles that do a great job of disposing of animal waste."" Prof Goulson said that some tough, adaptable, generalist species - like houseflies and cockroaches - seem to be able to live comfortably in a human-made environment and have evolved resistance to pesticides. He added that while the overall message was alarming, there were things that people could do, such as making their gardens more insect friendly, not using pesticides and buying organic food. More research is also badly needed as 99% of the evidence for insect decline comes from Europe and North America with almost nothing from Africa or South America. Ultimately, if huge numbers of insects disappear, they will be replaced but it will take a long, long time. ""If you look at what happened in the major extinctions of the past, they spawned massive adaptive radiations where the few species that made it through adapted and occupied all the available niches and evolved into new species,"" Prof Goulson told BBC News. ""So give it a million years and I've no doubt there will be a whole diversity of new creatures that will have popped up to replace the ones wiped out in the 20th and 21st centuries. ""Not much consolation for our children, I'm afraid.""

"GCSEs should be scrapped and A-levels should be replaced by a mix of academic and vocational subjects, says Robert Halfon, chairman of the Education Select Committee. His radical rewriting of England's exam system is designed to give young people a much broader range of skills for their working lives. The former Tory minister says GCSEs for 16-year-olds have become ""pointless"". The Department for Education defended GCSEs as ""gold standard"" exams. The exams taken by 16-year-olds have recently been reformed in England, with a new numerical grading system from 9 to 1. The DFE, which shows no sign of supporting calls to scrap GCSEs, says that the most recent figures show that about 47% of young people who take GCSEs stay on to study A-levels. But head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said the idea of ditching GCSEs had a ""lot of merit"", as they belonged to an era when young people left education at 16. Lord Baker, who introduced the exams as education secretary in the 1980s, said ""the days of GCSEs are numbered"". Robert Halfon says there is a false division between academic and technical education Mr Halfon, who presented his blueprint at an event in London run by the Edge vocational education charity, wants to end what he sees as an excessively narrow academic pathway in secondary schools. Instead of taking academic subjects at GCSE and A-level, he wants young people to have a broader curriculum, with vocational training alongside traditional subjects. The MP is proposing a baccalaureate system to replace A-levels, with a mix of arts, sciences and vocational subjects and exams at the age of 18. ""Get rid of GCSEs, which seem to me pointless. Instead there should be some kind of assessment to show how far you're progressing,"" he says. ""I would rather that all the concentration should be on the final exam before you leave."" This is an outstanding idea. I have been a secondary teacher for 10 years, and the relentless chase for GCSE grades has ruined our profession. I see colleagues suffering more and more burn out over an archaic system that serves no purpose in the modern era. Johnny, Hastings. Robert Halfon's education makeover ideas are fantastic. I diligently pursued an academic career costing my parents, the country and myself tens of thousands only to eventually discover my passion lay in the technical and bespoke social work of hairdressing! I wish I had more choices available. Scrap the ivory tower and make it real for our children! Claire The problem is school is still very Victorian, someone stands at the front of the class and you have to sit and listen. There is no opportunity to explore how people learn or attempt made to pique someone's interest. I think the system is broken and there is far too much pressure on children nowadays to achieve academically when not everyone is that way. It's like the old adage a fish will think it's stupid if you ask it to climb a tree. Duncan. We moved to France in order for them to have a better quality of life and that has happened. However, a by product has been the excellent education they have received. The Baccalaureate system is, in my opinion, far superior to the system in the UK. I am speaking as an ex-grammar school pupil. Paul, France Mr Halfon says England has been trapped in a false division between academic and vocational study - and this is failing to prepare young people for technological changes in the workplace. ""The march of the robots"" and the acceleration of artificial intelligence could remove a quarter of jobs, he says. He says there should be a royal commission on how to prepare for the impact of artificial intelligence and robotics. ""I think it's going to be dramatic. It will change the way we teach, change the way we learn and have a massive impact on jobs and skills."" The former education minister says young people are leaving school without the skills needed for work, at the same time as industry is complaining of skills shortages. But scrapping GCSEs could raise questions for secondary schools without sixth forms - which under the proposed changes would no longer have the focus of any public exams. GCSEs: How do the new grades 9 to 1 work? GCSE results rise despite tougher exams Are new-style GCSE league tables unfair on schools with white working class pupils? It would also mean, since the removal of AS-levels, young people would apply to university without having the results of any public exams. It would also raise questions about what would happen to young people who currently take GCSEs but do not stay to take exams at the age of 18. But Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, backed the underlying principle. ""GCSEs are a product of a different era when many young people left education at the age of 16, but this is no longer the case, and young people are now expected to remain in full-time education or training until the age of 18,"" he said. ""It would therefore make a great deal of sense to replace GCSEs with some sort of light-touch assessment which would help determine post-16 routes rather than persisting with high-stakes GCSEs."" But Andrew Halls, head teacher of King's College School, an independent school in south-west London, said it was ""absolutely the wrong idea"". ""This country's record in vocational training is terrible, to muddle that up with an academic qualification is a complete disaster."" ""A lot of money and thought needs to be put into vocational training,"" said the head teacher. ""They really need to stop fiddling and changing - and make things work,"" said Mr Halls. Alice Barnard, chief executive of the Edge Foundation, said the plans reflected the ""concerns not only of parents, teachers and pupils themselves, but employers and business leaders"". ""Technology is moving at such a rapid pace and change happening so quickly, we are failing young people if we do not enable them to develop the adaptability and the critical skills they need,"" she said. Lord Baker, who brought in GCSEs, said the exams were now ""redundant"". But he said ""they won't go quietly"" and warned that the government would be opposed to such radical change. There have been previous attempts to combine vocational and academic pathways - such as Sir Mike Tomlinson's review of exams and the diplomas introduced under the last Labour government. Mr Halfon says he would expect a ""massive backlash"" against such a change to GCSEs and A-levels. A spokesman for the Department for Education said vocational options had been improved, with apprenticeships and the new T-level technical qualifications. The government spokesman defended the value of GCSEs as ""the gold standard qualification at age 16 and a passport to further study and employability"". ""They were recently reformed so that their demand matches that in other high performing countries and better prepare students for work and further study."" GCSEs: How do the new 9-1 grades work?

"Theresa May will update MPs on Tuesday about recent Brexit talks as she continues to seek support for her deal. She visited Dublin and Brussels last week seeking EU agreement on changes to the backstop - the ""insurance"" policy to avoid the return of visible Northern Ireland border checks. Last month MPs - who will debate Brexit on Thursday - voted for the PM to find alternatives to the current backstop. But the EU has said it would not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. However, efforts to come up with a solution acceptable to both sides continue. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay met a group of Tory MPs working on possible alternatives to the backstop, before he travelled to Brussels and held talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Following the meeting, Mr Barnier said the talks had been ""constructive"", but added it was ""clear from our side we're not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement, but we will continue our discussions in the coming days"". A statement from the Department for Exiting the European Union said Mr Barclay and Mr Barnier had agreed to further talks ""in the coming days"". Their teams would continue to work in the meantime ""on finding a way forward"", it added. Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? New ideas for the Brexit border backstop UK signs trade deal with Switzerland The statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday - a day earlier than had been expected - follows an exchange of letters between Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader wrote to the PM on Wednesday,externalwith a list of five demands to secure his party's support for her deal, including a permanent customs union. The prime minister struck a conciliatory tone in her response overnight and said she looked forward to the two parties meeting again ""as soon as possible"" to discuss ways forward on Brexit. But No 10 said it rejected any proposals to remain in a customs union with the EU. Some of her cabinet members also quashed the idea, with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox calling Mr Corbyn's proposal a ""dangerous delusion"". Mrs May told the Labour leader: ""It is good to see that we agree that the UK should leave the European Union with a deal and that the urgent task at hand is to find a deal that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland, can command support in Parliament and can be negotiated with the EU - not to seek an election or second referendum."" This is despite Mr Corbyn repeatedly saying there should be a general election if Mrs May cannot get a deal through Parliament. He has also faced pressure from some of his MPs to push for another public vote on Brexit. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said his ""key question"" about Mrs May's response was: ""Is she prepared to move her red lines and find a consensus?"" ""I don't see that in the letter,"" he said. ""The point of the exercise was to say, look, there is a majority for a close economic relationship, if you're prepared to try to find it, and I've said for some time we should test that by having a vote on a customs union.""

Labour MP David Lammy - who supports the ""People's Vote"" campaign for a new referendum - said Mrs May's letter ""makes it clear there is no hope of her agreeing"" with Mr Corbyn's demands and said his party should campaign now for a fresh vote. But fellow Labour MP Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Politics Live that there were between 40 and 60 of her colleagues ""who are actively looking for ways to support"" a revised Brexit deal. She said the government needed to ""get serious"" about policy on a customs union and guarantee to ""legislate for the protections around workers' rights"". This video can not be played Lisa Nandy says 40 to 60 Labour MPs âactively looking for ways to support"" a new Brexit deal The anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats said it was ""astonishing"" the two leaders were starting ""serious discussions about delivering disastrous Brexit together"" 900 days after the vote to leave the EU. Brexit spokesman Tom Brake added: ""It is time for Jeremy Corbyn to give up the letters and instead draw his attention to Labour Party policy and get behind the campaign for a People's Vote."" The GMB union criticised the government's ""dangerous brinkmanship"" after Mrs May rejected remaining in a customs union. It has urged the extension of Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March. Meanwhile, speaking in Luxembourg, Mr Barnier said he would judge how interested the UK was in changes to the accompanying political declaration, which sketches out the shape of the future relationship. He said the EU was waiting for a clear and stable majority to emerge in the House of Commons, not just for the passage of the withdrawal agreement, but for the subsequent legislation too. Mr Corbyn's letter to the prime minister was ""interesting in tone and substance"", Mr Barnier said. Elsewhere, members of the Alternative Arrangements Working Group - including Conservative MPs Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh, Owen Paterson, Damian Green and Nicky Morgan - met government officials in Westminster. Mr Baker said the talks had been ""constructive"" and they were ""looking forward to hearing how Stephen Barclay gets on with Michel Barnier"". The group has met several times to discuss alternative arrangements to the proposed Irish border ""backstop"". By Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor It could have been a very different sort of letter. Mrs May could have just underscored her red lines: No to extending Article 50. No to another referendum. No to a customs union. Instead, it's a much more conciliatory and consensual letter. There's praise for Mr Corbyn in accepting the priority now should be on reaching a Brexit deal, rather than pressing for a general election. Praise too for his acknowledgement that the backstop has got to be changed. And there's some movement on employment rights and the promise of more cash for hard pressed communities. Even on the customs union - their key dividing area - Mrs May's language is more nuanced, even though privately her aides insist there can be no question of accepting a permanent customs union. It's unlikely to be anywhere near enough to win over Mr Corbyn. But it may be enough for those Labour MPs in leave supporting constituencies, who are looking for political cover to back or abstain on Mrs May's deal. In his letter, Mr Corbyn asked for five changes to be made to the Brexit deal. The Labour leader called for a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"" with the EU to be introduced to the deal, with the same external tariff. He said it would give the UK a say on any future trade deals that the EU may strike. In her reply, Mrs May said the political declaration - the second part of her deal which is a non-legally binding statement on the future relationship between the UK and EU - ""explicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union"", with no tariffs, fees, charges and restrictions. The customs union explained What is Labour's customs union policy? But, she said, it also allows for the UK to strike up its own trade deals elsewhere. She added her reassurance that securing frictionless trade with the EU was ""one of our key negotiating objectives"". Speaking in Switzerland, where Mr Fox has just signed a deal to see the country trade with the UK on the same terms it does now, the minister said the idea was ""not workable"". Mr Corbyn also wanted the deal to include a promise for the UK to be closely aligned with the Single Market after it leaves the EU, ""underpinned by shared institutions and obligations"". Mrs May quoted the EU as saying the current deal provides for the closest relationship possible outside the Single Market. She added: ""I am not sure what exactly you mean when you say 'shared institutions and obligations', but our teams can explore that."" The single market explained The PM also repeated the EU's warning that completely frictionless trade is only possible if the UK stays in the Single Market. ""This would mean accepting free movement, which Labour's 2017 General Election manifesto made clear you do not support,"" she added. Please upgrade your browser Labour has called for the UK to stay in step with the EU on rights and protections for workers, which was included in Mr Corbyn's letter. On this point, Mrs May said the government had already made commitments on workers' rights, adding: ""We are examining opportunities to provide further financial support to communities that feel left behind."" This could be referring toproposals that were said to have been discussed earlier this month from a group of Labour MPs in predominantly Leave-supporting constituencies,to allocate more funds to their communities for big infrastructure projects. The PM also said that while she had ""always been clear that Brexit should not be at the expense of workers' rights or environmental protections"", she did not support automatically following EU rules in these areas. The Labour leader called for a promise to participate in EU agencies and funding programmes on the environment, education and industry regulation after Brexit. The prime minister said the government supports participation in EU programmes in a number of areas, as set out in the political declaration - which includes areas such as science and innovation, youth, culture and education, and overseas development. Finally, Mr Corbyn demanded agreements with the EU on security, such as access to the European Arrest Warrant database. Mrs May said the government ""shares your ambition in relation to security arrangements"". She said the political declaration secured agreement on the exchange of Passenger Name Record, DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data and on arrangements ""akin to the European Arrest Warrant to surrender suspected and convicted persons efficiently and expeditiously."" But, she added, there is a challenge that as a third country outside of the EU, there are restrictions on the UK's ability to participate in some EU tools and measures.

"Residents described hearing the aftermath of the crash which left two people dead Two people were killed in a car that drove down the wrong side of the road and hit a coach following a lengthy police pursuit in west London. The man and woman died on the A40 in Acton, at about 21:00 GMT on Sunday. A second man was hurt in the crash, which took place after the pursuit began seven miles away in Harrow after reports of an armed burglary. The Met Police said its officers did not follow when the car went down the wrong side of the A40. Fire and ambulance crews, along with the police helicopter, were called in and roads in the area - near the A40's junction with Kingsdown Avenue - were closed. Transport for London said the roads reopened in both directions at 07:45. The crash happened about 20 minutes after the police pursuit began. Witness Antoine Eid, 47, said ""it wasn't like a normal car accident"", and there was ""no chance"" of the coach slowing down before the crash. ""I've never seen something like that,"" he added. The second man was taken to a major trauma centre, although the extent of his injuries have not been confirmed. There were no reports of any other serious injuries, the Met said. The crash happened about 20 minutes after the police pursuit began in response to an aggravated burglary in Harrow The Directorate of Professional Standards and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) have been informed. IOPC regional director Jonathan Green said: ""My thoughts are with the families and friends of the two people who have died, those injured and all those affected by this incident. ""It is important that we now establish all of the circumstances surrounding this collision. ""We have therefore launched an independent investigation into the events leading to the collision and have immediately deployed our investigators to attend the scene and the post incident procedure where further information will be gathered."" Bid to save Big Ben bell foundry Knife offenders to be tagged on release Bafta win for vegan farmer who gave away herd The chase came after police were called to reports of an aggravated burglary in Pinner, Harrow, at about 20:40. A man in his mid 30s, a woman in her late 50s and a man in his late 60s said the door to their home was forced open and four men entered. The suspects then threatened them with a large hunting knife and screwdriver and demanded valuables. Police said the suspects threatened to kill the residents and one punched the man in his 30s in the face. The suspects left taking cash and jewellery. The IOPC is investigatingfour deaths in separate incidents involving police vehicles, within four days of each other, in January. There were 29 police-related fatalities on the roads in 2017-18, of which 17 were ""pursuit-related"", according to the IOPC. Eight involved police vehicles responding to emergency calls. Five deaths involved police vehicles hitting pedestrians while responding to an emergency call and one pedestrian death related to a pursuit. In the previous year, 2016-17, there were 32 fatalities on the roads involving the police. Of those, 28 related to pursuits and none involved police responding to emergency calls.

"Alfonso Cuaron wrote and directed Roma, which won best film The Favourite may have been the favourite, but it was Roma that took the night's big prize at the Bafta film awards. The black and white, two-and-a-half-hour long subtitled film might not have ""box office smash"" written all over it - but then again, it wasn't aiming for the box office. Despite having a limited theatrical release, most will have seen Alfonso Cuaron's film on Netflix - and its success on Sunday night marks the first ever best film Bafta for the streaming service. But there wereplenty of other awards for The Favourite, which took home seven prizes including original screenplay, outstanding British film, and acting awards for Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz. Here are some of the things we learned at the ceremony: 1. Joanna Lumley was only Partially Fabulous Hosting the Baftas is a tall order. You have to be likeable, entertaining and funny, under the gaze of the brightest stars in Hollywood. Returning to hosting duties for a second year, Joanna Lumley gave it her best shot, but not everyone was impressed. ""I adore Joanna Lumley but who on earth is responsible for her dire script?""asked Denise Welch,external, while Piers Morgan described her performance as""a train wreck"",external. A little harsh, perhaps, but some of her lines did fall a little flat. Here are some of the jokes we most enjoyed: ""The fabulous Glenn Close is here. The Wife was a wonderful film, although I imagine a lot of men have already moved on to the sequel - The Second Wife."" ""What a masterstroke to call it The Favourite. Next year there'll be a film called 'And the Bafta goes to...'"" ""Bradley Cooper has been nominated for five categories - which suggests he's a multi-talented genius... or that he needs to learn how to delegate."" ""Thank god Baftahasa host - but I think that might owe a lot to the fact I'm not on Twitter."" [A reference toKevin Hart dropping out of the Oscars.] 2. The Black Panther cast have varied attitudes to texting This was the second year in a row a cast member from Black Panther won the award for rising star. Daniel Kaluuya was crowned the winner last year, just as he was riding the crest of the Get Out wave. This year, it was Letitia Wright's turn to take home the trophy - which differs from the others in that it's bright blue instead of gold. ""I love my little blue man,"" Letitia said backstage, after delivering anemotional acceptance speechat the ceremony. ""I'm enjoying the fact it's very unique, very special, and the fact that Bafta has this category means a lot."" Who might be the first Black Panther cast member to text her to say congratulations? ""Luptia [N'yongo],"" replied Letitia immediately, championing her co-star's talent with technology. ""She's a bit quicker than Chadwick [Boseman]."" And who would be last? ""Michael B Jordan because he's so busy and he's making a thousand films!"" 3. Bohemian Rhapsody's director was conspicuous by his absence John Warhurst (far right) acknowledged Singer's absence backstage One person who wasn't there to represent Bohemian Rhapsody was its director Bryan Singer. Bafta removed his namefrom the the film's nominations due to allegations he sexually abused underage boys, which he denies. Singer directed most of the film but exited the project before the film was completed. However, despite the controversy, the movie took home best sound and best actor for Rami Malek. ""We did have a change of director halfway through filming,"" acknowledged supervising sound editor John Warhurst backstage. ""But with everything the cast and crew was doing from one week to the next, there wasn't a lot that changed really. ""Rami and everyone else came back to work the next day [after Singer left] and it just carried on without there being much of a change, and that's when you realise how many people are involved in making a film like this."" Speaking on the red carpet, Brian May added: ""He was sacked for very good reason, not by us, but by Fox, so it's a very arm's-length kind of thing for us."" 4. Mahershala Ali's success is down to basketball. Kind of There's a surprising link between best supporting actor winner Mahershala Ali and The Favourite director Yorgos Lanthimos - both played basketball prior to launching their film careers. Speaking after his win, Mahershala said the team-building nature of the sport is, in fact, the perfect training for working on a major film. ""In basketball, there's a sense of everyone touching the ball, everyone contributing, there's only five people on the team, so you can see what everyone else is doing,"" he explained. ""I think there's this sense of real collaboration in sports. Michael Jordan knows he wouldn't have won the championship without Bill Cartwright. It prepares you for being able to work with other people."" The Favourite dominates Bafta awards In pictures: Baftas 2019 winners and stars Bafta win for farmer who gave herd away 5. Success smells sweet for Richard E Grant Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant made a wonderful double act in Can You Ever Forgive Me. But, joked Melissa McCarthy, it was a different story off camera. ""We don't care for each other,"" she told BBC News. ""Not one bit. We don't speak. He won't let me look at him."" Fortunately, the actress was just kidding. Not only did she say they ""hit it off bizarrely well"", but McCarthy has taken to wearing Grant's fragrance to remind her of him. Grant released his own range of perfumes several years ago - one of which McCarthy was wearing to the Baftas. ""I always wear it, so even when I don't get to have him with me, I weirdly go 'good morning Richard!' and put a little on."" 6. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper split their ceremonies Leading actress nominee Lady Gaga wasn't at the Baftas ceremony - but to be fair she had a good excuse. She was performing at the Grammys in the US, which were taking place on the same evening. Her co-star in A Star Is Born, Bradley Cooper, turned up instead to collect the prize for best original music. But Gaga quickly got word of the win and tweeted her thanks to the British Academy.

"This video can not be played Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney The Bank of England expects growth this year to be the slowest since 2009 when the economy was in recession. It is forecasting growth of 1.2% this year, down from its previous forecast of 1.7% made in November. The Bank said it had seen further evidence that businesses were being cautious in the run-up to Brexit, including evidence from its own survey of firms. As expected the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.75%. The Bank put the fall in growth down to a decline in business investment and housebuilding, as well as a halving of the growth rate in exports. The UK was also being hit by slower-than-expected growth in the eurozone and China,the Bank said in its Quarterly Inflation Report.,external ""Growth appears to have slowed at the end of 2018 and is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" it said. The Bank even sees a one-in-four chance of the economy slipping into recession in the second half of this year. Brexit stalemate scars prosperity, says Bank There has been an ""intensification"" of Brexit uncertainties, the Bank said. Its survey of 208 firms showed that half had started putting plans in place for a no-deal Brexit. The survey also showed that a fifth had taken on extra warehouse space It also noted a sharp fall in business investment at the end of last year. ""Uncertainty appears to have risen recently, and may have weighed on investment by more than had been expected in August,"" the Bank said. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: ""The fog of Brexit is causing short term volatility in the economic data, and more fundamentally, it is creating a series of tensions in the economy, tensions for business."" Interest rates remain at 0.75%, where they have been since the Bank of England last raised in interest rates in August. Many economists think that once the uncertainty over Brexit is lifted then the economy will accelerate and the Bank will have to raise interest rates to stop it overheating. However, recent economic data has indicated weakness in the UK economy. Growth in the service sector, the biggest part of the economy, appeared to have stalled in January,according to closely-watched survey of purchasing managers. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicts that the Bank will raise rates once this year and twice in 2020. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We still think that a decent rebound in GDP growth, should a Brexit deal be reached, will result in interest rates rising further than the Bank and the financial markets assume."" Moves in interest rates are important to the 3.5 million people with variable or tracker mortgages. Even a small rise of 0.25% can add hundreds of pounds to their annual mortgage costs. ""It's a very good time for people looking to borrow,"" said Andrew Montlake, a director at Coreco, a mortgage broker. He said there had been a lot of competition among lenders in January, with some very good deals for five-year fixed mortgage deals. Some lenders are offering five-year fixed deals at below 2%, he said. Concern over Brexit has held back some people from borrowing. ""There is a lot of pent-up demand,"" said Mr Montlake. Savers who depend on higher interest rates to boost their incomes will be disappointed that rates have stayed on hold for a sixth consecutive month. While the Bank cut its growth forecast it also noted the strength of the labour market, where the unemployment rate is currently 4%. The rate at which people are switching to new jobs is only slightly below the level hit before the financial crisis of 2007. That switching suggests that employers are having to compete to attract staff, the Bank said. It also noted a pick-up in the average number of hours worked at the end of last year and firmer wage growth. The Bank thinks that wage growth will increase in the coming years as the UK's unemployment rate continues to fall. The main reason the Bank thinks underlying inflation pressures will grow is that wage growth will rise. Britain's unemployment rate has hit its lowest level in more than 40 years. The Bank predicts that earnings will rise by more than 3% a year over the next three years.

"Economic growth has not been disastrous, but nor has it been sparkling There may still be more than a month to go until Brexit is scheduled to happen, but there has already been some fallout from the decision to leave. Most recently, the prolonged uncertainty - what the governor of the Bank of England refers to as the ""Brexit fog"" - appears to be leaving some potentially worrying scars on prosperity. What is clear, however, is that two-and-a-half years after the referendum, the most dire predictions about what could have happened to financial wellbeing have failed to transpire. Rewind to May 2016. The then chancellor, George Osborne, warned of what he said would happen over the immediate period of two years following a vote to leave the EU. He said: ""A vote to leave would represent an immediate and profound shock to our economy. That shock would push our economy into a recession and lead to an increase in unemployment of around 500,000, ""GDP would be 3.6% smaller, average real wages would be lower, inflation higher, sterling weaker, house prices would be hit and public borrowing would rise compared with a vote to remain."" He was assuming Article 50, the process by which the UK leaves, would be triggered immediately after the vote; in the event, it was nine months later. But the warning stands. Project Fear?  Well, the economy hasn't contracted, and the level of unemployment is actually the lowest on record. But that's not to say that the economy's path hasn't deviated from what had earlier been expected. Of course, there are other issues that will have influenced our economy's path - but the anticipation of the UK leaving the EU is far from insignificant. Let's start with prosperity. The economy has grown at an average of about 1.5% per year since the referendum - not sparkling, but not disastrous either. Average real wages are rising again. But most forecasters had hoped for more. The governor of the Bank of England said last May that households were Â£900 worse off compared with what it had expected pre-referendum. Since then, the gulf between those predictions and reality has widened, because of the prolonged uncertainty over the Brexit outcome. Retail spending slowed sharply towards the end of last year, while surveys suggest new orders have stagnated, such that activity in manufacturing has been driven largely by companies speeding up production to avert the risk of disruption after 29 March. The Bank of England found that business investment has slowed sharply, and reckons it will fall by even more this year. Companies are unwilling to flash the cash until they are confident about what lies ahead. That's not just down to a lack of clarity over Brexit, but a result, too, of weaker demand from elsewhere, as the likes of China and Europe slow down. As a result, the Bank now calculates the total level of GDP is about 1.2% lower than it had expected three years ago. Lower business investment tends to hamper how efficient we can be - that is productivity - and so could have a lingering impact on our economic health. And the reluctance to spend on buildings and equipment might help explain why employment is at a record high - one of the brightest spots in our economy. After the crisis, firms hung on to workers rather than invest in major projects, as it was the cheaper and more flexible option. They may be doing the same again. And while incomes in real terms, once the cost of living is accounted for, are on the rise, they remain lower on average than ahead of the financial crisis. Pay rises have been sluggish, but higher-than-expected inflation has also played a part, in particular in 2017. Prices that year rose by close to 3%, almost twice as much as expected pre-referendum. A higher cost of living means budgets don't stretch as far. That rise in inflation largely reflected a drop in the exchange rate in the aftermath of the referendum - which meant that sterling is worth about 10% less than it was previously. That led to a corresponding rise in the cost of many imports. A weaker pound may mean it's more expensive for UK holidaymakers to venture abroad - but on the upside, it makes the UK a more attractive destination.  A record 39.2 million overseas visitors came to the UK in 2017, spending Â£24.5bn. In theory, too, a weaker pound makes UK exports more attractive.  Sales to overseas customers were stronger than anticipated pre-referendum - but they rose by less than would have been expected. And surveys over the last couple of months have suggested export orders have dried up, perhaps as customers fear a no-deal scenario could spell delay and extra charges on delivery. What happens when the ""Brexit fog"" lifts? The government has hinted at hopes of a ""deal dividend"" - businesses and consumers going ahead with the spending that they may have been holding back. It'll take a while to fathom if that has happened - and then it'll be time to start looking at the impact of Brexit itself.

"The squadron of drones would have an expected cost of Â£7m ""Swarm squadrons"" of drones are to be deployed by British armed forces to overwhelm enemy air defences, the defence secretary has said. Gavin Williamson said the specially-adapted drones could be in operation by the end of 2019. He also warned in a speech that the UK needs a bolder and stronger armed forces prepared to use ""hard power"". Labour has said the military's role on the international stage had been ""completely undermined"" by Tory cuts. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute, Mr Williamson said Britain must stand up to those who ""flout international law"". There was an extra Â£1.8bn for defence in the last budget and Mr Williamson said Brexit had brought the UK its ""greatest opportunity"" to strengthen its global presence. He said the military's cyber capabilities will be reinforced to defend and launch attacks. The squadrons of ""network enabled"" drones would cost around Â£7m, he added. Mr Williamson says the UK needs a bigger and bolder armed forces By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Gavin Williamson will struggle to match his global ambitions with the realities of an already overstretched defence budget and a smaller British armed forces. MPs say there is already a growing black hole in the MoD's Â£180bn equipment plan. But instead of making cuts, Mr Williamson is adding more to his shopping list. He wants two new ""multi-role vessels"" to support Royal Marines in a range of operations from humanitarian support to war-fighting. This he believes could be done cheaply by converting civilian cargo ships but there is still no costs or mention of who will crew them - the Royal Navy certainly does not have the manpower. Mr Williamson talks of introducing swarm squadrons of drones to overcome an enemy's air defences. The MoD believes the technology could be bought ""off the shelf"" but, in truth, the concept is still untried and untested. The MoD still insists these plans have all been costed but its past financial record will give many a reason to doubt. Detailing plans to modernise the armed forces, he said it must increase its ""mass and lethality"" - revealing plans for two ships that could be deployed for crisis support as well as military operations. He said they would be able to respond ""at a moment's notice"" to support the Royal Marines. According to the MoD, the UK could purchase and adapt cargo ships or ferries with existing hulls to create the new vessels. The defence secretary also confirmed the Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is being deployed to the Pacific region, where China has been involved in adispute over territorial claims in the South China Sea. The carrier will take part in the mission along with F-35 jets from the UK and US. The Royal Navy's HMS Queen Elizabeth is being deployed to the Pacific region Mr Williamson said Britain and its allies had to be ready ""to use hard power to support our interests"". He told those gathered for his speech that ""state-on-state competition was reviving"".

"The squadron of drones would have an expected cost of Â£7m ""Swarm squadrons"" of drones are to be deployed by British armed forces to overwhelm enemy air defences, the defence secretary has said. Gavin Williamson said the specially-adapted drones could be in operation by the end of 2019. He also warned in a speech that the UK needs a bolder and stronger armed forces prepared to use ""hard power"". Labour has said the military's role on the international stage had been ""completely undermined"" by Tory cuts. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute, Mr Williamson said Britain must stand up to those who ""flout international law"". There was an extra Â£1.8bn for defence in the last budget and Mr Williamson said Brexit had brought the UK its ""greatest opportunity"" to strengthen its global presence. He said the military's cyber capabilities will be reinforced to defend and launch attacks. The squadrons of ""network enabled"" drones would cost around Â£7m, he added. Mr Williamson says the UK needs a bigger and bolder armed forces By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Gavin Williamson will struggle to match his global ambitions with the realities of an already overstretched defence budget and a smaller British armed forces. MPs say there is already a growing black hole in the MoD's Â£180bn equipment plan. But instead of making cuts, Mr Williamson is adding more to his shopping list. He wants two new ""multi-role vessels"" to support Royal Marines in a range of operations from humanitarian support to war-fighting. This he believes could be done cheaply by converting civilian cargo ships but there is still no costs or mention of who will crew them - the Royal Navy certainly does not have the manpower. Mr Williamson talks of introducing swarm squadrons of drones to overcome an enemy's air defences. The MoD believes the technology could be bought ""off the shelf"" but, in truth, the concept is still untried and untested. The MoD still insists these plans have all been costed but its past financial record will give many a reason to doubt. Detailing plans to modernise the armed forces, he said it must increase its ""mass and lethality"" - revealing plans for two ships that could be deployed for crisis support as well as military operations. He said they would be able to respond ""at a moment's notice"" to support the Royal Marines. According to the MoD, the UK could purchase and adapt cargo ships or ferries with existing hulls to create the new vessels. The defence secretary also confirmed the Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is being deployed to the Pacific region, where China has been involved in adispute over territorial claims in the South China Sea. The carrier will take part in the mission along with F-35 jets from the UK and US. The Royal Navy's HMS Queen Elizabeth is being deployed to the Pacific region Mr Williamson said Britain and its allies had to be ready ""to use hard power to support our interests"".

"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The family of missing pilot David Ibbotson have said they don't want him left ""out there on his own"". Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, was flying Cardiff City's Emiliano Sala from Nantes to the UK when their plane crashed near Guernsey on 21 January. The footballer's body was recovered from the wreck on the seabed, but Mr Ibbotson's body has not been found. An inquest into the death of Sala was opened and adjourned at Bournemouth Coroner's Court. The court heard that he died of injuries to his ""head and trunk"" and was identified by his fingerprints. Investigations launched by the police, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and the Civil Aviation Authority are estimated to take between six to 12 months to complete, the court was told. A fundraising appeal to fund an underwater search for the pilot has seen about Â£150,000 donated. Mr Ibbotson's daughter Danielle told ITV's Good Morning Britain she repeatedly rang his mobile phone when told by police the aircraft was missing. ""He was amazing, I was so lucky to have him as a dad. I know it might take a long time but I don't want this to just be it,"" she said. More news from across Lincolnshire Ms Ibbotson said she wanted a search team to ""just to go down and have a last look, a proper look"". The pilot's wife Nora added: ""We're still holding on a little bit. Obviously we do know he's gone but we want him back. ""We can't leave him out there on his own."" Who owned the plane Sala died in? Minute's silence observed at Cardiff game Bid to recover body from Sala plane wreck France and Paris St-Germain striker Kylian Mbappe hasdonated Â£27,000 to the appealto find Mr Ibbotson's body. The light aircraft was en route to Cardiff when it crashed two days after Argentine striker Sala's Â£15m transfer was announced. An initial search for the missing footballer and Mr Ibbotson was called off on 24 January. However, following calls for it to continue from stars including Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona, a private search funded by online donations was launched. It led to the discovery of the Piper PA-46 Malibu aircraft and a body, formally identified as Sala. The aircraft remains 220ft (67m) under water, 21 miles (34km) off Guernsey in the English Channel.

"Hungary's population is falling and the prime minister hopes these measures will reverse the trend Hungarian women with four children or more will be exempted for life from paying income tax, the prime minister has said, unveiling plans designed to boost the number of babies being born. It was a way of defending Hungary's future without depending on immigration, Viktor Orban said. The right-wing nationalist particularly opposes immigration by Muslims. Hungary's population is falling by 32,000 a year. Women there have fewer children than the EU average. As part of the measures, young couples will be offered interest-free loans of 10m forint (Â£27,400; $36,000), to be cancelled once they have three children. Mr Orban said that ""for the West"", the answer to falling birth rates in Europe was immigration: ""For every missing child, there should be one coming in and then the numbers will be fine. ""Hungarian people think differently,"" he said. ""We do not need numbers. We need Hungarian children."" Orban has taken a hard line on immigration, often clashing with his European counterparts While Mr Orban was delivering his state of the nation address, the latest demonstrations were being held in Budapest against his government's policies. About 2,000 people gathered in front of his office, while others blocked one of the main bridges across the Danube river. Viktor Orban: The man who thinks Europe has been invaded Correspondents say the biggest applause during Mr Orban's speech was for his announcement of a seven-point plan to increase the birth rate. Other points in the government's plan include: A pledge to create 21,000 nursery places over the next three years An extra $2.5bn to be spent on the country's healthcare system Housing subsidies State support for those buying seven-seat vehicles Mr Orban finished his speech with: ""Long live Hungary and long live the Hungarians!"" The average number of children a Hungarian woman will have in her lifetime (fertility rate) is 1.45. This puts the country below the EU average of 1.58. 'Remarkable' decline in fertility rates Why is IVF so popular in Denmark? 'Why I never want babies' 'Iâm not having children because I want to save the planet' In 2016,France had the highest fertility rate in the EU,external- 1.92 children per woman - and Spain and Italy had the lowest at 1.34, the EU statistics agency Eurostat reports. Niger, in West Africa, has the highest fertility rate in the world, with 7.24 children per woman. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest writes: Critics of the government say its package and pro-family policy so far target well-off families and ignore the Hungarian poor, including an estimated 750,000 Roma (Gypsies). Tax relief does little to help families who pay little tax anyway. Housing subsidies of â¬35,000 (Â£30,666) were offered to families able to invest a similar sum of their own - but few Roma have such savings. The nationalist Fidesz government has cut welfare payments and reduced the number of months those made unemployed can claim for. The population has been falling steadily, from a peak of 10.7 million in 1980, to below 9.7 million today. About 600,000 Hungarians have moved to western Europe in the past decade - it is impossible to calculate how many will return. ""Increasing the number of births is very difficult, because we have less and less women of child-bearing age,"" State Secretary for Families Katalin Novak told the BBC. That number is set to fall by 20% in the next decade. ""So less and less women need to have more and more babies."" The government's new package, she emphasised, is based on the number of babies couples would actually like to have, and then to encourage them with financial help. The aim is to increase the fertility rate to 2.1 by 2030. Many other countries with relatively low birth rates have introduced extra payments and other benefits for mothers. Russia'sbirth rate has been declining for decades: the population fell from 149m in 1991 to 140m in 2018, and the median age has risen from 33 to 39. So, to help the poorest families, in March 2018 the government announced monthly payments of 10-11,000 roubles (Â£118-Â£130; $152-$167) until their first child reached 18 months old. A poor family also gets a one-off payment of 300,000 roubles for each additional child born. Serbia,one of Hungary's neighbours, has one of the world's fastest-shrinking populations. It has seven million people and a median age of 43. Last March it announced that new mothers would get a one-off payment worth Â£740 ($956) for their first child, monthly payments of Â£74 ($96) for the second child for two years, and further payments for three or more children. The birth rate inItalyis among Europe's lowest, along with Cyprus and Spain. Italy gives mothers an allowance of â¬80 per month (Â£70; $90) for each child born. The poorest families get a monthly allowance of â¬160 per child. InGermanymore babies were born in 2016 than in any year since 1996. But Germany has also put more incentives in place for couples to have children. Parents have a legal right to a nursery place once their child is one year old. Germany has a new law, the ""Good KiTa Act"", granting lower childcare fees for parents who cannot afford the full price, and a fee exemption for parents who receive a child allowance and housing benefits. Low birth rates are also worrying governments in East Asia. The marriage rate inSouth Koreais at its lowest since records began - 5.5 per 1,000 people, compared with 9.2 in 1970 - and very few children are born outside marriage. According to World Bank data for 2016, just a few countries, including Singapore and Moldova, have a fertility rate as low as South Korea's - 1.2 per woman. The replacement rate - the number needed for a population to remain level - is 2.1. Fertility rates are also low in China (1.6) and Japan (1.4). Mothers, your country needs you!

"A football player and refugee whose detention in Thailand sparked an outcry has been freed from jail after Bahrain withdrew its extradition request. Hakeem al-Araibi, who is a Bahraini citizen, fled to Australia in 2014 and was granted political asylum. He was detained in Bangkok in November on an Interpol notice requested by Bahrain. He had travelled to the Thai capital on honeymoon. He was sentenced in absentia to 10 years for vandalising a police station. Al-Araibi, 25, denies the charges. Human rights activists say he could face torture if sent back to Bahrain, where he was a vocal critic of the authorities. His case has been taken up by high-profile footballers, with stars including Didier Drogba and Jamie Vardy calling for his release. The Australian government, football's international governing body Fifa and the International Olympic Committee all lobbied Thailand. Thailand's Office of the Attorney General (OAG) asked the court to end proceedings against al-Araibi because Bahrain had said it no longer wanted him, officials told BBC Thai on Monday. ""This morning the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed us that Bahrain was no longer interested in this request,"" OAG foreign office chief Chatchom Akapin said. Al-Araibi is expected to leave Thailand on Monday evening for Australia. Bahrain's foreign ministry said that despite the end of the extradition proceedings, the footballer's conviction still stood. ""The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms its right to pursue all necessary legal actions against Mr al-Araibi,"" it added. Bahraini footballer case 'an emergency' Fifa contacts Thailand over Al-Araibi Bahrain country profile The Thai foreign minister was in Bahrain over the weekend for an official visit and met senior leaders. Bahrain's foreign ministry on Monday said that despite the end of the extradition proceedings, the footballer's conviction still stood. ""The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms its right to pursue all necessary legal actions against Mr al-Araibi,"" it added. Craig Foster, a former Australian national football captain and TV host who spearheaded the campaign to free al-Araibi, said there were ""tears"" in his household ""right now"".

He told the BBC that it was ""an extraordinary day"". ""Sanity has prevailed, international law has been upheld,"" he said, adding he was glad that football had ""stepped forward"". There had been criticism that football bodies, including Fifa, had not initially lobbied strongly enough  on behalf of al-Araibi. Mr Foster and world players' union FIFPro had urged Fifa to threaten sporting sanctions against Bahrain and Thailand. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra that he thanked Bangkok for ""listening to the issues"" Australia had raised. ""Now the next step is for him to return home. But as it always is in these cases, people aren't home until they're home,"" he said. Al-Araibi plays for Pascoe Vale FC in Melbourne. Last month, his wife told the BBC that extradition would put him in danger. ""I'm calling on every country to help Hakeem because I know if he gets taken back, he will be tortured, and he will be killed,"" she said. But Bahrain said al-Araibi had been sentenced by an independent judiciary ""on charges involving serious violence and criminality, unrelated to any possible freedom of opinion/expression issues"". It said his safety would be ""guaranteed"" if he returned to Bahrain to appeal against the sentence. Hakeem's arrest caused an outcry in Australia Human rights activists lauded Monday's news. ""This is a huge victory for the human rights movement in Bahrain, Thailand and Australia, and even the whole world,"" said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, London-based campaign group. ""Hakeem's ordeal ended after 70 days when there was a clear public stance and solidarity movement.

"This video can not be played Nick Kwek toured the border dividing the US state of Arizona and Mexico's Sonora US congressional talks over a border security deal have stalled, raising the chances of another government shutdown. Negotiators were hoping for a deal by Monday to give Congress time to pass legislation by Friday, when the federal funding agreement runs out. They remain divided on how many undocumented immigrants can be detained and funding for President Trump's promised border wall with Mexico. The previous shutdown, lasting 35 days, was the longest in US history. Hundreds of thousands of workers were furloughed while others in essential services, such as hospital care, air traffic control and law enforcement, worked without pay. The cost to the US economy wasestimated at $11bn (Â£8.5bn).,external What is a government shutdown? How the last US shutdown hurt Trump's wall: How tech fills the gaps It was unclear how the negotiators would try to reach a deal, but a meeting has been scheduled for later on Monday, congressional aides said. The 17 Republican and Democratic negotiators from the Senate and the House have been holding talks to reach a border security agreement that can be accepted by Congress. The latest impasse seems to be centred on a Democratic demand to limit the number of undocumented migrants already in the US who can be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Democrats planned to cap the number of beds at detention centres reserved for those cases at 16,500. By doing that, they hoped to force ICE to focus on detaining irregular migrants with criminal records instead of those who have overstayed their visas and, Democrats say, are productive and offer no threat. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? They were also looking at between $1.3bn and $2bn in funding for Mr Trump's proposed border wall, a long way off the $5.7bn the president has been demanding. In a series of tweets on Monday,President Trump said that Democrats needed to ""loosen up"",external, adding that their latest demand relating to the detention of migrants was ""crazy"".

The president had earlier said the Democrats were ""behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally"",external. Lead Republican negotiator Sen Richard Shelby told Fox News: ""I'll say 50-50 we get a deal... The spectre of a shutdown is always out there."" However, one of the Democratic negotiators, Jon Tester, said there was still hope that a deal could be reached in time. Also speaking to Fox News, he said: ""Negotiations seldom go smooth all the way through."" As wall discussions labour on, Mr Trump plans on sending over 3,700 active troops to the US-Mexico border to help agents with security efforts this month. With over 2,000 troops already at the border, the new deployment would top November's election-time numbers of 5,900. Meanwhile, pushing back against the Trump administration's call for border states to help with security, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom says he will recall hundreds of the state's national guard from the border. Gov Newsom's move follows his Democratic colleague, Gov Michelle Grisham of New Mexico, who pulled her state's troops from the border last week. Both governors have cited the withdrawal as a retaliation against Mr Trump's ""fear-mongering"". On 25 January, President Trump agreed to a three-week spending deal to end the shutdown and allow Congress to reach an agreement. That funding ends at midnight on Friday.Another short-term deal could prevent a new shutdown,external, according to the New York Times. Mr Trump -who has suggested the talks are a ""waste of time""- made building a wall on the border with Mexico one of his key promises in the 2016 campaign. The president has backed away from his calls to make Mexico pay for a concrete wall but during his State of the Union speech last Tuesday - delayed because of the previous shutdown - he insisted on a ""smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier"".

"A football player and refugee whose detention in Thailand sparked an outcry has been freed from jail after Bahrain withdrew its extradition request. Hakeem al-Araibi, who is a Bahraini citizen, fled to Australia in 2014 and was granted political asylum. He was detained in Bangkok in November on an Interpol notice requested by Bahrain. He had travelled to the Thai capital on honeymoon. He was sentenced in absentia to 10 years for vandalising a police station. Al-Araibi, 25, denies the charges. Human rights activists say he could face torture if sent back to Bahrain, where he was a vocal critic of the authorities. His case has been taken up by high-profile footballers, with stars including Didier Drogba and Jamie Vardy calling for his release. The Australian government, football's international governing body Fifa and the International Olympic Committee all lobbied Thailand. Thailand's Office of the Attorney General (OAG) asked the court to end proceedings against al-Araibi because Bahrain had said it no longer wanted him, officials told BBC Thai on Monday. ""This morning the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed us that Bahrain was no longer interested in this request,"" OAG foreign office chief Chatchom Akapin said. Al-Araibi is expected to leave Thailand on Monday evening for Australia. Bahrain's foreign ministry said that despite the end of the extradition proceedings, the footballer's conviction still stood. ""The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms its right to pursue all necessary legal actions against Mr al-Araibi,"" it added.

He told the BBC that it was ""an extraordinary day"". ""Sanity has prevailed, international law has been upheld,"" he said, adding he was glad that football had ""stepped forward"". There had been criticism that football bodies, including Fifa, had not initially lobbied strongly enough  on behalf of al-Araibi. Mr Foster and world players' union FIFPro had urged Fifa to threaten sporting sanctions against Bahrain and Thailand. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra that he thanked Bangkok for ""listening to the issues"" Australia had raised. ""Now the next step is for him to return home. But as it always is in these cases, people aren't home until they're home,"" he said. Al-Araibi plays for Pascoe Vale FC in Melbourne. Last month, his wife told the BBC that extradition would put him in danger. ""I'm calling on every country to help Hakeem because I know if he gets taken back, he will be tortured, and he will be killed,"" she said. But Bahrain said al-Araibi had been sentenced by an independent judiciary ""on charges involving serious violence and criminality, unrelated to any possible freedom of opinion/expression issues"". It said his safety would be ""guaranteed"" if he returned to Bahrain to appeal against the sentence. Hakeem's arrest caused an outcry in Australia Human rights activists lauded Monday's news. ""This is a huge victory for the human rights movement in Bahrain, Thailand and Australia, and even the whole world,"" said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, London-based campaign group.

The names of the five houses at St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School in Bristol are all linked to white males, but will now be changed to ""reflect diversity"".

""We want every young person, whatever their gender, ethnic background and family income, to know that they can aspire to any number of careers and roles in society."" The changes mean that Colston House becomes Johnson House after Katherine Johnson, who worked for NASA as a mathematician.

"This video can not be played Equine flu: Inside the Newmarket laboratory that detected the outbreak Four new positive tests for equine flu have been returned in vaccinated thoroughbreds at the Newmarket yard of flat trainer Simon Crisford. Racing is on hold until at least Wednesday while the British Horseracing Authority tests horses nationwide. The suspension came after the discovery on Thursday of six cases of equine flu atDonald McCain'sCheshire stable. Crisford's yard was named so ""the Newmarket community is aware"" where the infection has been found, the BHA said. But Crisford says there is ""no obvious connection"" between the horses that have tested positive for equine flu at his yard and their stablemate who ran at a potential risk fixture last week. Crisford confirmed Sajanjl, who ran at Newcastle last week, has tested negative. What now for horse racing, Cheltenham and jockeys? In a statement, he said none of the four horses who tested positive displayed any clinical signs of respiratory illness prior to the mandatory swabbing undertaken last Friday. ""All horses at Kremlin House Stables, totalling 92 boxes, undergo a strict vaccination check and programme on their arrival,"" the statement added. ""All four identified horses have been vaccinated within the last six months along with the rest of the yard and in line with vaccination protocol."" The yard is one of the 174 to be tested because runners from the stable competed at the fixture at Newcastle on 5 February, which had been identified as a potential risk fixture. All the affected horses are contained within Crisford's yard, the BHA said. The BHA is set to announce when racing can begin again on Monday evening. The Animal Health Trust (AHT), which is carrying out testing on behalf of the BHA, is working through ""several thousands of samples"" received from yards across Britain. Earlier on Sunday, the BHA reported that around 1,500 samples had been analysed without a positive test. The authority also confirmed that testing had been carried out on the remaining 27 horses from the yard of Rebecca Menzies - where testing of three suspected cases came back negative on Saturday. All horses in the yard have tested negative, but it will ""remain under close surveillance and further testing will be carried out"", the authority said. Equine flu - not unlike human flu - is endemic in Britain, where racehorses are vaccinated against it. The virus is generally not thought to be life-threatening, but limits the competitive capability of horses. An unvaccinated non-thoroughbred horse was put down in Suffolk after developing complications following an outbreak of equine influenza. In a separate case, 10 unraced two-year-old thoroughbreds in the same county were found to have contracted the highly contagious virus. There have been outbreaks of equine influenza in nine English counties since the start of 2019. One case involves a vaccinated non-thoroughbred horse in stables at a fee-paying school in the south west of England. Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent Just when people were thinking that the light at the end of the tunnel was getting brighterâ¦ After two days of no positive test among hundreds of swabs studied by scientists, the feeling was that the resumption of racing this week, maybe on Wednesday, was very much on the cards. But this would appear to jeopardise that hope, for flat racing on the all-weather tracks anyway. The Crisford operation at Newmarket is flat racing only, and there's no obvious connection with the McCain string - certainly the two stables have had no runners at the same venues of late.

"Hungary's population is falling and the prime minister hopes these measures will reverse the trend Hungarian women with four children or more will be exempted for life from paying income tax, the prime minister has said, unveiling plans designed to boost the number of babies being born. It was a way of defending Hungary's future without depending on immigration, Viktor Orban said. The right-wing nationalist particularly opposes immigration by Muslims. Hungary's population is falling by 32,000 a year. Women there have fewer children than the EU average. As part of the measures, young couples will be offered interest-free loans of 10m forint (Â£27,400; $36,000), to be cancelled once they have three children. Mr Orban said that ""for the West"", the answer to falling birth rates in Europe was immigration: ""For every missing child, there should be one coming in and then the numbers will be fine. ""Hungarian people think differently,"" he said. ""We do not need numbers. We need Hungarian children."" Orban has taken a hard line on immigration, often clashing with his European counterparts While Mr Orban was delivering his state of the nation address, the latest demonstrations were being held in Budapest against his government's policies. About 2,000 people gathered in front of his office, while others blocked one of the main bridges across the Danube river. Viktor Orban: The man who thinks Europe has been invaded Correspondents say the biggest applause during Mr Orban's speech was for his announcement of a seven-point plan to increase the birth rate. Other points in the government's plan include: A pledge to create 21,000 nursery places over the next three years An extra $2.5bn to be spent on the country's healthcare system Housing subsidies State support for those buying seven-seat vehicles Mr Orban finished his speech with: ""Long live Hungary and long live the Hungarians!"" The average number of children a Hungarian woman will have in her lifetime (fertility rate) is 1.45. This puts the country below the EU average of 1.58. 'Remarkable' decline in fertility rates Why is IVF so popular in Denmark? 'Why I never want babies' 'Iâm not having children because I want to save the planet' In 2016,France had the highest fertility rate in the EU,external- 1.92 children per woman - and Spain and Italy had the lowest at 1.34, the EU statistics agency Eurostat reports. Niger, in West Africa, has the highest fertility rate in the world, with 7.24 children per woman. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest writes: Critics of the government say its package and pro-family policy so far target well-off families and ignore the Hungarian poor, including an estimated 750,000 Roma (Gypsies). Tax relief does little to help families who pay little tax anyway. Housing subsidies of â¬35,000 (Â£30,666) were offered to families able to invest a similar sum of their own - but few Roma have such savings. The nationalist Fidesz government has cut welfare payments and reduced the number of months those made unemployed can claim for. The population has been falling steadily, from a peak of 10.7 million in 1980, to below 9.7 million today. About 600,000 Hungarians have moved to western Europe in the past decade - it is impossible to calculate how many will return. ""Increasing the number of births is very difficult, because we have less and less women of child-bearing age,"" State Secretary for Families Katalin Novak told the BBC. That number is set to fall by 20% in the next decade. ""So less and less women need to have more and more babies."" The government's new package, she emphasised, is based on the number of babies couples would actually like to have, and then to encourage them with financial help. The aim is to increase the fertility rate to 2.1 by 2030. Many other countries with relatively low birth rates have introduced extra payments and other benefits for mothers. Russia'sbirth rate has been declining for decades: the population fell from 149m in 1991 to 140m in 2018, and the median age has risen from 33 to 39. So, to help the poorest families, in March 2018 the government announced monthly payments of 10-11,000 roubles (Â£118-Â£130; $152-$167) until their first child reached 18 months old. A poor family also gets a one-off payment of 300,000 roubles for each additional child born. Serbia,one of Hungary's neighbours, has one of the world's fastest-shrinking populations. It has seven million people and a median age of 43. Last March it announced that new mothers would get a one-off payment worth Â£740 ($956) for their first child, monthly payments of Â£74 ($96) for the second child for two years, and further payments for three or more children. The birth rate inItalyis among Europe's lowest, along with Cyprus and Spain. Italy gives mothers an allowance of â¬80 per month (Â£70; $90) for each child born. The poorest families get a monthly allowance of â¬160 per child. InGermanymore babies were born in 2016 than in any year since 1996. But Germany has also put more incentives in place for couples to have children. Parents have a legal right to a nursery place once their child is one year old. Germany has a new law, the ""Good KiTa Act"", granting lower childcare fees for parents who cannot afford the full price, and a fee exemption for parents who receive a child allowance and housing benefits. Low birth rates are also worrying governments in East Asia. The marriage rate inSouth Koreais at its lowest since records began - 5.5 per 1,000 people, compared with 9.2 in 1970 - and very few children are born outside marriage. According to World Bank data for 2016, just a few countries, including Singapore and Moldova, have a fertility rate as low as South Korea's - 1.2 per woman. The replacement rate - the number needed for a population to remain level - is 2.1. Fertility rates are also low in China (1.6) and Japan (1.4). Mothers, your country needs you!

"PM Scott Morrison says letting in sick asylum seekers would unleash ""a world of woe"" Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison is campaigning to block a bill that would let sick asylum seekers in offshore centres get treatment in Australia. Mr Morrison said the bill would ""take control from the government"", and ""unleash a world of woe"". Australia has sent asylum seekers who arrive by boat to detention centres on the Pacific islands of Nauru and Manus. Its tough immigration policy has been repeatedly criticised. Australia asylum: Why is it controversial? What is Nauru like? ""The problem with the bill is it takes control from the government and contracts it out to others who don't have those same interests or responsibilities,"",externalMr Morrison said on Monday, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. The detention centre on Nauru has been dogged by allegations of widespread abuse and trauma among children and women. Australia's parliament is expected to vote on the bill on Tuesday. Under the proposed changes, doctors would have the power to transfer refugees on Nauru and Manus to Australia for treatment. However, the immigration minister could ask an independent panel to review the medical assessment, and would have authority to overrule it. Mr Morrison criticised the proposal, which was passed in the Senate last year with the support of the opposition Labor party, saying it would lead to deaths at sea. ""They have no idea of the consequences of what they are playing with. They will unleash a world of woe again. I've seen it before,"" he said. Defence Minister Christopher Pyne similarly voiced his opposition, saying the changes would lead migrants to come to Australia ""one way or the other, saying they have a need to because of ill-health"". Thousands of doctors have already signed a petition calling for the bill to be passed. ""[It] is a sensible solution which allows doctors to take care of their patients if they need urgent care not available on Nauru or Manus,"" read the petition.,external There have been several high-profile cases of asylum seekers falling ill over the past few years, including an Iranian on Manus Island who died in 2014. Refugee's emergency revives Australia row He was flown unconscious to Brisbane, four days after first complaining of being ill, where he later died. Australia intercepts all asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. It insists they will never be able to resettle in Australia -  even if they are found to be refugees - and over the years has sent many to privately run ""processing centres"" it funds on Nauru, or Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. According to figures provided by the Refugee Council of Australia, more than 1,200 asylum seekers were believed to be on the islands last November - about 600 people on each. The detention centre on Nauru has been criticised by human rights advocates Australia's processing centre for asylum seekers on Nauru has long been plagued by allegations of human rights abuses, with one professor of psychiatry saying children as young as eight were showing ""suicidal behaviour"". Many of these children have lived most of their lives in these detention centres - though Australia has now said that the last four migrant children on Nauru have been moved to the US. Australia maintains that its immigration policy prevents deaths at sea and discourages people-smugglers.

"Theresa May will update MPs on Tuesday about recent Brexit talks as she continues to seek support for her deal. She visited Dublin and Brussels last week seeking EU agreement on changes to the backstop - the ""insurance"" policy to avoid the return of visible Northern Ireland border checks. Last month MPs - who will debate Brexit on Thursday - voted for the PM to find alternatives to the current backstop. But the EU has said it would not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. However, efforts to come up with a solution acceptable to both sides continue. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay met a group of Tory MPs working on possible alternatives to the backstop, before he travelled to Brussels and held talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Following the meeting, Mr Barnier said the talks had been ""constructive"", but added it was ""clear from our side we're not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement, but we will continue our discussions in the coming days"". A statement from the Department for Exiting the European Union said Mr Barclay and Mr Barnier had agreed to further talks ""in the coming days"". Their teams would continue to work in the meantime ""on finding a way forward"", it added. Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? New ideas for the Brexit border backstop UK signs trade deal with Switzerland The statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday - a day earlier than had been expected - follows an exchange of letters between Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader wrote to the PM on Wednesday,externalwith a list of five demands to secure his party's support for her deal, including a permanent customs union. The prime minister struck a conciliatory tone in her response overnight and said she looked forward to the two parties meeting again ""as soon as possible"" to discuss ways forward on Brexit. But No 10 said it rejected any proposals to remain in a customs union with the EU. Some of her cabinet members also quashed the idea, with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox calling Mr Corbyn's proposal a ""dangerous delusion"". Mrs May told the Labour leader: ""It is good to see that we agree that the UK should leave the European Union with a deal and that the urgent task at hand is to find a deal that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland, can command support in Parliament and can be negotiated with the EU - not to seek an election or second referendum."" This is despite Mr Corbyn repeatedly saying there should be a general election if Mrs May cannot get a deal through Parliament. He has also faced pressure from some of his MPs to push for another public vote on Brexit. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said his ""key question"" about Mrs May's response was: ""Is she prepared to move her red lines and find a consensus?"" ""I don't see that in the letter,"" he said. ""The point of the exercise was to say, look, there is a majority for a close economic relationship, if you're prepared to try to find it, and I've said for some time we should test that by having a vote on a customs union.""

But fellow Labour MP Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Politics Live that there were between 40 and 60 of her colleagues ""who are actively looking for ways to support"" a revised Brexit deal. She said the government needed to ""get serious"" about policy on a customs union and guarantee to ""legislate for the protections around workers' rights"". This video can not be played Lisa Nandy says 40 to 60 Labour MPs âactively looking for ways to support"" a new Brexit deal The anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats said it was ""astonishing"" the two leaders were starting ""serious discussions about delivering disastrous Brexit together"" 900 days after the vote to leave the EU. Brexit spokesman Tom Brake added: ""It is time for Jeremy Corbyn to give up the letters and instead draw his attention to Labour Party policy and get behind the campaign for a People's Vote."" The GMB union criticised the government's ""dangerous brinkmanship"" after Mrs May rejected remaining in a customs union. It has urged the extension of Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March. Meanwhile, speaking in Luxembourg, Mr Barnier said he would judge how interested the UK was in changes to the accompanying political declaration, which sketches out the shape of the future relationship. He said the EU was waiting for a clear and stable majority to emerge in the House of Commons, not just for the passage of the withdrawal agreement, but for the subsequent legislation too. Mr Corbyn's letter to the prime minister was ""interesting in tone and substance"", Mr Barnier said. Elsewhere, members of the Alternative Arrangements Working Group - including Conservative MPs Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh, Owen Paterson, Damian Green and Nicky Morgan - met government officials in Westminster. Mr Baker said the talks had been ""constructive"" and they were ""looking forward to hearing how Stephen Barclay gets on with Michel Barnier"". The group has met several times to discuss alternative arrangements to the proposed Irish border ""backstop"". By Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor It could have been a very different sort of letter. Mrs May could have just underscored her red lines: No to extending Article 50. No to another referendum. No to a customs union. Instead, it's a much more conciliatory and consensual letter. There's praise for Mr Corbyn in accepting the priority now should be on reaching a Brexit deal, rather than pressing for a general election. Praise too for his acknowledgement that the backstop has got to be changed. And there's some movement on employment rights and the promise of more cash for hard pressed communities. Even on the customs union - their key dividing area - Mrs May's language is more nuanced, even though privately her aides insist there can be no question of accepting a permanent customs union. It's unlikely to be anywhere near enough to win over Mr Corbyn. But it may be enough for those Labour MPs in leave supporting constituencies, who are looking for political cover to back or abstain on Mrs May's deal. In his letter, Mr Corbyn asked for five changes to be made to the Brexit deal. The Labour leader called for a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"" with the EU to be introduced to the deal, with the same external tariff. He said it would give the UK a say on any future trade deals that the EU may strike. In her reply, Mrs May said the political declaration - the second part of her deal which is a non-legally binding statement on the future relationship between the UK and EU - ""explicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union"", with no tariffs, fees, charges and restrictions. The customs union explained What is Labour's customs union policy? But, she said, it also allows for the UK to strike up its own trade deals elsewhere. She added her reassurance that securing frictionless trade with the EU was ""one of our key negotiating objectives"". Speaking in Switzerland, where Mr Fox has just signed a deal to see the country trade with the UK on the same terms it does now, the minister said the idea was ""not workable"". Mr Corbyn also wanted the deal to include a promise for the UK to be closely aligned with the Single Market after it leaves the EU, ""underpinned by shared institutions and obligations"". Mrs May quoted the EU as saying the current deal provides for the closest relationship possible outside the Single Market. She added: ""I am not sure what exactly you mean when you say 'shared institutions and obligations', but our teams can explore that."" The single market explained The PM also repeated the EU's warning that completely frictionless trade is only possible if the UK stays in the Single Market. ""This would mean accepting free movement, which Labour's 2017 General Election manifesto made clear you do not support,"" she added. Please upgrade your browser Labour has called for the UK to stay in step with the EU on rights and protections for workers, which was included in Mr Corbyn's letter. On this point, Mrs May said the government had already made commitments on workers' rights, adding: ""We are examining opportunities to provide further financial support to communities that feel left behind."" This could be referring toproposals that were said to have been discussed earlier this month from a group of Labour MPs in predominantly Leave-supporting constituencies,to allocate more funds to their communities for big infrastructure projects. The PM also said that while she had ""always been clear that Brexit should not be at the expense of workers' rights or environmental protections"", she did not support automatically following EU rules in these areas. The Labour leader called for a promise to participate in EU agencies and funding programmes on the environment, education and industry regulation after Brexit. The prime minister said the government supports participation in EU programmes in a number of areas, as set out in the political declaration - which includes areas such as science and innovation, youth, culture and education, and overseas development. Finally, Mr Corbyn demanded agreements with the EU on security, such as access to the European Arrest Warrant database. Mrs May said the government ""shares your ambition in relation to security arrangements"". She said the political declaration secured agreement on the exchange of Passenger Name Record, DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data and on arrangements ""akin to the European Arrest Warrant to surrender suspected and convicted persons efficiently and expeditiously."" But, she added, there is a challenge that as a third country outside of the EU, there are restrictions on the UK's ability to participate in some EU tools and measures.

"Chancellor Philip Hammond is due to unveil his Spring Statement next month Philip Hammond must spend billions extra to end austerity, says think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). To maintain per capita spending across government departments that do not have ring-fenced budgets, he must find an extra Â£5bn a year by 2023, it adds. And maintaining spending on unprotected services as a share of national income would require Â£11bn on top of spending plans set out in the 2018 Budget. The Treasury says long-term funding decisions will be made later this year. In its analysis, the IFS said spending increases already promised by the chancellor would be swallowed up by commitments to fund the NHS, defence and international aid. That could mean cuts in other areas, IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme. ""[Unless he finds the money] we will continue to see cuts in some departments at least as a fraction of national income, and don't forget the scale of the cuts up to now really has been extraordinary historically. ""We've had Â£40bn of cuts to department spending and cuts of 30% and 40% to some budget items. So even if he even if he stops cutting, it's still not going to feel great in a lot of areas."" The Treasury says health is the ""number one spending priority"" But a Treasury spokesman said public investment would hit peaks not seen since 1979. ""The chancellor has said that the Spending Review will take place in 2019, and that is the right moment for government to make long term funding decisions,"" he said. ""We have made clear that health is our number one spending priority by announcing a five-year settlement which will provide an extra Â£34bn a year for the NHS by 2023-24. ""Outside the NHS, total day-to-day departmental spending is now set to grow in line with inflation, and public investment will reach levels not sustained in 40 years in this parliament. "" Meanwhile, the IFS said a no-deal Brexit would mean lower growth, requiring either spending cuts or higher taxes. And it said in the short term the government might need to borrow more to fund a stimulus package to mitigate the impacts for the hardest-hit areas of the economy. But Mr Johnson said any spending boost to spending would be temporary. ""Obviously if there is some kind of no-deal Brexit that is going to be bad for the economy both in the short run and in the long run, there will be less money around. ""[The chancellor] can probably put a bit more money in [in the short run], but in the long run that is going to mean several more years of austerity to row back from that initial expansion."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The evidence is mounting that despite Theresa May's rhetoric, austerity is not over. ""Unless Philip Hammond, at the very least, finds another Â£5bn at the Spring Statement, departments will be planning for yet more cuts next year. ""Nine years of brutal Tory austerity have wounded our public services and the whole country which relies on them."" What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy?

"Claim:Labour is proposing a new permanent customs union with the European Union (EU) after Brexit which would allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Reality Check Verdict:EU law currently does not allow non-EU members to have a formal say or veto in its trade talks. Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past and its proposal cannot be ruled out until the party has had a chance to negotiate formally. There's renewed focus on Labour's Brexit policy as Theresa May holds discussions with opposition MPs, in the wake of the historic defeat of her Brexit deal. One area under the spotlight is Labour's plan for the UK to have a new permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit and the power to have a say in future EU trade talks. The idea that the UK would be allowed such a say has been dismissed by Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary. He's declared Labour's position ""an unprecedented legal and political novelty of the kind that is rightly called a unicorn"". So how realistic is Labour's plan? The purpose of a customs union is to make trade easier. Countries in a customs union agree not to impose charges - known as tariffs - or custom checks on each other's goods. The rules also mean that any goods coming in from the rest of the world pay the same tariff - irrespective of where in the customs union those goods first enter. This is known as a common tariff. For example, a car from the US entering the EU customs union currently attracts a tariff of 10% of the car's value. It doesn't matter if the car arrives in France, Spain or anywhere else - the same one-off 10% charge is applied. That car can then move between all the customs union countries without incurring extra costs or custom checks. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The EU customs union includes the 28 EU member states as well as Monaco. The EU also has customs union arrangements with non-EU members: Turkey, Andorra and San Marino. But under (the EU's) customs union rules, members cannot negotiate their own independent trade deals with countries from the rest of the world. Instead, free trade deals (ie agreements that reduce or eliminate tariffs between countries) can only be negotiated by the EU as a whole. As a result, Theresa May's government has ruled out remaining in the customs union after Brexit, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past At the moment, the EU is negotiating trade agreements with21 countries,external. So what are the chances of Labour's proposal of leaving ""the"" EU customs union and replacing it with ""a"" customs union arrangement where the UK could have a say in those talks? It somewhat depends on what Labour means by a ""say"". Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary,told the Commons,externalthat he favoured: ""A new customs union in which the UK would be able to reject any agreement it believed was concluded to its disadvantage."" He told MPs that this position should have been adopted at the start of the Brexit talks. But allowing the UK a formal role in EU trade talks after Brexit, would not be allowed under current EU rules: ""Trade outside the EU is an exclusive responsibility of the EU.... this means the EU institutions make laws on trade matters, negotiate and conclude international trade agreements,external,"" says the European Commission. Brexit: Are we running out of time? Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? Reality Check: What does Brexit withdrawal agreement mean? Holger Hestermeyer, an expert in international dispute resolution at the British Academy, agrees it would be very difficult: ""To give the UK a say in the EU's talks, the procedure, as set out in EU treaties, would need to be changed. ""A treaty change in that respect will not happen and to give the UK a say without such a change is legally doubtful and politically impossible,"" he says. Labour wants a customs union arrangement that allows the UK to influence any future EU trade deals Labour points out that the EU is already in favour of the UK remaining in a customs union after Brexit. Therefore it believes the EU may well be receptive to the idea of the UK also having a say in future trade deals. Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC that ""the EU is well-known for its ability to be flexible"". If a ""say"" means something less formal, it may be more achievable. But even then it would still be unique - the EU currently has no relationship with any country like the one Labour is asking for. A Labour source told Reality Check that determining exactly how the arrangement could work would be subject to any future negotiation with the EU. Turkey has often been held up as example of a non-EU country entering into a customs union arrangement with the EU. It's had a customs union deal with the EU since 1995, although it's not as comprehensive as the one Labour is seeking. That's because Turkey's customs arrangementonly applies to industrial products,external. This means Turkey has some limited freedom to strike its own trade deals, but only in the areas not covered by its customs union arrangement - such as agriculture. Turkey can also strike deals around the world on services - as this is not a customs union issue. It has a number of trade deals with nearby countries, such as Georgia and Lebanon as well countries as far afield as Chile. However, Turkey is also obliged to apply common external tariffs on industrial products arriving from outside the EU customs union. Turkey has been in an EU customs union arrangement since 1995 This is a very strict rule, according to Catherine Barnard an EU law professor at Cambridge University. ""Under no circumstances may Turkey be authorised to apply a customs tariff which is lower than the common external tariff for any product,external,"" she says. ""The arrangement has boosted trade between the two sides,"" says Alex Stojanovic from the Institute for Government. However, Mr Stojanovic adds that neither the EU nor Turkey is entirely happy with the current arrangement: ""The EU Parliament has released reports criticising the governance of resolving disputes. From Turkey's point of view, it argues it has little input or say in EU trade policy."" Labour says it has ruled-out a Turkey-style arrangement on the grounds it is ""asymmetrical"" and only covers certain goods. However, it remains to be seen whether the EU would accept the type of customs union arrangement the Labour is pursuing instead.

"Economic growth has not been disastrous, but nor has it been sparkling There may still be more than a month to go until Brexit is scheduled to happen, but there has already been some fallout from the decision to leave. Most recently, the prolonged uncertainty - what the governor of the Bank of England refers to as the ""Brexit fog"" - appears to be leaving some potentially worrying scars on prosperity. What is clear, however, is that two-and-a-half years after the referendum, the most dire predictions about what could have happened to financial wellbeing have failed to transpire. Rewind to May 2016. The then chancellor, George Osborne, warned of what he said would happen over the immediate period of two years following a vote to leave the EU. He said: ""A vote to leave would represent an immediate and profound shock to our economy. That shock would push our economy into a recession and lead to an increase in unemployment of around 500,000, ""GDP would be 3.6% smaller, average real wages would be lower, inflation higher, sterling weaker, house prices would be hit and public borrowing would rise compared with a vote to remain."" He was assuming Article 50, the process by which the UK leaves, would be triggered immediately after the vote; in the event, it was nine months later. But the warning stands. Project Fear?  Well, the economy hasn't contracted, and the level of unemployment is actually the lowest on record. But that's not to say that the economy's path hasn't deviated from what had earlier been expected. Of course, there are other issues that will have influenced our economy's path - but the anticipation of the UK leaving the EU is far from insignificant. Let's start with prosperity. The economy has grown at an average of about 1.5% per year since the referendum - not sparkling, but not disastrous either. Average real wages are rising again. But most forecasters had hoped for more. The governor of the Bank of England said last May that households were Â£900 worse off compared with what it had expected pre-referendum. Since then, the gulf between those predictions and reality has widened, because of the prolonged uncertainty over the Brexit outcome. Retail spending slowed sharply towards the end of last year, while surveys suggest new orders have stagnated, such that activity in manufacturing has been driven largely by companies speeding up production to avert the risk of disruption after 29 March. The Bank of England found that business investment has slowed sharply, and reckons it will fall by even more this year. Companies are unwilling to flash the cash until they are confident about what lies ahead. That's not just down to a lack of clarity over Brexit, but a result, too, of weaker demand from elsewhere, as the likes of China and Europe slow down. As a result, the Bank now calculates the total level of GDP is about 1.2% lower than it had expected three years ago. Lower business investment tends to hamper how efficient we can be - that is productivity - and so could have a lingering impact on our economic health. And the reluctance to spend on buildings and equipment might help explain why employment is at a record high - one of the brightest spots in our economy. After the crisis, firms hung on to workers rather than invest in major projects, as it was the cheaper and more flexible option. They may be doing the same again. And while incomes in real terms, once the cost of living is accounted for, are on the rise, they remain lower on average than ahead of the financial crisis. Pay rises have been sluggish, but higher-than-expected inflation has also played a part, in particular in 2017. Prices that year rose by close to 3%, almost twice as much as expected pre-referendum. A higher cost of living means budgets don't stretch as far. That rise in inflation largely reflected a drop in the exchange rate in the aftermath of the referendum - which meant that sterling is worth about 10% less than it was previously. That led to a corresponding rise in the cost of many imports. A weaker pound may mean it's more expensive for UK holidaymakers to venture abroad - but on the upside, it makes the UK a more attractive destination.  A record 39.2 million overseas visitors came to the UK in 2017, spending Â£24.5bn. In theory, too, a weaker pound makes UK exports more attractive.  Sales to overseas customers were stronger than anticipated pre-referendum - but they rose by less than would have been expected. And surveys over the last couple of months have suggested export orders have dried up, perhaps as customers fear a no-deal scenario could spell delay and extra charges on delivery. What happens when the ""Brexit fog"" lifts? The government has hinted at hopes of a ""deal dividend"" - businesses and consumers going ahead with the spending that they may have been holding back. It'll take a while to fathom if that has happened - and then it'll be time to start looking at the impact of Brexit itself.

"Younger women with a family history of breast cancer should receive annual screenings to pick up the disease earlier, a charity says. Breast Cancer Now funded a study which found cancers were detected sooner when 35 to 39-year-olds at risk had annual mammograms. NHS screening often starts at the age of 40 for women with a family history. Experts need to balance the benefits of doing more checks against causing any undue worry or over-treatment. The study's authors said that more analysis was needed on the risks, costs and benefits of extending the screening programme. Breast cancer risk test 'game changer' Breast cancer screening programme does more harm than good Breast cancer screening error 'overstated' Early risers have lower breast cancer risk But Baroness Delyth Morgan, the charity's chief executive, called for the government's forthcoming review of NHS screening programmes in England to consider the introduction of scans for women aged 35 to 39 with a family history of breast cancer. The study, carried out by researchers at the University of Manchester, offered scans to 2,899 women in this age group who were deemed to have a moderate or high risk of the disease after being referred by a GP to a family history clinic. The screening detected 35 invasive breast cancer tumours, most of which were small and identified before they had reached the lymph nodes - a sign that they had not spread around the body. In a control group, which did not have the screening, far fewer of the cancers were discovered when they were still small and more had spread to the lymphatic system. Prof Gareth Evans, the lead author of the study, said the trial demonstrates that annual scans are effective in detecting tumours earlier for this younger age group. He said overdiagnosis - where people are treated for cancers that are unlikely to prove harmful - was ""far less likely"" to be an issue with this younger age group. Baroness Morgan was made a life peer in 2004 ""For women with a family history, removing a non-invasive tumour so early in their lives is likely to be a cancer preventive,"" Professor Evans said. The study did not include women who had specific gene mutations which can increase the risk of the disease. The charity says regular MRI scans - as iscurrently recommended,external- remains the best option for those with faulty BRCA or TP53 genes. If annual mammograms for at risk younger women were made widely available across all four of the UK's NHS services, it could affect up to 86,000 women, the researchers said. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with about 55,000 women being diagnosed each year and 11,500 dying from the disease. Between 5% and 15% of breast cancers are linked to a family history of the illness. ""We've long known that a family history can define a woman's risk, and that breast cancer can be more aggressive in younger women,"" said Baroness Morgan. I was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer when I was 22 What not to say to someone with cancer 'Why I wanted a tattoo on my mastectomy scar' ""So if we can intervene earlier for those at higher risk through annual screening, we believe we may be able to stop the disease cutting so many women's lives so heartbreakingly short."" An NHS England spokeswoman said possible changes to the screening programme will be considered in the review. She said: ""Breast cancer survival is at its highest ever and with improved screening a key focus of the NHS long-term plan, even more cancers will be diagnosed earlier."" The Scottish Government said it continues to monitor and consider all available evidence and recommendations. Women are routinely offered screening when they reach the age of 50  - they will get an invite every three years until their 71st birthday The NHS is doing a trial of extending routine screening to some women aged 47-73 If you have an increased risk of breast cancer because you carry certain genes or have close relatives who have had breast cancer, you may be offered yearly checks.

"Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa and Kacey Musgraves won some of the night's biggest prizes Kacey Musgraves, Dua Lipa, Cardi B and Lady Gaga were among the big winners at the Grammy Awards, making it a good night for female stars. Country star Musgraves picked up four awards, including album of the year, while Childish Gambino also won four. Cardi B made history as the first solo female to win best rap album. British pop star Dua Lipa was named best new artist and paid tribute to the ""incredible"" line-up of ""so many female artists"" in the category. ""I guess this year we've really stepped up,"" she said - a dig at Grammys president Neil Portnow, who last year tried to deflect criticism of the lack of female winners by saying women needed to ""step up"" in order to be considered. List of winners and nominees Grammy highlights: Steamy duets and Dolly's delights He appeared on stage at this year's ceremony to apologise, saying: ""This past year I've been reminded that if coming face to a face with an issue opens your eyes wide enough it makes you more committed to bring change."" Speaking backstage, Dua said: ""Being in the new artist category and having so many female artists nominated is a big change and it's a change we want to see for many years to come. ""It's a big difference from previous years, it only felt right because there were so many artists on there that I love and admire.""

"Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa and Kacey Musgraves won some of the night's biggest prizes Kacey Musgraves, Dua Lipa, Cardi B and Lady Gaga were among the big winners at the Grammy Awards, making it a good night for female stars. Country star Musgraves picked up four awards, including album of the year, while Childish Gambino also won four. Cardi B made history as the first solo female to win best rap album. British pop star Dua Lipa was named best new artist and paid tribute to the ""incredible"" line-up of ""so many female artists"" in the category. ""I guess this year we've really stepped up,"" she said - a dig at Grammys president Neil Portnow, who last year tried to deflect criticism of the lack of female winners by saying women needed to ""step up"" in order to be considered. List of winners and nominees Grammy highlights: Steamy duets and Dolly's delights He appeared on stage at this year's ceremony to apologise, saying: ""This past year I've been reminded that if coming face to a face with an issue opens your eyes wide enough it makes you more committed to bring change."" Speaking backstage, Dua said: ""Being in the new artist category and having so many female artists nominated is a big change and it's a change we want to see for many years to come. ""It's a big difference from previous years, it only felt right because there were so many artists on there that I love and admire."" This year's ceremony certainly appeared to be at pains to make amends, with lifetime achievement prizes for Dolly Parton and Diana Ross, and scores of female performers throughout the night. In pictures: Winners and performances In pictures: BTS, Cardi B and more on the red carpet It was the first year in Grammys history that women had won five of the top album awards - album of the year, best pop album (Ariana Grande), best country album (Musgraves), best R&B album (H.E.R.) and best rap album (Cardi B).

"Alfonso Cuaron wrote and directed Roma, which won best film The Favourite may have been the favourite, but it was Roma that took the night's big prize at the Bafta film awards. The black and white, two-and-a-half-hour long subtitled film might not have ""box office smash"" written all over it - but then again, it wasn't aiming for the box office. Despite having a limited theatrical release, most will have seen Alfonso Cuaron's film on Netflix - and its success on Sunday night marks the first ever best film Bafta for the streaming service. But there wereplenty of other awards for The Favourite, which took home seven prizes including original screenplay, outstanding British film, and acting awards for Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz. Here are some of the things we learned at the ceremony: 1. Joanna Lumley was only Partially Fabulous Hosting the Baftas is a tall order. You have to be likeable, entertaining and funny, under the gaze of the brightest stars in Hollywood. Returning to hosting duties for a second year, Joanna Lumley gave it her best shot, but not everyone was impressed. ""I adore Joanna Lumley but who on earth is responsible for her dire script?""asked Denise Welch,external, while Piers Morgan described her performance as""a train wreck"",external. A little harsh, perhaps, but some of her lines did fall a little flat. Here are some of the jokes we most enjoyed: ""The fabulous Glenn Close is here. The Wife was a wonderful film, although I imagine a lot of men have already moved on to the sequel - The Second Wife."" ""What a masterstroke to call it The Favourite. Next year there'll be a film called 'And the Bafta goes to...'"" ""Bradley Cooper has been nominated for five categories - which suggests he's a multi-talented genius... or that he needs to learn how to delegate."" ""Thank god Baftahasa host - but I think that might owe a lot to the fact I'm not on Twitter."" [A reference toKevin Hart dropping out of the Oscars.] 2. The Black Panther cast have varied attitudes to texting This was the second year in a row a cast member from Black Panther won the award for rising star. Daniel Kaluuya was crowned the winner last year, just as he was riding the crest of the Get Out wave. This year, it was Letitia Wright's turn to take home the trophy - which differs from the others in that it's bright blue instead of gold. ""I love my little blue man,"" Letitia said backstage, after delivering anemotional acceptance speechat the ceremony. ""I'm enjoying the fact it's very unique, very special, and the fact that Bafta has this category means a lot."" Who might be the first Black Panther cast member to text her to say congratulations? ""Luptia [N'yongo],"" replied Letitia immediately, championing her co-star's talent with technology. ""She's a bit quicker than Chadwick [Boseman]."" And who would be last? ""Michael B Jordan because he's so busy and he's making a thousand films!"" 3. Bohemian Rhapsody's director was conspicuous by his absence John Warhurst (far right) acknowledged Singer's absence backstage One person who wasn't there to represent Bohemian Rhapsody was its director Bryan Singer. Bafta removed his namefrom the the film's nominations due to allegations he sexually abused underage boys, which he denies. Singer directed most of the film but exited the project before the film was completed. However, despite the controversy, the movie took home best sound and best actor for Rami Malek. ""We did have a change of director halfway through filming,"" acknowledged supervising sound editor John Warhurst backstage. ""But with everything the cast and crew was doing from one week to the next, there wasn't a lot that changed really. ""Rami and everyone else came back to work the next day [after Singer left] and it just carried on without there being much of a change, and that's when you realise how many people are involved in making a film like this."" Speaking on the red carpet, Brian May added: ""He was sacked for very good reason, not by us, but by Fox, so it's a very arm's-length kind of thing for us."" 4. Mahershala Ali's success is down to basketball. Kind of There's a surprising link between best supporting actor winner Mahershala Ali and The Favourite director Yorgos Lanthimos - both played basketball prior to launching their film careers. Speaking after his win, Mahershala said the team-building nature of the sport is, in fact, the perfect training for working on a major film. ""In basketball, there's a sense of everyone touching the ball, everyone contributing, there's only five people on the team, so you can see what everyone else is doing,"" he explained. ""I think there's this sense of real collaboration in sports. Michael Jordan knows he wouldn't have won the championship without Bill Cartwright. It prepares you for being able to work with other people."" The Favourite dominates Bafta awards In pictures: Baftas 2019 winners and stars Bafta win for farmer who gave herd away 5. Success smells sweet for Richard E Grant Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant made a wonderful double act in Can You Ever Forgive Me. But, joked Melissa McCarthy, it was a different story off camera. ""We don't care for each other,"" she told BBC News. ""Not one bit. We don't speak. He won't let me look at him."" Fortunately, the actress was just kidding. Not only did she say they ""hit it off bizarrely well"", but McCarthy has taken to wearing Grant's fragrance to remind her of him. Grant released his own range of perfumes several years ago - one of which McCarthy was wearing to the Baftas. ""I always wear it, so even when I don't get to have him with me, I weirdly go 'good morning Richard!' and put a little on."" 6. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper split their ceremonies Leading actress nominee Lady Gaga wasn't at the Baftas ceremony - but to be fair she had a good excuse. She was performing at the Grammys in the US, which were taking place on the same evening. Her co-star in A Star Is Born, Bradley Cooper, turned up instead to collect the prize for best original music. But Gaga quickly got word of the win and tweeted her thanks to the British Academy.

"A reported investment by Chinese tech giant Tencent in Reddit has sparked a backlash on the popular community news site over censorship fears. Last weekreports said that Tencent would be investing $150m (Â£115m),externalinto the platform. China has a strict internet censorship regime known as the Great Firewall and Reddit is among the sites it blocks. The proposed funding prompted a wave of criticism on Reddit, which many of its users see as a bastion of free speech. Most analysts agree that it is unlikely Tencent or any other such investor would be able to control what content is posted on the site but that hasn't stopped a stream of memes and protest messages appearing in the past few days. The Reddit platform allows users to share links on any conceivable subject, which are then up-or down-voted, meaning the most popular content surfaces to the top and is more prominent. The platform has 330 million active users and describes itself as the ""Front Page of the Internet"". Along with sites like Facebook and Twitter, Reddit is inaccessible in China as part of the country's Great Firewall. The government's internet censorship regime uses a series of technical measures to block foreign platforms and controversial content. China-based messaging services -including Tencent-owned WeChat - and social media are restricted, with key words and expressions blocked if they express dissent or ridicule senior political leaders. How Chinese authorities censor your thoughts Why you can talk about John Oliver in China So the report prompted some concerns among the Reddit community that the site may even face content restrictions outside China in the future. In recent days Reddit users shared images of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest and Winnie the Pooh in reference to concerns a tie-up with the Chinese firm would lead to stricter content controls. In the past, Chinese authorities have blocked information related to the crackdown against protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on the anniversary of the event. Search terms such as ""six four"" - a reference to the date of the event 4 June and ""never forget"" when typed into Chinese search engines have not returned any results. Winnie the Pooh has also been blocked at times on Chinese social media sitesas bloggers compare the cartoon character to the country's President Xi Jinping. One popularpost by FreeSpeechWarrior featuring an image of a man stopping tanks in Tiananmen Square,externalwas up-voted on the site more than 200,000 times. A separate post from user BonZZil17 said: ""Thanks for the money Tencent, now here's Tank man from the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989."" Another,posted by ChristopherVDV, shared an image of Winnie the Pooh,externalciting Tencent's investment had been up-voted more than 37,000 times. ""Given that Reddit just took a $150 million investment from a Chinese censorship powerhouse, I thought it would be nice to post this picture of Winnie-The-Pooh before our new glorious overlords decide we cannot post it anymore,"" the post read. Still, the level of Tencent's proposed funding falls far short of full control. A $150m investment represents a fraction of the site's value, which is thought to be worth as much as $2.7bn. Taipei-based independent tech analyst Sam Reynolds said while some scepticism of Chinese technology firms was ""warranted,"" Tencent did not pose any risk to Reddit. ""Tencent has invested in hundreds of companies and there's been little involvement or interest from China's state apparatus."" Mr Reynolds added that Reddit ""simply isn't on the radar of censors"".

"Olivia Colman was named best actress - can she repeat it at the Oscars? The Favourite dominated the Bafta film awards on Sunday night, picking up seven awards out of 12 nominations. Among its haul were best actress for Olivia Colman and best supporting actress for Rachel Weisz. Mexican film Roma won best film, while Rami Malek won best actor for playing Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Colman, who starred as Queen Anne in The Favourite, said the team were having ""an amazing night"" and would be enjoying several drinks later. In pictures: Baftas 2019 red carpet glamour Six things we learned at the Baftas Speaking about her co-stars Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, Colman said: ""As far as I'm concerned, all three of us are the same and should be the leads, and it's weird we can't do that. ""This is for all three of us. It's got my name on it but we can scratch on some other ones."" This video can not be played The highlights from this yearâs British Academy film awards The period drama's other awards were best production design, best costume design, best hair and make-up and best original screenplay. Yorgos Lanthimos, the film's director, said of the outstanding British film award: ""It's a great honour... this film took 20 years to make - I contributed to the last 10."" The Favourite - 7 Roma - 4 Bohemian Rhapsody - 2 Black Panther - 1 BlacKkKlansman - 1 Green Book - 1 Vice - 1 A Star is Born - 1 Bafta Film Awards 2019: The winners in full He also thanked actresses Colman, Stone and Weisz, saying: ""Of course the three leading ladies that I couldn't be more proud of."" Collecting the prize for original screenplay, The Favourite's Deborah Davis said: ""Thank you for celebrating our female-dominated movie about women in power."" Yalitza Aparicio is the star of Roma, which won four awards Alfonso Cuaron's Roma also had a successful night picking up four prizes - best film, best director, best cinematography and best film not in the English language. After winning best cinematography, Curaon said: ""Foreign is just a different colour, and colour complements each other, I'm very happy Bafta is honouring a story about a domestic worker of indigenous background. ""The specific colour of this film is Mexico, so I want to thank also Mexico."" Spike Lee won his first ever Bafta for BlackKklansman Rami Malek won the best actor prize for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. The film also won best sound. Malek said as he collected his Bafta: ""You Brits do music well, it's not lost on me how sacred your musical heritage is. Thank you to the greatest outsider of them all, Freddie Mercury."" One person who wasn't recognised among the winners was the film's director Bryan Singer. His name was removedfrom the film's Bafta nomination due to allegations he sexually abused under-age boys. Singerdenies the allegations, which he calls a ""homophobic smear"". Queen star Brian May said: ""The only reason he's on the movie is his guild forced Fox to do this... technically, really, he's not the director of the movie. ""Everybody who had something to do with the movie should be very proud."" Aside from the success of The Favourite and Roma, many of the night's prizes were split amongst several films. Mahershala Ali won best supporting actor for Green Book and was visibly moved as he collected his award. He praised his fellow nominees for ""their work"". Mahershala Ali gave an emotional speech after his win Speaking backstage, Ali said he was touched by the impact Green Book has had in the UK. He said he found the Bafta statuette to be ""a beautiful trophy"", and it would sit alongside his Oscar (for Moonlight) at home. Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman won best adapted screenplay. ""Brooklyn's in the house!"" he yelled triumphantly as he collected his prize. Box office hit Black Panther won best visual effects Letitia Wright gave an emotional speech as she picked up the Bafta rising star award. ""A few years ago I saw myself in a deep state of depression and I wanted to quit acting. ""The only thing that pretty much pulled me out of that was God, my belief, my faith and my family and an email from Bafta saying they wanted me to be a part of the Bafta Breakthrough Brits, and I was like 'let me try again'. Bafta winner Letitia Wright's speech in full Black Panther won best visual effects. Other winners included Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse, which won best animated film..

The Oscars have decided to not have a host this year after Kevin Hart stepped downfollowing a controversy over homophobic tweets. Joanna Lumley, hosting the Baftas for the second year running, joked: ""Thank goodness Bafta has a host. But that's probably just down to the fact I'm not on Twitter.""

"People on zero-hour contracts are more than twice as likely to work night shifts, and are paid a third less an hour than other workers, the TUC says. After polling 3,287 workers - 300 of them zero-hour staff - it concluded the ""exploitative"" system should be banned. It says the flexibility such contracts offer are only ""good for employers"". But the government said a ban would ""impact more people than it would help"", arguing zero-hours worked well for students, carers and retirees. ""They provide flexibility for both employers and individuals, such as carers, students, or retirees,"" a business department spokesman added. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said ""the vast majority"" of people on zero-hours contracts ""want out"". ""Zero-hours workers regularly work through the night for low pay, putting their health at risk. And many face the constant uncertainty of not knowing when their next shift will come,"" she added. The TUC's research is likely to reignite the debate over zero-hour contracts. While the casual employment contracts don't oblige employers to provide a minimum number of working hours, they don't oblige employees to accept any of the hours offered by their employer either. Workers on zero-hours contracts are still entitled to statutory annual leave and the national minimum wage. Although such contracts have been controversial, many say they provide flexibility to people such as students, parents and those with other caring responsibilities. But critics say that zero-hours contracts create insecurity for workers and are used by employers to undercut wages and avoid holiday pay and pension contributions. Why so many young workers have âside hustlesâ Corbyn promises pay rise for the low-paid The TUCsays its research suggests,externaltwo-thirds of zero-hours workers would prefer jobs with guaranteed hours. The research also suggests: The median hourly pay before tax for someone on a zero-hour contract was Â£7.70 compared to Â£11.80 for other workers It found 23% of zero-hour contracts have night work as a usual part of their working pattern, compared to 11% of other workers The union's research was based on analysing the latestofficial data on zero-hours contracts,external. The data shows there are around 780,000 on such contracts, equivalent to 2.4% of the working population.

"This video can not be played Nick Kwek toured the border dividing the US state of Arizona and Mexico's Sonora US congressional talks over a border security deal have stalled, raising the chances of another government shutdown. Negotiators were hoping for a deal by Monday to give Congress time to pass legislation by Friday, when the federal funding agreement runs out. They remain divided on how many undocumented immigrants can be detained and funding for President Trump's promised border wall with Mexico. The previous shutdown, lasting 35 days, was the longest in US history. Hundreds of thousands of workers were furloughed while others in essential services, such as hospital care, air traffic control and law enforcement, worked without pay. The cost to the US economy wasestimated at $11bn (Â£8.5bn).,external What is a government shutdown? How the last US shutdown hurt Trump's wall: How tech fills the gaps It was unclear how the negotiators would try to reach a deal, but a meeting has been scheduled for later on Monday, congressional aides said. The 17 Republican and Democratic negotiators from the Senate and the House have been holding talks to reach a border security agreement that can be accepted by Congress. The latest impasse seems to be centred on a Democratic demand to limit the number of undocumented migrants already in the US who can be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Democrats planned to cap the number of beds at detention centres reserved for those cases at 16,500. By doing that, they hoped to force ICE to focus on detaining irregular migrants with criminal records instead of those who have overstayed their visas and, Democrats say, are productive and offer no threat. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? They were also looking at between $1.3bn and $2bn in funding for Mr Trump's proposed border wall, a long way off the $5.7bn the president has been demanding. In a series of tweets on Monday,President Trump said that Democrats needed to ""loosen up"",external, adding that their latest demand relating to the detention of migrants was ""crazy"".

The president had earlier said the Democrats were ""behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally"",external. Lead Republican negotiator Sen Richard Shelby told Fox News: ""I'll say 50-50 we get a deal... The spectre of a shutdown is always out there."" However, one of the Democratic negotiators, Jon Tester, said there was still hope that a deal could be reached in time. Also speaking to Fox News, he said: ""Negotiations seldom go smooth all the way through."" As wall discussions labour on, Mr Trump plans on sending over 3,700 active troops to the US-Mexico border to help agents with security efforts this month. With over 2,000 troops already at the border, the new deployment would top November's election-time numbers of 5,900. Meanwhile, pushing back against the Trump administration's call for border states to help with security, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom says he will recall hundreds of the state's national guard from the border. Gov Newsom's move follows his Democratic colleague, Gov Michelle Grisham of New Mexico, who pulled her state's troops from the border last week. Both governors have cited the withdrawal as a retaliation against Mr Trump's ""fear-mongering"". On 25 January, President Trump agreed to a three-week spending deal to end the shutdown and allow Congress to reach an agreement. That funding ends at midnight on Friday.Another short-term deal could prevent a new shutdown,external, according to the New York Times. Mr Trump -who has suggested the talks are a ""waste of time""- made building a wall on the border with Mexico one of his key promises in the 2016 campaign. The president has backed away from his calls to make Mexico pay for a concrete wall but during his State of the Union speech last Tuesday - delayed because of the previous shutdown - he insisted on a ""smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier"".

They were picked up by the pilot boat from Aberdeen Harbour within 10 minutes of going into the water, close to Victoria Bridge. Mr Duncan condemned the actions of those responsible. He said: ""I would like for them to think very hard that they may need that for themselves, or a friend, or a family member. before they cut that line. ""It's an emergency piece of equipment. I can't think what kind of mindset someone has to go and cut an emergency piece of equipment that's vital and could save a life."" Medical checks were carried out on the five people at the harbour Aberdeen RNLI lifeboat and a coastguard rescue team aided in the rescue, along with an offshore industry rescue helicopter. It is understood that a doctor who was travelling in the helicopter was lowered to the harbour to assist with medical checks on the girls.

"Hungary's population is falling and the prime minister hopes these measures will reverse the trend Hungarian women with four children or more will be exempted for life from paying income tax, the prime minister has said, unveiling plans designed to boost the number of babies being born. It was a way of defending Hungary's future without depending on immigration, Viktor Orban said. The right-wing nationalist particularly opposes immigration by Muslims. Hungary's population is falling by 32,000 a year. Women there have fewer children than the EU average. As part of the measures, young couples will be offered interest-free loans of 10m forint (Â£27,400; $36,000), to be cancelled once they have three children. Mr Orban said that ""for the West"", the answer to falling birth rates in Europe was immigration: ""For every missing child, there should be one coming in and then the numbers will be fine. ""Hungarian people think differently,"" he said. ""We do not need numbers. We need Hungarian children."" Orban has taken a hard line on immigration, often clashing with his European counterparts While Mr Orban was delivering his state of the nation address, the latest demonstrations were being held in Budapest against his government's policies. About 2,000 people gathered in front of his office, while others blocked one of the main bridges across the Danube river. Viktor Orban: The man who thinks Europe has been invaded Correspondents say the biggest applause during Mr Orban's speech was for his announcement of a seven-point plan to increase the birth rate. Other points in the government's plan include: A pledge to create 21,000 nursery places over the next three years An extra $2.5bn to be spent on the country's healthcare system Housing subsidies State support for those buying seven-seat vehicles Mr Orban finished his speech with: ""Long live Hungary and long live the Hungarians!"" The average number of children a Hungarian woman will have in her lifetime (fertility rate) is 1.45. This puts the country below the EU average of 1.58. 'Remarkable' decline in fertility rates Why is IVF so popular in Denmark? 'Why I never want babies' 'Iâm not having children because I want to save the planet' In 2016,France had the highest fertility rate in the EU,external- 1.92 children per woman - and Spain and Italy had the lowest at 1.34, the EU statistics agency Eurostat reports. Niger, in West Africa, has the highest fertility rate in the world, with 7.24 children per woman. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest writes: Critics of the government say its package and pro-family policy so far target well-off families and ignore the Hungarian poor, including an estimated 750,000 Roma (Gypsies). Tax relief does little to help families who pay little tax anyway. Housing subsidies of â¬35,000 (Â£30,666) were offered to families able to invest a similar sum of their own - but few Roma have such savings. The nationalist Fidesz government has cut welfare payments and reduced the number of months those made unemployed can claim for. The population has been falling steadily, from a peak of 10.7 million in 1980, to below 9.7 million today. About 600,000 Hungarians have moved to western Europe in the past decade - it is impossible to calculate how many will return. ""Increasing the number of births is very difficult, because we have less and less women of child-bearing age,"" State Secretary for Families Katalin Novak told the BBC. That number is set to fall by 20% in the next decade. ""So less and less women need to have more and more babies."" The government's new package, she emphasised, is based on the number of babies couples would actually like to have, and then to encourage them with financial help. The aim is to increase the fertility rate to 2.1 by 2030. Many other countries with relatively low birth rates have introduced extra payments and other benefits for mothers. Russia'sbirth rate has been declining for decades: the population fell from 149m in 1991 to 140m in 2018, and the median age has risen from 33 to 39. So, to help the poorest families, in March 2018 the government announced monthly payments of 10-11,000 roubles (Â£118-Â£130; $152-$167) until their first child reached 18 months old. A poor family also gets a one-off payment of 300,000 roubles for each additional child born. Serbia,one of Hungary's neighbours, has one of the world's fastest-shrinking populations. It has seven million people and a median age of 43. Last March it announced that new mothers would get a one-off payment worth Â£740 ($956) for their first child, monthly payments of Â£74 ($96) for the second child for two years, and further payments for three or more children. The birth rate inItalyis among Europe's lowest, along with Cyprus and Spain. Italy gives mothers an allowance of â¬80 per month (Â£70; $90) for each child born. The poorest families get a monthly allowance of â¬160 per child. InGermanymore babies were born in 2016 than in any year since 1996. But Germany has also put more incentives in place for couples to have children. Parents have a legal right to a nursery place once their child is one year old. Germany has a new law, the ""Good KiTa Act"", granting lower childcare fees for parents who cannot afford the full price, and a fee exemption for parents who receive a child allowance and housing benefits. Low birth rates are also worrying governments in East Asia. The marriage rate inSouth Koreais at its lowest since records began - 5.5 per 1,000 people, compared with 9.2 in 1970 - and very few children are born outside marriage. According to World Bank data for 2016, just a few countries, including Singapore and Moldova, have a fertility rate as low as South Korea's - 1.2 per woman. The replacement rate - the number needed for a population to remain level - is 2.1. Fertility rates are also low in China (1.6) and Japan (1.4). Mothers, your country needs you!

"This video can not be played Snow was falling when US senator Amy Klobuchar announced her candidacy Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has announced she is running for president in the 2020 election. Ms Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, said she was running for ""everyone who wanted their work recognised"". She won praise for grilling Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and attorney general nominee William Barr during recent confirmation hearings. The 58-year-old enters an increasingly crowded field of Democrats competing to challenge President Donald Trump. Ms Klobuchar called on people to join her ""home-grown"" campaign, saying, ""I don't have a political machine. I don't come from money. But what I do have is this: I have grit."" Which Democrats are running in 2020? A record total of five women have so far entered the race for the presidency - these also include Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Tulsi Gabbard, and Kirsten Gillibrand. On her first full day of presidential campaigning, Ms Warren - a senator from Massachusetts - told supporters: ""By the time we get to 2020, Donald Trump may not even be president. In fact, he may not even be a free person."" After working as a lawyer in a private firm, she became chief prosecutor for Hennepin, Minnesota's most populous county, in 1998. Eight years later, she was elected to the Senate to represent Minnesota. Ms Klobuchar is the fifth woman to run for the Democratic nomination Ms Klobuchar has long prided herself in her bipartisanship; on being able to, as she wrote in her 2015 memoir, ""disagree without being disagreeable"". ""Courage is about whether or not you're willing to stand next to someone you don't always agree with for the betterment of this country,"" she wrote. Lessons US Democrats can learn for 2020 It is this approach that has given her a reputation for being ""Minnesota nice"" - but it also, in her early years, reportedly earned herthe unflattering nickname ""Cotton Candy Amy"",externalin some circles. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher Her kick-off rally looked like a scene out of the Disney film Frozen, with a snow-covered crowd gathered near the banks of an icy river. Amy Klobuchar's newly announced presidential campaign, however, could generate some heat in 2020. She may not have the same level of name recognition as recent and future entrants into the race, but the three-term Minnesota senator has shown the ability to win votes in the kind of Midwestern battleground state that Donald Trump appealed to in 2016. She offers a steady, sensible political outlook that could attract the majority of Democratic voters who are more interested in electability than ideological purity. Her buzz has been dampened a bit by recent allegations that she has been abusive toward her staff, but she may try to turn the criticism into a strength. ""I have high expectations for the people that work for me,"" she told NBC News after her speech, ""but I have high expectations for this country."" Ms Klobuchar has become a fashionable pick as a ""dark horse"" candidate. It wouldn't be a shock if she has a good showing in the neighbouring-state Iowa caucuses and rides that momentum deep into the primary season. After years under the radar, the former prosecutor went viral last September forher tense exchange with Justice Brett Kavanaugh,externalover his history of drinking. In January this year, she proved that this frank interrogation style was not a one-off whenshe grilled President Trump's attorney general nominee Mr Barrabout obstruction of justice allegations. Meanwhile, former employees of Ms Klobuchar have disputed her ""Minnesota nice"" image too, telling the Huffington Post thatat least three potential campaign managers have withdrawn,externalover her treatment of staff. This video can not be played Klobuchar asks Barr about obstruction In an age when political views are condensed into 280 characters and measured in retweets, Ms Klobuchar's reputation for working away in the background could help her stand out. She was able to turn 43 Trump-voting Minnesota counties over to her side in last year's mid-term elections. But her bipartisan approach may not stand her in such good stead in a party now dominated by the progressive left. For example, while she has publicly spoken out against President Trump's immigration and border policies, she has not voiced her support for the movement to abolish US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Two of her opponents, Kirsten Gillibrand and Ms Warren, have openly called for the agency to be dismantled, while Ms Harris has said it needs to be ""critically re-examined"". She has also avoided supporting Bernie Sanders' single-payer healthcare bill, known commonly as Medicare for All, preferring to back a ""sensible transition"" instead. Many on the left also feel that her education reforms, which push for universities in the US to be more affordable, do not go far enough. Ms Harris, and likely opponent Mr Sanders,both support making college tuition almost entirely free,external.

"Ros and Josh Hannam have had to fundraise to pay for sign language classes Parents of a deaf four-month-old have to pay Â£6,000 for sign language classes if they want to communicate with her. Ros and Josh Hannam's daughter Lola was diagnosed shortly after she was born. Although they had some support from Monmouthshire council, the couple from Caldicot will have to pay for British Sign Language (BSL) classes themselves. Mrs Hannam said people found it ""ridiculous"" when she told them they had to pay. The Welsh Government said it would review BSL funding. ""I think the first thing we felt [after Lola was diagnosed] was probably devastation,"" Mrs Hannam said. ""She was going to have extra requirements and extra needs that we weren't anticipating. ""I think once we got over the initial devastation, it was about what can we do to make this good?"" The couple got some basic language support through the council's Sensory Communication Service, but how much parents have to pay towards BSL classes depends on where they live. Some get it for free, but others have to foot the full cost themselves. Deaf boy's amazing reaction to bedtime story 'I could be the first deaf PM' The moment a one year old hears sound for the first time Approximately 90% of children with hearing loss are born to families with no experience or knowledge of deafness Mrs Hannam said: ""I was pretty taken aback. If we say to someone we have to fund it ourselves, the general reaction is 'What? That's ridiculous'. ""Nobody can afford that kind of money and I think that's how we felt as well. ""I'm spending most of my time trying to organise, trying to raise funds, organise raffle prizes just to be able to communicate with my daughter."" Jade Kilduff, who is campaigning for basic sign language to be compulsory in schools, said she supports Mr and Mrs Hannam's campaign. The 17-year-old has begun teaching  her three-year-old brother Christian, who has cerebral palsy and a brain injury, how to communicate using Makaton, which is based on BSL.

"Charles Darwin is the founder of modern evolutionary studies A school has axed a musical on evolution over its suggestive lyrics and portrayal of Christian views. Darwin Rocks, about the scientist Charles Darwin, was due to be performed by about 90 pupils at Hartford Manor Primary School, Cheshire, next month. The move follows six ""expressions of concern"" from parents, the school said. The musical's publishers Musicline said it was written by a Christian, adding ""we can't ever recall having courted controversy before"". The musical includes scenes from across Darwin's life, including his journey on HMS Beagle According to its website,,externalthe production is a ""light-hearted look"" at the work of Darwin, whosetheory of evolution,external, published in 1859, shocked Victorian society by suggesting animals and humans shared a common ancestry. Head teacher Simon Kidwell told the BBC that the school, in Hartford near Northwich, received six ""expressions of concern"" over lyrics that refer to ""bump and grind"" - a sexually suggestive dance move. He said three of those parents also believed a bishop was ""mocked"" in a separate scene. ""There were concerns about caricature,"" he said, adding the complainants, who include a science teacher from another school, felt its representation of Christian views on science ""wasn't accurate"". One parent said they did not want their daughter to think her ambition to be an engineer contradicted Christian beliefs, Mr Kidwell said. He added the school board was not involved in the decision to drop the production and denied newspaper suggestions a local vicar who is on the board had influenced the move. Darwin stopped going to church in his 40s and described himself in later life as an agnostic The school teaches evolution as part of the syllabus and no parents have withdrawn their children from those lessons, Mr Kidwell said. Mike Smith, managing director at Musicline, said the firm ""asked Steve Titford - a practising Christian - and the writer of Shakespeare Rocks to write a factual musical about Charles Darwin's life and beliefs"". He said it had been ""received with enthusiasm"" and been performed in schools around the world since 2017. ""You can't please all the people all the time, but having been in the school musical business for over 25 years, we can't ever recall having courted controversy before,"" Mr Smith added. Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor The traditional (and often lazy) depiction of faith v science is old hat. In Britain and the US, there are multiple experts who see no conflict with holding religious beliefs alongside their strong grasp of science. Theistic evolutionists include Francis Collins - the geneticist who led the Human Genome Project and the current director of the National Institutes of Health in the US. David Wilkinson, the astrophysicist and principal of St John's College, Durham, is also a Methodist lay minister - and often contributes to Thought for the Day. It's not a surprise there has been some objection to the ""mockery"" of Christians, who are often depicted as anti-intellectual and anti-science.

"Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa and Kacey Musgraves won some of the night's biggest prizes Kacey Musgraves, Dua Lipa, Cardi B and Lady Gaga were among the big winners at the Grammy Awards, making it a good night for female stars. Country star Musgraves picked up four awards, including album of the year, while Childish Gambino also won four. Cardi B made history as the first solo female to win best rap album. British pop star Dua Lipa was named best new artist and paid tribute to the ""incredible"" line-up of ""so many female artists"" in the category. ""I guess this year we've really stepped up,"" she said - a dig at Grammys president Neil Portnow, who last year tried to deflect criticism of the lack of female winners by saying women needed to ""step up"" in order to be considered. List of winners and nominees Grammy highlights: Steamy duets and Dolly's delights He appeared on stage at this year's ceremony to apologise, saying: ""This past year I've been reminded that if coming face to a face with an issue opens your eyes wide enough it makes you more committed to bring change."" Speaking backstage, Dua said: ""Being in the new artist category and having so many female artists nominated is a big change and it's a change we want to see for many years to come. ""It's a big difference from previous years, it only felt right because there were so many artists on there that I love and admire."" This year's ceremony certainly appeared to be at pains to make amends, with lifetime achievement prizes for Dolly Parton and Diana Ross, and scores of female performers throughout the night. In pictures: Winners and performances In pictures: BTS, Cardi B and more on the red carpet It was the first year in Grammys history that women had won five of the top album awards - album of the year, best pop album (Ariana Grande), best country album (Musgraves), best R&B album (H.E.R.) and best rap album (Cardi B). Grande won her first ever Grammy Award for Sweetener, but wasn't there to collect it aftera dispute with organisers. ""This is wild and beautiful,""she tweeted,external. ""Thank you so much."" Cardi B performed atop a glittering piano According toVariety,external, the Thank U, Next singer also expressed her disdain in a series of since-deleted tweets at the fact Mac Miller, who was nominated posthumously for best rap album, lost out to Cardi B. ""Trash"" Grande reportedly wrote when the Brooklyn rapper was announced as the winner. But she later congratulated her, writing: ""Good for her. I promise. I'm sorry."" Childish Gambino makes Grammys history Accompanied on stage by her husband Offset, Cardi thanked her daughter Kulture Kiari for giving her the impetus to finish the record on time. ""When I found out I was pregnant, my album was not complete,"" she said. ""So I was like, 'I have to get this album done so we can shoot these videos while I was not showing.'"" Speaking backstage, Cardi said she shared her award with late rapper Mac Miller, whose family were at the awards. The star also won best pop vocal for Joanne Lady Gaga won three prizes, including best pop performance for Joanne and best pop duet for Shallow, from the Oscar-nominated film A Star Is Born. Holding back tears, the star thanked Bradley Cooper, her co-star and director, who missed the Grammys to attend The Baftas in London. She also used her speech to highlight the film's mental health message, telling the audience: ""If you see someone that's hurting, don't look away."" And Emily Lazar, who worked on Beck's Colors album, became the first woman in Grammys history to win best engineered album. This video can not be played On the Grammys red carpet But while the Grammys has made strides with female artists, it still needs to repair its image in the hip-hop community. This year, major stars including Chance The Rapper, Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino declined invitations to perform, amid concerns their music is being relegated to the rap categories (no hip-hop record has won album of the year since Outkast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below in 2004). The absence of Childish Gambino - aka actor Donald Glover - was particularly notable on Sunday, after he won four prizes for This Is America, his scathing critique of US socio-politics. At one point, host Alicia Keys awkwardly had to fill time when no-one came forward to accept the song of the year award on his behalf. Pop star Camila Cabello opened the ceremony with a colourful - and expensive - staging of her smash hit Havana, set in a replica of her grandmother's childhood home in Cuba. However, some of the most powerful performances were the most simple - including Miley Cyrus and Shawn Mendes' powerhouse performance of In My Blood, album of the year nominee Brandi Carlile and a rousing tribute to Aretha Franklin by Audra Day, Fantasia and Yolanda Adams. Former first lady Michelle Obama was drowned out by applause at the Staples Center in LA Former first lady Michelle Obama also made a surprise appearance, giving a speech about the unifying power of music alongside Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Jennifer Lopez and Alicia Keys. ""Whether we like country or rap or rock, music helps us share ourselves, our dignity and sorrows, our hopes and joys,"" she said. ""It allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in."" Diana Ross also spoke of the power of music as she performed her own tribute (possibly the most perfect diva moment in a career full of them), just weeks before turning 75. ""When I was a little girl, I thought the joy of singing made me happy, it made my parents happy and it led to this day and it brings me joy,"" Ross said. Parton's tribute was more inclusive, with fans and friends Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves, Little Big Town, Miley Cyrus and Maren Morris joining the star on stage for a joyful medley of her biggest hits. ""I'm just internally freaking out,"" said Morris before the show. ""I met her and I was just trying not to quote Steel Magnolias at her."" Katy Perry, Dolly Parton and Kacey Musgraves Dozens of awards were handed out before the televised ceremony kicked off, with The Greatest Showman winning best soundtrack; and British singer Ella Mai scooping best R&B song for the slinky summer hit Boo'd Up.
